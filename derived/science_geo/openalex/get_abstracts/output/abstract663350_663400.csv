https://openalex.org/W3102945151,"Nine dogs with hemophilia A were treated with adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy and followed for up to 10 years. Administration of AAV8 or AAV9 vectors expressing canine factor VIII (AAV-cFVIII) corrected the FVIII deficiency to 1.9-11.3% of normal FVIII levels. In two of nine dogs, levels of FVIII activity increased gradually starting about 4 years after treatment. None of the dogs showed evidence of tumors or altered liver function. Analysis of integration sites in liver samples from six treated dogs identified 1,741 unique AAV integration events in genomic DNA and expanded cell clones in five dogs, with 44% of the integrations near genes involved in cell growth. All recovered integrated vectors were partially deleted and/or rearranged. Our data suggest that the increase in FVIII protein expression in two dogs may have been due to clonal expansion of cells harboring integrated vectors. These results support the clinical development of liver-directed AAV gene therapy for hemophilia A, while emphasizing the importance of long-term monitoring for potential genotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3102939328,"Fine-mapping aims to identify causal variants impacting complex traits. We propose PolyFun, a computationally scalable framework to improve fine-mapping accuracy by leveraging functional annotations across the entire genome-not just genome-wide-significant loci-to specify prior probabilities for fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE or FINEMAP. In simulations, PolyFun + SuSiE and PolyFun + FINEMAP were well calibrated and identified >20% more variants with a posterior causal probability >0.95 than identified in their nonfunctionally informed counterparts. In analyses of 49 UK Biobank traits (average n = 318,000), PolyFun + SuSiE identified 3,025 fine-mapped variant-trait pairs with posterior causal probability >0.95, a >32% improvement versus SuSiE. We used posterior mean per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun + SuSiE to perform polygenic localization, constructing minimal sets of common SNPs causally explaining 50% of common SNP heritability; these sets ranged in size from 28 (hair color) to 3,400 (height) to 2 million (number of children). In conclusion, PolyFun prioritizes variants for functional follow-up and provides insights into complex trait architectures."
https://openalex.org/W3101884091,"Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a severe type of stroke. To discover new risk loci and the genetic architecture of intracranial aneurysms, we performed a cross-ancestry, genome-wide association study in 10,754 cases and 306,882 controls of European and East Asian ancestry. We discovered 17 risk loci, 11 of which are new. We reveal a polygenic architecture and explain over half of the disease heritability. We show a high genetic correlation between ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We also find a suggestive role for endothelial cells by using gene mapping and heritability enrichment. Drug-target enrichment shows pleiotropy between intracranial aneurysms and antiepileptic and sex hormone drugs, providing insights into intracranial aneurysm pathophysiology. Finally, genetic risks for smoking and high blood pressure, the two main clinical risk factors, play important roles in intracranial aneurysm risk, and drive most of the genetic correlation between intracranial aneurysms and other cerebrovascular traits. Cross-ancestry genome-wide association analyses in individuals of European and East Asian ancestry identify 11 new risk loci for intracranial aneurysms and highlight a polygenic architecture explaining a substantial fraction of disease heritability."

https://openalex.org/W3099485282,"Untargeted mass spectrometry is employed to detect small molecules in complex biospecimens, generating data that are difficult to interpret. We developed Qemistree, a data exploration strategy based on the hierarchical organization of molecular fingerprints predicted from fragmentation spectra. Qemistree allows mass spectrometry data to be represented in the context of sample metadata and chemical ontologies. By expressing molecular relationships as a tree, we can apply ecological tools that are designed to analyze and visualize the relatedness of DNA sequences to metabolomics data. Here we demonstrate the use of tree-guided data exploration tools to compare metabolomics samples across different experimental conditions such as chromatographic shifts. Additionally, we leverage a tree representation to visualize chemical diversity in a heterogeneous collection of samples. The Qemistree software pipeline is freely available to the microbiome and metabolomics communities in the form of a QIIME2 plugin, and a global natural products social molecular networking workflow."
https://openalex.org/W3099296701,"Secreted polypeptides are a fundamental axis of intercellular and endocrine communication. However, a global understanding of the composition and dynamics of cellular secretomes in intact mammalian organisms has been lacking. Here, we introduce a proximity biotinylation strategy that enables labeling, detection and enrichment of secreted polypeptides in a cell type-selective manner in mice. We generate a proteomic atlas of hepatocyte, myocyte, pericyte and myeloid cell secretomes by direct purification of biotinylated secreted proteins from blood plasma. Our secretome dataset validates known cell type–protein pairs, reveals secreted polypeptides that distinguish between cell types and identifies new cellular sources for classical plasma proteins. Lastly, we uncover a dynamic and previously undescribed nutrient-dependent reprogramming of the hepatocyte secretome characterized by the increased unconventional secretion of the cytosolic enzyme betaine–homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). This secretome profiling strategy enables dynamic and cell type-specific dissection of the plasma proteome and the secreted polypeptides that mediate intercellular signaling. A proximity labeling strategy enables enrichment of cell type-selective secretomes in mice by direct biochemical purification of biotinylated polypeptides from blood plasma."

https://openalex.org/W3105991173,"The DNA guanine quadruplexes (G4) play important roles in multiple cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription and maintenance of genome stability. Here, we showed that Yin and Yang 1 (YY1) can bind directly to G4 structures. ChIP–seq results revealed that YY1-binding sites overlap extensively with G4 structure loci in chromatin. We also observed that the dimerization of YY1 and its binding with G4 structures contribute to YY1-mediated long-range DNA looping. Displacement of YY1 from G4 structure sites disrupts substantially the YY1-mediated DNA looping. Moreover, treatment with G4-stabilizing ligands modulates the expression of not only those genes with G4 structures in their promoters, but also those associated with distal G4 structures that are brought to close proximity via YY1-mediated DNA looping. Together, we identified YY1 as a DNA G4-binding protein, and revealed that YY1-mediated long-range DNA looping requires its dimerization and occurs, in part, through its recognition of G4 structure. The authors identify the interaction between transcription factor YY1 and DNA G4 structures, which contributes to chromatin looping induced by YY1 dimerization as well as its transcriptional regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3104492196,"Molecules that covalently bind macromolecular targets have found widespread applications as activity-based probes and as irreversibly binding drugs. However, the general reactivity of the electrophiles needed for covalent bond formation makes control of selectivity difficult. There is currently no rapid, unbiased screening method to identify new classes of covalent inhibitors from highly diverse pools of candidate molecules. Here we describe a phage display method to directly screen for ligands that bind to protein targets through covalent bond formation. This approach makes use of a reactive linker to form cyclic peptides on the phage surface while simultaneously introducing an electrophilic ‘warhead’ to covalently react with a nucleophile on the target. Using this approach, we identified cyclic peptides that irreversibly inhibited a cysteine protease and a serine hydrolase with nanomolar potency and exceptional specificity. This approach should enable rapid, unbiased screening to identify new classes of highly selective covalent inhibitors for diverse molecular targets. Covalent inhibitors with high selectivity are rapidly identified by phage display."
https://openalex.org/W3101507523,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits are a relatively late consequence of Aβ aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. When pathogenic Aβ seeds begin to form, propagate and spread is not known, nor are they biochemically defined. We tested various antibodies for their ability to neutralize Aβ seeds before Aβ deposition becomes detectable in Aβ precursor protein-transgenic mice. We also characterized the different antibody recognition profiles using immunoprecipitation of size-fractionated, native, mouse and human brain-derived Aβ assemblies. At least one antibody, aducanumab, after acute administration at the pre-amyloid stage, led to a significant reduction of Aβ deposition and downstream pathologies 6 months later. This demonstrates that therapeutically targetable pathogenic Aβ seeds already exist during the lag phase of protein aggregation in the brain. Thus, the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease-currently defined as Aβ deposition without clinical symptoms-may be a relatively late manifestation of a much earlier pathogenic seed formation and propagation that currently escapes detection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3099914779,"The Hippo pathway plays critical roles in cell growth, differentiation, organ development and tissue homeostasis, whereas its dysregulation can lead to tumorigenesis. YAP and TAZ are transcription co-activators and represent the main downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. Here, we show that heat stress induces a strong and rapid YAP dephosphorylation and activation. The effect of heat shock on YAP is dominant to other signals known to modulate the Hippo pathway. Heat shock inhibits LATS kinase by promoting HSP90-dependent LATS interaction with and inactivation by protein phosphatase 5. Heat shock also induces LATS ubiquitination and degradation. YAP and TAZ are crucial for cellular heat shock responses, including the heat shock transcriptome and cell viability. This study uncovers previously unknown mechanisms of Hippo regulation by heat shock, as well as physiological functions of YAP, in the heat stress response. Our observations also reveal a potential combinational therapy involving hyperthermia and targeting of the Hippo pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3104453564,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport to the outer membrane (OM) is a crucial step in the biogenesis of microbial surface defenses. Although many features of the translocation mechanism have been elucidated, molecular details of LPS insertion via the LPS transport (Lpt) OM protein LptDE remain elusive. Here, we integrate native MS with hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of substrate and peptide binding on the conformational dynamics of LptDE. Our data reveal that LPS induces opening of the LptD β-taco domain, coupled with conformational changes on β-strands adjacent to the putative lateral exit gate. Conversely, an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, stabilizes the β-taco, thereby preventing LPS transport. Our results illustrate that LPS insertion into the OM relies on concerted opening movements of both the β-barrel and β-taco domains of LptD, and suggest a means for developing antimicrobial therapeutics targeting this essential process in Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. Native mass spectrometry, HDX-MS and MD simulations define the mechanism for how LPS binding to the Gram-negative outer membrane complex LptDE opens the LptD lateral exit gate and how thanatin impairs transport across the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W3105992397,"Skeletal muscles have a high metabolic capacity, which play key roles in glucose metabolism. Although periodontal disease increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, the relationship between periodontal bacterial infection and skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction is unclear. We found that anti-Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) antibody titers positively correlated with intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), fasting blood glucose, and HOMA-IR in metabolic syndrome patients. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet, recipients of oral Pg (HFPg) had impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and higher IMAC compared to recipients of saline (HFco). The soleus muscle in HFPg mice exhibited fat infiltration and lower glucose uptake with higher Tnfa expression and lower insulin signaling than in HFco mice. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that TNFα signaling via NFκB gene set was enriched in the soleus muscle of HFPg mice. Moreover, TNF-α also decreased glucose uptake in C2C12 myoblast cells in vitro. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, Pg administration altered the gut microbiome, particularly by decreasing the abundance of genus Turicibacter. Microbial network of the gut microbiome was dramatically changed by Pg administration. Our findings suggest that infection with Pg is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction via gut microbiome alteration."
https://openalex.org/W3125298061,"Many germ cells are eliminated during development, long before oogenesis or spermatogenesis. In mouse fetal testes, the majority of germ cell apoptosis coincides with the onset of male differentiation, suggesting coordination of these processes. We studied fetal germ-cell fates and discovered that both apoptosis and differentiation initiate in clonally related clusters. Lineage tracing confirmed that germ cells die as clones independent of intercellular bridges, suggesting that shared intrinsic properties are apoptotic determinants. We identified transcriptional heterogeneity among fetal germ cells that included an apoptosis-susceptible population characterized by failure to differentiate, whereas successful differentiation to prospermatogonia occurred through the expression of epigenetically regulated genes, including LINE1. Our results indicate that the fetal germ-cell fate is based on discrete cell-heritable identities. Elevated DNA methylation in the apoptosis-susceptible subpopulation supports our hypothesis that earlier errors in germ-cell epigenetic reprogramming derail differentiation in cellular progeny, leading to fetal apoptotic selection that ultimately improves the gamete quality."
https://openalex.org/W3105941422,"Microglia, the key neuroimmune cells of the central nervous system, are best known for their function in defending an individual from pathogens and injury. Recent findings, including our own, suggest microglia also have several immune-independent roles, including in regulating satiety, promoting memory, and modifying pain responses. Many of these microglia-associated functions are affected by circadian rhythmicity, thus, varying substantially depending upon the time of day. To gain further insight into this link, we used a Cx3cr1-Dtr transgenic Wistar rat model to acutely deplete microglia and examined if this could lead to a disruption in diurnal temperature, metabolism, and activity measures. We also examined if differences in the physiological rhythms corresponded with changes in the expression of key circadian rhythm-regulating genes and proteins. Our data show that in the absence of microglia there is a pronounced disruption of diurnal rhythms in several domains consistent with a shift toward the inactive phase, in conjunction with changes in circadian rhythm-regulating genes and proteins. These data suggest microglia are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and indicate an exciting potential to manipulate these cells to improve disrupted circadian rhythms such as with shift-work or jet-lag."
https://openalex.org/W3106431630,"Spermatogenesis is an important biological process in male reproduction. The interaction between male germ cells and somatic cells during spermatogenesis, is necessary for male reproductive activities. This cellular heterogeneity has made it difficult to profile distinct cell types at different stages of development. Here, we present the first comprehensive, unbiased single-cell transcriptomic study of sheep spermatogenesis using 10× genomics single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq). We collected scRNA-seq data from 11 772 cells from the adult sheep testis and identified all known germ cells (including early primary spermatocytes, late primary spermatocytes, round spermatids, elongated spermatids, and sperm), and somatic cells (Sertoli cells and Leydig cells), as well as one somatic cell that unexpectedly contained leukocytes. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that several pathways of cell cycle, gamete generation, protein processing, and mRNA surveillance pathways were significantly enriched in testicular germ cell types, and ribosome pathway was significantly enriched in testicular somatic cell types. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of sheep germ cells, such as EZH2, SOX18, SCP2, PCNA, and PRKCD. Our research explored for the first time of the changes in the transcription level of various cell types during the process of sheep spermatogenesis, providing new insights for sheep spermatogenesis and spermatogenic cell development."
https://openalex.org/W3106499637,"Background Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Many previous studies have demonstrated that the infiltrating of immune and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to prognosis. Methods Dataset TCGA-UVM, download from TCGA portal, was taken as the training cohort, and GSE22138, obtained from GEO database, was set as the validation cohort. ESTIMATE algorithm was applied to find intersection differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among tumor microenvironment. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression model were performed on intersection DEGs to initial screen for potential prognostic genes. Then these genes entered into the validation cohort for validation using the same methods as that in the training cohort. Moreover, we conducted correlation analyses between the genes obtained in the validation cohort and the status of chromosome 3, chromosome 8q, and tumor metastasis to get prognosis genes. At last, the immune infiltration analysis was performed between the prognostic genes and 6 main kinds of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) for understanding the role of the genes in the tumor microenvironment. Results 959 intersection DEGs were found in the UM microenvironment. Kaplan-Meier and Cox analysis was then performed in the training and validation cohorts on these DEGs, and 52 genes were identified with potential prognostic value. After comparing the 52 genes to chromosome 3, chromosome 8q, and metastasis, we obtained 21 genes as the prognostic genes. The immune infiltration analysis showed that Neutrophil had the potential prognostic ability, and almost every prognostic gene we had identified was correlated with abundances of Neutrophil and CD8+ T Cell. Conclusions Identifying 21 prognosis genes (SERPINB9, EDNRB, RAPGEF3, HFE, RNF43, ZNF415, IL12RB2, MTUS1, NEDD9, ZNF667, AZGP1, WARS, GEM, RAB31, CALHM2, CA12, MYEOV, CELF2, SLCO5A1, ISM1, and PAPSS2) could accurately identify patients' prognosis and had close interactions with Neutrophil in the tumor environment, which may provide UM patients with personalized prognosis prediction and new treatment insights."
https://openalex.org/W3104795942,"A subset of human prostate cancer exhibits increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids, but the molecular driver(s) of this metabolic abnormality remains obscure. This study demonstrates a novel metabolic function of c-Myc (Myc) in regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The role of Myc in regulation of fatty acid synthesis was investigated by: (a) interrogation of the prostate cancer The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, (b) chromatin immunoprecipitation, and (c) determination of the expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and targeted metabolomics using a mouse model and human specimens. The expression of MYC was positively associated with that of key fatty acid synthesis genes including ACLY, ACC1, and FASN in prostate cancer TCGA dataset. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed Myc occupancy at the promoters of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN. Prostate-specific overexpression of Myc in Hi-Myc transgenic mice resulted in overexpression of ACLY, ACC1, and FASN proteins in neoplastic lesions and increased circulating levels of total free fatty acids. Targeted metabolomics confirmed increased circulating levels of individual fatty acids in the plasma of Hi-Myc mice and human subjects when compared to corresponding controls. Immunohistochemistry also revealed a positive and statistically significant association in expression of Myc with that of ACC1 in human prostate adenocarcinoma specimens. We propose that Myc-regulated fatty acid synthesis is a valid target for therapy and/or prevention of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3104327897,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a devastating pediatric sarcoma. The survival outcomes remain poor for patients with relapsed or metastatic disease. Effective targeted therapy is lacking due to our limited knowledge of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to disease progression. In this study, we used functional assays in vitro and in vivo (zebrafish and xenograft mouse models) to demonstrate the crucial role of HDAC6, a cytoplasmic histone deacetylase, in driving RMS tumor growth, self-renewal, and migration/invasion. Treatment with HDAC6-selective inhibitors recapitulates the HDAC6 loss-of-function phenotypes. HDAC6 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics to promote tumor cell migration and invasion. RAC1, a Rho family GTPase, is an essential mediator of HDAC6 function, and is necessary and sufficient for RMS cell migration and invasion. High expression of RAC1 correlates with poor clinical prognosis in RMS patients. Targeting the HDAC6-RAC1 axis represents a promising therapeutic option for improving survival outcomes of RMS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3103481145,"Native cattle breeds can carry specific signatures of selection reflecting their adaptation to the local environmental conditions and response to the breeding strategy used. In this study, we comprehensively analysed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes to characterise the population structure and detect the selection signatures in Russian native Yaroslavl and Kholmogor dairy cattle breeds, which have been little influenced by introgression with transboundary breeds. Fifty-six samples of pedigree-recorded purebred animals, originating from different breeding farms and representing different sire lines, of the two studied breeds were genotyped using a genome-wide bovine genotyping array (Bovine HD BeadChip). Three statistical analyses—calculation of fixation index ( F ST ) for each SNP for the comparison of the pairs of breeds, hapFLK analysis, and estimation of the runs of homozygosity (ROH) islands shared in more than 50% of animals—were combined for detecting the selection signatures in the genome of the studied cattle breeds. We confirmed nine and six known regions under putative selection in the genomes of Yaroslavl and Kholmogor cattle, respectively; the flanking positions of most of these regions were elucidated. Only two of the selected regions (localised on BTA 14 at 24.4–25.1 Mbp and on BTA 16 at 42.5–43.5 Mb) overlapped in Yaroslavl, Kholmogor and Holstein breeds. In addition, we detected three novel selection sweeps in the genome of Yaroslavl (BTA 4 at 4.74–5.36 Mbp, BTA 15 at 17.80–18.77 Mbp, and BTA 17 at 45.59–45.61 Mbp) and Kholmogor breeds (BTA 12 at 82.40–81.69 Mbp, BTA 15 at 16.04–16.62 Mbp, and BTA 18 at 0.19–1.46 Mbp) by using at least two of the above-mentioned methods. We expanded the list of candidate genes associated with the selected genomic regions and performed their functional annotation. We discussed the possible involvement of the identified candidate genes in artificial selection in connection with the origin and development of the breeds. Our findings on the Yaroslavl and Kholmogor breeds obtained using high-density SNP genotyping and three different statistical methods allowed the detection of novel putative genomic regions and candidate genes that might be under selection. These results might be useful for the sustainable development and conservation of these two oldest Russian native cattle breeds."
https://openalex.org/W3104335720,"Due to unavailability of consistent income data at the sub-state or district level in developing countries, it is difficult to generate consistent and reliable economic inequality estimates at the disaggregated level. To address this issue, this paper employs the association between night time lights and economic activities for India at the sub-state or district-level, and calculates regional income inequality using Gini coefficients. Additionally, we estimate the relationship between night time lights and socio-economic development for regions in India. We employ a newly available data on regional socio-economic development (Social Progress Index), as well as an index that represents institutional quality or governance. Robust to the choice of socio-economic development indicators, our findings indicate that regional inequality measured by night time lights follow the Kuznets curve pattern. This implies that starting from low levels of socio-economic development or quality of institutions, inequality rises as regional socio-economic factors or quality of institutions improve, and with subsequent progress in socio-economic factors or quality of institutions, regional inequality declines."
https://openalex.org/W3101760778,"Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. While metabolic changes leading to preterm birth are unknown, several factors including dyslipidemia and inflammation have been implicated and paradoxically both low (<18.5 kg/m2) and high (>30 kg/m2) body mass indices (BMIs) are risk factors for this condition. The objective of the study was to identify BMI-associated metabolic perturbations and potential mid-gestation serum biomarkers of preterm birth in a cohort of underweight, normal weight and obese women experiencing either sPTB or full-term deliveries (n = 102; n = 17/group). For this purpose, we combined untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics with targeted metabolic profiling of major regulators of inflammation and metabolism, including oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids and ceramides. Women who were obese and had sPTB showed elevated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia characterized by elevated serum free fatty acids. Women who were underweight-associated sPTB also showed evidence of dyslipidemia characterized by elevated phospholipids, unsaturated triglycerides, sphingomyelins, cholesteryl esters and long-chain acylcarnitines. In normal weight women experiencing sPTB, the relative abundance of 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids to other regioisomers were altered at mid-pregnancy. This phenomenon is not yet associated with any biological process, but may be linked to estrogen metabolism. These changes were differentially modulated across BMI groups. In conclusion, using metabolomics we observed distinct BMI-dependent metabolic manifestations among women who had sPTB. These observations suggest the potential to predict sPTB mid-gestation using a new set of metabolomic markers and BMI stratification. This study opens the door to further investigate the role of cytochrome P450/epoxide hydrolase metabolism in sPTB."
https://openalex.org/W3102380712,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations are the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and aberrant cytoplasm-dislocated NPM1 mutant is a distinct biological characterization of this disease. Our group previously reported that NPM1 mutant elevated autophagy activity and autophagy activation contributed to leukemic cell survival. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cytoplasmic NPM1 mutant involving in the autophagy pathway has not been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) as a core autophagy protein was highly expressed in NPM1-mA positive OCI-AML3 cells and primary NPM1-mutated AML blasts. Meanwhile, we found that NPM1-mA could interact with ULK1 protein and positively regulated ULK1 protein levels. Mechanically, NPM1-mA promoted TRAF6-dependent K63 ubiquitination and further maintained ULK1 stability and kinase activity via miR-146a. In addition, ULK1 high expression-mediated autophagy activation and facilitated to leukemic cell proliferation. Finally, we demonstrated that restoring ULK1 expression, ULK1 inhibitor SBI-0206965 treatment and using shULK1 partially rescued the effect of NPM1-mA on autophagy and cell survival. In conclusion, our findings suggest that NPM1 mutant interacts with ULK1, and thus, maintains its protein stability, which is required for NPM1 mutant-mediated autophagic cell survival. These data extend our understanding of the functions of NPM1 mutant in the regulation of autophagy activation in NPM1-mutated AML."
https://openalex.org/W3099347851,"Consistent with increasing findings, extracellular vesicles (EVs), consider as a major constituents of the aqueous humor, have a role as signaling mediators in glaucoma. Following secretion, EVs hold immense promise for utilization as bio-therapeutics and drug delivery vehicles due to their nature as biological nanoparticles that facilitate intercellular molecular transport. Yet, the specific pathway utilizing for transferring signals by EVs in the ocular drainage system is not fully understood. Hence, the objective of this study was to examine internalization mechanisms by which Non-Pigmented Ciliary Epithelium (NPCE)-derived EVs deliver their signals to the Trabecular Meshwork (TM) cells. EVs were isolated and size and concentration were determined. Internalization study of treated EVs with Proteinase-K to achieve removal of surface membrane proteins on EVs was conducted. Energy dependent uptake mechanism was examined under various temperatures. Using uptake inhibitors endocytosis, phagocytosis, and Wnt-TGFβ2 signaling were investigated. TM cells exposed to NPCE EVs demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of two proteins in two Wnt-TGFb2 signaling proteins levels: p-GSK3β and β-catenin. A significant decrease in the uptake by TM cells of Proteinase-K-treated EVs was found, followed by attenuation of the Wnt-TGFβ2 proteins expression. Energy dependent uptake revealed a significant decrease in EVs internalization. The exposure of TM cells to endocytosis uptake inhibitors abolished the decrease of the Wnt-TGFβ2 proteins levels. Exposure to phagocytosis uptake inhibitor resulted in a partial inhibition of NPCE EVs effect in TM cells. The attenuation of proteins expression levels following uptake inhibitors treatment or EVs membrane proteins removal indicates that Wnt-TGFβ2 signaling in TM cells is mediated through NPCE EVs surface proteins in an active manner that involves endocytosis-dependent routes."
https://openalex.org/W3101212261,"The combination of chemical fertilizer and biochar is regarded as a useful soil supplement for improving the properties of soil and crop yields, and this study describes how the biochar of maize straw can be used to improve the quality of the degraded black soil. This has been achieved by examining the effects of combining different amounts of biochar with chemical fertilizer on the porosities and aggregate formation of soil and exploring how these changes positively impact on crop yields. A field trial design combining different amounts of maize straw biochar [0 (NPK), 15.75 (BC1), 31.5 (BC2), and 47.25 t ha −1 (BC3)] with a chemical fertilizer (NPK) has been used to investigate changes in the formation of soil aggregate, clay content, soil organic carbon (SOC), and crop yields in Chinese black soil over a three year period from 2013 to 2015. The results of this study show that the addition of fertilizer and biochar in 2013 to black soil results in an increased soybean and maize yields from 2013 to 2015 for all the treatments, with BC1/BC2 affording improved crop yields in 2015, while BC3 gave a lower soybean yield in 2015. Total porosities and pore volumes were increased for BC1 and BC2 treatments but relatively decreased for BC3, which could be attributed to increased soil capillary caused by the presence of higher numbers of fine soil particles. The addition of biochar had a positive influence on the numbers and mean weight diameters (MWD) of soil macroaggregates (&gt;0.25 mm) that were present, with the ratio of SOC to TN in soil macroaggregates found to be greater than in the microaggregates. The most significant amount of carbon present in macroaggregates (&gt;2 mm and 0.25–2 mm) was observed when BC2 was applied as a soil additive. Increasing the levels of maze straw biochar to 47.25 t ha −1 led to an increase in the total organic carbon of soil, however, the overall amount of macroaggregates and MWD were decreased, which is possibly due to localized changes in microbial habitat. The supplementation of biochar increased in the amount of aromatic C present (most significant effect observed for BC2), with the ratio of aliphatic C to aromatic C found to be enhanced due to a relative reduction in the aliphatic C content with &gt;2 mm particle fraction. These changes in organic carbon content and soil stability were analyzed using univariate quadratic equations to explain the relationship between the type of functional groups (polysaccharide C, aliphatic C, aromatic C, aliphatic C/aromatic C) present in the soil aggregates and their MWDs, which were found to vary significantly. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the use of controlled amounts of maize-straw biochar in black soil is beneficial for improving crop yields and levels of soil aggregation, however, the use of excessive amounts of biochar results in unfavorable aggregate formation which negatively impacts the yields of crop growth. The data produced suggest that aromatic C content can be used as a single independent variable to characterize the stability of soil aggregate when biochar/fertilizer mixtures are used as soil additives to boost growth yields. Analysis of soil and crop performance in black soil revealed that the application of maize-straw biochar at a rate of 15.75 and 31.5 t ha −1 had positive effects on crop yields, soil aggregation and accumulation of aromatic C in the aggregate fractions when a soybean-maize rotation system was followed over three years."
https://openalex.org/W3106011691,"Fear memory is a pivotal biological function by which organisms can predict possible danger to avoid or reduce harm. However, dysregulation of fear memory processing may lead to pathological fear or anxiety and produce serious clinical symptoms, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Iron deficiency (ID) is reported to inhibit the initiation of fear memory. In our study, we found that ferroportin1 (FPN1), the only known cellular iron export protein in mammals, and ablation in neurons and astrocytes caused iron deficiency in the cortex and hippocampus. However, little is known about its role in the development of fear memory. Moreover, direct evidence of the role of FPN1, or the related molecular mechanisms of such a role, in balancing brain iron homeostasis, especially in neuronal cells, is lacking. Herein, we deleted Fpn1 in mouse neurons, using Nestin-cre transgenic mice, and explored the impact on neuronal iron recycling and brain iron homeostasis in the cortex and hippocampus. We investigated the response of the mice to contextual fear and found that formation of fear memory was impeded after neuronal FPN1 depletion. We also found that FPN1 ablation in neurons and astrocytes caused an atypical expression of iron metabolism-related proteins in these two regions: decreased expression of DMT1, Ft-H, and Ft-L, and increased TfR1 expression.

https://openalex.org/W3102521864,"Alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), which are characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth restriction and craniofacial dysmorphology. Recently, cell-derived extracellular vesicles, including exosomes and microvesicles containing several species of RNAs (exRNAs), have emerged as a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication. However, EtOH’s effects on the biogenesis and function of non-coding exRNAs during fetal development have not been explored. Therefore, we studied the effects of maternal EtOH exposure on the composition of exosomal RNAs in the amniotic fluid (AF) using rat fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) model. Through RNA-Seq analysis we identified and verified AF exosomal miRNAs with differential expression levels specifically associated with maternal EtOH exposure. Uptake of purified FAE AF exosomes by rBMSCs resulted in significant alteration of molecular markers associated with osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. We also determined putative functional roles for AF exosomal miRNAs (miR-199a-3p, miR-214-3p and let-7g) that are dysregulated by FAE in osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. Our results demonstrate that FAE alters AF exosomal miRNAs and that exosomal transfer of dysregulated miRNAs has significant molecular effects on stem cell regulation and differentiation. Our results further suggest the usefulness of assessing molecular alterations in AF exRNAs to study the mechanisms of FAE teratogenesis that should be further investigated by using an in vivo model."
https://openalex.org/W3027665049,"To be able to resolve molecular-clusters it is crucial to access vital informations (such as, molecule density and cluster-size) that are key to understand disease progression and the underlying mechanism. Traditional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of variable sizes (as determined by its localization precisions (LPs)) to reconstruct super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single molecules) that degrade image resolution. Ideally it should be possible to identify the brightest molecules (also termed as, fortunate molecules) to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the recorded data. POSSIBLE microscopy explores this possibility by introducing narrow probability size-distribution of single molecules (narrow size-spectrum about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function). Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single molecule filtering is carried out by the Gaussian distribution function to filter out unfortunate molecules. The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected. In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single molecule images with an average PSF sizes of 15 nm, 30 nm and 50 nm. Results show better-resolved Dendra2-HA clusters with large cluster-density in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cells as compared to the traditional SMLM techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3101098540,"A significant problem in biological X-ray crystallography is the radiation chemistry caused by the incident X-ray beam. This produces both global and site-specific damage. Site specific damage can misdirect the biological interpretation of the structural models produced. Cryo-cooling crystals has been successful in mitigating damage but not eliminating it altogether; however, cryo-cooling can be difficult in some cases and has also been shown to limit functionally relevant protein conformations. The doses used for X-ray crystallography are typically in the kilo-gray to mega-gray range. While disulfide bonds are among the most significantly affected species in proteins in the crystalline state at both cryogenic and higher temperatures, there is limited information on their response to low X-ray doses in solution, the details of which might inform biomedical applications of X-rays. In this work we engineered a protein that dimerizes through a susceptible disulfide bond to relate the radiation damage processes seen in cryo-cooled crystals to those closer to physiologic conditions. This approach enables a low-resolution technique, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), to detect and monitor a residue specific process. A dose dependent fragmentation of the engineered protein was seen that can be explained by a dimer to monomer transition through disulfide bond cleavage. This supports the crystallographically derived mechanism and demonstrates that results obtained crystallographically can be usefully extrapolated to physiologic conditions. Fragmentation was influenced by pH and the conformation of the dimer, providing information on mechanism and pointing to future routes for investigation and potential mitigation. The novel engineered protein approach to generate a large-scale change through a site-specific interaction represents a promising tool for advancing radiation damage studies under solution conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3098827546,"Bovine brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease caused by members of genus Brucella, affecting both animals and humans, and resulting in a serious economic loss in animal production sector and deterioration of public health. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2014 to April 2015 to determine the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of bovine brucellosis in Sendafa, Oromia Special Zone, Ethiopia. A total of 503 blood samples were collected using a simple random sampling technique from dairy cattle of above 6 months of age with no history of previous vaccination against brucellosis. All sera samples were subjected to both Rose Bengal Plate Test for screening and Complement Fixation Test for confirmation. Accordingly, the overall seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in the study area was 0.40%. The result showed that the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in the study area was not statistically significant with all proposed risk factors. No reactors were observed in male animals. The seroprevalence was observed in animals without previous history of abortion. Moreover, information was gathered on individual animal and farm-level risk factors and other farm characteristics using a questionnaire. Awareness among society was poor, so the positive animals can be a potential hazard to animals and humans in the study area. Therefore, public education should be done to improve the awareness of the community on bovine brucellosis and its public health impact with due consideration on the safe consumption of food of animal origin."
https://openalex.org/W3104303794,"Disassembly of tight junctions is a major cause of intestinal barrier dysfunction under total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but the precise mechanisms have not been fully understood. Normally, RNA binding protein Lin 28A is highly restricted to embryonic stem cells and dramatically decreases as differentiation progresses; however, in our preliminary study it was found aberrantly increased in the intestinal epithelial cells of TPN rats, and thus its mechanism of action needs to be addressed. Herein, we report a pivotal role of Lin 28A in the regulation of tight junctions, which induces a sustained translational repression of Occludin, leading to disruption of intestinal barrier function under TPN. Using a rat model of TPN, we found time-dependent upregulation of Lin 28A, negatively correlated with Occludin. Using mouse intestinal organoids and human gut-derived Caco-2 cells as in vitro models, we found that expression of Occludin could be significantly suppressed by ectopic overexpression of Lin 28A. The underlying mechanisms may be partially attributed to translational repression, as the abundance of Occludin transcripts in polysomes was dramatically reduced by Lin 28A (polysomal profiling). Furthermore, Lin 28A was found to directly bind to Occludin mRNA 3' untranslated coding region (UTR), thereby repressing the translation of Occludin transcripts through decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1a). Taken together, our findings revealed that Lin 28A/Occludin axis may be a novel mechanism accounting for the development of barrier dysfunction under TPN."

Kelch-like 15 (KLHL15) is a substrate adaptor for cullin3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases, and KLHL15 gene mutations were recently described as a cause of severe X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify a family of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins as KLHL15 substrates, which are themselves critical for early brain development. We biochemically validated doublecortin (DCX), also an X-linked disease protein, and doublecortin-like kinase 1 and 2 as bona fide KLHL15 interactors and mapped KLHL15 interaction regions to their tandem DCX domains. Shared with two previously identified KLHL15 substrates, a FRY tripeptide at the C-terminal edge of the second DCX domain is necessary for KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination of DCX and doublecortin-like kinase 1 and 2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Conversely, silencing endogenous KLHL15 markedly stabilizes these DCX domain-containing proteins and prolongs their half-life. Functionally, overexpression of KLHL15 in the presence of WT DCX reduces dendritic complexity of cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas neurons expressing FRY-mutant DCX are resistant to KLHL15. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical importance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor KLHL15 in proteostasis of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins and identify a regulatory network important for development of the mammalian nervous system.

KLHL15-dependent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation requires a degron containing both N-terminal DCX domains and a conserved FRY tripeptide. Functionally, we show that KLHL15 expression reduces dendritic arborization in primary hippocampal cultures unless neurons also express DCX with a stabilizing FRY mutation. Our study uncovers a novel role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor KLHL15 as a negative regulator of DCX protein abundance and dendritogenesis and suggests possible mechanistic connections in X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders. Two KLHL15 substrates have been identified to date, the neuron-enriched PP2A regulatory subunit B'β (15Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B'beta subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol.

Cullin3-KLHL15 ubiquitin ligase mediates CtIP protein turnover to fine-tune DNA-end resection.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). According to gene expression databases (e.g., https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa), B'β is more highly expressed in the adult than in the embryonic human brain. This raises the question whether this PP2A subunit is relevant for the neurodevelopmental consequences of KLHL15 mutations. To determine whether KLHL15 possesses functions in neurons independent of PP2A/B'β, we investigated the effect of KLHL15 on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs, Fig. 1A). We previously reported that the B'β-containing PP2A holoenzyme potentiates nerve growth factor signaling at the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor level to sustain ERK signaling and neuronal differentiation of neuroendocrine PC12 cells (22Van Kanegan M.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To address the hypothesis that PP2A/B'β may similarly potentiate TrkB receptor activity in central neurons, we measured ERK activity in transiently transfected primary hippocampal neurons from E18 rat embryos using a dual luciferase reporter assay (PathDetect Elk1 reporter, Fig. 1A) (22Van Kanegan M.J.

In GFP control-transfected neurons, a 3-h incubation with a subsaturating concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) resulted in a several-fold increase in Elk1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Compared with control, overexpression of GFP-KLHL15 attenuated ERK activation by 2.5-fold, whereas B'β overexpression amplified the BDNF response by 3-fold (Fig. 1B). Conversely, silencing of endogenous KLHL15 amplified BDNF signaling to ERK by 1.5-fold over control shRNA-transfected cells, whereas shRNA targeting endogenous B'β nearly eliminated the BDNF response (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that KLHL15 inhibits neurotrophin signaling in hippocampal neurons primarily by targeting PP2A/B'β for proteasomal degradation. The neuromodulator pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) signals through the type 1 G protein–coupled receptor PAC1 to ERK via cAMP-dependent activation of Rap1 (38Vaudry D.

In control-transfected neurons, PACAP at subsaturating concentration induced Elk1 transcriptional activity by ∼5-fold (Fig. 1D). Overexpression of GFP-KLHL15 dampened this response by ∼2-fold, whereas KLHL15 silencing amplified PACAP signaling to ERK by ∼3-fold (Fig. 1, D–E). In contrast to BDNF stimulation, neither overexpression nor knockdown of PP2A/B'β significantly affected the reporter response to PACAP (Fig. 1, D–E), suggesting the involvement of a distinct KLHL15 substrate. To uncover additional neuronal KLHL15 substrates, we searched the human UniProt database for proteins that contain the FRY sequence, which is necessary for the interaction of KLHL15 with its two previously identified targets, PP2A/B'β (15Oberg E.A.

This search identified a list of 616 proteins, which was further narrowed down according to secondary structure prediction (Fig. 2A). The FRY sequence in B'β and CtIP/RBBP8 is predicted to adopt a β-strand flanked by extended unstructured regions, which we reasoned provides flexibility for protein–protein interactions. Constraining the list of FRY-containing proteins to those in which the tripeptide is within a 2- to 4-residue-long β-strand surrounded by at least five unstructured residues on both sides yielded a list of 24 proteins (Fig. 2A), which includes signaling proteins, transcription factors, and proteins involved in proteostasis (Table 1).

GFP-IP of KLHL15 selectively enriched DCX, DCLK1, and DCLK2, but not DCLK3 or another negative control (FLAG-RIβ). Similarly, only FLAG-IPs of DCX and DCLK1/2 isolated GFP-KLHL15 (Fig. 2C). No interactions were detected with dynamin-related protein 1 (GFP-Drp1), indicating that DCX and DCLK1/2 do not interact with GFP. Notably, compared with GFP-Drp1, coexpression of GFP-KLHL15 dramatically decreased steady-state levels of the three interacting proteins (Fig. 2C, input). To obtain evidence for direct interactions with endogenous proteins, we performed glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments with brain lysates from E18 rat embryos.

This thesis aims to identify the fault forms of submersible screw pump accurately and efficiently, and proposes a fault diagnosis method of the submersible screw pump based on random forest. HDFS storage system and MapReduce processing system are established based on Hadoop big data processing platform; Furthermore, the Bagging algorithm is used to collect the training set data. Also, this thesis adopts the CART method to establish the sample library and the decision trees for a random forest model. Six continuous variables, four categorical variables and fault categories of submersible screw pump oil production system are used for training the decision trees. As several decision trees constitute a random forest model, the parameters to be tested are input into the random forest models, and various types of decision trees are used to determine the failure category in the submersible screw pump. It has been verified that the accuracy rate of fault diagnosis is 92.86%. This thesis can provide some meaningful guidance for timely detection of the causes of downhole unit failures, reducing oil well production losses, and accelerating the promotion and application of submersible screw pumps in oil fields."
https://openalex.org/W3098233085,"The large-scale patterns of movement for the Sharp-shinned Hawk ( Accipiter striatus ), a small forest hawk found throughout western North America, are largely unknown. However, based on field observations we set out to test the hypothesis that juvenile migratory A . striatus caught along two distinct migration routes on opposite sides of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of North America (Pacific Coast and Intermountain Migratory Flyways) come from geographically different natal populations. We applied stable isotope analysis of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) of feathers, and large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) to formulate spatially explicit predictions of the origin of the migrant birds. Novel relationships were assessed between the measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of feathers from A . striatus museum specimens of known origin and the isoscape modeled hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of precipitation at those known locations. We used these relationships to predict the origin regions for birds migrating along the two flyways from the measured isotope values of migrant’s feathers and the associated hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation where these feathers were formed. The birds from the two migration routes had overlap in their natal/breeding origins and did not differentiate into fully separate migratory populations, with birds from the Pacific Coast Migratory Flyway showing broader natal geographic origins than those from the Intermountain Flyway. The methodology based on oxygen isotopes had, in general, less predictive power than the one based on hydrogen. There was broad agreement between the two isotope approaches in the geographic assignment of the origins of birds migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway, but not for those migrating along the Intermountain Migratory Flyway. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for conservation efforts of A . striatus in western North America, and the use of combined hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis to track the movement of birds of prey on continental scales."
https://openalex.org/W3099892848,"Inhibition of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement by saliva from Anopheles mosquitoes facilitates feeding by blocking production of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which activate mast cells leading to plasma extravasation, pain, and itching. We have previously shown that albicin, a member of the SG7 protein family from An. Albimanus, blocks the AP by binding to and inhibiting the function of the C3 convertase, C3bBb. Here we show that SG7.AF, the albicin homolog from An. freeborni, has a similar potency to albicin but is more active in the presence of properdin, a plasma protein that acts to stabilize C3bBb. Conversely, albicin is highly active in the absence or presence of properdin. Albicin and SG7.AF stabilize the C3bBb complex in a form that accumulates on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) surfaces coated with properdin, but SG7.AF binds with lower affinity than albicin. Albicin induces oligomerization of the complex in solution, suggesting that it is oligomerization that leads to stabilization on SPR surfaces. Anophensin, the albicin ortholog from An. stephensi, is only weakly active as an inhibitor of the AP, suggesting that the SG7 family may play a different functional role in this species and other species of the subgenus Cellia, containing the major malaria vectors in Africa and Asia. Crystal structures of albicin and SG7.AF reveal a novel four-helix bundle arrangement that is stabilized by an N-terminal hydrogen bonding network. These structures provide insight into the SG7 family and related mosquito salivary proteins including the platelet-inhibitory 30 kDa family."

The aim of this study was to understand the impact of the SOD1 : c . 118G &gt; A mutation by genotyping a population of German Shepherd dogs in Brazil. A PCR-RFLP approach was used to genotype 97 healthy individuals belonging from the Northeast (Bahia and Pernambuco states) and South (Santa Catarina state) regions of Brazil.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to describe the presence of the “ A ” allele associated with CDM ( SOD1 : c . 118G &gt; A ) in German Shepherd dogs in Brazil and, as such, these results contribute toward important epidemiological data in this country and to the knowledge of the distribution of the aforementioned mutation worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3099362900,"Background Monitoring and treating metastatic progression remains a formidable task due, in part, to an inability to monitor specific differential molecular adaptations that allow the cancer to thrive within different tissue types. Hence, to develop optimal treatment strategies for metastatic disease, an important consideration is the divergence of the metastatic cancer growing in visceral organs from the primary tumor. We had previously reported the establishment of isogenic human metastatic breast cancer cell lines that are representative of the common metastatic sites observed in breast cancer patients. Methods Here we have used proteomic, RNAseq, and metabolomic analyses of these isogenic cell lines to systematically identify differences and commonalities in pathway networks and examine the effect on the sensitivity to breast cancer therapeutic agents. Results Proteomic analyses indicated that dissemination of cells from the primary tumor sites to visceral organs resulted in cell lines that adapted to growth at each new site by, in part, acquiring protein pathways characteristic of the organ of growth. RNAseq and metabolomics analyses further confirmed the divergences, which resulted in differential efficacies to commonly used FDA approved chemotherapeutic drugs. This model system has provided data that indicates that organ-specific growth of malignant lesions is a selective adaptation and growth process. Conclusions The insights provided by these analyses indicate that the rationale of targeted treatment of metastatic disease may benefit from a consideration that the biology of metastases has diverged from the primary tumor biology and using primary tumor traits as the basis for treatment may not be ideal to design treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3098804355,"In the current work we evaluated the anatomical changes induced by T . harzianum and T . asperellum in two soybean cultivars, BRSGO Caiaponia and NA 5909 RG. Soybean production represents a growing market worldwide, and new methods aimed at increasing its productivity and yield are constantly being sought. Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have been widely used in agriculture as a promising alternative for the promotion of plant growth and for biological control of various pathogens. It is known that Trichoderma spp. colonize plant roots, but the anatomical changes that this fungus can cause are still less studied. Experiment was conducted in a greenhouse to collect leaves and soybean roots to perform analysis of growth parameters, enzymatic activity of defense-related enzymes and anatomical changes. It was observed that inoculation of Trichoderma spp. caused anatomical alterations, among them, increase in stomatal index at the abaxial leaf surface, thickness of the root cortex, thickness of adaxial epidermis, mean diameter of the vascular cylinder, thickness of the mesophyll, and thickness of the spongy parenchyma of the soybean plants. These results indicate that the alterations in these factors may be related to the process of plant resistance to pathogens, and better performance against adverse conditions. This study demonstrates that the anatomical study of plants is an important tool to show the effects that are induced by biological control agents."

Although phosphohistidine is relatively unstable, enzymatic dephosphorylation of this residue is apparently needed in some contexts, since both prokaryotic and eukaryotic phosphohistidine phosphatases have been reported. Here we identify the mechanism by which a bacterial phosphohistidine phosphatase dephosphorylates the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system, a broadly conserved bacterial pathway that controls diverse metabolic processes. We show that the phosphatase SixA dephosphorylates the phosphocarrier protein NPr and that the reaction proceeds through phosphoryl transfer from a histidine on NPr to a histidine on SixA. In addition, we show that Escherichia coli lacking SixA are outcompeted by wild-type E. coli in the context of commensal colonization of the mouse intestine. Notably, this colonization defect requires NPr and is distinct from a previously identified in vitro growth defect associated with dysregulation of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system. The widespread conservation of SixA, and its coincidence with the phosphotransferase system studied here, suggests that this dephosphorylation mechanism may be conserved in other bacteria.

To our knowledge, there are only four phosphohistidine phosphatases for which in vivo targets have been proposed: SixA in Escherichia coli and PHPT1, PGAM5, and LHPP in mammals (21Hindupur S.K.

The “histidine” in this superfamily name refers not to substrate specificity but rather to the conserved residue in the active site that is essential for enzyme activity and that becomes phosphorylated during catalysis.

However, beyond the two reports that proposed this activity 2 decades ago, we are unaware of any other publications describing SixA regulation of ArcB. In fact, at least two subsequent studies failed to find an effect of SixA on ArcB-regulated transcription (33Schulte J.E. Goulian M. The phosphohistidine phosphatase SixA targets a phosphotransferase system.mBio. 2018; 9: e01666-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 42Bekker M. Alexeeva S. Laan W. Sawers G.

Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, analysis of a growth defect of a SixA-null strain identified a different regulatory pathway that appears to be a physiological target of SixA (33Schulte J.E. Goulian M. The phosphohistidine phosphatase SixA targets a phosphotransferase system.mBio. 2018; 9: e01666-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar): the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system. In contrast to the classical carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems, the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system does not participate in sugar phosphorylation and uptake, but, like the carbohydrate systems, it regulates a diverse set of cellular processes, including potassium homeostasis, nitrogen and carbon metabolism, the stringent response, and two-component signaling (10Galinier A.

Regulatory roles of the bacterial nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system.Trends Microbiol. 2010; 18: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In most cases, regulation is mediated by phosphorylation-dependent protein–protein interactions (2Deutscher J. Francke C. Postma P.W.

Rev. 2014; 78: 231-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system consists of a phosphotransferase, EINtr, and two phosphocarriers, NPr and EIIANtr (Fig. 1A). Together, these three proteins perform reversible phosphoryl transfer reactions via histidine residues in a similar fashion to their counterparts in carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems: a phosphoryl group is first transferred from phosphoenolpyruvate to EINtr, next from EINtr to NPr, and finally from NPr to EIIANtr. Whereas carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems donate phosphoryl groups to incoming carbohydrates or acceptor proteins, the fate of the phosphoryl groups that pass through the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system is not understood in most bacteria. Two exceptions are Acinetobacter baumannii, in which phosphoryl groups can be transferred from NPr to a serine residue of the protein GigB and subsequently removed by the phosphoserine phosphatase GigA (46Gebhardt M.J. Shuman H.A. GigA and GigB are master regulators of antibiotic resistance, stress responses, and virulence in Acinetobacter baumannii.J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199e00066-00017Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and Sinorhizobium meliloti, in which an aspartic acid residue near the phosphorylation site of NPr (called HPr in this organism) is proposed to heighten the autohydrolysis rate (47Goodwin R. Influence of Intracellular Nitrogen Status and Dynamic Control of Central Metabolism in the Plant Symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT2015Google Scholar). While it is possible that autohydrolysis also plays a role in E. coli, recent work suggests that SixA provides another mechanism for dephosphorylating the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (33Schulte J.E. Goulian M. The phosphohistidine phosphatase SixA targets a phosphotransferase system.mBio. 2018; 9: e01666-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the absence of SixA, EIIANtr becomes hyperphosphorylated. In addition, the reduction of EIIANtr phosphorylation by SixA requires NPr. These observations, together with epistasis studies of a ΔsixA growth defect, led to the proposal that phosphorylated NPr (NPr-P) is a substrate for SixA. Here we establish through in vivo and in vitro experiments that SixA is a phosphohistidine phosphatase for NPr-P. The NPr-P dephosphorylation reaction proceeds through an unstable phosphohistidine intermediate of SixA. We also show that the SixA–NPr interaction is important for E. coli to colonize its natural niche, the mammalian intestinal tract. These results establish a substrate for a highly conserved prokaryotic phosphohistidine phosphatase and identify a mechanism for modulating the activity of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system. To determine the effect of SixA on NPr phosphorylation, we analyzed strains expressing a tagged NPr (E-Tag) by western blot after native gel electrophoresis. Under nondenaturing conditions, the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the protein are resolved into two bands, with the phosphorylated form corresponding to higher mobility (48Goodwin R.A. Gage D.J. Biochemical characterization of a nitrogen-type phosphotransferase system reveals that enzyme EINtr integrates carbon and nitrogen signaling in Sinorhizobium meliloti.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 1901-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5). Comparison of the results for the sixA+ and ΔsixA strains indicates that the fraction of NPr protein that is phosphorylated is increased when SixA is absent (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 1C). We also note that there are several additional bands (with lower mobility) in the lanes with E-tagged NPr that are absent in the lane with untagged NPr (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2–5 with lane 1). We do not know the identity of these additional bands, but they may indicate complexes of NPr with other proteins. NPr is phosphorylated by EINtr and also by reverse phosphotransfer from EIIANtr, which can be phosphorylated by cross talk from other phosphotransferase systems in mutant backgrounds (49Zimmer B. Hillmann A. Görke B. Requirements for the phosphorylation of the Escherichia coli EIIANtr protein in vivo.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 286: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Cross talk to NPr directly is also plausible (50Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. Novel proteins of the phosphotransferase system encoded within the rpoN operon of Escherichia coli. Enzyme IIANtr affects growth on organic nitrogen and the conditional lethality of an erats mutant.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) but, to our knowledge, has never been investigated in vivo. We therefore examined the effect of deleting sixA on NPr phosphorylation in strains that lack EINtr and EIIANtr. A ΔptsP ΔptsN strain (EINtr-null, EIIANtr-null) had no detectable NPr-P (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In contrast, the triple-deletion ΔsixA ΔptsP ΔptsN showed considerable NPr phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 5). These results establish that NPr can be phosphorylated by other pathways (possibly carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems) when EINtr, EIIANtr, and SixA are absent and further establish that SixA does not require EINtr and EIIANtr to modulate NPr phosphorylation. We also tested whether SixA's active-site histidine is required for the protein to affect NPr phosphorylation by comparing the effects of expressing wild-type SixA or a SixA(H8A) mutant. Wild-type SixA expression eliminated NPr-P, whereas expression of SixA(H8A) did not (Fig. 1D). Collectively, the above results show that SixA modulates NPr phosphorylation independently of EINtr and EIIANtr, and they support the hypothesis that SixA directly dephosphorylates NPr-P. To study the activity of SixA against NPr-P in vitro, we used purified NPr that consisted of the complete amino acid sequence of the protein plus eight additional residues at the C-terminus (see Experimental procedures). We will refer to this protein as “wild-type” NPr. We phosphorylated NPr by incubating with EINtr and phosphoenolpyruvate. As expected (51Rabus R. Reizer J. Paulsen I. Saier Jr., M.H. Enzyme INtr from Escherichia coli. A novel enzyme of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system exhibiting strict specificity for its phosphoryl acceptor, NPr.J. Biol.

Functional characterization of the incomplete phosphotransferase system (PTS) of the intracellular pathogen Brucella melitensis.PLoS One. 2010; 5e12679Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), phosphorylation required His16 of NPr (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 8). Curiously, the H16A mutant ran as a doublet on native gels; we will discuss this observation further below. Addition of purified SixA to NPr-P resulted in complete dephosphorylation of the protein, whereas the catalytic mutant SixA(H8A) had no observable effect on NPr-P level (Fig. 2B). For the experiments described above and below, the polyhistidine tag used to purify NPr was cleaved from the protein. We had noticed that phosphorylation reactions of NPr-(His)6, a protein consisting of the complete amino acid sequence of NPr plus the eight additional residues LEHHHHHH, produced multiple bands (Fig. 2C lane 4; Fig. 2D lanes 2 and 4). In addition, incubation with SixA eliminated these bands, leaving only the band corresponding to unphosphorylated NPr-(His)6 (Fig. 2D). To determine whether these multiple bands correspond to multiple phosphorylation states of the protein, we analyzed NPr-(His)6 phosphorylation and mock-phosphorylation samples by mass spectrometry. Monoisotopic masses of phosphorylated NPr-(His)6 measured by electrospray ionization MS matched the masses for singly and doubly phosphorylated protein (Fig. S1). Unfortunately, LC-MS/MS produced spectra of insufficient quality to assign phosphorylation to specific residues (data not shown), despite efforts to preserve acid-labile histidine phosphorylation. Since the extra bands appear only for the construct with the polyhistidine tag, and since these bands were eliminated after incubation with SixA (Fig. 2D), we suspect that one or more histidines in the (His)6 tag were phosphorylated. We further suspect that the (His)6 tag is phosphorylated by intramolecular phosphoryl transfer, because, first, the site of NPr phosphorylation, His16, is adjacent to the C-terminus of NPr (53Strickland M. Stanley A.M. Wang G. Botos I. Schwieters C.D. Buchanan S.K. Peterkofsky A. Tjandra N.

Solution structure of NPr, a bacterial signal-transducing protein that controls the phosphorylation state of the potassium transporter-regulating protein IIANtr.Amino Acids. 2008; 35: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and, second, NPr(H16A)-(His)6 shows no evidence of phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, lane 7). We are unaware of previous reports of histidine phosphorylation of polyhistidine tags, but we speculate that this reaction may occur if the polyhistidine tag is near a site of histidine phosphorylation of the native protein. As noted above, NPr(H16A) protein preparations ran as doublets on native gels (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8; Fig. 2C, lanes 5–7). The two bands are unlikely to reflect two chemically distinct forms of the protein because NPr(H16A) runs as a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. S2) and analysis of NPr(H16A) by electrospray ionization MS identified only a single species (data not shown). Although wild-type NPr protein preparations primarily ran as a single band with mobility similar to the higher mobility band of NPr(H16A), a faint lower mobility band for the wild-type protein was also discernable (for example Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3; Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). The doublet on native gels may therefore indicate that our recombinant NPr has two stable (or quasi-stable) conformations. Indeed, previous work has also reported evidence for two conformations of recombinant NPr (54Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G.

Based on NMR spectroscopy, it was suggested that the two protein forms could be due to interactions with a disordered C-terminal tail c"
https://openalex.org/W3105616105,"A ventilation network feature graph can directly and quantitatively represent the features of a ventilation network. To ensure the stability of airflow in a mine and improve ventilation system analysis, we propose a new algorithm to draw ventilation network feature graphs. The independent path method serves as the algorithm’s main frame, and an improved adaptive genetic algorithm is embedded so that the graph may be drawn better. A mathematical model based on the node adjacency matrix method for unidirectional circuit discrimination is constructed as the drawing algorithm may not be valid in such cases. By modifying the edge-seeking strategy, the improved depth-first search algorithm can be used to determine all of the paths in the ventilation network with unidirectional circuits, and the equivalent transformation method of network topology relations is used to draw the ventilation network feature graph. Through the analysis of the topological relation of a ventilation network, a simplified mathematical model is constructed, and network simplification technology makes the drawing concise and hierarchical. The rapid and intuitive drawing of the ventilation network feature graphs is significant for optimization of the ventilation system and day-to-day management."
https://openalex.org/W3103593817,"Objective To investigate the relationship between high FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C), MRI-defined white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cognitive function over time. Methods Data from the population-based Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 5,888, aged ≥65) were used. FVIII:C was measured in blood samples taken at baseline. WMH burden was assessed on two cranial MRI scans taken roughly 5 years apart. Cognitive function was assessed annually using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). We used ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular factors in cross-sectional and longitudinal WMH analyses, and adjusted linear regression and linear mixed models in the analyses of cognitive function. Results After adjustment for confounding, higher levels of FVIII:C were not strongly associated with the burden of WMH on the initial MRI scan (OR&gt;p75 = 1.20, 95% CI 0.99–1.45; N = 2,735) nor with WMH burden worsening over time (OR&gt;p75 = 1.18, 95% CI 0.87–1.59; N = 1,527). High FVIII:C showed no strong association with cognitive scores cross-sectionally (3MSE&gt;p75 β = -0.06, 95%CI -0.45 to 0.32, N = 4,005; DSST&gt;p75 β = -0.69, 95%CI -1.52 to 0.13, N = 3,954) or over time (3MSE&gt;p75 β = -0.07,95% CI -0.58 to 0.44, N = 2,764; DSST&gt;p75 β = -0.22, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.53, N = 2,306) after confounding adjustment. Interpretation The results from this cohort study of older adult participants indicate no strong relationships between higher FVIII:C levels and WMH burden or cognitive function in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses."
