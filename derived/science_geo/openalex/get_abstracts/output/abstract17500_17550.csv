https://openalex.org/W2034453538,The influenza virus M2 protein was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and shown to have an associated ion channel activity selective for monovalent ions. The anti-influenza virus drug amantadine hydrochloride significantly attenuated the inward current induced by hyperpolarization of oocyte membranes. Mutations in the M2 membrane-spanning domain that confer viral resistance to amantadine produced currents that were resistant to the drug. Analysis of the currents of these altered M2 proteins suggests that the channel pore is formed by the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein. The wild-type M2 channel was found to be regulated by pH. The wild-type M2 ion channel activity is proposed to have a pivotal role in the biology of influenza virus infection.
https://openalex.org/W1558473055,"The APO-1 antigen as defined by the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1 was previously found to be expressed on the cell surface of activated human T and B lymphocytes and a variety of malignant human lymphoid cell lines. Cross-linking of the APO-1 antigen by anti-APO-1 induced programmed cell death, apoptosis, of APO-1 positive cells. To characterize the APO-1 cell surface molecule and to better understand its role in induction of apoptosis, the APO-1 protein was purified to homogeneity from membranes of SKW6.4 B lymphoblastoid cells by solubilization with sodium deoxycholate, affinity chromatography with anti-APO-1 antibody, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Each purification step was followed by an APO-1-specific solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the APO-1 antigen was found to be a membrane glycoprotein of 48-kDa. Endoproteinase-cleaved peptides of the APO-1 protein were subjected to amino acid sequencing, and corresponding oligonucleotides were used to identify a full-length APO-1 cDNA clone from an SKW6.4 cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of APO-1 showed sequence identity with the Fas antigen, a cysteine-rich transmembrane protein of 335 amino acids with significant similarity to the members of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. The APO-1 antigen was expressed upon transfection of APO-1 cDNA into BL60-P7 Burkitt's lymphoma cells and conferred sensitivity towards anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis to the transfectants."
https://openalex.org/W2050838682,"The pattern of retrograde axonal transport of the target-derived neurotrophic molecule, nerve growth factor (NGF), correlates with its trophic actions in adult neurons. We have determined that the NGF-related neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), are also retrogradely transported by distinct populations of peripheral and central nervous system neurons in the adult. All three 125I-labeled neurotrophins are retrogradely transported to sites previously shown to contain neurotrophin-responsive neurons as assessed in vitro, such as dorsal root ganglion and basal forebrain neurons. The patterns of transport also indicate the existence of neuronal populations that selectively transport NT-3 and/or BDNF, but not NGF, such as spinal cord motor neurons, neurons in the entorhinal cortex, thalamus, and neurons within the hippocampus itself. Our observations suggest that neurotrophins are transported by overlapping as well as distinct populations of neurons when injected into a given target field. Retrograde transport may thus be predictive of neuronal types selectively responsive to either BDNF or NT-3 in the adult, as first demonstrated for NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2091659591,"The receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) binds two proteins containing SH2 domains, GTPase activating protein (GAP) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). The sites on the receptor that mediate this interaction were identified by using phosphotyrosine-containing peptides representing receptor sequences to block specifically binding of either PI3-kinase or GAP. These results suggested that PI3-kinase binds two phosphotyrosine residues, each located in a 5 aa motif with an essential methionine at the fourth position C-terminal to the tyrosine. Point mutations at these sites caused a selective elimination of PI3-kinase binding and loss of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. Mutation of the binding site for GAP prevented the receptor from associating with or phosphorylating GAP, but had no effect on PI3-kinase binding and little effect on DNA synthesis. Therefore, GAP and PI3-kinase interact with the receptor by binding to different phosphotyrosine-containing sequence motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1985146688,"Voltage-sensitive sodium channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of the action potential and therefore are important for neuronal excitability. Complementary DNA clones encoding the beta 1 subunit of the rat brain sodium channel were isolated by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and library screening techniques. The deduced primary structure indicates that the beta 1 subunit is a 22,851-dalton protein that contains a single putative transmembrane domain and four potential extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites, consistent with biochemical data. Northern blot analysis reveals a 1,400-nucleotide messenger RNA in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and spinal cord. Coexpression of beta 1 subunits with alpha subunits increases the size of the peak sodium current, accelerates its inactivation, and shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation to more negative membrane potentials. These results indicate that the beta 1 subunit is crucial in the assembly, expression, and functional modulation of the heterotrimeric complex of the rat brain sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1602807836,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important molecular messenger accounting for endothelial-derived relaxing activity in blood vessels, mediating cytotoxic actions of macrophages, and functioning as a neurotransmitter in the brain and periphery. NO synthase (NOS) from brain has been purified to homogeneity and molecularly cloned. We now report that NOS is stoichiometrically phosphorylated by cAMP dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, with each kinase phosphorylating a different serine site on NOS. Activation of PKC in transfected cells reduces NOS enzyme activity by approximately 77% in intact cells and by 50% in protein homogenates from these cells. Utilizing fluorescence spectroscopy we find that purified monomer NOS contains 1 molar equivalent of both FMN and FAD. This stoichiometry is supported by enzymatic digestion of the flavins with phosphodiesterase, and titration of the FMN with a specific FMN binding protein. We demonstrate that purified NOS is labeled by a photoaffinity derivative of calmodulin. These recognition sites on NOS provide multiple means for regulation of NO levels and cross-talk between second messenger systems."

When animals are immunized with encephalitogenic peptide of myelin basic protein and recover from the first episode of EAE, they become resistant to a second induction of this disease. Animals depleted of CD8+ T cells by antibody-mediated clearance were used to examine the role of CD8+ T cells in EAE. These cells were found to be major participants in the resistance to a second induction of EAE but were not essential for spontaneous recovery from the first episode of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2049153479,"Neurotrophin-4 is a novel member of the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophins recently isolated from Xenopus and viper DNA. We now report that the Xenopus NT-4 protein (XNT-4) can mediate some of its biological properties through gp145trkB, a murine tyrosine protein kinase previously identified as a primary receptor for the related brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). XNT-4 displaces 125I-labeled BDNF from binding to cells expressing gp145trkB receptors, induces their rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, and causes the morphologic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells when coexpressed with gp145trkB. Moreover, XNT-4 induces the differentiation of PC12 cells into sympathetic-like neurons only if they ectopically express gp145trkB receptors. None of these biochemical or biological effects could be observed when XNT-4 was added to cells expressing the related receptors. Replacement of one of the extracellular cysteines (Cys-345) of gp145trkB by a serine residue prevents its activation by XNT-4 but not by BDNF. Therefore, XNT-4 and BDNF may interact with at least partially distinct domains within the gp145trkB receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2122524469,Plasma membrane vesicles and protoplasts of Escherichia coli were fused to planar lipid bilayers and studied with electrophysiological techniques. Large transmembrane aqueous channels were opened when 0.2 nM LamB signal peptide was added to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. These aqueous pores are similar in conductance to those previously observed in mammalian endoplasmic reticulum when puromycin is used to release and thus unplug nascent translocating chains. Signal sequences have been previously shown to be necessary and sufficient for targeting proteins to cellular membranes. These results demonstrate that signal peptides are sufficient for opening the protein-conducting channels. We suggest that they are the physiological ligands that open protein-conducting channels at the initiation of protein translocation across prokaryotic plasma membrane and mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.
https://openalex.org/W1525622263,"Nitric oxide acts as a widespread signal molecule and represents the endogenous activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase. In endothelial cells and brain tissue, NO is enzymatically formed from L-arginine by Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated NO synthases which require NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and molecular oxygen as cofactors. Here we show that purified brain NO synthase binds to cytochrome c-agarose and exhibits superoxide dismutase-insensitive cytochrome c reductase activity with a Vmax of 10.2 mumol x mg-1 x min-1 and a Km of 34.1 microM. Cytochrome c reduction was largely dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin and cochromatographed with L-citrulline formation during gel filtration. When reconstituted with cytochrome P450, NO synthase induced a moderate Ca(2+)-independent hydroxylation of N-ethylmorphine. NO synthase also reduced the artificial electron acceptors nitro blue tetrazolium and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. Cytochrome c, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, and nitro blue tetrazolium inhibited NO synthase activity determined as formation of L-citrulline from 0.1 mM L-arginine in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal effects at 166, 41, and 7.3 microM, respectively. These results suggest that NO synthase may participate in cellular electron transfer processes and that a variety of electron-acceptors may interfere with NO formation due to the broad substrate specificity of the reductase domain of NO synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1991460507,"Activation of B lymphocytes by engagement of their immunoglobulin M antigen receptors results in phosphorylation of a number of proteins on tyrosine residues. One such protein is p95vav, the product of the vav proto-oncogene. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav occurred within seconds of immunoglobulin M cross-linking and was independent of other events induced during stimulation of B cells, such as protein kinase C activation, guanosine triphosphate-binding protein signaling, and calcium mobilization. Moreover, engagement of antigen receptors induced the rapid (approximately 5 seconds) and transient (approximately 60 seconds) association of p95vav with a 70-kilodalton tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, Vap-1, an interaction mediated by the Src homology 2 domain of p95vav. These results suggest that the vav proto-oncogene participates in the signaling processes that mediate the antigen-induced activation of B lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2050599523,"Triggering neural cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily with specific ligands or antibodies inhibited the phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in a subpopulation of α- and β-tubulin associated with membranes from a subcellular fraction of nerve growth cones from fetal rat brain. Preincubation of these membranes with purified extracellular fragments of L1, N-CAM, or myelin-associated glycoprotein, or with antibodies directed against the extracellular domains of L1 or N-CAM, inhibited pp60c-src phosphorylation of tubulin in an endogenous membrane kinase reaction. Other proteins that affect neurite outgrowth (fibronectin, laminin, antibodies against N-cadherin) had no effect. The results suggest that cell adhesion molecules transduce cell surface events to intracellular signals by modulating the activity of protein tyrosine kinases or phosphatases in axonal membranes to influence cytoskeletal dynamics at the growth cone."

https://openalex.org/W1490576088,"The paramagnetic molecule nitric oxide (NO), produced from L-arginine by a specific enzyme (NO synthase), has been shown to be involved in a surprising variety of mammalian cellular responses, including the regulation of T cell immunity to alloantigens in vitro. In cytotoxic activated macrophages, NO production results in a characteristic pattern of alteration of iron-containing enzyme function that is mimicked by exposure to NO. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have shown the formation of iron-nitrosyl species during macrophage activation and also during sepsis, indicating that alteration of iron-containing protein function may be the result of the well-documented tendency of NO to bind to metal ions. We have recently shown that the NO synthesis induced during alloantigenic activation of rat splenocytes inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte generation. This report demonstrates that iron-nitrosyl EPR signals similar to those observed in macrophages and during sepsis are present in the blood and in the grafted tissue of rats during the rejection of allogeneic (but not syngeneic) heart grafts. These signals are found in the blood and at the site of allograft rejection, but are not found in other tissues (such as spleen and lung), and are obliterated by administration of the immunosuppressant FK506. These results directly demonstrate the formation of iron-nitrosyl complexes during vascularized allograft rejection and suggest that consequent destruction of iron-containing protein function plays an important role in the rejection response."
https://openalex.org/W2065563953,"Expression of the bcr-abl oncogene in multipotent progenitor cells (MPPCs) is implicated as a key event in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Bone marrow enriched for MPPCs was infected with a retrovirus that carried bcr-abl. The mixed-lineage colonies that resulted were responsive to growth factors and could differentiate. These cells later became growth factor-independent but, when injected into severe combined immunodeficient mice, were not leukemogenic. Thus, the presence of bcr-abl alone does not cause growth factor independence, although it initiates a stepwise process. This system may prove useful in the study of other oncogenes that cause leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1545973549,"P-selectin on platelets and endothelial cells and E-selectin on endothelial cells are leukocyte receptors that recognize lineage-specific carbohydrates on neutrophils and monocytes. The proposed ligands for these receptors contain the Le(x) core and sialic acid. Since other investigators have shown that both E-selectin and P-selectin bind to sialylated Le(x), we evaluated whether E-selectin and P-selectin recognize the same counter-receptor on leukocytes. The interaction of HL60 cells with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing P-selectin or E-selectin was studied. To determine whether a protein component is required in addition to sialyl Le(x) for either P-selectin or E-selectin recognition, HL60 cells or neutrophils were digested with proteases, including chymotrypsin, elastase, proteinase Glu-C, ficin, papain, or thermolysin. Cells treated with these proteases bound E-selectin but not P-selectin. Fucosidase or neuraminidase treatment of HL60 cells markedly decreased binding to both E-selectin- and P-selectin-expressing CHO cells. Growth of HL60 cells in tunicamycin inhibited the ability of these cells to support P-selectin-mediated binding and, to a lesser extent, E-selectin-mediated binding. Purified P-selectin inhibited CHO:P-selectin binding to HL60 cells, but incompletely inhibited CHO:E-selectin binding to HL60 cells. However, purified soluble E-selectin inhibited CHO:P-selectin and CHO:E-selectin binding to HL60 cells equivalently and completely. COS cells, unable to bind to E-selectin or P-selectin, bound E-selectin but not P-selectin upon transfection with alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase or alpha-1,3/1,4-fucosyltransferase. Similarly, LEC 11 cells expressing sialyl Le(x) bound E-selectin- but not P-selectin-expressing CHO cells. Sambucus nigra lectin, specific for the sialyl-2,6 beta Gal/GalNAc linkage, inhibited P-selectin but not E-selectin binding to HL60 cells. Although sialic acid and Le(x) are components of the P-selectin ligand and the E-selectin ligand, these results indicate that the ligands are related, having overlapping specificities, but are structurally distinct. A protein component containing sialyl Le(x) in proximity to sialyl-2,6 beta Gal structures on the P-selectin ligand may contribute to its specificity for P-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1496060898,"The autophosphorylation, from [gamma-32P]ATP, of insulin and epidermal growth factor receptors in rat liver endosomes peaked at 2-5 min and declined thereafter. When autophosphorylation from either [gamma-32P]ATP or unlabeled ATP was stopped after 5 min by adding excess EDTA +/- ATP, the phosphotyrosine (PY) content of each receptor decreased at 37 degrees C with a t 1/2 of 1.6 min. This was equally so whether the PY content of 32P-labeled receptors was analyzed by autoradiography of KOH-treated gels or by Western blotting with PY antibodies of immunoprecipitated receptors. The dephosphorylation reaction was strictly dependent on the presence of sulfhydryl, was unaffected by the addition of rat liver cytosol, and was temperature-dependent. The phosphotyrosine phosphatase(s) (PTPase(s)) appeared to be tightly anchored to the endosomal membrane, since the dephosphorylation reaction was unaffected by sodium carbonate and 0.6 M KCl treatments. However, treatment with Triton X-100 abolished dephosphorylation, implying an intimate association between the PTPase(s) and its substrate in an intact membrane environment. The powerful insulinomimetic agent pervanadate was the most potent inhibitor (50% inhibition at 1 microM). Increasing the dose of injected ligand augmented the rate of insulin and decreased that of EGF receptor dephosphorylation, respectively. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies failed to identify PTPase 1B or T-cell PTPase in ENs, whereas positive signals were seen in plasma membrane. These studies indicate that the phosphorylation state of receptor tyrosine kinases is dynamically regulated, with dephosphorylation, by closely associated PTPase(s), playing an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1606012461,"The genome of CT10 avian sarcoma virus encodes a 47-kDa fusion protein that consists of viral gag sequences fused to a cell-derived sequence containing SH2 and SH3 domains (v-crk). Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that v-Crk can induce transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by influencing the activity of cellular proteins involved in growth regulation. In this report, we have developed an in vitro microtiter assay to study the binding of bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins of v-Crk and its cellular homolog, c-Crk, to the phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Competitive binding data are presented that compare the abilities of heterologous glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins containing GAPSH2[N], AblSH2, SrcSH2, and PLC-gamma SH2[N] sequences to inhibit Crk binding. Results indicate that both full-length Crk and GAPSH2[N] bind the phosphorylated EGFR with high affinity and can quantitatively compete the binding of each other by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binding of full-length Crk or the isolated SH2 domains of GAP or Abl resulted in a significant protection of phosphorylated EGFR against dephosphorylation by cellular phosphatase activity, but did not appear to stimulate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR. To extend these findings to p130, the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in CT10-transformed cells, we utilized a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Results demonstrate high affinity binding of Crk toward denatured p130 and, as is the case for phosphorylated EGFR, Crk binding can partially protect p130 from phosphatase activity. However, no apparent competition of Crk binding was noted with heterologous SH2-containing proteins including GAPSH2[N], suggesting a possible specificity of Crk-p130 binding. These data are consistent with a direct role of SH2 in the modulation of cellular phosphotyrosine status in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1816946917,"Using the human erythropoietin-responsive hematopoietic cell line UT-7, we showed that erythropoietin (Epo) rapidly and specifically induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of its own receptor (M(r) 75,000) and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins of M(r) 140,000, 120,000, 95,000, 60,000, 57,000, and 42,000. Neither granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, interleukin 6, nor the kit ligand induced the phosphorylation of the M(r) 75,000 receptor protein, although these growth factors induced the phosphorylation of other proteins. Cross-linking experiments using 125I-Epo indicated that the UT-7 cells expressed three Epo receptor subunits, of M(r) 100,000, 85,000, and 75,000, among which only the M(r) 75,000 subunit was tyrosine-phosphorylated following activation with Epo."
https://openalex.org/W1500424117,"In the course of screening a human hepatoma cDNA library with antibody raised against a mammalian lectin with subunit molecular weight of about 14,000, we detected a partial cDNA encoding a related but distinct protein that was possibly a homologous lectin (Gitt and Barondes, 1986). We here report the isolation and sequencing of a full-length cDNA for this protein from a HepG2 cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a protein with subunit molecular weight of 14,650. Expression of the coding sequence in Escherichia coli yields a product that binds to a lactose affinity column and is specifically eluted with lactose, confirming that this new protein is a lectin. Like its well studied relative, here called L-14-I, the new lectin, L-14-II, exists as a homodimer in solution. The two related human lectins have 43% amino acid sequence identity. The genomic DNA encoding L-14-II (LGALS2) contains four exons with similar intron placement to L-14-I (LGALS1); but the genomic upstream region, which contains several sequences characteristic of regulatory elements, differs significantly from L-14-I."
https://openalex.org/W1528843291,"Although the angiogenic proteins acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) both interact with the transition metal copper, itself a putative modulator of angiogenesis, a role for copper in FGF function has not been established. Using nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detect the complete conversion of recombinant forms of human FGF-1 monomer protein to FGF-1 homodimers after exposure to copper ions. In contrast, not all forms of bovine FGF-1 isolated from bovine brain or a recombinant preparation of human FGF-2 completely formed homodimers after exposure to copper ions under similar conditions. Since the copper-induced FGF-1 homodimers reverted to the monomer form in the presence of dithiothreitol, specific alkylation of cysteine residues by pyridylethylation prevented FGF-1 homodimer formation, and preformed FGF-1 homodimers could not be dissociated by the metal chelator EDTA, FGF-1 dimer formation appeared to result from the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds by copper-induced oxidation of sulfhydryl residues. FGF-1 homodimers bound with similar apparent affinity as FGF-1 monomers to immobilized copper ions, both eluting at 60 mM imidazole. Both human FGF-1 monomer and dimer forms had a 6-fold higher apparent affinity for immobilized copper ions, as compared with human FGF-2, which eluted in the monomer form at 10 mM imidazole. Further, in contrast to FGF-1 monomers, which dissociate from immobilized heparin in 1.0 M NaCl, preformed FGF-1 homodimers had reduced apparent affinity for immobilized heparin and eluted at 0.4 M NaCl. In contrast, the apparent affinity of human FGF-2 for immobilized heparin was unaffected after exposure to copper ions. Heparin appeared to modulate the formation of copper-induced intermolecular disulfide bonds for FGF-1 but not FGF-2, since co-incubation of heparin and copper with FGF-1 monomers resulted in dimers and other oligomeric complexes. FGF-1 copper-induced homodimers failed to induce mitogenesis in [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, an effect which could be reversed by treatment with dithiothreitol, whereas FGF-2-induced mitogenic activity was relatively unaffected by pretreatment with copper. The differences between human FGF-1 and FGF-2 in protein-copper interactions may be due to differing free thiol content and arrangement between the two proteins. A recombinant human FGF-1 mutant containing the two cysteines conserved throughout the FGF family of proteins but lacking a cysteine residue (Cys 131) present in wild-type human FGF-1 but not human FGF-2 readily formed copper-induced dimers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1626758822,"Of the several proteins that bind along the cytoplasmic domain of erythrocyte membrane band 3, only the sites of interaction of proteins 4.1 and 4.2 remain to be at least partially localized. Using five independent techniques, we have undertaken to map and characterize the binding site of band 4.1 on band 3. First, transfer of a radioactive cross-linker (125I-2-(p-azido-salicylamido)ethyl-1-3-dithiopropionate) from purified band 4.1 to its binding sites on stripped inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles (stripped IOVs) revealed major labeling of band 3, glycophorin C, and glycophorin A. Proteolytic mapping of the stripped IOVs then demonstrated that the label on band 3 was confined largely to a fragment comprising residues 1-201. Second, competitive binding experiments with Fab fragments of monoclonal and peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies to numerous epitopes along the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 displayed stoichiometric competition only with Fabs to epitopes between residues 1 and 91 of band 3. Weak competition was also observed with Fabs to a sequence of the cytoplasmic domain directly adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain, but only at 50-100-fold excess of Fab. Third, band 4.1 protected band 3 from chymotryptic hydrolysis at tyrosine 46 and to a much lesser extent at a site within the junctional peptide connecting the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of band 3. Fourth, ankyrin, which has been previously shown to interact with band 3 both near a putative central hinge and at the N terminus competed with band 4.1 for band 3 in stripped IOVs. Since band 4.1 does not associate with band 3 near the flexible central hinge, the competition with ankyrin can be assumed to derive from a mutual association with the N terminus. Finally, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-15 of band 3 was found to mildly inhibit band 4.1 binding to stripped IOVs. Taken together, these data suggest that band 4.1 binds band 3 predominantly near the N terminus, with a possible secondary site near the junction of the cytoplasmic domain and the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1585686118,"The work described in this report suggests the existence of two biochemically distinguishable forms of the interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. Kinase isolated from the cytosolic fraction (S-100) and the ribosome salt wash fraction of interferon-treated cells differed in their chromatographic properties. S-100 kinase eluted from a gel filtration column with M(r) = 140,000-160,000 and was predominantly anionic in nature, whereas ribosomal kinase eluted with M(r) = 66,000 and was predominantly cationic in nature. Purified preparations of S-100 kinase contained the M(r) = 66,000 subunit, P1, as the only polypeptide present in stoichiometric amounts, and thus the S-100 kinase appears to be a dimer of P1 subunits. Dimerization of the S-100 kinase was dependent on the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. Kinase isolated from S-100 was partially phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of the S-100 kinase by treatment with alkaline phosphatase resulted in a monomeric form of the enzyme with biochemical characteristics similar to that of the ribosome salt wash kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1599851165,"Two FK506 binding proteins of molecular mass 12 kDa (FKBP12) and 13 kDa (FKBP13) have been identified as common cellular receptors of the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. Here we report the molecular cloning and overexpression of a 25-kDa rapamycin and FK506 binding protein (termed FKBP25) with peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity. The amino acid sequence, predicted from the FKBP25 cDNA, shares identity with FKBP12 (44%) and FKBP13 (47%) in the C-terminal 97 amino acids. Unlike either FKBP12 or FKBP13, the nucleotide sequence of FKBP25 contains a number of putative nuclear localization sequences. The PPIase activity of recombinant FKBP25 was comparable with that of FKBP12. The PPIase activity of FKBP25 was far more sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin (IC50 = 50 nM) than FK506 (IC50 = 400 nM). PPIase activity of 100 nM FKBP25 was almost completely inhibited by 150 nM rapamycin while only 90% inhibition was achieved by 4 microM FK506. These data demonstrate that FKBP25 has a higher affinity for rapamycin than for FK506 and suggest that this cellular receptor may be an important target molecule for immunosuppression by rapamycin."

https://openalex.org/W2168849946,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a member of the serpin superfamily of proteins, has been demonstrated previously to interact functionally with the glycosaminoglycan heparin (Ehrlich, H.J., Keijer, J., Preissner, K. T., Klein Gebbink, R., and Pannekoek, H. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 1021-1028). Heparin specifically enhances the rate of association between PAI-1 and thrombin about 2 orders of magnitude, whereas no effect is detected with other serine proteases (e.g. factor Xa). For the heparin-dependent serpins antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II, basic amino acid residues in and around the helix D subdomain were proposed to be involved in the binding of glycosaminoglycans. Here we employed site-directed mutagenesis of full-length PAI-1 cDNA to identify the amino acid residues that mediate heparin binding. To that end, 15 single-point mutants of PAI-1, each having individual arginyl, lysyl, or histidyl residues replaced by a neutral (alanyl) residue (ala-scan), and one double mutant were constructed, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified biologically active proteins were subjected to the following analyses: (i) heparin-dependent inhibition of thrombin; (ii) heparin-dependent formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with thrombin; and (iii) binding to and elution from heparin-Sepharose. Based on the data presented, we propose that the amino acid residues Lys65, Lys69, Arg76, Lys80, and Lys88 constitute major determinants for heparin binding of PAI-1. These residues are located in and around the helix D domain and are conserved in the other heparin-dependent thrombin inhibitors, antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II."
https://openalex.org/W1603223792,"In pancreatic acinar cells cholecystokinin and its analogs, caerulein and CCK-JMV-180, stimulate an increase in intracellular free [Ca2+] by releasing Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial intracellular pools. It is generally believed that the caerulein-induced release of Ca2+ is mediated by phospholipase C-catalyzed production of 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP3). In this study we have investigated the source and mechanism of Ca2+ release induced by CCK-JMV-180 using streptolysin O-permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells. Caerulein-stimulated release of Ca2+ was completely blocked by either neomycin, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, or by heparin, an IP3 receptor antagonist. These observations are compatible with the conclusion that caerulein releases Ca2+ from an IP3-sensitive pool. In contrast to caerulein, however, CCK-JMV-180-stimulated release of Ca2+ was not blocked by either neomycin or by heparin, indicating that CCK-JMV-180 releases Ca2+ by mechanisms which do not involve the generation or action of IP3. CCK-JMV-180 stimulated the release of Ca2+ even after the IP3-sensitive pool had been completely emptied by prior exposure to a supramaximally stimulating concentration of IP3 (40 microM). Prestimulation of permeabilized acini with 20 mM caffeine did not abolish the CCK-JMV-180-induced Ca2+ release. These results indicate that CCK-JMV-180 stimulates release of Ca2+ from a hitherto uncharacterized intracellular storage pool which is insensitive to either IP3 or caffeine."
https://openalex.org/W1583089063,"The stem cell factor (SCF) is a polypeptide ligand that is essential for the development of germ cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and melanocyte precursors. It binds to a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor that is encoded by the c-kit proto-oncogene. We have constructed an expression vector that directs the synthesis of the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Kit/SCF receptor. When expressed and amplified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a secreted 90-kDa glycoprotein could be harvested from the growth medium of the cells in a soluble form. This extracellular portion of the Kit/SCF receptor, denoted Kit-X, was recognized by antibodies specific to the SCF receptor; and when injected into animals, it raised antibodies that were reactive with the complete membrane form of the receptor. Direct binding and covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled SCF showed that Kit-X fully retained high affinity ligand binding and also underwent efficient dimerization in the presence of the ligand. The capacity of Kit-X to act as an antagonist of SCF was assayed on cultured cells that overexpress the receptor. Simultaneous addition of SCF and Kit-X to these cells resulted in a stoichiometric inhibition of SCF binding and a consequent decrease in autophosphorylation of the SCF receptor on tyrosine residues. The inhibition extended to later SCF-mediated responses, including the association of the receptor with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and coupling to the Raf1 protein kinase. These results indicate that the recombinant ectodomain of the Kit-SCF receptor can be used as a specific antagonist of SCF actions and may enable detailed molecular analysis of ligand-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1649767094,"Resting human peripheral blood T cells synthesize proteins at very low rates and contain very low levels of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 alpha mRNA. During mitogenic activation, the level of eIF-2 alpha mRNA increases at least 50-fold, an effect thought to be due primarily to intranuclear stabilization of the primary transcript (Cohen, R. B., Boal, T. R., and Safer, B. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 3831-3837). Analysis of sequences within the first intron revealed a region with homology to the initiator (Inr) sequence first described by Smale and Baltimore (Smale, S. T., and Baltimore, D. (1989) Cell 57, 103-113). This Inr element is positioned 450 bases downstream of the eIF-2 alpha promoter and is oriented to generate an overlapping antisense transcript. Deletion or mutation of the Inr element results in a reproducible 5-8-fold increase in the activity of an eIF-2 alpha promoter-driven CAT reporter gene and a corresponding 2.5-fold decrease in activity of an antisense driven luciferase reporter gene in vivo in 293 cells. In vitro transcription analysis also reveals antisense transcripts which depend on an intact Inr element and whose 5' ends map to sequences surrounding the Inr consensus sequence. A potential role for double-stranded RNA generated by these overlapping divergent transcription units in the regulation of eIF-2 alpha gene expression in T cells is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1587470144,"Peptide 1-21, generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of each of two highly purified components of human myelin basic protein, components 1 and 8, gave a series of peaks in the fast atom bombardment mass spectra with m/z 2299, 2327, 2355, 2383, and 2411, indicating additions of 42, 70, 98, 126, and 154 atomic mass units respectively with m/z 2327 and 2355 as the dominant species. The pentafluorobenzyl esters prepared from an acid hydrolysate analyzed by negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography mass spectrometry confirmed that C6, C8, and C10 fatty acids were present. These data demonstrated (i) that the N terminus of a myelin basic protein is not simply acetylated but contains C2, C4, C6, C8, and C10 fatty acids with C4 and C6 as the dominant species, (ii) the two components studied (C-1 and C-8) showed different relative amounts of C2 and C8 in particular, and (iii) human myelin basic protein is the first protein to be reported with a complex N terminus consisting of several alkyl carboxylic acid species."
https://openalex.org/W42682225,"The cDNA sequence of the flavoprotein subunit of bovine heart succinate dehydrogenase is reported. This is the first complete eukaryotic sequence of the flavoprotein subunit to be characterized, and it encodes a 665-amino acid protein that consists of a presequence and a 621-residue mature protein. The deduced bovine sequence shows homology to the corresponding peptides of prokaryotic succinate dehydrogenase and the related fumarate reductases; in particular, there is good overall homology (48%) to the flavoprotein subunit of Escherichia coli succinate dehydrogenase. The conserved sequences comprising the active site and those involved in FAD binding are also found in the bovine protein. The active site of the bovine polypeptide contains a cysteine that confers sensitivity of the enzyme to sulfhydryl reagents; this cysteine is only present in some sequences and thus provides a discriminatory biochemical marker. A putative flavoprotein subunit of human placental succinate dehydrogenase (partial sequence) that lacks this critical cysteine (Malcovati, M., Marchetti, T., Zanelli, T., and Tenchini, M. L. (1991) in Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990 (Curti, B., Ronchi, S., and Zanetti, G., eds) pp. 727-730, Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin) has only 16% homology to the bovine heart flavoprotein subunit. However, we show that the enzyme from human placenta is as sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide as that from bovine tissues. In addition, a transcript in human placenta and muscle hybridizes to the bovine heart flavoprotein cDNA and is the same size as that in bovine tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1581258387,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was studied in HT-29 human colonic carcinoma cells with the aim of assessing possible mechanisms of up-regulation of its expression. CFTR was identified and quantified in total cell extracts by Western immunoblots using a monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody and was functionally assessed by tracer Cl-efflux from intact cells. It was found that various stimuli that lead to a sustained (greater than or equal to 8 h) elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP elicited a marked and specific increase in CFTR expression in cell membranes and concomitant activation of Cl- secretion. Further activation of Cl- secretion was obtained by additional short term activation by cyclic AMP analogues or cyclic AMP-inducing agents. Blockers of transcription or translation largely depressed the cAMP-mediated induction of CFTR levels and associated function, indicating that the inductive phenomenon was at the transcriptional level. The results imply the involvement of putative cyclic AMP responsive (and related) elements that are present in the CFTR gene promoter and that are known to modulate eukaryotic gene expression. Activation of these elements by various stimuli might provide pharmacological tools for up-regulation of CFTR expression at both biochemical and physiological levels."

https://openalex.org/W1582195129,A molecular cDNA clone (KIN27) was isolated that encodes a novel variant of the catalytic subunit C alpha of the human cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Analysis of PKA genomic sequence data revealed that the KIN27 variant transcripts likely result from alternative splice-site selection of the C alpha gene transcripts. The KIN27 cDNA has therefore been designated C alpha 2. RNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction revealed that KIN27 C alpha 2 splice-site variant RNA and PKA C alpha RNA were both expressed in the amnion U and HeLa human cell lines. C alpha RNA was about 3- to 5-fold more abundant than C alpha 2 RNA. Interferon treatment decreased the steady-state amount of the C alpha 2 RNA relative to C alpha RNA. These results suggest that alternative splicing may contribute to the structural heterogeneity of C subunits expressed in human cells and that interferon may affect this process.
https://openalex.org/W1504973150,"We have developed a procedure to isolate the microtubule-associated protein 2c (MAP2c), a juvenile form of MAP2 occurring in mammalian brain. The shape, size, self-association, and antibody interactions of MAP2c were studied. Monomeric MAP2c is an elongated molecule with a length approximately 48 nm, considerably shorter than the higher molecular weight forms MAP2a or b of adult brain. Two monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes are near the N or C terminus, respectively, are located close to the opposite ends of the MAP2c rods. This places constraints on the types of internal folding of the molecule. MAP2c self-associates into dimers and fibrous aggregates. The dimers are predominantly antiparallel and nearly in register, as judged by antibody labeling."
https://openalex.org/W1488890356,"Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) has been implicated in mitogenic signal transduction downstream of oncogenic and receptor tyrosine kinases. Previous studies have suggested that GAP is phosphorylated by oncogenic viral Src (v-Src) and that GAP is associated with a complex containing normal cellular Src (c-Src) in vertebrate fibroblasts. To investigate molecular interactions between the Src kinases and GAP, we developed an in vitro system for reconstituting Src-GAP complexes. For this purpose, we constructed recombinant baculovirus vectors that direct expression of Rous sarcoma virus v-Src, chicken c-Src, and bovine GAP in infected Sf9 insect cells. In vitro reconstitution experiments using baculovirus-expressed proteins demonstrate that both v-Src and c-Src associate in complexes with GAP. In addition, in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation analyses indicate that GAP serves as a substrate for both the v-Src and c-Src tyrosine kinases. To determine which structural features of GAP are involved in interactions with the Src kinases, we constructed recombinant baculoviruses that encode deletion mutants of bovine GAP. Deletion of the GAP amino-terminal portion containing Src homology 2 regions, which are highly conserved structural motifs postulated to mediate interactions among proteins, diminishes GAP phosphorylation and association with Src. This reconstitution system should facilitate further studies of molecular interactions between the Src kinases and GAP."
https://openalex.org/W1482458371,"We have previously characterized the calcium response of cultured human fibroblasts (HSWP cells) to stimulation by the mitogen Lys-bradykinin (BK). We have reported a biphasic response which includes a rapid rise to a peak that appears to result from mobilization of internal calcium, and a plateau phase, which is due to influx of external calcium (Byron, K., Babnigg, G., Villereal, M. L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 108-118). In this paper we examine participation of L-type voltage operated calcium channels in the calcium entry phase of BK-stimulated HSWP cells. We show that there is an increase in 45Ca2+ uptake and an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) as measured by fura-2, when HSWP cells are stimulated with the L-channel agonist Bay K 8644 under depolarizing conditions. Furthermore, both of these effects are inhibited by low doses of the dihydropyridine antagonist nitrendipine. We also report that BK stimulation of 45Ca2+ uptake can be significantly inhibited by low doses of nitrendipine, while nitrendipine treatment has no effect on the BK-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, as measured by fura-2. These results suggest that under normal conditions the portion of the BK-stimulated Ca2+ influx which is mediated by a nitrendipine-sensitive entry pathway is invisible to the fura-2 technique used to measure [Ca2+]i. This suggest that the nitrendipine-sensitive influx pathway admits calcium preferentially into an intracellular store that is isolated from fura-2. This idea is supported by the observation that in media where calcium has been replaced by 2 mM Ba2+ nitrendipine inhibits most of the BK-stimulated Ba2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W21652043,"Sodium orthovanadate caused a 2-fold stimulation of system A transport activity in soleus muscle, as assessed by the uptake of the nonmetabolizable analog 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB). The effect of vanadate on system A was rapid, concentration-dependent and was characterized by an increased Vmax without modification of Km for MeAIB. Under these conditions, vanadate also activated 3-O-methylglucose uptake and lactate production. The effects of vanadate on muscle metabolism showed a complex interaction with the effects of insulin. Thus, the stimulatory effects of vanadate and insulin on MeAIB and 3-O-methylglucose uptake were not additive; however, the effects of insulin and vanadate on lactate production were additive. In spite of the lack of additivity, insulin- and vanadate-induced stimulation of system A differed in their sensitivity to gramicidin D, being the vanadate effect more susceptible to inhibition by gramicidin D than the insulin effect. System A transport activity shows a dependence on pH, and recent results suggest the presence of critical histidine residues on the A carrier that may be responsible for its pH dependence (Bertran, J., Roca, A., Pola, E., Testar, X., Zorzano, A. & Palacin, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 798-802). In this regard, a rise in extracellular pH led to a substantial activation of system A. Furthermore, lowering of muscle intracellular pH induced by ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), a specific inhibitor of sodium/proton exchange activity, led to inhibition of system A. This suggests that critical histidine residues are present in an intracellular localization on the A carrier. Furthermore, the rate of muscle glycolysis was also altered in response to a rise in extracellular pH or to EIPA treatment. Regarding the mechanisms involved in vanadate action, vanadate treatment in the incubated soleus muscle did not cause any significant stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity after partial purification of muscle insulin receptors. On the other hand, vanadate but not insulin caused a substantial increase in muscle intracellular pH as assessed by 5,5'-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione equilibrium. This effect of vanadate on intracellular pH was not due to activation of the sodium/proton exchanger, since it was not blocked by EIPA. Based on these findings, we suggest that alkalinization of muscle intracellular pH might mediate the effects of vanadate on system A and on glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1529055053,"Abstract We have compared the activities of mouse alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) enhancers I, II, and III with their minimal enhancer fragments (Mers) I, II, and III and with the entire 7-kilobase pair enhancer domain by transient expression assay in primary fetal mouse liver cells. The level of expression directed by the AFP promoter [p(-1009)AFPcat] alone is stimulated at least 10-fold by the entire AFP enhancer domain (-1009 to -6983). Enhancer I can drive the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity equivalent to that of the entire enhancer domain, whereas the increase in activity by enhancers II and III is significantly lower (1.5-fold). MersI, II, and III all mediate a greater increase in activity than their corresponding enhancer regions. The increase with MerI is 16-fold. Using DNase I protection analyses we identified 3 protein-binding regions in MerI; site Ia binds liver and brain nuclear proteins; site Ib binds liver, kidney, and brain nuclear proteins as well as purified C/EBP; site Ic binds liver and kidney nuclear proteins. Site-specific mutation of Ia, Ib, or Ic showed a 10-25% reduction in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression; deletion of the C/EBP-binding site in Ib showed a 45% reduction in activity and mutation of all 3 sites (Ia, Ib, and Ic) resulted in a 75% reduction in activity. Our studies indicate no single trans-acting factor is absolutely essential for enhancer activity, and that the enhancer activity of MerI is mediated via a combinatorial and additive mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1542747143,"Previous work has shown that a mammary-derived growth factor (MDGF1), a human milk-derived, acidic, 62-kDa, N-glycosylated growth factor binds to cell surface receptors and stimulates proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. An 18-amino acid N-terminal partial sequence of the factor did not show any homology to other known growth factors or proteins. Using polyclonal antiserum raised against the synthetic peptide, we demonstrated that conditioned medium prepared from human breast cancer cell lines contains the factor. The antibody could adsorb the biological activity of the factor present in the conditioned medium. Earlier experiments on receptor cross-linking indicated that the receptor was approximately 120-140 kDa. Since tyrosine phosphorylation plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and cell transformation, experiments were conducted to find out whether MDGF1 induces the appearance of phosphotyrosine in MDGF1-receptor-positive MDA-MB 468, MCF-7, and 184A1N4 cell lines compared to receptor-negative lines. Western blot analysis using monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine indicated that MDGF1 induces phosphotyrosine in a 180-185-kDa protein in MDGF1 receptor-positive cell lines. Phosphorylation was not blocked and phosphorylated proteins were not immunoprecipitated by an antibody directed against the binding site of the EGF receptor. Cell membrane fractionation demonstrated that phosphorylation induced by MDGF1 was membrane-associated. The nature of this 180-185-kDa protein and its possible relationship to the MDGF1 receptor are under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1603375288,"Cleavage of oligopeptide substrates mimicking the maturation sites in the Gag polyproteins of the mouse mammary tumor virus was assayed using lysed virus. Cleavage at the expected P1-P1' positions was detected in four of seven synthetic peptides. However, studies with specific inhibitors of retroviral proteases showed that only two of them could be unequivocally attributed to the viral enzyme. In an attempt to characterize other proteolytic activities that copurify with the virus, we isolated a multicatalytic high molecular mass protease (700 kDa) that copurifies with the virus. This protein has been identified as an alpha 2-macroglobulin-protein complex according to its biochemical properties and ultrastructure. The proteases forming these complexes are mainly serine proteases and can be inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. However, other compounds such as chymostatin and elastatinal are more effective inhibitors. The relative efficacy of each compound depends on the substrate, since the complexes described herein appear to be multicatalytic. Elastatinal is a very good inhibitor of the cleavages found at Ala-Ala bonds in peptides representing the capsid/nucleocapsid site, while chymostatin inhibits certain cleavages at the carboxyl terminus of bonds involving leucine and valine in three of the substrates used. Therefore, the alpha 2-macroglobulin present in the cell culture medium is able to bind proteases, forming high molecular weight complexes, which are active against peptide substrates, copurify with the virus and are responsible for the nonviral proteolytic activities found in the purified virus. Elastase appears to be the main proteolytic activity which can be detected in the alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes associated with the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2120924866,"We have previously expressed the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) reverse transcriptase (RTase) gene, the ORFV gene, in yeast in an active form (RTase-Y). An activity gel analysis revealed that the molecular size of RTase-Y as well as an RTase associated with the CaMV particles (RTase-V) is 60 kDa. This size is about 18 kDa smaller than that of the inactive form previously expressed in Escherichia coli (RTase-E) (78 kDa), which corresponds to the coding capacity estimated for the ORFV gene. To investigate the possible involvement of proteolytic processing in the de novo synthesis of CaMV RTase, we constructed a series of deletions from either terminus or both termini of the ORFV coding sequence and expressed them in E. coli. Among the various truncated RTases, those (denoted delta N) that lack N-terminal peptide fragments 143-185 amino acids long were active on the synthetic RNA template-primer, poly(rC)-oligo(dG). Those RTases (denoted delta C) lacking C-terminal peptide fragments 50-102 amino acids long and those lacking both termini (denoted delta NC) were also active on this template. However, only the delta N RTases showed enzyme properties indistinguishable from the RTase-Y in that they transcribed natural RNA into DNA and required either Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity. The length of the deletion corresponded approximately to the difference of the molecular weights between RTase-Y and RTase-E. These results suggest that CaMV RTase is translated in an inactive precursor form and then converted to an active form by proteolytic processing during de novo synthesis. We have also demonstrated that C-terminal deletions cause a loss of activity on a natural RNA template accompanied by an alteration in metal ion requirement. The inability to incorporate dTTP accounts for the loss of activity on the natural RNA template. However, the affinities for dTTP and the corresponding template, poly(rA)-oligo(dT), were found to be unaltered."
