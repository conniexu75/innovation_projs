https://openalex.org/W1506421347,"Purified hepatic cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats was used to produce antibody in rabbits. The cytochrome P-448 antibody (IgG fraction) isolated from immune rabbit serum is quite specific and precipitates purified rat liver cytochrome P-448 at low antibody to protein ratios when assayed by the Ouchterlony double diffusion technique. Purified hepatic cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats cross-reacts poorly with the cytochrome P-448 antibody as do purified rabbit hepatic cytochrome P-448 and P-450. No cross-reaction is observed with purified cytochrome P-450 from beef adrenal mitochondria or from Pseudomonas putida in Ouchterlony double diffusion experiments. The cytochrome P-448 antibody produces a single distinct precipitin band with purified rat cytochrome P-448. In contrast, purified liver cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats gives three precipitin bands, all of which contain hemeprotein as judged by benzidine staining. At least two of the three precipitin bands are immunochemically different from the precipitin band formed with cytochrome P-448. When added to the reconstituted system, the cytochrome P-448 antibody inhibits purified rat cytochrome P-448- and P-450-supported N-demethylation of benzphetamine, O-deethylation of ethoxycoumarin, hydroxylation of benzo[a]pyrene, and the hydroxylation of testosterone at the 6beta, 7alpha, and 16alpha positions. Antibody inhibits cytochrome P-448-supported metabolism more than cytochrome P-450-supported metabolism except for benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation at low antibody to hemeprotein ratios. In addition, the pattern and extent of inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 system depends on the substrate used, suggesting that multiple forms of the hemeprotein are present in the purified preparation from phenobarbital-treated rats. The observed patterns of immunoprecipitation and inhibition of catalytic activity indicate that (a) cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats is immunochemically different from cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-treated rats, and (b) there appear to be at least three hemeprotein forms in the purified cytochrome P-450 preparation from phenobarbital-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W1513688351,"Administration of estrogen to roosters induces the synthesis of egg yolk phosphoproteins in the liver. We have demonstrated that these proteins are synthesized in the form of a large precursor, vitellogenin, and that vitellogenin is the only phosphoprotein found in the plasma of the estrogen-treated rooster. Vitellogenin is cleaved to form the egg yolk phosphoproteins, lipovitellin, and phosvitin. We have purified vitellogenin to hemogeneity by two methods: chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-52-cellulose and affinity chromatography on an antibody-Sepharose column. Antibodies were elicited in rabbits and sheep by immunization with vitellogenin and lipovitellin, and these antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on antigen-Sepharose columns. We found that phosvitin was not immunogenic in its native form or in any of the large variety of modified forms we have tested. We have determined the molecular weights of native and denatured vitellogenin and have examined the immunological relationship between vitellogenin and lipovitellin. On the basis of these studies, together with data from phosphate analyses, we suggest that avian vitellogenin is composed of two polypeptides, each of which has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000 and contains within it lipovitellin and two phosvitins."
https://openalex.org/W1565920658,"An activator stimulating the enzymic hydrolysis of sphingoglycolipids has been purified from human liver. The purity of the activator, as examined by disc gel electrophoresis, showed one major band stained with both amido black and periodate-Schiff reagent. Chemical analyses identify the activator as a glycoprotein. The physical properties of the activator are: heat-stable, nondialyzable; molecular weight, about 21,000; isoelectric point (pI), 4.1. The purified activator stimulates the hydrolysis of GM1 by beta-galactosidase, GM2 by beta-hexosaminidase, as well as ceramide trihexoside by alpha-galactosidase A or B. The hydrolysis by glycosidases depends upon the amount of activator added. An antibody against the activator was developed from rabbits. The specificity of the antibody to the activator has been established. The antibody was used to make the affinity column for isolation of the activator. It was also used to develop a sensitive immunodiffusion method to detect the activator."

https://openalex.org/W1503223519,"Platelet factor 4 is a low molecular weight protein contained in the storage granules of platelets and released during aggregation with a variety of aggregating agents. In vitro, it is a potent antiheparin. This property has been used for a rapid, simple purification procedure using affinity chromatography on heparin epsilon-aminocaproic aced Sepharose. Supernatants collected from outdated platelet concentrates, or platelet extracts prepared from washed, outdate platlets themselves, are first precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. The supernatant is dialyzed and applied to the affinity column. Contaminating proteins are washed from the column with 0.5 M NaCl in 0.005 M sodium barbital buffer, pH 7.4 and the column is then eluted with a gradient of 0.5 to 3.0 M NaCl in 0.005 M sodium barbital buffer, pH 7.4. When prepared from platelet extracts, a single protein peak with high platelet factor 4 activity is eluted at 0.9 to 1.0 M NaCl. The peak fractions demonstrate a single band on Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight as determined by Na dodecyl-SO4 gel electrophoresis was 11,600 +/- 330, and was 40,000 by gel filtration."

https://openalex.org/W1535486603,"Essentially glycogen-free, fully converted rabbit muscle glycogen synthase I and D forms were purified to a specific activity of 30 approximately 35 units/mg, higher than that previously reported. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the synthase I and D forms in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed two species with molecular weights of 85,000 and 81,000 (I form) and one species with molecular weight of 85,000 (D form), respectively. The 81,000 subunit of the synthase I form is a product of proteolysis, since its proportion decreased when the enzyme was purified in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Two-dimensional chromatography and high voltage electrophoretic maps of the peptides produced by exhaustive tryptic digestion of synthase I and D forms gave 78 and 85 peptides, respectively. These values agreed with the expected theoretical number of peptides assuming that the molecular weight of the enzyme subunit is 85,000 based on the analytical data of arginine and lysine content. Pro-Leu- was found as the NH2-terminal dipeptide sequence of synthase D form by the dansyl Edman method. The automated sequential degradation of synthase I form by the method of Edman provided the following NH2-terminal octapeptide sequence: Pro-Leu-Ser-Ser-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-. The molecular weight of the subunit was also determined to be 80,000 approximately 90,000 by the quantitative analysis of phenylthiohydantoinproline. The purified synthase I and D forms each show two protein bands on gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, which were also found to be enzymatically active by employing an activity stain directly on the gels. The molecular species of the I and D forms have molecular weights of 155,000 and 340,000 (I form), and 278,000 and 350,000 (D form), respectively, as measured by gel electrophoresis. Thus, the native synthase I and D forms as visualized on gels under these conditions consist of dimer and tetramer, and trimer and tetramer, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1587682317,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) of the male mouse submaxillary gland are found in association with arginine esteropeptidases. These enzymes, the gamma subunits of 7 S NGF and the EGF-binding protein, respectively, have similar molecular weights, amino acid compositions, and substrate specificities (Greene, L. A., Shooter, E. M., and Varon, S. (1969) Biochemistry 8, 3735-3741; Taylor, J.M., Mitchell, W. M., and Cohen, S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 21-8-2194). Although on the basis of molecular weight, the EGF-binding protein has a peptide chain composition similar to that of the gamma3 subunit, it does not have the same isoelectric point nor electrophoretic properties as the subunit. In urea, its isoelectric point differs from those of the gamma1, gamma2, and gamma3 subunits. The EGF-binding protein has antigenic determinants not shared by the gamma subunits and vice versa. It also fails to replace the gamma subunits in the formation of 7 S NGF points to the specificity of this complex and supports the hypothesis that the nerve and epidermal growth factors are generated from larger precursors by the proteolytic action of their respective arginine esteropeptidases."

https://openalex.org/W1585683443,"DNA polymerase III from Bacillus subtilis has been purified about 4,500-fold. Disc gel electrophoresis of the purified fraction reveals a single major protein band which co-migrates with the polymerase activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the polymerase yields a single, 166,000 dalton band. The hydrodynamic properties of the enzyme are ionic strength-dependent. The average values from determinations in high and low salt are 7.6 S for the sedimentation coefficient and 52 A for the Stokes radius. These two parameters indicate a molecular weight for the native enzyme of 160,000. Therefore, the enzyme appears to contain a single, long, polypeptide chain. The enzyme has no endonuclease activity but does have single strand specific exonuclease activity. Hydrolysis is initiated exclusively from the 3' terminus yielding 5' mononucleotides, and a dinucleotide is the limit of digestion. The exonuclease activity has an ionic strength dependence of pH optimum similar to that of the polymerase but appears to be more fastidious in its divalent metal requirement. The mode of attack by the enzyme is strictly distributive. The activity of the exonuclease decreases markedly with increasing substrate size. Two opposing mechanisms account quantitatively for this effect--intrinsic competitive inhibition by interior substrate nucleotides and increasing accessibility of the substrate terminus to the enzyme with increasing chain length. The polymerase synthesizes DNA in the 5' leads to 3' direction and the apparent Km for each of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates is about 1 muM. The polymerase replicates RNA-primed, phiX174 DNA in the presence of Escherichia coli elongation Factors I and II. In contrast to polymerase III, B. subtilis DNA polymerase II has no detectable nuclease activity."

https://openalex.org/W1622365970,"Of the 28 expected tryptic peptides from Bacillus subtilis 168 flagellin, 24 were isolated and sequenced. Several overlapping tryptic peptides were also characterized. Studies were also performed on two peptides of 142 and 162 residues isolated after cleavage of the flagellin molecule at the single tyrosine residue (residue 142) with N-bromosuccinimide. These studies together with the previous data on the cyanogen bromide peptides and the tryptic peptides from maleylated flagellin permitted the complete amino acid sequence to be established: (see article). The primary structure reveals no obvious regularities or major repetitions of homologous sequences. Hydrophobic residues are distributed randomly in the amino acid sequence. However, the distribution of charged residues is strikingly asymmetric. The NH2-terminal region (residues 1 to 101) possesses a net charge of 6 plus, the middle of the molecule (residues 102 to 203), a net charge of 9 minus, and the COOH terminal region (residues 204 to 304), a net charge of 4 minus."

https://openalex.org/W1593636034,"A soil organism, isolated by enrichment culture on unbranched alpha1 leads to 6-mannan backbone from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, secretes and endo-alpha1 leads to 6-mannanase. We have purified this mannanase to homogeneity and find it to consist of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of about 131,000. The enzyme is unusually heat-stable and appears to be highly extended in shape, possessing very little alpha helicity but with a high proportion of beta structure. The mannanase acts on unbranched alpha1 leads to 6-mannan to produce mannose and alpha1 leads to 6-mannobiose, with the intermediate formation of alpha1 leads to 6-mannooligosaccharides of various sizes. Calcium ion is required for full activity. The smallest substrate is the alpha1 leads to 6-mannotriose, whereas the reduced mannotriose is an inhibitor. The combining site appears to encompass 6 to 8 mannose units."

https://openalex.org/W1546704084,"A low molecular weight protein found in the soluble extract of bovine adrenal medulla, and having a high affinity for calcium ions has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification requires three steps, including ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The protein was homogeneous by the criteria of both standard and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity analysis, and NH2-terminal analysis. The calcium-binding protein is very acidic and has an isoelectric point of 4.27. Aspartic and glutamic acid together account for 30% of the total amino acid composition. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum reveals a A280/A260 ratio of 0.83 and shows discrete maxima at 258, 264, 269, 278, and 284 nm. Two moles of calcium are bound per mole of protein. The apparent Kp is approximately 20 muM. The molecular weight was found to be 16,000 +/- 1,000 by both sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The protein was found to consist of a single polypeptide chain by the criteria of tryptic peptide mapping and NH2-terminal analysis. Amino acid analysis revealed the absence of tryptophan, single residues of cysteine and histidine, and 2 residues of tyrosine. The protein was void of carbohydrate and phosphate. The structural similarities and possible functional correlation between adrenal medulla calcium-binding protein and troponin-C from muscle tissue are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1572438202,"A new form of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase termed enzyme III has been purified from sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis. In addition to the subunits of core RNA polymerase (beta', beta, alpha, and omega), enzyme III contains sporulation-specific polypeptides of 85,000 (P85) and 27,000 (P27) daltons. P85 corresponds to an RNA polymerase-binding protein previously identified by precipitation of RNA polymerase from crude extracts of sporulating cells with antibody directed against core enzyme. Both P85 and P27 co-purified with RNA polymerase highly purified by gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. Enzyme III bound more tightly to phosphocellulose and sedimented more rapidly during zone centrifugation than did RNA polymerase lacking the sporulation polypeptides. RNA polymerase containing P85 and P27 transcribed B. subtilis DNA about 4.5 times more actively than did core RNA polymerase, although both enzymes exhibited similar activities with poly(dA-dT) and phage phie DNA as templates. Enzyme III and core RNA polymerase also differed in their response to increasing concentrations of Mg2+ and KCl."
https://openalex.org/W1534015211,"Limited tryptic digestion of either synthase I or D forms resulted in the appearance of a new glucose 6-phosphate-dependent form which was composed of 75,000 molecular weight subunits. Early in tryptic digestion, an intermediate 78,000 subunit was also observed with both forms of the enzyme. The NH2-terminal dipeptide sequence of the 75,000 subunit of both forms was the same as that of the original 85,000 subunit (Pro-Leu-) indicating degradation at or near the COOH-terminal end without affecting the NH2-terminal end. Studies interrelating loss of organic phosphate, increase in glucose 6-phosphate dependency, and retention of the NH2-terminal sequence during limited tryptic digestion suggest that there are phosphorylation sites at or near the COOH-terminal, as well as sites within the core of the subunit, which are of importance in the synthase I to D form interconversion reaction via phosphorylation. The pathway of limited tryptic proteolysis of either synthase I or D forms was the same as judged by the molecular weights of the subunit intermediates: 85,000 leads to 78,000 leads to 75,000. A Ca2+-stimulated proteinase activity was also detected in some highly purified preparations of the synthase D form, which led to the appearance of subunits of molecular weight 78,000 and 75,000 together with phosphopeptide(s). These findings suggest that the pathway of proteolysis of the Ca2+-stimulated proteinase is similar to that of trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1670087559,"Ternary complexes of thymidylate synthetase (Form II and Form III), which are composed of the enzyme, 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate, and the natural isomer of methylenetetrahydrofolate, were generated by titrating thymidylate synthetase (Form I) in the presence of 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate with either the enzymatically prepared natural isomer or the chemically prepared racemic mixture of the diastereomers of methylenetetrahydrofolate. Such titrations were monitored by absorption, circular dichroic and fluorescence spectroscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results of these investigations suggest that the natural isomer of methylenetetrahydrofolate is primarily involved in the formation of stable ternary complexes with thymidylate synthetase and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate but that the unnatural isomer of methylenetetrahydrofolate, when present in solution, may compete with the natural isomer by forming relatively weak complexes with the enzyme and the 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate."

https://openalex.org/W201672746,"A rapid method is described for the purification of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.12) from human red blood cells by the use of DEAE-cellulose and two steps of affinity chromatography on a uridine-aminohexyl agarose column. The enzyme consists of two identical subunits of 31,000 molecular weight as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Chromatography on Sephadex G-200 chromatography gave a molecular weight of 69,000 for the native enzyme, it being eluted from the column with bovine serum albumin. Cross-linking of the enzyme with dimethylsuberimidate followed by analysis of the products by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis caused the near-disappearance of the 31,000 molecular weight subunit and the appearance of a protein with a molecular weight of about 65,000 without the appearance of higher polymers."
https://openalex.org/W160024026,"Abstract adenosine, adenosine,Transport-competent plasma membrane vesicles isolated from a subline of L929 cells (L929se-) grown in serum-free, defined medium accumulate ribose-1-P when exposed to adensoine, inosine, guanosine, or uridine. This observation suggests the action of one or more nucleoside phosphorylases acting prior to, during, or subsequent to the transport event. Extravesicular ribose-1-P neither inhibits uptake nor exchanges with intravesicular ribose-1-P, indicating that the action of the phosphorylase is not prior to uptake. Preloading the vesicles with inosine prior to subjecting the vesicles to conditions under which further uptake could not take place (in the presence of caffeine) did not result in an alteration of the ribose-1-P to inosine ratio within the vesicles. This observation was interpreted as evidence that only exogenously derived, not intravesicular inosine, is the substrate for the nucleoside phosphorylase. This datum, when taken with the fact that hypoxanthine is never found to be a significant extent within the vesicles, suggests that the phosphorolytic cleavage of inosine occurs as a group translocation during the transport itself, so that hypoxanthine is released to the surrounding medium while the ribose-1-P accumulates intravesicularly. Thus, phosphorolysis would seem to occur during passage across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1980399284,"GENETIC analysis has been used successfully for identifying the elements responsible for biological processes1,2, and understanding the logic of their interactions. This approach has, however, been little used in the study of morphogenesis in multicellular organisms, chiefly because of a dearth of viable mutants and the difficulties of interpreting the altered primary gene function from the mutant phenotype. The existence of pleiotropy in particular makes this analysis difficult3,4. An alternative approach would be to study the effect of mutations on individual cell behaviour5. This approach depends on the well founded assumption that normal morphogenesis results from the ordered integration of discrete cell autonomous functions. This can be done in Drosophila in genetic mosaics, where the heterozygous, phenotypically wild-type individual is a carrier of clones of homozygous mutant cells. This approach has the advantage that morphogenetic mutants, even if they are lethal to the individual, can be detected, studied and interpreted directly at the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2046526022,"The hydration rate of CO2 catalyzed by human red cell carbonic anhydrase B is 92 percent reduced by the normal concentrations of chloride and bicarbonate in red cells. This reflects a general sensitivity of this reaction to halides and other anions, up to 87 times greater than the effect on red cell carbonic anhydrase C. The catalytic hydration of CO2 is generally more (up to 24 times) sensitive to inhibition by anions and sulfonamides than the dehydration of HCO3-, probably reflecting different mechanisms. The sensitivity of enzyme B to anion inhibition also depends upon the substrate, being much greater for CO2 than for certain esters. On the basis of the very low catalytic activity of B for CO2 in the presence of physiological concentration of chloride, and the fact that carbonic anhydrase C is effective for CO2 hydration (in the presence of chloride) at a rate 340 times greater than that of CO2 output from tissues, it appears that the biological role of enzyme B is not that of a carbonic anhydrase."

The changes observed, including absence of alpha-lipoprotein and the presence of lipoproteins rich in phospholipid and unesterified cholesterol but deficient in cholesteryl esters, are remarkably similar to changes found in human pathologic states of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency. When examined by electron microscopy, all of the major lipoprotein classes isolated by ultracentrifugation showed morphological abnormalities including the formation of rouleaus consisting of disk-shaped particles."

https://openalex.org/W1540560484,"A23187 (0.2 TO 1.0 Nmol/mg of cell protein) stimulates the transport of 3-O-methylglucose by rat thymocytes more than 2-fold within 10 min in the presence of 1.9 mM Ca2+. Under these conditions, Ca2+ uptake by the cells increases 3- to 10-fold. The ionophore is less effective at lower Ca2+ concentrations and it has no effect on 3-O-methylglucose uptake when ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetate (EGTA) is present in excess over Ca2+. Excess EGTA does not reduce the elevated rates of 3-O-methylglucose transport in cells already stimulated with A23187 on 3-O-methylglucose transport is completely blocked by inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. The results suggest that elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations activate some ATP-dependent mechanism that modifies the glucose transport system in a manner that is not readily reversible."

However, the antiserum contains some antibodies which react only with the species derived from HbS. These -specific antibodies were isolated by absorption of the serum on a column of betaA(1-55) coupled covalently to Sepharose. The S-specific antibodies have markedly diminished reaction with betaA(1-55) and HbA. The S specificity was localized to the valine substitution at position 6 of the beta globin, as shown by inhibition of the binding of the radiolabeled fragment to S-specific antibodies by the synthetic peptide betaS(1-13).

Only the subunit polypeptide derived from the gamma chain in either Fragment E contained carbohydrate. The two Fragment E species had identical sedimentation coefficients and identical molecular weights by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The amino acid compositions were indistinguishable.
