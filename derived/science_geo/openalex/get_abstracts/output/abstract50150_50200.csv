https://openalex.org/W2011917769,"We have used the random chromosomal integration sites of retrovirus vectors as unique clonal markers to analyze cell lineage relationships within the hemopoietic stem cell hierarchy. Using a high efficiency protocol for retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, anemic W/Wv mutant mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells infected with a NEO vector. Analysis of the DNA from bone marrow, thymus, and spleen of these reconstituted W/Wv mice indicated insertion of the vector into primitive pluripotent stem cells capable of producing both myeloid and lymphoid progeny as well as into more committed stem cells apparently restricted to either the myeloid or lymphoid lineages. The neo gene was also expressed in these mice, as they contained a variety of G418 resistant in vitro colony-forming cells. These results demonstrate high-efficiency gene transfer and expression in primitive hemopoietic stem cells and provide a direct approach for analyzing the hemopoietic stem cell hierarchy."

https://openalex.org/W2070820417,"The binding of dioxygen and carbon monoxide to heme proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin has been studied with flash photolysis. At temperatures below 200 K, binding occurs from within the heme pocket and, contrary to expectation, with nearly equal rates for both ligands. This observation has led to a reexamination of the theory of the association reaction taking into account friction, protein structure, and the nature of electronic transitions. The rate coefficients for the limiting cases of large and small friction are found with simple arguments that use characteristic lengths and times. The arguments indicate how transition state theory as well as calculations based on nonadiabatic perturbation theory, which is called the Golden Rule, may fail. For ligand-binding reactions the data suggest the existence of intermediate states not directly observed so far. The general considerations may also apply to other biomolecular processes such as electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W2159425270,"The rat optic nerve contains three types of macroglial cells: type 1 astrocytes first appear at embryonic day 16 (E16), oligodendrocytes at birth (E21), and type 2 astrocytes between postnatal days 7 and 10. The oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes develop from a common, bipotential O-2A progenitor cell. We show here that although O-2A progenitor cells in E17 optic nerve prematurely stop dividing and differentiate into oligodendrocytes within 2 days in culture, when cultured on a monolayer of type 1 astrocytes, they continue to proliferate; moreover, the first cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes after 4 days in vitro, which is equivalent to the time that oligodendrocytes first appear in vivo. Our findings suggest that the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation depends on an intrinsic clock in the O-2A progenitor cell that counts cell divisions that are driven by a growth factor (or factors) produced by type 1 astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1517564457,"Purified human colonic mucin was separated into six distinct components by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and the structures of oligosaccharide side chains from the three most abundant species were determined. Oligosaccharide side chains were isolated from colonic mucin species III, IV, and V after alkaline borohydride reductive cleavage in the presence of sodium borotritide. After initial separation of acidic and neutral oligosaccharides by ion exchange chromatography, individual oligosaccharides were isolated by sequential chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4 and Bio-Gel P-2 resins followed by preparative normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. Composition and structure of individual oligosaccharides were determined by combination of gas chromatography, methylation analysis, and sequential glycosidase digestion. Collectively, 21 discrete oligosaccharide structures were identified in the major human colonic mucin species including 10 acidic oligosaccharides and 11 neutral structures which ranged in size from 2 to 12 sugar residues. Although detailed structures were defined for each oligosaccharide, the majority of the structures identified were variations of a relatively small number of basic structures, and several generalizations pertained. First, many oligosaccharides represented variations of a biantennary structure in which branch chains arise in N-acetylglucosaminyl residues linked to C3 and C6 of a galactosyl residue linked in turn to a GlcNAc beta (1-3)GalNAc core; second, non-branched oligosaccharides appeared to be linear chain derivatives of the same core structure; third, all acidic oligosaccharides could be derived from neutral structures present in the mucin species; fourth, sialic acid substitution was limited to few sites and always included substitution in alpha 2-6 linkage to the reducing terminal N-acetylgalactosamine, and finally several structures contained both sialic acid and fucose residues. Individually, mucin species III, IV, and V were found to contain unique mixtures of 13, 14, and 10 oligosaccharide structures, respectively. These data demonstrate that human colonic mucin contain a wide range of oligosaccharides reflecting variations of common core oligosaccharide structures. The major chromatographically defined constituents of normal colonic mucin appear to possess characteristic and distinguishable combinations of oligosaccharide structures. These findings support the concept that colonic mucin contains structurally and functionally distinct subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2061885228,"The hypoglossal motor neurons that innervate the vocal organ (syrinx) of the male zebra finch show a selective, long-latency (50-millisecond) response to sound. This response is eliminated by lesions to forebrain song-control nuclei. Different song syllables elicit a response from different syringeal motor neurons. Conspecific vocalizations may therefore be perceived as members of a set of vocal gestures and thus distinct from other environmental sounds. This hypothesis is an avian parallel to the motor theory of speech perception in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1986936966,"The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major are transmitted by insect vectors to their mammalian hosts. The temperature difference between the hosts (25 degrees and 37 degrees C) may induce a heat shock response in the parasite. Transcripts of heat shock genes (homologous to Hsp70 and Hsp83) were 25 to 100 times more abundant in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms (trypomastigotes) than in insect (procyclic) stages. In Leishmania major the patterns of heat shock gene expression in promastigotes (insect-adapted) and amastigotes (mammal-adapted) were different. A temperature shift in vitro induced differentiation of Leishmania major from promastigotes to amastigotes. Therefore, heat shock genes may be responsible for differentiation of these vector-borne parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2086155704,"Fibroblasts possess several distinct mechanisms that control cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix macromolecules. Monoclonal antibodies to a 140-kilodalton (kD) cell surface glycoprotein inhibited the adhesion of fibroblastic Chinese hamster ovary cells to fibronectin-coated substrata but did not inhibit adhesion to substrata coated with vitronectin, laminin, serum, or other adhesive macromolecules. Thus the 140-kD glycoprotein appears to be involved in the fibronectin-mediated adhesion mechanism but not in other adhesion processes."

https://openalex.org/W2069600152,Histone-depleted chromosomes have revealed a scaffold and loop architecture of metaphase chromosomes. In its simplest form this arrangement contradicts many classical observations suggesting chromosomes have a helical substructure. We have obtained preparations that allow the visualization of several levels of chromosome structure. These images suggest that metaphase packing is achieved by the compaction through helical coiling of a 200-300 nm fiber that is in turn composed of radial loops. These observations imply that any scaffold elements associated with radial loops are not distributed as previously proposed but must follow a complex and more extensive path within the metaphase chromatid.
https://openalex.org/W2072630058,"Brain dopamine is necessary for normal movement. To determine whether there is a precise relation between the intensity of movement and changes in brain dopamine metabolism, the investigators ran rats on straight and circular treadmills at different speeds and with different body postures. Concentrations of dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid increased in the caudate and accumbens nuclei in direct relation to the speed and angular posture of the animals. Dopamine metabolism in the nucleus accumbens was more strongly linked to the speed and direction of movement, while in the caudate nucleus dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were affected most by posture and direction."
https://openalex.org/W2044769864,"Frequency distributions of parasitic helminths within human communities are invariably highly aggregated, the majority of worms occurring in relatively small fractions of the host populations. It has been suggested that the heavily infected individuals are predisposed to this state, not by chance, but by as yet undefined genetic, ecological, behavioral, or social factors. Analyses of individual post-treatment patterns of hookworm reinfection among 112 villagers in an endemic area of West Bengal provide quantitative evidence of predisposition to heavy infection. This observation has implications for the design of control programs based on chemotherapy because of the potential economic advantage of selective or targeted treatment as opposed to mass or blanket treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2001667631,"Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection of man which is widespread in tropical countries, and which so far has resisted attempts at control. We have been approaching the problem from an immunological angle. We have previously reported the production of a rat monoclonal IgG2a antibody against Schistosoma mansoni which exhibits marked cytoxicity for schistosomula in the presence of eosinophils and a high degree of protection by passive transfer in naive rats. This antibody, IPLSm1, was shown to bind specifically to a schistosomulum membrane target antigen defined as a glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 38,000 (38K), which is strongly immunogenic in schistosome infection of various animal species including man. Although theoretically the 38K protein represents an excellent candidate for a potential vaccine against schistosomiasis, the glycanic nature of the epitope recognized by IPLSm1 limits its production by DNA recombinant technology. It was, moreover, shown that, together with protective antibodies, the 38K molecule was able to induce the production of blocking IgG2c antibodies that inhibit the functional properties of IPLSm1 both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, following Jerne's network theory, we considered an alternative approach, the possibility of immunization using anti-idiotype antibodies. In the present study, rat monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies were produced against IPLSm1 (AB1). Anti-idiotype antibodies (AB2) were selected by their capacity to inhibit the binding of radioiodinated AB1 to its 38K target antigen. Sera from naive LOU rats immunized with a purified AB2 preparation contained specific anti-schistosome antibodies (AB3) which bound to 38K. AB3 antibodies were strongly cytotoxic for schistosomula in the presence of rat eosinophils and conferred highly significant protection by passive transfer. Most importantly, rats immunized with AB2 demonstrated marked protection (50-80%) to a challenge infection."
https://openalex.org/W1496224999,"Intact alveolar macrophages were found to acylate alkyl- and acyllysophospholipids with a high selectivity for arachidonate. A specific mechanism appears responsible for the incorporation of arachidonate into lysophospholipids in intact cells since the kinetic pattern for the formation of the 20:4 species was different from all other species. This specificity was investigated in more detail by examining the enzymatic acylation of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by macrophage membranes; in the absence of CoA, ATP, and Mg2+, this lysophospholipid was acylated with a high preference for arachidonate that was independent of added free fatty acids. The addition of CoA alone increased the rate of acylation of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, mainly due to an increase in the formation of species other than those containing arachidonate. When CoA, ATP, and Mg2+ were present, the macrophage membranes catalyzed the acylation of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine without preference for arachidonate. A different apparent Km and Vmax was observed for reactions involving each cofactor condition. We conclude that the acylation of alkyl- and acyllysophospholipids by rabbit alveolar macrophages occurs by three separate mechanisms: a CoA-independent transacylation, a CoA-dependent transacylation (reverse reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA acyltransferase), and an acyl-CoA-dependent acylation. The CoA-independent transacylation reaction is unique in that it is specific for arachidonate and accounts for the selective acylation of alkyl- and acyllysophospholipids by arachidonate in membrane preparations of alveolar macrophages. This reaction appears to be extremely important in the remodeling of phospholipid molecular species and the mobilization of arachidonate into ether-linked lipids. The transfer of arachidonate to 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine also is of importance in the final inactivation step for platelet activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), whereby 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (a stored precursor of both platelet activating factor and arachidonic acid metabolites) is formed."

https://openalex.org/W1505518667,"The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor of porcine cerebrum has been purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography, with conjugated 3-(2'-aminobenzhydryloxy)tropane (ABT) as described previously (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13575-13579). In a single step purification using 900 ml of digitonin/cholate-solubilized preparations and 300 ml of the ABT-agarose gel, we obtained, in a yield of 10-15%, more than 250 pmol of muscarinic receptors which bind [3H]N-methylscopolamine with a specific activity of 1,000-5,000 pmol/mg of protein (1,000-5,000-fold purification). The muscarinic receptors eluted from the ABT-agarose gel with 0.1 mM atropine were adsorbed to hydroxylapatite and then recovered as a concentrated solution. Muscarinic receptors were further purified by rechromatography with the same gel or by gel permeation high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino acid composition of the purified receptor was determined, and the specific activity of the purified preparation was estimated to be 13,100 pmol/mg of protein on the basis of amino acid composition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified receptors with or without radioiodination revealed a single, major band with an apparent Mr of 70,000 either by silver staining or radioautogram. The major band corresponded to the band which specifically bound [3H]propylbenzylcholine mustard (irreversible muscarinic ligand). The purified receptor showed essentially the same specificity for muscarinic ligands as unpurified receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1637445535,"Protein amino groups can react with glucose without the aid of enzymes to form stable Amadori products containing 1-amino-1-deoxyketose residues. These adducts can undergo subsequent rearrangements and dehydrations to form various brown and fluorescent pigments. Recently, a chromophore, 2-(2-furoyl)-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (FFI), was isolated from acid hydrolysates of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and poly-L-lysine which had been incubated with glucose. To confirm the presence of FFI in situ, a radioimmunoassay was developed. A derivative of FFI, 4-furanyl-2-furoyl-1H-imidazole-1-hexanoic acid, was coupled to BSA and used to immunize rabbits. A radioactive FFI derivative was synthesized by reaction of 2-furyl-glyoxal with gamma-amino-[2,3-3H]butyric acid to form FFI-[3H]butyric acid. The resultant antiserum showed binding affinity to FFI and cross-reactivity for related compounds. FFI bound to proteins was liberated by acid hydrolysis or digestion by proteinase K prior to measurement. A linear relationship was seen between the amount of FFI equivalent detected and the amount of acid hydrolysate or enzymatic digest assayed. Poly-L-lysine and BSA incubated with glucose showed a time-dependent increase in the amounts of fluorescence and FFI equivalence. The detection of a time-related increase in the amount of FFI or a closely related structure in enzymatically digested proteins implicates it as an in situ product on proteins which have undergone the Maillard reaction with glucose. Of physiological significance is that FFI could also be detected in human globin and serum albumin from normal individuals. Thus, proteins exposed to glucose in vitro and in vivo form FFI as an in situ glycosylation product."

https://openalex.org/W1485105968,"We used a cone and plate rheometer to evaluate the mechanical properties of actin over a wide range of oscillation frequencies and shear rates. Remarkably, both filamentous and nonfilamentous actin behaved as viscoelastic solids in both oscillatory and shear type experiments, providing that they were given ample time to equilibrate. Actin was purified by gel filtration from rabbit skeletal muscle and Acanthamoeba. Nonfilamentous actin in 2 different buffers had similar properties. In a low ionic strength buffer the absence of filaments was confirmed by electron microscopy, ultracentrifugation, and the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. In 0.6 M KI, actin was monomeric by gel filtration. Filamentous actin had similar properties in 2 mM MgCl2 with either 50 mM KC1 or 500 mM KC1. Under all 4 of these conditions, actin required about 1000 min at 25 degrees C for the rheological properties to equilibrate. Under conditions where the oscillation of the rheometer did not affect the mechanical properties, all of the actin preparations had dynamic viscosities that were inverse functions of the frequency and dynamic elasticites that leveled off at low frequencies as expected for viscoelastic solids. For filamentous actin, the values of these parameters were about 2 times higher than for nonfilamentous actin. In shear experiments, both filamentous and nonfilamentous actin exhibited shear rate-dependent yield stresses. When filamentous and nonfilamentous actin structures were disrupted by transient shearing, the dynamic elasticity recovered to 90% in 30 min. Ovalbumin in the low ionic strength buffer also behaved as a viscoelastic material with elasticity and viscosity about 10 times lower than nonfilamentous actin, while cytochrome c behaved as a Newtonian fluid with a viscosity of 0.02 poise."
https://openalex.org/W2010143073,"The picosecond geminate rebinding of molecular oxygen was monitored in a variety of different human, reptilian, and fish hemoglobins. The fast (100 to 200 picoseconds) component of the rebinding is highly sensitive to protein structure. Both proximal and distal perturbations of the heme affect this rebinding process. The rebinding yield for the fast process correlates with the frequency of the stretching motion of the iron-proximal histidine mode (VFe-His) observed in the transient Raman spectra of photodissociated ligated hemoglobins. The high-affinity R-state species exhibit the highest values for VFe-His and the highest yields for fast rebinding, whereas low affinity R-state species and T-state species exhibit lower values of VFe-His and correspondingly reduced yields for this geminate process. These findings link protein control of ligand binding with events at the heme."
https://openalex.org/W2019588748,"The molecular basis underlying the sequence-specific positioning of nucleosomes on DNA was investigated. We previously showed that histone octamers occupy multiple specific positions on mouse satellite DNA in vivo and have now reconstituted the 234 bp mouse satellite repeat unit with pure core histones into mononucleosomes. Histones from mouse liver or chicken erythrocytes bind to the DNA in multiple precisely defined frames in perfect phase with a diverged 9 bp subrepeat of the satellite DNA. This is the first time that nucleosome positions on a DNA in vivo have been compared to those found on the same DNA by in vitro reconstitution. Most of the nucleosomes occupy identical positions in vivo and in vitro. There are, however, some characteristic differences. We conclude that sequence-dependent histone-DNA interactions play a decisive role in the positioning of nucleosomes in vivo, but that the nucleosome locations in native chromatin are subject to additional constraints."
https://openalex.org/W1515511446,"The carbocyanine dye 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide has been used to investigate changes in membrane potential (Em) which occur upon binding of complement proteins C5b-9 to the plasma membrane of blood platelets. Gel-filtered platelets exposed to C5b6 and C7 in serum-free medium show no change in Em from that of controls, as indicated by either 3,3,'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide fluorescence or by the distribution of [14C]tetraphenylphosphonium bromide. Addition of complement proteins C8 and C9 to the C5b67 platelets results in partial depolarization of Em, which spontaneously repolarizes to basal levels within 15-20 min at 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, C5b-9-treated platelets show no increase in lysis over complement-free controls. Isotonic replacement of external sodium by either potassium or choline alters both the rate and extent of membrane depolarization and inhibits the platelets' capacity to repolarize after C5b-9 assembly. Repolarization of Em to basal levels is also completely blocked by addition of ouabain, confirming that this recovery is mediated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ pump. These results demonstrate that membrane binding of the C5b-9 proteins can induce a transient change in Em when bound to the plasma membrane at a sublytic concentration, providing a mechanism for target cell activation by these potentially cytolytic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1494774919,"Highly purified human mucins from postmortem intestinal tissue were fractionated on anion exchange columns to generate separate neutral and acidic species. The neutral mucin (less than 1.0 mol % sialic acid) was the major species (greater than 80% by weight) and contained a higher molar proportion of fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine, and a lower proportion of sialic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine than the acidic species (greater than 10 mol % sialic acid). Amino acid analyses revealed a highly significant enrichment in serine, aspartate, and alanine in the neutral species and proline, threonine, and glycine in the acidic species. Thiol reduction of each species to remove their integral 118,000-dalton component did not alter the essential interspecies differences. Differences in threonine, proline, and serine also remained after removal of all or pronase-susceptible peptide regions from each species. These results indicate that neutral and acidic mucins contain glycopeptide segments exclusive of their 118,000-dalton and naked peptide components, which differ in amino acid composition. The key amino acid markers are similar to those observed for fuco- and sialoglycopeptides obtained after proteolytic digestion of human colonic mucin by Gold et al. (Gold, D.V., Schochat, D., and Miller, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6354-6358). The oligosaccharide composition of small intestinal and colonic mucin may therefore depend upon transcriptional control of the synthesis of specific mucin peptides as well as the post-translational activity of glycosyltransferases. These findings may have significance for the quality and functions of mucus produced in a variety of pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W2065871570,"Aminopeptidase-I allozymes, which are products of the Lap locus in the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis, differ in their catalytic efficiencies. These biochemical differences result in genotype-specific rates of change in the free amino acid pool, that is, in cell volume regulation, when mussels are subjected to changes in salinity. A high degree of dominance was found among genotypes for these biochemical and physiological phenotypes. Selection models that incorporate dominance adequately predict observed genotypic properties at the Lap locus among natural populations that exhibit clinal allele frequency. This suggests that a high degree of dominance for fitness must also occur at this locus in natural populations. These results provide additional evidence that the maintenance of an allele frequency cline is operating by natural selection at the Lap locus."
https://openalex.org/W2017161181,"The toxicity of macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the livers of man and animals has been attributed to the formation of reactive pyrroles from dihydropyrrolizines.

Other alkenals such as trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal have previously been isolated from microsomal systems when treated with halogenated hydrocarbons or subjected to lipid peroxidation. The in vivo pathology caused by trans-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal appears to be identical to that previously attributed to reactive pyrroles.

https://openalex.org/W1497478636,"Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase is a name applied to enzymes which cleave the S-cysteine conjugates of some xenobiotics to pyruvate, ammonia, and a thiol. Recently, several laboratories have characterized these enzymes from kidney, liver, and bacterial sources in an effort to understand their role in the genesis of novel sulfur-containing metabolites of xenobiotics and in the toxicity of some S-cysteine conjugates. Kynureninase is an enzyme which plays a key role in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide ribonucleotides. This investigation demonstrates that rat hepatic cysteine conjugate beta-lyase is the same enzyme as kynureninase. Both activities copurify on ion exchange, hydroxylapatite, and molecular exclusion chromatography. The subunit composition of enzyme prepared by two different methods is identical, Mr = 55,000. The Km values for 3-OH-kynurenine and kynurenine are 13 and 400 microM, respectively. Kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine inhibit cysteine conjugate beta-lyase activity. Inactivation of the enzyme by substrates which undergo beta-elimination results in loss of kynureninase activity, but kynurenine does not inactivate the enzyme. Both enzyme activities react with anti-cysteine conjugate beta-lyase antibody. Product inhibitors of kynureninase, anthranilate, and 3-hydroxyanthranilate are also inhibitors of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase. Heat inactivation at 70 degrees C produced coincident loss of both activities. The enzyme has an absorption maximum at 432 nm suggesting a bound pyridoxal phosphate. These data show that at least one cysteine conjugate beta-lyase is a pyridoxal phosphate enzyme with a biological function other than xenobiotic metabolism. The enzyme can catalyze two distinct types of reactions, i.e. beta-elimination and the kynureninase reaction."

Inhibition of lipid biosynthesis by MEDICA 16 involved a reduction in cytosolic acetyl-CoA content, while the carbon flux from glucose to glycogen, protein, and carbon dioxide remained unaffected. Inhibition of lipogenesis by MEDICA 16 resulted in a 50% decrease in liver and carcass (but not brain) neutral lipid ester content at 0.25% (w/w) of the drug in the diet, as well as in a dose-dependent hypotriglyceridemic effect, with an up to 3-fold reduction in serum triacylglycerols.

https://openalex.org/W1616134586,"Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been employed to investigate the molecular bases for the markedly different properties of horseradish oxyperoxidase and oxymyoglobin. The porphyrin core of oxyperoxidase is slightly more expanded with the iron atom closer to the porphyrin plane, and there is greater iron d pi-to-oxygen pi backbonding compared to oxymyoglobin. The iron-oxygen (stretching or bending) bands are observed at 570 and 562 cm-1, respectively, for oxymyoglobin and oxyperoxidase, and the iron-His stretching bands have been tentatively identified at 276 and 289 cm-1, respectively. It is suggested that the stronger iron-His bond in oxyperoxidase facilitates greater iron d pi-to-oxygen pi backdonation by raising the energy of the iron d pi orbitals closer to the energy of the oxygen pi orbitals. This weakens the O-O bond and activates dioxygen for use as an electron acceptor in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1902425749,"Abstract Carbon monoxide and dioxygen were employed as resonance Raman-visible ligands for probing the nature of the heme-binding site in elephant myoglobin, which has glutamine in the distal position (E7) instead of the usual histidine. The distal histidine (E7) residue has been thought to be responsible for weakening carbon monoxide binding to hemoproteins. It is of interest to see how the His(E7)----Gln replacement affects such parameters as nu(Fe-N epsilon), nu(Fe-CO), delta(Fe-C-O), nu(C-O), delta(Fe-O-O), and nu(O-O) vibrational frequencies and relative intensities. Elephant myoglobin has a CO affinity approximately 6 times higher than that for human/sperm whale myoglobin (Mb). If this enhanced affinity were solely due to the removal of some of the steric hindrance that normally tilts the CO off the heme axis, one would expect the nu(Fe-CO) frequency to decrease and the nu(C-O) frequency to increase relative to the corresponding values in sperm whale Mb. However, the opposite was found. In addition, strong enhancement of the Fe-C-O bending mode was observed. These results suggest that the Fe-C-O linkage remains distorted. In elephant Mb, new interactions resulting from the conformational change accompanying ligand binding may be responsible for the increased CO binding. Similar spectra were obtained for elephant and sperm whale oxymyoglobin. This suggests that the interactions of bound O2 are not markedly affected by the glutamine replacement."

The marked increase in potency was observed against human ovarian and breast carcinomas in vitro; it was not accompanied by an increase in cardiotoxicity in fetal mouse heart cultures. Doxorubicin and MRA-CN both produced typical cardiac ultrastructural and biochemical changes, but at equimolar concentrations. In addition, MRA-CN was not cross-resistant with doxorubicin in a variant of the human sarcoma cell line MES-SA selected for resistance to doxorubicin.

(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8404-8410) correlated well with their respective inhibitory effect on liver ATP-citrate lyase. Thus, MEDICA 16 inhibited liver ATP-citrate lyase competitively to citrate with a Ki of 16 microM as compared to a Km of 0.8 mM for the citrate substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1508709878,"An oxytocin/bovine neurophysin I biosynthetic precursor, [N epsilon-diacetimidyl-30,71, des-His106]pro-OT/BNPI, was synthesized from a synthetic oxytocinyl peptide, 1/2Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-1/2Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly-Gly-Lys-Arg, and native neurophysin by chemical semisynthesis. The semisynthetic precursor contains the entire sequence of the biosynthetic precursor deduced from the complementary DNA structure except for omission of the carboxyl-terminal histidine residue. The covalent structure of the semisynthetic product was verified by amino acid analysis and amino-terminal analysis. Analytical affinity chromatography was employed to evaluate noncovalent binding properties of the precursor. The precursor does not bind significantly to immobilized Met-Tyr-Phe, a hormone binding site ligand. In contrast, the acetimidated precursor binds to immobilized bovine neurophysin II, with a 13-fold higher affinity than does acetimidated neurophysin itself. When a hormonal ligand, [Lys8]vasopressin, was added to the elution buffer at the concentration of 0.1 mM so that a major portion of the immobilized BNPII was liganded, the affinity between the immobilized liganded BNPII and the precursor was enhanced 8-fold and approached the affinity for the liganded (bovine neurophysin I-immobilized BNPII) interaction. The data imply that the precursor can self-associate and that this self-association is closely related to that of liganded neurophysin. The tripeptide affinity matrix data argue that, in the precursor, the ligand binding site of the neurophysin domain is occupied intramolecularly by the hormone domain. The data verify the view that both the self-association surface and hormone binding site are established upon precursor folding. A disulfide stability analysis showed the resistance, to disulfide interchange by dithiothreitol, of semisynthetic precursor but not of neurophysin, as judged by protein association and peptide ligand binding activities, respectively. The results argue that the molecular structure of the precursor is established upon precursor folding and before enzymatic processing that produces mature hormone and neurophysin."

https://openalex.org/W2081986713,Adult emergence at the end of metamorphosis in the moth Manduca sexta is followed by the death of abdominal interneurons and motoneurons. Abdominal ganglia removed from insects before this period of naturally occurring cell death and maintained in vitro showed neuronal death confined to the same cells that normally die in vivo. Addition of physiological levels of the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone to the culture system prevented the selective death of these motoneurons.
https://openalex.org/W1515982763,"The effects of testosterone (in vivo) and polyamines (in vitro) on the phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins of rat ventral prostates were studied. Phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins was accomplished by incubation of isolated nucleoli with [gamma-32P]ATP at 37 degrees C for 10 min followed by electrophoretic separation and autoradiographic demonstration of phosphorylated proteins. Of several nucleolar phosphoproteins observed in ventral prostates of castrated rats, the incorporation of 32P into 110-kDa protein was remarkably augmented by the testosterone treatment. The stimulation became evident as early as 4 h after the injection of the hormones, reaching 3-4-fold of the control level and was efficiently prevented by cycloheximide injection 3 h before killing. 5 alpha-Dihydrotestosterone gave similar results to testosterone, but estradiol-17 beta failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of 110-kDa protein. Polyamines and cyclic nucleotides did not affect the phosphorylation, but, when phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was omitted from the standard medium, spermine and spermidine showed a distinct effect: 110-kDa phosphoprotein was completely abolished with a concomitant increase of 59-kDa phosphoprotein in both cases of castrated and testosterone-primed rats. The effect of polyamines seems to be due to the stimulation of degradation of the protein which is presumably catalyzed by a serine protease."
https://openalex.org/W1998550740,"Two RNA-catalyzed reactions have been described, the Tetrahymena self-splicing ribosomal RNA and ribonuclease P. The Tetrahymena self-splicing reaction proceeds through a transesterification cascade that is dependent upon nucleophilic attacks by ribose 3'-OH groups. Periodate oxidation of the catalytic (or substrate) RNA, which destroys the nucleophilicity of RNA 3' termini, did not inhibit ribonuclease P activity. Thus, catalysis by ribonuclease P differs from the self-splicing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1591626342,"The complete amino acid sequence of the [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway was determined by repetitive Edman degradation of the whole protein and peptides derived from tryptic digestion. The protein has 59 residues. Four of the six cysteine residues are involved in the binding of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in the same arrangement as in clostridial ferredoxins. This sequence is compared to various Desulfovibrio ferredoxin sequences and to the sequence and three-dimensional structure of Peptococcus aerogenes ferredoxin. Evidence of gene duplication is indicated. The requirement of some sequence features in the ferredoxin for an interaction process with its electron transfer partner, cytochrome c3, is postulated in the discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1553909781,"Ovoperoxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the dityrosine cross-linking of fertilization membranes of eggs from the sea urchin Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, exhibits slow changes in catalytic activity upon alterations of pH, with attendant changes in spectral properties. For ovoperoxidase pre-equilibratated at pH 8, abrupt decreases in pH are accompanied by a slow loss in activity that is temporally associated with a change in absorbance at the Soret band. With enzyme pre-equilibrated at pH 4.5 and then shifted to higher pH, there was a slow increase in catalytic activity following a rapid change in the Soret band absorbance. These changes were reversible and led to the same equilibrium state, regardless of the direction of pH shift. The rate of approach to the equilibrium state of ovoperoxidase was independent of enzyme concentration, the presence of substrates, or temperature (from 6.5 to 39.7 degrees C). The pH-induced interconversions of catalytic and spectral properties indicate that ovoperoxidase undergoes hysteretic transitions, in which alterations in the heme environment accompany, but are not sufficient for, the expression of catalytic activity. We present a kinetic mechanism for the hysteretic relaxations and suggest how these transitions may have relevance to the assembly of the fertilization membrane in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2169856718,"The crystal structure of deoxyhemoglobin S has been refined at 3.0-A resolution using the Hendrickson-Konnert restrained least-squares method. Comparison with the structure of deoxyhemoglobin A reveals a hingelike movement of the beta-chain A helices, which are involved in molecular contacts, toward the EF corners of their respective subunits. This movement brings the amino termini of the beta-chains closer to the molecular dyad. The A helices remain alpha-helical throughout their entire lengths. No other major structural difference is found between deoxyhemoglobin A and deoxyhemoglobin S."
https://openalex.org/W1517552153,"Luminescence methods were used to examine the interaction of Eu(III) and Tb(III) with parvalbumin isozyme III from pike (Esox lucius). The bound lanthanide ions were excited both directly, via laser irradiation, and indirectly, via fluorescence energy transfer from adjacent phenylalanine residues. At high (175 microM) protein concentrations, the lanthanide titration curves exhibited pronounced quenching of luminescence at Ln3+:parvalbumin ratios above 2:1, in agreement with earlier reports (Donato, H., Jr., and Martin, R. B. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 4575-4579). However, in experiments performed with lower concentrations (10 microM), the titrations were well behaved and indicated a lanthanide:protein stoichiometry of 2:1. Equilibrium dialysis measurements performed with Eu(III) ruled out the existence of a third strong binding site which could cause the quenching of the luminescence at high protein concentrations. Similarly, careful analysis of the spectrum that results from direct excitation of the 7F0—-5D0 transition of parvalbumin-bound Eu3+ ion revealed no peak attributable to a third Ln3+-binding site. The peak which has been construed by others (Rhee, M.-J., Sudnick, D. R., Arkle, V. K., and Horrocks, W. DeW., Jr. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3328-3334) as evidence for a third site was shown to result from a pH-dependent spectral transition involving the europium ions bound at the CD and EF sites. Luminescent lifetime measurements performed on Tb(III)/parvalbumin solutions follow Stern-Volmer quenching kinetics at terbium:protein ratios in excess of 2:1, suggesting that the quenching results from collisional deactivation of the tightly bound ions by excess terbium ion free in solution."

The cellular uptake of 55Fe-parabactin, its enantiomer, as well as a large number of its homologues and analogues are measured. Furthermore, the ability of these catecholamide ligands to stimulate microbial growth is also determined. The results of these studies point out several structural boundary conditions which the microorganism sets when utilizing iron chelates."

https://openalex.org/W2134189995,"Thiol-oxidizing agents were found to stimulate [14C] aminopyrine accumulation, a reliable index of acid secretory function of isolated canine parietal cells. Glutathione is the predominant intracellular free thiol; thus, its oxidation status largely determines the thiol-disulfide status of the cell by thiol-disulfide interchange reactions. Three agents which alter glutathione oxidation status by different mechanisms were applied to parietal cells in vitro to investigate whether enhanced formation of GSSG alters acid secretory function. The agents studied were diamide (which nonenzymatically oxidizes GSH to GSSG), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (an organic peroxide specifically reduced by glutathione peroxidase, thereby generating GSSG for GSH), and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (an inhibitor of NADPH:GSSG reductase, which presumably allows the accumulation of GSSG). Each of these agents stimulated aminopyrine accumulation in a dose-dependent fashion. Simple depletion of GSH by diethyl maleate or 2-cyclohexene-1-one did not stimulate aminopyrine accumulation. Likewise, enhanced aminopyrine accumulation occurred at diamide concentrations which did not cause significant depletion of total cellular glutathione. The thiol-reducing agent, dithiothreitol, prevented enhanced aminopyrine accumulation by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. These observations support the hypothesis that thiol-disulfide interchange reactions involving GSSG modulate the acid secretory function of the isolated parietal cell."
https://openalex.org/W1539300821,"At least six viral genes are activated early after adenovirus 2 infection of HeLa cells. In an effort to define more clearly the effects of protein synthesis inhibition on early viral gene expression, the rate of transcription and the cytoplasmic abundance of viral mRNA from each transcription unit were studied in infected cells treated with translational inhibitors added at different times during infection and at concentrations known to inhibit 95 to 99% of protein synthesis. Tritiated uridine-labeled nuclear and cytoplasmic viral RNA molecules synthesized in infected HeLa cells in both the presence and absence of inhibitors were analyzed and compared by hybridization using specific DNA probes. Translational inhibitors (25 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide or 10 microM anisomycin) added 30 min to 1 h after infection stimulated the over-accumulation of cytoplasmic viral mRNA from 3- to 20-fold, early regions E1A, E2, and E4 being affected most. This overproduction of viral mRNA was found to result from enhanced transcription of the respective early genes. Treatment of cells with 100 microM anisomycin 1 h prior to and during infection did not prevent the accumulation of early viral mRNA molecules; however, total cellular RNA synthesis was drastically inhibited in 100 microM anisomycin-treated cells. These results support the hypothesis that a cellular factor may function in the regulation of early viral gene expression at a transcriptional level."
