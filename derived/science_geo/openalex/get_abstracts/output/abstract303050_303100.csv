https://openalex.org/W2035204949,"After volcanic explosions or tidal waves had defaunated several islands near New Guinea, bird species number rapidly returned to equilibrium on coral islets and rapidly returned to quasi-steady-state values limited by regrowth of vegetation in lowland forest of larger islands. However, reequilibration in montane forest has been limited by slow dispersal of the birds. Colonists have been drawn disproportionately from r-selected ""supertramrip"" species, which maintain much higher population densities than do K-selected faunas, perhaps due to selection for resource overexploitation by the latter."

https://openalex.org/W2031848336,"Barley seedlings homozygous both for the xantha-1(35) and tigrina-d(12) mutation accumulate magnesium protopophyrins and other precursors of chlorophyllide constitutively in darkness. The homozygous double mutant xantha-f(10), tigrina-O(34) produces protoporphyrin constitutively. These results provide evidence for the control of chlorophyllide synthesis in higher plants through the products of regulatory genes in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1993210628,"For 10 months the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) provided astronomers with what might be termed their first view of the infrared sky on a clear, dark night. Without IRAS, atmospheric absorption and the thermal emission from both the atmosphere and Earthbound telescopes make the task of the infrared astronomer comparable to what an optical astronomer would face if required to work only on cloudy afternoons. IRAS observations are serving astronomers in the same manner as the photographic plates of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey; just as the optical survey has been used by all astronomers for over three decades, as a source of quantitative information about the sky and as a ""roadmap"" for future observations, the results of IRAS will be studied for years to come. IRAS has demonstrated the power of infrared astronomy from space. Already, from a brief look at a miniscule fraction of the data available, we have learned much about the solar system, about nearby stars, about the Galaxy as a whole and about distant extragalactic systems. Comets are much dustier than previously thought. Solid particles, presumably the remnants of the star-formation process, orbit around Vega and other stars and may provide the raw material for planetary systems. Emission from cool interstellar material has been traced throughout the Galaxy all the way to the galactic poles. Both the clumpiness and breadth of the distribution of this material were previously unsuspected. The far-infrared sky away from the galactic plane has been found to be dominated by spiral galaxies, some of which emit more than 50 percent and as much as 98 percent of their energy in the infraredâ€”an exciting and surprising revelation. The IRAS mission is clearly the pathfinder for future missions that, to a large extent, will be devoted to the discoveries revealed by IRAS."

In 4 years basic research has moved from the smallest to the largest component in nondefense R & D expenditures, and basic research specifically to universities has grown by 26 percent in real terms during that period. New programs for fiscal year 1985 emphasize engineering education and research, as well as improved interactions between universities, federal laboratories, and industry."
https://openalex.org/W1972239961,"In a recent report Case et al. (1)
presented a free-air gravity anomaly
map of Galapagos Islands based on
32 gravity stations on islands. On
the basis of their data they stated that
the Galapagos Islands are associated
with an east-west trending residual
negative anomaly which is superimposed
on a broader positive anomaly
of unknown amplitude and extent.
They concluded that the gravity data
can be most readily interpreted in terms
of a low-density region related to a hot
spot or plume beneath islands.
We believe, however, that data
of Case et al. in no way support this
interpretation. Their observations can,
in fact, be explained simply if the
Galapagos Islands are in some form of 
isostatic equilibrium. Any form of isostatic
compensation will result in an
edge in free-air anomaly
at location of a large change in
relief. For a relatively narrow feature,
the edge effect anomalies over two
edges merge, resulting in a large
positive anomaly. For a wider feature,
the two edge effects become separated,
resulting in an area of less positive
anomalies over center of feature."
