Defects in this filtration apparatus lead to glomerular vascular leak or proteinuria. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the regulation of glomerular vascular permeability is still unclear. Recent studies indicate that patients receiving anti-VEGF antibody therapy may have an increased incidence of proteinuria. In a different setting, pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia are associated with elevated soluble VEGF receptor 1 protein (sFlt-1), endothelial cell dysfunction and proteinuria. These studies suggest that neutralization of physiologic levels of VEGF, a key endothelial survival factor, may lead to proteinuria. In the present study, we evaluated the potential of anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies and sFlt-1 in the induction of proteinuria. Our studies demonstrate that anti-VEGF antibodies and sFlt-1 cause rapid glomerular endothelial cell detachment and hypertrophy, in association with down-regulation of nephrin, a key epithelial protein in the glomerular filtration apparatus. These studies suggest that down-regulation or neutralization of circulating VEGF may play an important role in the induction of proteinuria in various kidney diseases, some forms of cancer therapy and also in women with preeclampsia.

Several splice variants of human VEGF1 have been reported to exist, and VEGF165 along with VEGF121 are key circulating forms (5Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C.

The importance of VEGF is further illustrated by the fact the deletion of even a single allele of VEGF in mice leads to embryonic lethality (11Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S.

While the importance of VEGF as a survival factor for vascular endothelium is well appreciated, its role in the regulation of kidney glomerular vascular endothelium behavior is poorly understood. Some studies have suggested that VEGF expression is reduced during renal injury (12Fan L. Wakayama T. Yokoyama S. Amano O. Iseki S.

Hughes J. Mazzali M. Schreiner G.F. Johnson R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar). Preeclampsia is also associated with proteinuria, hypertension, and endothelial cell dysfunction (16Pridjian G. Puschett J.B. Obstet. Gynecol. Surv. 2002; 57: 598-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Roberts J.M. Cooper D.W.

Halmesmaki E. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 14: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrate that VEGF is bound by a circulating serum protein in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Later, the same group demonstrates that soluble VEGF receptor 1 protein (sFlt-1) is significantly elevated in the amniotic fluid of peeclamptic women, again suggesting a pathogenic significance for the decrease of VEGF levels in the serum and amniotic fluid in this condition (20Vuorela P. Helske S. Hornig C. Alitalo K. Weich H. Halmesmaki E. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 95: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a related study, Zhou et al. (21Zhou Y. McMaster M. Woo K.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 1405-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) demonstrate that cytotrophoblasts from placentas of women whose pregnancies were complicated by preeclampsia produce higher levels of sFlt-1 in vitro as compared with control cells. Such separate studies collectively suggest a causal connection between proteinuria/hypertension and endothelial cell dysfunction, mediated by sFlt-1. The significance of physiological circulating levels of VEGF in the regulation of glomerular vascular leak or proteinuria is important to evaluate as anti-VEGF antibody therapy, and VEGF receptor antagonists are being used in several clinical cancer trials (www.nci.nih.gov). In this regard, recent reports from Phase I and Phase II human clinical cancer trials using anti-VEGF antibodies (Bevacizumab) suggest that proteinuria was associated with this treatment protocol (22Kabbinavar F. Hurwitz H.I. Fehrenbacher L. Meropol N.J. Novotny W.F. Lieberman G. Griffing S. Bergsland E. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). These results suggest that anti-VEGF antibodies may induce proteinuria. In the present study we evaluated the capacity of anti-mouse VEGF neutralizing antibodies and sFlt-1 to induce proteinuria. Our results indicate that a single intravenous infusion of anti-VEGF antibodies into normal healthy mice results in excessive albumin excretion in the urine (proteinuria) via massive glomerular endothelial cell detachment/damage and suppression of the glomerular epithelial slit diaphragm apparatus-associated protein, nephrin. Thus we propose that circulating physiological levels of VEGF are important for the proper function and survival of glomerular endothelial cells and appropriate filtration of blood in the kidney glomeruli. Additionally, these results suggest that long term proteinuria may be a significant side effect of chronic anti-VEGF therapy. Anti-VEGF antibody and sFlt-1 bolus injection studies were performed in wild-type CD1 mice. Each mice were injected with a single intravenous injection of anti-VEGF antibody or sFlt-1/Fc at a concentration of 3.25 and 32.5 pm (picomole per liter). This concentration corresponds to equivalent molar concentration to that of 65 pg/ml (3.25 pm) of normal plasma VEGF (1:1 ratio) and 10 times molar excess to that of 65 pg/ml (3.25 pm) of normal plasma VEGF concentration (1:10 ratio). Mouse anti-VEGF antibody (IgG1) and sFlt-1/Fc chimera were purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. For the in vivo inhibition experiments, human recombinant VEGF165 was injected at a concentration of 32.5 pm to counteract the anti-VEGF antibodies injected at the same concentration. Since timed urine collection was essential to assess protienuria, we used 10 μg of furosemide in 200 μl of PBS for injection after the infusion of anti-VEGF antibodies or sFlt-1. Mice injected with control IgG1 served a control. One-hundred microliters of urine was collected 0, 1, 3, 5, and 24 h after the initial injection. Injections of furosemide were repeated every 1 h before the collection of the urine. Albumin and creatinine concentrations in the urine were estimated using a colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). Urine albumin excretion was estimated as the quotient of urine albumin and urine creatinine (23Kristal B. Shasha S.M. Labin L. Cohen A. Am. J. Nephrol. 1988; 8: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For these experiments, five mice per each group were used. Some mice were sacrificed 5 h after to collect kidneys for immunohistochemistry. The entire experiment was repeated three times. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (24Hamano Y. Grunkemeyer J.A. Sudhakar A. Zeisberg M. Cosgrove D. Morello R. Lee B. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31154-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-μm cryosections were fixed in acetone (−20 °C) for 3 min and dried at room temperature. After incubation with primary antibodies to nephrin, CD2AP, podocin, and α-actinin-4 for 2 h at room temperature, the sections were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies. After washing with PBS the sections were covered with glass slips using Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The staining was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope Eclipse TE300 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies to nephrin, CD2AP, podocin, and α-actinin-4 were reported by our laboratory in a previous publication (24Hamano Y. Grunkemeyer J.A. Sudhakar A. Zeisberg M. Cosgrove D. Morello R. Lee B. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31154-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Equal weights of cortical portions of kidneys from each groups were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and they were solubilized in the lysis buffer (0.05 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.01 m CaCl2, 4 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 25 mmε-aminohexanoic acid). The lysates were dialyzed with PBS and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblots were blocked with 5% skim milk-containing TBST buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl). Western blotting was performed by incubating with indicated antibodies in TBST buffer followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and then developed by ECL kit as an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (25Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Kotelianski V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences. As needed, further analysis was carried out using t test with Bonferroni correction to identify significant differences. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Circulating physiological levels of free VEGF in the normal mouse plasma (VEGF164 and VEGF120) is about 65 pg/ml (3.25 pm) as determined by ELISA (data not shown). We used neutralizing mouse anti-VEGF antibodies at two different concentrations, equivalent molar amount to the free serum VEGF in normal mice according to our measurement (3.25 pm) and also 10-fold molar excess (32.5 pm), to evaluate their capacity to induce proteinuria (as measured by albumin content in the urine). The amount of protein in the urine was estimated as the ratio of urine protein to urine creatinine (Fig. 1). Our results indicate that starting 3 h after the intravenous injection of anti-VEGF antibody, the mice develop significant proteinuria and maintain the same level of proteinuria for next 7 h and gradually after 24 h the albumin content in the urine returns to normal levels (Fig. 1A; data not shown). The amount of proteinuria in mice with 1:1, VEGF:anti-VEGF antibody ratio (1:1 ratio), is less compared with 1:10 ratio (Fig. 1A). The likely explanation for this is the potential lack of sensitivity on part of the ELISA assay to detect all of the circulating VEGF in the plasma. Nevertheless, these experiments suggest that very low amounts of anti-VEGF antibody (3.25 pm) can induce proteinuria. To further establish the specificity of this antibody, we performed the antibody infusion (1:10 ratio) experiments in conjunction with infusion of equivalent molar amounts of exogenous human VEGF165(32.5 pm). Such experiments show that human VEGF165 can inhibit proteinuria inducing capacity of anti-VEGF antibody, providing further proof that anti-VEGF antibody specifically induces proteinuria (Fig. 1A). Recent studies propose that sFlt-1 can also neutralize circulating VEGF and suggest the use of this protein as an anti-cancer agent (26Bainbridge J.W. Mistry A. De Alwis M. Paleolog E. Baker A.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7840-7845PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study we used mouse sFlt-1/Fc fusion protein to perform similar experiments as done using anti-VEGF antibodies. Again, consistent with anti-VEGF antibody experiments, we show that sFlt-1 can induce proteinuria in mice within 3 h of intravenous injection and this effect disappears by 24 h (Fig. 1B; data not shown). Additionally, as shown earlier, exogenous VEGF supplementation at equivalent molar concentration of sFlt-1 (32.5 pm) inhibits the proteinuria-inducing effect of sFlt-1 (Fig. 1B). These results collectively show that intravenous injection of a single dose of anti-VEGF antibodies and sFlt-1 to neutralize circulating VEGF leads to proteinuria. We next performed ultrastructural transmission electron microscopy analysis of the kidney glomerular tissue sections from mice which developed proteinuria upon treatment with anti-VEGF antibodies and sFlt-1. The control kidney sections, 5 h after injected with 32.5 pm of IgG1, reveal normal ultrastructual histology with well defined endothelial layer (arrowhead) adjacent to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), proper alignment of podocyte foot processes (black arrow), and slit diaphragms (white arrow) (Fig. 1, C and D). Starting 3 h and even at 24 h, anti-VEGF antibodies treatment reveal glomerular endothelial hypertrophy (Fig. 1E,dotted line), damage (Fig. 1F, dotted line), endothelial cell detachment from GBM (Fig. 1G,arrow) and occasional disruption/loss of slit diaphragms (Fig. 1, E–H, arrowhead). Similar results are observed when kidney from sFlt-1 injected mice are analyzed (data not shown). These results suggest that anti-VEGF antibody and sFlt-1 infusion leads to glomerular endothelial cell damage and also patchy yet significant glomerular epithelial cell damage (podocytes). Such defects could result in proteinuria as shown by recent studies (22Kabbinavar F. Hurwitz H.I. Fehrenbacher L. Meropol N.J. Novotny W.F. Lieberman G. Griffing S. Bergsland E. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 24Hamano Y. Grunkemeyer J.A. Sudhakar A. Zeisberg M. Cosgrove D. Morello R. Lee B. Sugimoto H. Kalluri R. J. Biol.

Lab. Invest. 1985; 52: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bulger R.E. Eknoyan G. Purcell II, D.J. Dobyan D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such fenestrations are considered to allow for the filtration property of the glomerulus (34Farquhar M.G. Wissig S.L. Palade G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2645-2662PubMed Google Scholar, 35Venkatachalam M.A. Karnovsky M.J. Fahimi H.D. Cotran R.S. J. Exp.

Essner E. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 136: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is well established now that fenestrated endothelium does not prevent albumin penetration and in general many large proteins can pass through the fenestrations (34Farquhar M.G. Wissig S.L. Palade G.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2645-2662PubMed Google Scholar, 37Oliver C. Essner E. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 136: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Rennke H.G. Venkatachalam M.A. Fed. Proc. 1977; 36: 2519-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, presence of albumin in the urine has to be due to a defect in the glomerular basement membrane or podocyte slit diaphragm structure associated with glomerular epithelial cells (34Farquhar M.G.

In the anti-VEGF antibody and sFlt-1 experiments, the glomerular basement membrane is quite intact but occasional defects in the glomerular podocyte architecture can be detected (Fig. 1, E–H). Therefore, we examined four recently identified glomerular podocyte-associated proteins considered to be important for glomerular filtration. Human mutations in nephrin, podocin, and α-actinin-4 result in kidney diseases associated with proteinuria (45Kaplan J.M. Kim S.H. North K.N. Rennke H. Correia L.A. Tong H.Q. Mathis B.J.

Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1586-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that nephrin is key regulator of glomerular filtration apparatus (51Holthofer H. Ahola H.

Thus, in this study we examined the effect of anti-VEGF antibodies and sFlt-1 on the expression of glomerular slit diaphragm/podocyte associated proteins. The expression of nephrin, CD2AP, podocin, and α-actinin-4 were examined in the kidneys from mice infused with anti-VEGF antibodies (1:10 ratio). By immunofluoresence and Western blot using either kidney sections or kidney extracts, we demonstrate that anti-VEGF antibodies significantly reduce the expression of glomerular slit diaphragm associated protein, nephrin (Fig. 2). The expression of CD2AP, podocin, and α-actinin-4 was unchanged in these kidneys (Fig. 2). Similar results are also obtained when kidneys from sFlt-1 injected mice were analyzed (data not shown). These results suggest that significant decrease in the expression of nephrin, a component of glomerular slit diaphragm which constitutes an important barrier to large serum proteins such as albumin, is a key mediator of anti-VEGF antibody and sFlt-1 induced proteinuria in mice. These results are consistent with other reports which suggest that nephrin expression must be altered for induction of proteinuria (53Langham R.G. Kelly D.J. Cox A.J. Thomson N.M. Holthofer H.

Kalluri R. Remuzzi G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 941-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these experiments provide evidence for the importance for circulating physiological levels VEGF in the homeostasis of kidney glomerulus. The glomerular endothelial cells are known to express VEGF receptors 1 and 2, while glomerular epithelial cells do not express these receptors (55Simon M. Rockl W. Hornig C. Grone E.F. Theis H. Weich H.A. Fuchs E. Yayon A. Grone H.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1032-1044PubMed Google Scholar, 56Feng D. Nagy J.A. Brekken R.A. Pettersson A. Manseau E.J. Pyne K. Mulligan R. Thorpe P.E. Dvorak H.F. Dvorak A.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus the effect on glomerular epithelial cells is conceivably indirect and derived from the loss of glomerular endothelial cells due to the lack of survival signals from circulating VEGF (Fig. 2). This study also provides the necessary biochemical and molecular proof that anti-VEGF antibodies and sFlt-1 can cause proteinuria, offering a possible explanation for proteinuria observed in some cancer patients on anti-VEGF antibody therapy and also pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (16Pridjian G.

https://openalex.org/W1988380443,"Functional inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the cause of familial VHL disease and sporadic kidney cancer. The <i>VHL</i> gene product (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 and 2 α subunits for polyubiquitylation. This process is dependent on the hydroxylation of conserved proline residues on the α subunits of HIF-1/2 in the presence of oxygen. In our effort to identify orphan HIF-like proteins in the data base that are potential targets of the pVHL complex, we report multiple splice variants of the human HIF-3α locus as follows: hHIF-3α1, hHIF-3α2 (also referred to as hIPAS; human inhibitory PAS domain protein), hHIF-3α3, hHIF-3α4, hHIF-3α5, and hHIF-3α6. We demonstrate that the common oxygen-dependent degradation domain of hHIF-3α1–3 splice variants is targeted for ubiquitylation by the pVHL complex <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This activity is enhanced in the presence of prolyl hydroxylase and is dependent on a proline residue at position 490. Furthermore, the ubiquitin conjugation occurs on lysine residues at position 465 and 568 within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain. These results demonstrate additional targets of the pVHL complex and suggest a growing complexity in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes by the HIF family of transcription factors."

It is highly expressed in the kidney as well as blood-brain barrier-deficient hypothalamic nuclei responsible for systemic osmosensing. Apart from its gating by hypotonicity, little is known about TRPV4 regulation. We observed that hypotonic stress resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 in a heterologous expression model and in native murine distal convoluted tubule cells in culture. This tyrosine phosphorylation was sensitive to the inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases, PP1, in a dose-dependent fashion. TRPV4 associated with Src family kinases by co-immunoprecipitation studies and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and this interaction required an intact Src family kinase SH2 domain. One of these kinases, Lyn, was activated by hypotonic stress and phosphorylated TRPV4 in an immune complex kinase assay and an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant Lyn and TRPV4. Transfection of wild-type Lyn dramatically potentiated hypotonicity-dependent TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation whereas dominant negative-acting Lyn modestly inhibited it. Through mutagenesis studies, the site of tonicity-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was mapped to Tyr-253, which is conserved across all species from which TRPV4 has been cloned. Importantly, point mutation of Tyr-253 abolished hypotonicity-dependent channel activity. In aggregate, these data indicate that hypotonic stress results in Src family tyrosine kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the tonicity sensor TRPV4 at residue Tyr-253 and that this residue is essential for channel function in this context.

Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the sensor for hypotonic stress, both at the single cell and organismal levels, remains elusive. A member of the transient receptor potential (TRP)1 family of cation channels has recently been described that fulfills multiple criteria for an osmosensing protein. Based upon homology with OSM-9, an osmosensing TRP-like channel expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans (2Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Google Scholar), the mammalian candidate osmosensing TRP channel family member, was cloned independently as OTRPC4 (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar) and VR-OAC (4Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Google Scholar). This protein, also identified as TRP12 and vanilloid receptor-related protein-2 in other contexts, was recently renamed TRPV4 (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar). TRPV4, as a member of the TRPV subfamily of TRP channels, shares close homology with the following channels: 1) the vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor and sensor of noxious heat, TRPV1; 2) the heat-sensitive vanilloid receptor-related channel-1, TRPV2; 3) the calcium channels, TRPV5 (formerly known as ECaC1 and CaT2) and TRPV6 (formerly known as CaT1, ECaC2, and CaT-L) (all reviewed in Ref. 5Montell C.

TRPV4 forms nonselective cation channels that are activated by changes in extracellular osmolarity; hypertonicity, in contrast, inactivates the channel (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar, 4Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Google Scholar). Although TRPV4 is expressed at the mRNA level in multiple tissues including liver, heart, lung, spleen, and adipose tissue, it is by far most abundant in the kidney (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar, 4Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Google Scholar). By in situhybridization, renal expression was localized principally to the distal convoluted tubule (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRPV4 expression was also detected in the specific blood-brain barrier-deficient hypothalamic nuclei responsible for systemic osmosensing and in the mechanosensing hair cells of the inner ear (4Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 103: 525-535Google Scholar). Functional and expression data were both consistent with a role for TRPV4 in osmosensing at both the single cell and organismal levels. Apart from its gating by tonicity, little is known about TRPV4 regulation. We and others have shown that signaling events in response to hypotonic stress are reminiscent of activation of a receptor-tyrosine kinase (9Tilly B.C. van den Berghe N. Tertoolen L.G.

We observed that hypotonic stress resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 in a heterologous expression model and in native murine distal convoluted tubule cells in culture. This tyrosine phosphorylation was sensitive to the inhibitor of Src family cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, PP1, in a dose-dependent fashion. TRPV4 associated with Src family tyrosine kinases by co-immunoprecipitation studies and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and this interaction required an intact SH2 domain. Lyn, a Src family kinase, was activated by hypotonic stress and phosphorylated TRPV4 in an immune complex kinase assay and kinase assay with recombinant proteins. Transfection of wild-type Lyn dramatically potentiated hypotonicity-dependent TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation whereas dominant negative-acting Lyn modestly inhibited it. Phosphorylation occurred principally at residue Tyr-253, and point mutation of this residue abolished tonicity-dependent calcium entry. In aggregate, these data indicate that Src family kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-253 regulates TRPV4 activation in response to hypotonicity. mIMCD3 cells were maintained and passaged as previously described (13Rauchman M.I. Nigam S. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Google Scholar). The murine distal convoluted tubule mDCT cell line (14Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Google Scholar), kindly provided by Peter Friedman, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TRPV4 was cloned from murine kidney poly(A)+ RNA via RT-PCR using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen) for first strand synthesis, followed by amplification with TRPV4-specific primers, 5′-AGT ATG GCA GAT CCT GGT GA-3′ and 5′-GTA CAG TGG GGC ATC GTC C-3′. Amplified fragment was TA-cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to create an expression plasmid encoding a carboxyl-terminal V5-epitope-tagged murine TRPV4; identity was confirmed by sequencing (Core Facility, Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research). Following the demonstration of tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4, high probability tyrosine phosphorylation sites were sought using ProSite (us.expasy.org/prosite, Ref. 15Bucher P. Bairoch A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intel. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 53-61Google Scholar) and NetPhos (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos, Ref. 16Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Google Scholar; see “Results”). The deduced amino acid sequence of the TRPV4 clone in the present study was identical to that of the canonical sequence, NP_071300, with the following exceptions: Leu instead of Arg at position 90, Thr instead of Ile at position 389, and His instead of Tyr at position 860. Leu-90 was previously reported in the context of murine TRP12 and murine VR-OAC. Of note, the extreme carboxyl-terminal Tyr-860, present in NM_022017 and absent from our clone, was predicted to encode an extremely low-probability tyrosine phosphorylation site (probability 0.075, NetPhos). HEK293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus in accordance with the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were derived from pooled clones propagated under selection pressure with Gly-418. Lyn-WT and Lyn-DN were originally described as pSRα-Lyn wt and pSRα-Lyn(K-R) (17Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34663-34668Google Scholar). Individual point mutants of TRPV4 were generated using the QuickChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, using PAGE-purified primers obtained from IDT. Multiple point mutants (e.g. 5×-mutant) were generated through iterated application of this approach. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing, as above. Anti-peptide polyclonal antibody was raised in two rabbits against a synthetic peptide representing the carboxyl-terminal sequence of TRPV4 (CDG HQQ GYA PKW RTD DAP L) and then subjected to affinity purification with the peptide antigen (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc., San Antonio, TX). Sequence analysis (BLAST search with peptide) indicated that this sequence was not conserved across other TRP family members including TRPV1 (VR-1), TRPV2 (VRL-1), TRPV5 (ECaC, CAT2), TRPV6 (ECaC-2, Cat1). It was conserved across murine VRL-2, TRP12, OTRPC4, and TRPV4, all of which are nearly identical at the amino acid level and have been collectively designated TRPV4 (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar). Other antibodies were commercially available including anti-PY99 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-V5, anti-Lyn, anti-Src, anti-Fyn, anti-Lck, anti-Hck, anti-Yes (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (18Cohen D.M. Chin W.W. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25865-25870Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were lysed in Lysis Buffer (125 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm4-(2-aminoetryl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate) for 30 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibody and protein A/G bound to Sepharose beads. Lyn immune complex kinase assay was performed essentially as described by Yoshida et al. (17Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34663-34668Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were lysed in Lysis Buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn, washed, and subjected to kinase assay in Complete Kinase Buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm ATP, 1% (v/v) [γ-32P]ATP [250 μCi/ml], 75 ng/μl acid-activated enolase) for 30 min at 30 °C prior to SDS/PAGE. Adult mouse kidney tissue blot was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic International. For Lyn co-immunoprecipitation kinase assay, monolayers of control or hypotonically stressed HEK293 cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-Lyn, washed extensively, and then subjected to in vitro kinase assay in Complete Kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence of acid-activated enolase. In vitro TRPV4-directed LynA kinase assay was performed essentially as described by Chin et al.(19Chin H. Arai A. Wakao H. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1998; 91: 3734-3745Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro transcribed and translated TRPV4 or ΔTRPV4 (see below), synthesized using the TnT kit (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. After washing, bead-bound TRPV4 or ΔTRPV4 was incubated in In Vitro Kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm ATP, 5% v/v [γ-32P]ATP [250 μCi/ml], and 0.36 μg/μl LynA [Calbiochem]) for 30 min at 30 °C. ΔTRPV4 (murine TRPV4 absent membrane-spanning domains 2 through 6) was prepared throughBsu36I restriction digestion of TRPV4-pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO and self-ligation following gel purification of the larger fragment. In some experiments (e.g. anti-V5 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Src family protein-tyrosine kinase immunoblotting), anti-V5 was covalently cross-linked to protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using dimethyl pimelimidate (20Harlow E. Lane D. Harlow E. Lane D. Using antibodies: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 321-325Google Scholar) to eliminate the secondary antibody detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain, which co-migrates with many Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. Intracellular [Ca2+]i measurements were conducted on cell suspensions obtained by trypsinization of confluent cell monolayers of wild-type and TRPV4 stably transfected HEK293 cells. The suspended cells were loaded with Fura-2-AM, washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaHPO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and assayed for intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a cuvette under constant, gentle stirring (2-ml final volume). Fluorescent emission was monitored at 510 nm with alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm using a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Inc., Naperville, IL). Calibration of the Fura-2 signal was performed as previously described (21Roullet J.B. Luft U.C. Xue H. Chapman J. Bychkov R. Roullet C.M. Luft F.C. Haller H. McCarron D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32240-32246Google Scholar) using Fura-2·Ca2+ dissociation constant of 224 nm(22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Monolayers were grown on LabTek Chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc) and labeled with primary antibody (anti-Lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-15), anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-19), or anti-V5 (Invitrogen 46–0705)) and secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes A-11037) or AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes A-11001) prior to confocal epifluorescence imaging. Studies were performed on wild-type HEK293 cells and on HEK293 cells stably transfected with TRPV4. The affinity-purified anti-TRPV4 antibody was insufficiently sensitive in the immunofluorescence assay to permit examination of the native (mDCT) system. For confocal imaging, consecutive sections 500 nm apart, bracketing the center of the cell, were scanned alternating between 488 and 568 nm using a Leica TCS SP confocal laser scanning microscope. System settings were held constant for all imaging. Images were digitally captured and then deconvolved using Power HazeBusterTM imaging software (VayTek, Inc., Fairfield, VA). All imaging analysis determining colocalization was carried out using software by IPLabTM (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfield, VA). Because tyrosine phosphorylation events may accompany hypotonic stress, we sought to determine whether hypotonicity resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the tonicity-responsive TRPV4. V5-epitope-tagged TRPV4 was stably overexpressed in HEK293 cells, which were reported to lack this channel (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar). By anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of anti-V5 immunoprecipitates, hypotonic stress (150 mosmol/kg H2O) resulted in pronounced and transient up-regulation of TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). This phenomenon was specific to hypotonic stress as it was not observed in the presence of treatment with the peptide growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or the activator of classical protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Fig.1 B). There was no effect upon total TRPV4 abundance in these experiments (data not shown). Two other solute stressors, hypertonic stress and urea stress, both failed to increase anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity in this model (data not shown). Of note, additional less intense bands migrating more slowly than the principal band corresponding to newly tyrosine-phosphorylated TRPV4 were frequently observed in this heterologous expression model. Treatment of lysates with endoglycosidase-F resulted in the complete disappearance of the higher molecular mass bands and enhancement of the principal lower molecular mass band (Fig. 1 C). These data were consistent with the presence of forms of TRPV4 exhibiting varying degrees of glycosylation. We next sought to confirm that: 1) stable heterologous transfection of epitope-tagged TRPV4 resulted in expression of functional TRPV4 and thereby mimicked endogenous expression, and 2) addition of the epitope tag did not interfere with channel function. Calcium transients in response to hypotonicity were examined in untransfected and TRPV4-transfected HEK293 cells. In both untransfected and TRPV4-transfected cells, there was negligible calcium entry following sham (isotonic) treatment (Fig.2 A). In response to hypotonic stress (150 mosmol/kg H2O), there was a robust response in the TRPV4-transfected cells but virtually no response in the wild-type cell line. Next, to confirm that the calcium transients required calcium entry, similar studies were performed with only the TRPV4-transfected cell line in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium (Fig. 2 B). The response to hypotonic stress was noted again, in the presence of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o = 1.25 mm) but was completely absent when calcium was omitted from the assay buffer ([Ca2+]o ∼0 mm). However, the hypotonicity-dependent, intracellular calcium signal was restored upon addition of calcium (CaCl2, 1.25 mm) to the cuvette. In aggregate, these data indicated that the heterologous expression model functionally mimicked the native system. To demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 in response to hypotonic stress occurred in a native system, in a fashion similar to the HEK293-based heterologous expression system, a rabbit polyclonal, affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody was generated against the carboxyl terminus of murine TRPV4 (see “Materials and Methods”). The specific peptide was chosen to avoid cross-reactivity with closely related members of the TRP channel family (Fig.3 A); VRL-2, OTRPC4, VR-OAC, and TRP12 are names independently assigned to the protein now designated TRPV4 (5Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar). Murine renal tissue was screened for anti-TRPV4 immunoreactivity. Expression was detected in whole kidney lysate (Fig.3 B), most of which appeared to be conferred by expression in the outer cortex. The distal convoluted tubule, where TRPV4 mRNA had previously been detected (3Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Google Scholar), is confined to the outer cortex. Several cell lines were also screened for the presence of TRPV4 by anti-TRPV4 immunoblotting (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the reports of others, anti-TRPV4 immunoreactivity was absent in 3T3 and HEK293 cells. It was, however, present, in the renal distal convoluted tubule cell line (14Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Google Scholar), mDCT, and in the renal inner medullary cell line, mIMCD3. As expected, abundant TRPV4 expression was detected in a HEK293 cell line stably transfected with TRPV4. To assess utility of the anti-TRPV4 antiserum in immunohistochemistry, and to confirm that the TRPV4 overexpression system exhibited membrane-associated immunoreactivity, anti-TRPV4 immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with wild-type HEK293 cells and with the TRPV4/HEK stable cell line studied in Fig. 2. Anti-TRPV4 confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated modest nonspecific staining in wild-type HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 D) and robust, primarily cell membrane-associated, expression in TRPV4/HEK stable transfectants (Fig.3 D). The effect of hypotonicity upon TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation was next examined in the native model of the mDCT cell line. Hypotonic stress (∼ 150 mosmol/kg H2O) resulted in robust time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPV4 in this model (Fig. 3 E), confirming that neither heterologous expression nor, potentially, overexpression, was required for this phenomenon. To ascertain in preliminary fashion the nature of this tyrosine phosphorylation event, a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was applied prior to hypotonic stress. The general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, only modestly inhibited the effect of hypotonicity whereas the Src family kinase-specific inhibitor, PP1, was more effective. In addition, this effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 4). Of note, piceatannol, which is reportedly specific for Syk (23Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29697-29703Google Scholar), a related cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase not belonging to the Src family (reviewed in Ref. 24Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Google Scholar), failed to influence tonicity-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggested in a preliminary fashion that tonicity-dependent activation of a Src family kinase may be responsible for TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation. To confirm our inference from the inhibitor data, we first sought a physical association between TRPV4 and members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. For these studies, the HEK293 heterologous expression model was used primarily because of the clean background afforded by the commercially available monoclonal anti-V5 antibody. (In most experiments, this antibody was covalently linked to Sepharose beads for immunoprecipitation because of the similarity in molecular mass between Src family protein-tyrosine kinases and immunoglobulin heavy chain.) Multiple Src family members were immunodetectable in the anti-V5 (anti-TRPV4) immunoprecipitates (Fig.5 A); the association between TRPV4 and both Lyn and Yes increased with duration of hypotonic stress. Of note, on immunoblots with anti-Src, a faint band co-migrating withbona fide Src was evident following anti-V5 immunoprecipitation even in untransfected HEK cells. The three antibodies in this panel are reported to be free from cross-reactivity with other Src family kinases in murine cells. Reciprocal experiments were performed (Fig. 5 B) wherein lysates prepared from untransfected and V5-TRPV4-transfected HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src family kinase antibodies and then immunoblotted with anti-V5. TRPV4 interaction with Lyn, Src, Fyn, Hck, Lck, and Yes was detected in this fashion. Only Lyn exhibited time-dependent interaction with TRPV4 such that the anti-V5 (i.e. anti-TRPV4) immunoreactivity in anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates was much stronger at 30 min than at time zero. These data suggested a physical interaction between TRPV4 and the Src family tyrosine kinases. To further support a physical interaction between these proteins, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with TRPV4, near total co-localization of TRPV4 with Lyn was observed (Fig. 6). This co-localization, however, was unaffected by up to 30 min of exposure to hypotonicity. In contrast, only a small fraction of immunodetectable TRPV4 exhibited co-localization with Src (data not shown). We next sought to confirm the interaction in the native mDCT system and to determine in preliminary fashion the Src family tyrosine kinase motif conferring interaction with TRPV4. Fyn was selected for these studies because of its constitutive interaction with TRPV4 by immunoprecipitation and because of the availability of agarose bead-bound deletion mutants of this kinase. Murine Fyn is a 534 (or 537 for FynT) amino acid Src family protein-tyrosine kinase containing three well described structural motifs: an SH3 domain (amino acids ∼87–141), an SH2 domain (amino acids ∼149–231), and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (amino acids ∼268–517). Agarose-conjugated SH3-SH2 from Fyn (absent the kinase domain) effectively affinity-precipitated TRPV4 from both the heterologous expression (V5-TRPV4-HEK293, Fig.7 A) and the native (mDCT, Fig.7 B) models. In both models, agarose-conjugated Fyn SH2 alone (Fyn-(145–247)) but not agarose-conjugated Fyn SH3 alone (Fyn-(85–139)) reproduced this effect (Fig. 7 C). These data suggested that the TRPV4-Src family tyrosine kinase interaction was mediated via the SH2 domain of the latter, presumably in conjunction with one or more cognate phosphotyrosine motifs on TRPV4. The ability of Src family tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate TRPV4 was next examined. HEK293 cells stably expressing V5-epitope-tagged TRPV4 were transiently transfected with wild-type Lyn, dominant negative-acting Lyn, or with vector alone. TRPV4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 and phosphorylation assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Overexpression of Lyn resulted in a marked increase in TRPV4 tyrosine phosphorylation under control conditions, which was even more evident in the presence of hypotonic stress (Fig.8). These data suggested that Lyn can phosphorylate TRPV4 in intact cells. Dominant negative-acting Lyn modestly but reproducibly suppressed tonicity-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV4 but did not eliminate it entirely, suggesting that Lyn is perhaps a principal kinase involved in this process. These data could not, however, demonstrate whether this effect was direct or indirect. We performed in vitro kinase assays to determine whether Lyn can directly phosphorylate TRPV4. We first confirmed that Lyn was activated in our model by hypotonic stress using an anti-Lyn immune complex kinase assay with acid-treated enolase as a substrate (Fig.9 A).

We have examined the effect of overexpression of full-length TRPC1, depletion of endogenous TRPC1, and expression of TRPC1 in which the proposed pore region (S5-S6, amino acids (aa) 557–620) was deleted or modified by site-directed mutagenesis on thapsigargin- and carbachol-stimulated SOCC activity in HSG cells.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 427-434Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). Two types of plasma membrane channels have been associated with this signaling mechanism; store-independent channels that appear to be activated as a result of PIP2 hydrolysis and store-operated Ca2+channels, SOCC, that are activated primarily in response to depletion of Ca2+ from the internal Ca2+ stores (3Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Google Scholar, 4Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) underlying activation and gating of these plasma membrane calcium channels as well as their molecular composition have remained elusive for more than a decade (5Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 6Putney Jr., J.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1991; 22: 251-269Google Scholar, 7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar). The most well characterized SOCC is the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channel (CRAC) that mediates the store-operated current ICRAC in mast cells and lymphocytes (8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar, 9Lewis R.S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Google Scholar). This channel has been reported to have a very high selectivity for Ca2+ and unique inactivation properties. SOCCs have also been described in a number of other cell types. Many of these display characteristics different from CRAC and from each other (7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar, 8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar). Based on the distinct activities seen in different cell types, it is likely that the molecular composition, or regulation, of their SOCCs is different.Members of the TRP superfamily of putative ion channel proteins have been suggested as components of SOCCs (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar). Although it is possible that some TRPVs or TRPMs might form SOCCs (11Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar, 12Schindl R. Kahr H. Graz I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26950-26958Google Scholar, 13Voets T. Prenen J.

Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Google Scholar, 4Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Google Scholar,14Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1)Google Scholar). It is now clear that some TRPCs, e.g. TRPC1 and TRPC4, allow plasma membrane Ca2+ influx in response to depletion of the internal Ca2+ store. Others, like TRPC3 and TRPC6, appear to be activated by PIP2 hydrolysis in a number of cell types. Compared with the other TRPCs, TRPC1 displays a relatively wider tissue distribution (15Zhu X.

Although these previous studies provide convincing evidence that TRPC1 has a critical role in SOCE, they do not elucidate whether TRPC1 serves as an essential regulatory subunit that is required for the assembly or regulation of the SOCCs in these cells or contributes more directly to the channel function per se,i.e. as a component of the pore-forming unit of the channel.We have previously suggested (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar) TRPC1 as a candidate for store-operated Ca2+ entry mechanism in the human submandibular gland cell line, HSG. We have also reported that the TRPC1 C terminus mediates Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of SOCE in HSG cells (18Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36483-36486Google Scholar, 23Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar). To elucidate whether TRPC1 is a regulatory subunit of SOCC or contributes more directly to SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx, here we have measured SOCE and SOCC activity in control HSG cells and in cells overexpressing either TRPC1 or TRPC1 with mutations in the proposed pore region. The data demonstrate that TRPC1 is required for generation of functional SOCC in HSG cells and that specific acidic aa residues in the proposed pore region of TRPC1 contribute to Ca2+ influx.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar, 18Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar) from our laboratory, and others, provide convincing evidence that TRPC1 has a critical role in SOCE. Based on the presently available data two possible roles can be assigned to TRPC1: (i) it is a regulatory subunit of SOCC that is required for its activation or assembly, and (ii) it is a component of the SOCC pore that directly contributes to SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. The data presented above suggest that TRPC1 is a functional component of an SOCC in HSG cells that contributes to Ca2+ influx in response to stimulation by either agonist or Tg. We have shown that the characteristics of SOCC activity generated by expression of TRPC1 in HSG cells are similar to the endogenous SOCC activity in these cells. Consistent with this, expression of TRPC1 in HSG cells induces an increase in the amplitude of the SOCC-mediated current, ISOC, without altering its characteristics (23Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). We have also shown here and previously (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar) that endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells is essential for SOCC activity. Tg- or CCh-stimulated SOCC activity, ISOC, and Ca2+ influx, as well as levels of endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells are decreased by 80% or more in cells transfected with antisense-TRPC1. More significant is our finding that acidic amino acid residues in the proposed pore region of TRPC1 contribute to SOCE. We have shown that expression of TRPC1 with simultaneous mutations (Asp → Asn and Glu → Gln) of seven acidic aa residues in the proposed pore region suppressed endogenous SOCC activity in more than 80% of the cells. In the few cells expressing this mutant where channel activity was detected, there was an apparent decrease in the Ca2+ conductance. Importantly, the amplitude of ISOC in these cells was decreased, and there was a left shift in the reversal potential, suggesting a decrease in the Ca2+ permeability of the channel. Interestingly, the Na+ current mediated by Mut-pore was similar to that seen in TRPC1-cells. Thus, mutations in the acidic aa residues in the pore region do not appear to decrease SOCC activity per se. We have also demonstrated that two of these seven acidic amino acid residues, Glu-576 and Asp-581, are involved in SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. Substitution of either residue, E576K or D581K, induced a suppression of Tg-stimulated SOCE and ISOC. Notably, Glu-576 and Glu-615 are conserved in TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, although Asp-581 is present only in TRPC1. Our data also rule out the possibility that a decrease in SOCC activity in cells expressing mutant TRPC1 proteins is due to differences in protein expression or altered localization. In aggregate, these data support the proposal that TRPC1 is a component of the functional (i.e. pore-forming) unit of SOCC, rather than an associated regulatory protein. Although it is possible that a single mutation in an extracellular domain of TRPC1 might alter its interaction with an as yet unknown SOCC protein and lead to a decrease in Ca2+influx via the channel, it is highly unlikely.Previous studies have shown that Asp → Asn substitution in the pore region of TRPV4 decreased Ca2+ influx, although Asp → Lys substitutions completely blocked channel function (29Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1020-1025Google Scholar). Substitution of conserved hydrophobic residues (LFW) in the TRPC6 pore region eliminated TRPC6-generated channel activity in HEK293 cells (30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar). However, neither of these channels appear to be involved in SOCE. While this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported (31Cui J. Bian J.-S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Google Scholar) that expression of TRPV6 with substitution of FEL to AAA in the proposed pore region induced suppression of endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells. However, it is not clear whether the endogenous TRPV6 in Jurkat cells is required for ICRAC. Furthermore, TRPV6 displayed both store-operated and store-independent activities. The data we have presented above are significant because they demonstrate the following: (i) endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells is required for the endogenous SOCE detected in these cells; (ii) expressed TRPC1 is regulated by store depletion and is not spontaneously active; and (iii) acidic aa residues in the pore region of TRPC1 contribute to SOCE.Although presently we do not have evidence for homo-multimerization of endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells, we have shown that the expressed mutant TRPC1 is immunoprecipitated with endogenous TRPC1. This result has major implications because it suggests that TRPC1 monomers interact with each other to form SOCC. Our data are consistent with reports suggesting that Drosophila TRP and TRPC1β homomultimerize via N-terminal interactions (32Engelke M. Friedrich O. Budde P. Schafer C. Niemann U. Zitt C. Jungling E. Rocks O. Luckhoff A. Frey J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 17 (193–199): 523Google Scholar, 33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar). We suggest that endogenous or exogenously expressed TRPC1 monomers associate with each other to form functional SOCCs. Thus, when full-length TRPC1 is expressed channel activity is increased. When mutant TRPC1s are overexpressed relative to the endogenous protein, the probability of mutant TRPC1 monomers associating with each other or with endogenous TRPC1 monomers is relatively high. As a result, aberrant SOCCs are formed which have decreased permeability for calcium. In contrast, in cells transfected with antisense TRPC1 or expressing TRPC1Δ567–793, where either depletion of TRPC1 or the pore region is deleted, respectively, there is a reduction in the total number of functional channels rather than a change in the channel properties. However, other proteins, including other TRPCs, might be co-assembled with endogenous TRPC1 and required for functional SOCC in HSG cells. Studies using heterologous expression have shown that TRPC1 interacts with TRPC3 (33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar, 34Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27799-277805Google Scholar), TRPC6 (30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar), and TRPC4 and TRPC5 (35Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar). The latter study also showed that endogenous heteromers of either TRPC1 and TRPC4 or TRPC1 and TRPC5 were co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain. TRPC1 expression altered the currents generated when either TRPC5 or TRPC4 was expressed alone, and furthermore, these currents were not activated by store depletion. Although it is unclear why TRPC1 forms different types of channels in different cells, it is important to note that the characteristics of the channel formed by heteromeric TRPC1 channels (35Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) appear to be considerably different from those of ISOCmeasured in HSG cells. Further studies will be required to determine which TRPC proteins are endogenously expressed in HSG cells and interact with endogenous TRPC1.In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that TRPC1 is a component of the functional (pore-forming) unit of SOCC in HSG cells. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that SOCC might be a heteromer of TRPC1 with other TRPCs (5Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar, 33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar, 34Lintschinger B.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) or with other as yet unknown protein(s). We have shown earlier that in HSG cells TRPC1, like the Drosophila TRP (14Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1)Google Scholar, 36Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Google Scholar), is assembled in a supramolecular protein complex with key proteins involved in the Ca2+ signaling cascade that leads to SOCC activation (26Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 11934-11942Google Scholar). We suggest that SOCC activity in any cell type will depend not only on the proteins that constitute its pore-forming unit but also other regulatory proteins that might affect its function, assembly, or localization. It will be important to determine whether differences in the molecular composition of the channel per se, or its regulation, account for the large variation in the characteristics of SOCCs seen in different cell types. Activation of cell surface receptors, which are coupled to inositol lipid signaling, results in phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2)1hydrolysis, generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores, and activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels (1Putney Jr., J.W.

Two types of plasma membrane channels have been associated with this signaling mechanism; store-independent channels that appear to be activated as a result of PIP2 hydrolysis and store-operated Ca2+channels, SOCC, that are activated primarily in response to depletion of Ca2+ from the internal Ca2+ stores (3Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Google Scholar, 4Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) underlying activation and gating of these plasma membrane calcium channels as well as their molecular composition have remained elusive for more than a decade (5Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 6Putney Jr., J.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1991; 22: 251-269Google Scholar, 7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar). The most well characterized SOCC is the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channel (CRAC) that mediates the store-operated current ICRAC in mast cells and lymphocytes (8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar, 9Lewis R.S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Google Scholar). This channel has been reported to have a very high selectivity for Ca2+ and unique inactivation properties. SOCCs have also been described in a number of other cell types. Many of these display characteristics different from CRAC and from each other (7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar, 8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar). Based on the distinct activities seen in different cell types, it is likely that the molecular composition, or regulation, of their SOCCs is different. Members of the TRP superfamily of putative ion channel proteins have been suggested as components of SOCCs (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Google Scholar). Although it is possible that some TRPVs or TRPMs might form SOCCs (11Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar, 12Schindl R. Kahr H. Graz I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26950-26958Google Scholar, 13Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Google Scholar), there are sufficient data to demonstrate that the TRPC family is involved in agonist-stimulated Ca2+ signaling (3Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Google Scholar, 4Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Google Scholar,14Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1)Google Scholar). It is now clear that some TRPCs, e.g. TRPC1 and TRPC4, allow plasma membrane Ca2+ influx in response to depletion of the internal Ca2+ store. Others, like TRPC3 and TRPC6, appear to be activated by PIP2 hydrolysis in a number of cell types. Compared with the other TRPCs, TRPC1 displays a relatively wider tissue distribution (15Zhu X. Chu P.B. Peyton M. Birnbaumer L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 193-198Google Scholar, 16Wang W. O'Connell B. Dykeman R. Sakai T. Delporte C. Swaim W. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J.

Although these previous studies provide convincing evidence that TRPC1 has a critical role in SOCE, they do not elucidate whether TRPC1 serves as an essential regulatory subunit that is required for the assembly or regulation of the SOCCs in these cells or contributes more directly to the channel function per se,i.e. as a component of the pore-forming unit of the channel. We have previously suggested (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar) TRPC1 as a candidate for store-operated Ca2+ entry mechanism in the human submandibular gland cell line, HSG. We have also reported that the TRPC1 C terminus mediates Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of SOCE in HSG cells (18Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36483-36486Google Scholar, 23Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar). To elucidate whether TRPC1 is a regulatory subunit of SOCC or contributes more directly to SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx, here we have measured SOCE and SOCC activity in control HSG cells and in cells overexpressing either TRPC1 or TRPC1 with mutations in the proposed pore region. The data demonstrate that TRPC1 is required for generation of functional SOCC in HSG cells and that specific acidic aa residues in the proposed pore region of TRPC1 contribute to Ca2+ influx. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar, 18Singh B.B. Liu X.

Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar) from our laboratory, and others, provide convincing evidence that TRPC1 has a critical role in SOCE. Based on the presently available data two possible roles can be assigned to TRPC1: (i) it is a regulatory subunit of SOCC that is required for its activation or assembly, and (ii) it is a component of the SOCC pore that directly contributes to SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. The data presented above suggest that TRPC1 is a functional component of an SOCC in HSG cells that contributes to Ca2+ influx in response to stimulation by either agonist or Tg. We have shown that the characteristics of SOCC activity generated by expression of TRPC1 in HSG cells are similar to the endogenous SOCC activity in these cells. Consistent with this, expression of TRPC1 in HSG cells induces an increase in the amplitude of the SOCC-mediated current, ISOC, without altering its characteristics (23Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). We have also shown here and previously (17Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Google Scholar) that endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells is essential for SOCC activity. Tg- or CCh-stimulated SOCC activity, ISOC, and Ca2+ influx, as well as levels of endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells are decreased by 80% or more in cells transfected with antisense-TRPC1. More significant is our finding that acidic amino acid residues in the proposed pore region of TRPC1 contribute to SOCE. We have shown that expression of TRPC1 with simultaneous mutations (Asp → Asn and Glu → Gln) of seven acidic aa residues in the proposed pore region suppressed endogenous SOCC activity in more than 80% of the cells. In the few cells expressing this mutant where channel activity was detected, there was an apparent decrease in the Ca2+ conductance. Importantly, the amplitude of ISOC in these cells was decreased, and there was a left shift in the reversal potential, suggesting a decrease in the Ca2+ permeability of the channel. Interestingly, the Na+ current mediated by Mut-pore was similar to that seen in TRPC1-cells. Thus, mutations in the acidic aa residues in the pore region do not appear to decrease SOCC activity per se. We have also demonstrated that two of these seven acidic amino acid residues, Glu-576 and Asp-581, are involved in SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. Substitution of either residue, E576K or D581K, induced a suppression of Tg-stimulated SOCE and ISOC. Notably, Glu-576 and Glu-615 are conserved in TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, although Asp-581 is present only in TRPC1. Our data also rule out the possibility that a decrease in SOCC activity in cells expressing mutant TRPC1 proteins is due to differences in protein expression or altered localization. In aggregate, these data support the proposal that TRPC1 is a component of the functional (i.e. pore-forming) unit of SOCC, rather than an associated regulatory protein. Although it is possible that a single mutation in an extracellular domain of TRPC1 might alter its interaction with an as yet unknown SOCC protein and lead to a decrease in Ca2+influx via the channel, it is highly unlikely.Previous studies have shown that Asp → Asn substitution in the pore region of TRPV4 decreased Ca2+ influx, although Asp → Lys substitutions completely blocked channel function (29Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1020-1025Google Scholar). Substitution of conserved hydrophobic residues (LFW) in the TRPC6 pore region eliminated TRPC6-generated channel activity in HEK293 cells (30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar). However, neither of these channels appear to be involved in SOCE. While this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported (31Cui J. Bian J.-S. Kagan A. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47175-47183Google Scholar) that expression of TRPV6 with substitution of FEL to AAA in the proposed pore region induced suppression of endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells. However, it is not clear whether the endogenous TRPV6 in Jurkat cells is required for ICRAC. Furthermore, TRPV6 displayed both store-operated and store-independent activities. The data we have presented above are significant because they demonstrate the following: (i) endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells is required for the endogenous SOCE detected in these cells; (ii) expressed TRPC1 is regulated by store depletion and is not spontaneously active; and (iii) acidic aa residues in the pore region of TRPC1 contribute to SOCE.Although presently we do not have evidence for homo-multimerization of endogenous TRPC1 in HSG cells, we have shown that the expressed mutant TRPC1 is immunoprecipitated with endogenous TRPC1. This result has major implications because it suggests that TRPC1 monomers interact with each other to form SOCC. Our data are consistent with reports suggesting that Drosophila TRP and TRPC1β homomultimerize via N-terminal interactions (32Engelke M. Friedrich O. Budde P. Schafer C. Niemann U. Zitt C. Jungling E. Rocks O. Luckhoff A. Frey J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 17 (193–199): 523Google Scholar, 33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar). We suggest that endogenous or exogenously expressed TRPC1 monomers associate with each other to form functional SOCCs. Thus, when full-length TRPC1 is expressed channel activity is increased. When mutant TRPC1s are overexpressed relative to the endogenous protein, the probability of mutant TRPC1 monomers associating with each other or with endogenous TRPC1 monomers is relatively high. As a result, aberrant SOCCs are formed which have decreased permeability for calcium. In contrast, in cells transfected with antisense TRPC1 or expressing TRPC1Δ567–793, where either depletion of TRPC1 or the pore region is deleted, respectively, there is a reduction in the total number of functional channels rather than a change in the channel properties. However, other proteins, including other TRPCs, might be co-assembled with endogenous TRPC1 and required for functional SOCC in HSG cells. Studies using heterologous expression have shown that TRPC1 interacts with TRPC3 (33Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar, 34Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27799-277805Google Scholar), TRPC6 (30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar), and TRPC4 and TRPC5 (35Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar). The latter study also showed that endogenous heteromers of either TRPC1 and TRPC4 or TRPC1 and TRPC5 were co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain. TRPC1 expression altered the currents generated when either TRPC5 or TRPC4 was expressed alone, and furthermore, these currents were not activated by store depletion. Although it is unclear why TRPC1 forms different types of channels in different cells, it is important to note that the characteristics of the channel formed by heteromeric TRPC1 channels (35Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) appear to be considerably different from those of ISOCmeasured in HSG cells. Further studies will be required to determine which TRPC proteins are endogenously expressed in HSG cells and interact with endogenous TRPC1.In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that TRPC1 is a component of the functional (pore-forming) unit of SOCC in HSG cells. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that SOCC might be a heteromer of TRPC1 with other TRPCs (5Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) or with other as yet unknown protein(s). We have shown earlier that in HSG cells TRPC1, like the Drosophila TRP (14Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1)Google Scholar, 36Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Google Scholar), is assembled in a supramolecular protein complex with key proteins involved in the Ca2+ signaling cascade that leads to SOCC activation (26Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 11934-11942Google Scholar). We suggest that SOCC activity in any cell type will depend not only on the proteins that constitute its pore-forming unit but also other regulatory proteins that might affect its function, assembly, or localization. It will be important to determine whether differences in the molecular composition of the channel per se, or its regulation, account for the large variation in the characteristics of SOCCs seen in different cell types.

Further studies will be required to determine which TRPC proteins are endogenously expressed in HSG cells and interact with endogenous TRPC1. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that TRPC1 is a component of the functional (pore-forming) unit of SOCC in HSG cells. However, these data do not rule out the possibility that SOCC might be a heteromer of TRPC1 with other TRPCs (5Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Google Scholar, 30Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) or with other as yet unknown protein(s). We have shown earlier that in HSG cells TRPC1, like the Drosophila TRP (14Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/90/re1)Google Scholar, 36Li H.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1411-1422Google Scholar), is assembled in a supramolecular protein complex with key proteins involved in the Ca2+ signaling cascade that leads to SOCC activation (26Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 11934-11942Google Scholar). We suggest that SOCC activity in any cell type will depend not only on the proteins that constitute its pore-forming unit but also other regulatory proteins that might affect its function, assembly, or localization. It will be important to determine whether differences in the molecular composition of the channel per se, or its regulation, account for the large variation in the characteristics of SOCCs seen in different cell types. We are grateful to Drs. Klaus Groschner, Martha Nowycky, and Michael Zhu for helpful comments during the preparation of this manuscript. We are also grateful to Dr. Mitchel Villereal for kindly providing us with antisense constructs for TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 and Dr. Craig Montell for the TRPC1-FLAG construct."

Cell Biol. 155, 41–51) that ryanodine receptors (RyR) are present on insulin-containing secretory vesicles. Here we show that pancreatic islets and derived β-cell lines express type I and II, but not type III, RyRs. Purified by subcellular fractionation and membrane immuno-isolation, dense core secretory vesicles were found to possess a similar level of type I RyR immunoreactivity as Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes but substantially less RyR II than the latter. Monitored in cells expressing appropriately targeted aequorins, dantrolene, an inhibitor of RyR I channels, elevated free Ca2+ concentrations in the secretory vesicle compartment from 40.1 ± 6.7 to 90.4 ± 14.8 μm(n = 4, p < 0.01), while having no effect on ER Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a novel Ca2+-mobilizing agent, decreased dense core secretory vesicle but not ER free Ca2+ concentrations in permeabilized MIN6 β-cells, and flash photolysis of caged NAADP released Ca2+ from a thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ store in single MIN6 cells. Because dantrolene strongly inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (from 3.07 ± 0.51-fold stimulation to no significant glucose effect;n = 3, p < 0.01), we conclude that RyR I-mediated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from secretory vesicles, possibly potentiated by NAADP, is essential for the activation of insulin secretion.

In the latter cell type, increases in [Ca2+]cusually occur as a result of either nutrient-induced influx of Ca2+ ions through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane (3Safayhi H. Haase H. Kramer U. Bihlmayer A. Roenfeldt M. Ammon H.P. Froschmayr M. Cassidy T.N. Morano I. Ahlijanian M.K. Striessnig J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 619-629Google Scholar) or via the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Wollheim C.B. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8314-8319Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Streb H. Bayerdorffer E. Haase W. Irvine R.F. Schulz I. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 81: 241-253Google Scholar, 6Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Google Scholar) probably represent the major Ca2+ stores in β-cells (8Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin.

Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51 Suppl. 1: 190-201Google Scholar) as in other cell types (11Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Google Scholar). However, we have recently provided evidence that dense core secretory vesicles also play a role in intracellular Ca2+signaling in β-cells (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar, 12Emmanouilidou E. Teschemacher A.G. Pouli A.E. Nicholls L.I. Seward E.P. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 915-918Google Scholar). Importantly, secretory vesicles occupy a substantial proportion of the intracellular volume of β-cells (13Dean P.M. Matthews E.K. J. Theor. Biol. 1975; 54: 309-321Google Scholar,14Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Google Scholar) and may contain close to half the total cellular Ca2+. As such, these organelles potentially provide a huge store of mobilizable Ca2+ ions (15Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Google Scholar). Previous studies involving measurements of intravesicular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]SV) and immunoelectron microscopy (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar) indicated that ryanodine, but not inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (11Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Google Scholar), receptors mediate Ca2+release from secretory vesicles in β-cells (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A.

A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding three RyR isoforms have so far been identified in mammals. The type I isoform (RyR I) is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle (17Marks A.R. Tempst P. Hwang K.S. Taubman M.B. Inui M. Chadwick C. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8683-8687Google Scholar), whereas RyR II is abundant in the heart (18Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamat Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Google Scholar). RyR III is present in a variety of tissues and cell types, most notably the brain (19Ledbetter M.W. Preiner J.K. Louis C.F. Mickelson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31544-31551Google Scholar). RyR II has been reported previously to be the most abundantly expressed isoform (at the mRNA level) in wild type (20Takasawa S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Kuroki M. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Kobayashi S. Kato I. Katada T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2497-2500Google Scholar) and ob/obmouse islets (20Takasawa S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Kuroki M. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Kobayashi S. Kato I. Katada T. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2497-2500Google Scholar, 21Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Google Scholar), as well as in rat islets (22Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar) and clonal βTC3 cells (22Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of RyR II protein has also been demonstrated in derived INS-1 β-cells (23Gamberucci A. Fulceri R. Pralong W. Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Watkins S.L. Benedetti A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 309-312Google Scholar). Lower levels of RyR I and RyR III mRNA have also been detected in βTC3 (22Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar) and HIT-T15 cells (24Taniguchi T. Yamada Y. Yasuda K. Kubota A. Ihara Y. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Watanabe R. Inada A. Seino Y. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 3: 135-138Google Scholar), respectively. However, the physiological role(s) of RyRs in β-cells remains unclear, given that RyR II mRNA levels inob/ob mouse islets are reportedly ∼1000-fold less than in the heart (21Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekstrom T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Google Scholar), whereas RyR II protein levels in INS-1 β-cells were ∼10-fold lower than in brain (23Gamberucci A. Fulceri R. Pralong W. Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Watkins S.L. Benedetti A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 309-312Google Scholar). Receptors for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a novel intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing agent (25Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Google Scholar), may represent an alternative pathway for Ca2+ efflux from dense core secretory vesicles (26Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Google Scholar). Although other studies (27Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Google Scholar, 28Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A.

Ondrias K. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 441: 674-677Google Scholar) have demonstrated NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in a variety of mammalian cells and cell lines, few data are currently available regarding the role of NAADP in the β-cell. Although functional NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores were recently revealed in human β-cells (31Johnson J.D. Misler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14566-14571Google Scholar), NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was not observed in dispersed β-cells from either normal or ob/ob mouse islets (32Tengholm A. Hellman B. Gylfe E. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 43-51Google Scholar). However, in the latter report, neither the RyR agonists caffeine and ryanodine nor cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr) induced Ca2+ release. In the present study, we show that islets and MIN6 β-cells express two RyR isoforms, RyR I and RyR II, that display distinct subcellular localizations. Thus, whereas type I RyRs are present at approximately equal density in a vesicle/mitochondrial fraction, and in microsomes, RyR II was considerably more abundant on ER membranes. Surprisingly, dantrolene, a selective inhibitor of RyR I, increased steady-state free [Ca2+] in secretory vesicles but not in the ER, suggesting the presence on vesicles of a further activator or channel capable of amplifying the effects of RyRs on Ca2+ release. We provide evidence that receptors for NAADP may serve this role, and we thus demonstrate that secretory vesicles, but not the ER, are an NAADP-responsive Ca2+ store in β-cells. MIN6 cells, a well differentiated mouse insulinoma β-cell line (33Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Google Scholar) (passages 20–30), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose and 2 mmpyruvate, and supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 20 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 (9Mitchell K.J.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Google Scholar). For [Ca2+] measurements with recombinant aequorins (see below), cells were seeded onto 13-mm diameter poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and grown to 50–80% confluency. Cells were then infected with Cyt.Aq, VAMP.Aq, or ER.Aq adenoviruses encoding untargeted aequorin (Cyt.Aq) (35Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Google Scholar) or aequorin targeted to either the secretory vesicles (VAMP.Aq) (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar) or the ER (ER.Aq) (36Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Google Scholar), at a multiplicity of infection of 30 infectious units per cell. Measurements of aequorin bioluminescence were performed using a purpose-built photomultiplier system 48 h after infection, as described previously (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar, 37Rutter G.A. Theler J.M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines or rat tissue using TRI ReagentTM (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR amplification was performed with primers designed to amplify an isoform-specific region of each of the three RyR subtypes (38Fitzsimmons T.J. Gukovsky I. McRoberts J.A. Rodriguez E. Lai F.A. Pandol S.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 265-271Google Scholar) as follows: RyR I (forward, 5′-GAAGGTTCTGGACAAACACGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGCTCTTGTTGTAGAATTTGCGG-3′); RyR II (forward, 5′-GAATCAGTGAGTTACTGGGCATGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGGTCTCTGAGTTCTCCAAAAGC-3′); and RyR III (forward, 5′-CCTTCGCTATCAACTTCATCCTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTTCTACTGGGCTAAAGTCAAGG-3′). The PCR mix consisted of 5 μl of 10× Buffer 3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 6 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 0.25 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 μl of reverse transcriptase-PCR cDNA, 0.4 μm forward primer, 0.4 μmreverse primers, and distilled H2O, at a final volume of 50 μl. Amplification conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 2 min and then 94 °C for 45 s, 55.5 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 32 cycles and then 72 °C for 10 min. Negative controls were performed by omission of the reverse transcription step or by exclusion of the template from the PCR. PCR products were separated by migration on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. Products were excised and purified using a QIAQuickTM gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subjected to restriction digest analysis and automated sequencing. Total RNA from rat islets, skeletal muscle, or heart was reverse-transcribed, and semi-quantitative PCR was performed in the following mix: 5 μl of 10× Buffer 3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 6 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 0.25 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 μl of reverse transcriptase-PCR cDNA, 0.4 μm RyR I or RyR II primers, 0.1 μm β-actin primers (39Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Google Scholar), and distilled H2O at a final volume of 50 μl. Semi-quantitative PCR was then performed as follows: RyR I primers, 94 °C for 2 min and then 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 25 cycles and then 72 °C for 10 min; RyR II primers, 94 °C for 2 min and then 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 20 cycles and then 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification in the linear phase was confirmed in each case by trials with 12–30 cycles (data not shown). MIN6 cells or homogenized rat skeletal muscle were extracted into radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, consisting of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Secretory vesicle protein was obtained by immunoadsorption of phogrin.EGFP-containing vesicles (40Varadi A. Ainscow E.K. Allan V.J. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4177-4189Google Scholar). In brief, MIN6 cells infected with phogrin.EGFP were homogenized, and the nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation. Pre-cleared homogenate was then incubated with anti-GFP antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) bound to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoadsorbed vesicles were washed then incubated at 99 °C for 10 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer to dissociate vesicle proteins. To generate MIN6 membrane fractions, cells were harvested in Tris-saline buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.14 mNaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% (v/v) Tween 40. Fractions were collected by differential centrifugation using the following spins: 200 ×g for 10 min, nuclear fraction; 15,000 × gfor 5 min, mitochondrial/secretory vesicle fraction; 100,000 ×g for 1 h, plasma membrane, ER, Golgi fraction; supernatant from 100,000 × g spin, cytosolic fraction. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised to a RyR I-specific sequence of 15 amino acids (residues 830–845; RREGPRGPHLVGPSRC) that is 100% conserved in all known mammalian RyRI sequences and absent from the mammalian RyR II and III sequences. Rabbits (New Zealand White) were immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide as described previously (41Tunwell R.E. Wickenden C. Bertrand B.M. Shevchenko V.I. Walsh M.B. Allen P.D. Lai F.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 477-487Google Scholar), and antibody specificity was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis with brain, skeletal, and cardiac muscle microsomes, prepared as described previously (41Tunwell R.E. Wickenden C. Bertrand B.M. Shevchenko V.I. Walsh M.B. Allen P.D. Lai F.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 477-487Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, microsomes were separated on a 5% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel (30 μg of protein/lane), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane before probing with antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. Affinity-purified antibody (anti-RyR I; number 2142) was prepared by acid elution following incubation of the crude RyR I antisera either with skeletal muscle RyR protein immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane strips or on protein A-agarose columns (Sigma). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 5% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) following a standard protocol. Membranes were probed with anti-skeletal muscle RyR antibody (1:2500; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-RyR I (1:500; number 2142), anti-RyR II (1:200; Affinity BioReagents), and anti-RyR III antibodies (1:500; number 110E) (42Airey J.A.

Immunostaining was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:100 000), anti-mouse IgG (Sigma; 1:10,000), or anti-sheep IgG (Dako; 1:4000) using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were depleted of Ca2+ by incubation with ionomycin (10 μm), monensin (10 μm), and cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm) in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB: 140 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, for 10 min at 4 °C (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar). Aequorin was reconstituted with 5 μm coelenterazine n(43Shimomura O. Kishi Y. Inouye S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 549-551Google Scholar) for 1–2 h at 4 °C in KRB supplemented with 1 mm EGTA. Intact cells were perifused with KRB plus additions as stated at 2 ml·min−1 in a thermostatted chamber (37 °C) in close proximity to a photomultiplier tube (ThornEMI) (44Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin for 1 min at 37 °C and subsequently perifused in intracellular buffer (IB: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm sodium succinate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.05). Additions to this buffer were as stated in the figure legends. At the end of all experiments cells were lysed in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (100 μm digitonin, 10 mm Ca2+ in H20) to discharge the remaining aequorin pool for calibration of the aequorin signal (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were seeded onto 24 mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and microinjected, as previously described (45Rutter G.A. White M.R. Tavare J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 890-899Google Scholar, 46Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Google Scholar, 47Kennedy H.J. Pouli A.E. Ainscow E.K. Jouaville L.S. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13281-13291Google Scholar), with Oregon Green 488 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-1 dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 2.5 mg·ml−1) in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in the absence (control) or presence of 2 μm caged NAADP (48Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Luigia Santella, University of Naples). The concentration of caged NAADP in the microinjection pipette was 2 μm, resulting in a final intracellular concentration of 50–150 nm, given an injection volume of 2.5–7.5% of the total cell volume (49Rutter G.A. Kennedy H.J. Wood C.D. White M.R. Tavare J.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R285-R290Google Scholar). 2–4 h after microinjection, cells were imaged on a Leica TCS-SP2 laser-scanning confocal illumination system attached to a Leica DM IRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope, using a 63× PL Apo 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm (argon laser), and fluorescence was detected at wavelengths longer than 515 nm using a long pass cut-off filter at this wavelength. A second laser (CoherentTM) provided light for 1 s at wavelengths of 351 and 364 nm (via the objective lens) and was used for photolysis of caged NAADP at selected regions of interest within the cell (corresponding to ∼1% of the surface of the confocal slice). Images were acquired at 5-s intervals before and after the UV pulse. Where indicated, ER/Golgi Ca2+ stores were depleted of Ca2+ by washing the cells in Ca2+-free KRB and incubation in Ca2+-free KRB supplemented with 1 μm thapsigargin, 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid, and 1 mm EGTA for 10 min. Cells were then maintained in Ca2+-free KRB during confocal imaging and photorelease of NAADP. MIN6 cells were incubated in full growth medium (see above) containing 3 mm glucose for 16 h and then incubated in KRB supplemented with 3 mmglucose for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed and retained, and cells were then stimulated with KRB supplemented with 30 mm glucose for a further 30 min at 37 °C. Released and total insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay (34Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Google Scholar). Free [Ca2+] was calculated using METLIG software (50Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 181-189Google Scholar). Data represent the means ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test. Using isoform-specific primers, PCR products corresponding to RyR I and RyR II cDNA were readily amplified from MIN6-, INS1-, or rat islet-derived cDNAs (data not shown). By contrast, RyR III cDNA was not amplified from these sources using the chosen primer pair (see “Experimental Procedures”), although RyR III from brain cDNA was amplified, as expected. The identity of each of the generated PCR products was confirmed by both restriction analysis and by automatic sequencing, which revealed 100% identity with the corresponding mouse (GenBankTM accession numbers X83932 and AF295105 for RyR I and RyR II, respectively) and rat (GenBankTM accession numbers AF130879 and U95157) cDNAs. Semi-quantitative PCR revealed ∼5-fold lower RyR I mRNA levels in rat islet-derived than in skeletal muscle-derived cDNA, and RyR II mRNA levels were ∼8-fold lower in islet than in heart cDNA (data not shown). In order to confirm the presence, and identify the intracellular localization, of RyRs in MIN6 β-cells, subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting (Western) was performed. Probing of crude MIN6 cell fractions with a subtype-specific RyR antibody, which recognizes type I (and III) isoforms, indicated similar levels of RyR immunoreactivity in both mitochondrial/dense core secretory vesicle and microsomal fractions (Fig. 1 A,upper panel). By contrast, RyR II immunoreactivity was much more abundant on the latter fraction, with only weak staining for RyR II in the crude vesicle/mitochondria fraction (Fig. 1 A,lower panel). To demonstrate that RyR I immunoreactivity was present on secretory vesicles in the crude secretory vesicle/mitochondrial fraction examined above, immunoblotting was also performed with immunopurified dense core secretory vesicles (40Varadi A. Ainscow E.K. Allan V.J. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4177-4189Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity toward both anti-RyR I/III, and to a selective anti-RyR I antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”), was clearly evident in these membranes (Fig. 1 B, upper panels), whereas reactivity to RyR III (Fig. 1 B,lower panel) was undetectable. The above fractionation studies indicated that the relative abundance of type I/type II RyRs was higher in secretory vesicles than the ER but provided no information on the relative abundance of the two isoforms on either membrane, considered alone. To determine the relative importance of RyR I and RyR II on each organelle, we therefore used a functional approach in living MIN6 cells. Recombinant aequorins, targeted specifically to either organelle by the addition of appropriate presequences (9Mitchell K.J. Pinton P. Varadi A. Tacchetti C. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 41-51Google Scholar), were utilized to monitor free Ca2+ concentrations in each compartment. Concentrations of ryanodine (10 μm) expected to lead to closure of all RyR isoforms (51Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Google Scholar) substantially raised the steady-state concentrations of free Ca2+ in both the secretory vesicle matrix ([Ca2+]SV) and the ER lumen ([Ca2+]ER) (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, the skeletal muscle relaxant dantrolene (52Van Winkle W.B. Science. 1976; 193: 1130-1131Google Scholar) significantly increased [Ca2+]SV (from 40.1 ± 6.7 to 90.4 ± 14.8 μm; n = 4,p < 0.01; Fig. 2 C), whereas neither [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2 D) nor [Ca2+]c (Fig. 2 E) was affected by this agent. These findings are in agreement with previous studies where dantrolene was shown to bind directly to and inhibit pig and rabbit skeletal muscle (types I and III), but not cardiac (type II), RyRs (52Van Winkle W.B. Science. 1976; 193: 1130-1131Google Scholar, 53Paul-Pletzer K. Palnitkar S.S. Jimenez L.S. Morimoto H. Parness J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 531-542Google Scholar, 54Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Google Scholar, 55Zhao F. Li P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Google Scholar), suggesting that dantrolene inhibits the type I, but not the type II, RyR in MIN6 β-cells. The above results suggest that although ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ efflux from secretory vesicles is likely to be mediated principally via type I RyRs, this channel subtype apparently plays a minor role, if any, in mediating Ca2+release from the ER in MIN6 β-cells. This result was unexpected given that subcellular fractions enriched with ER membranes apparently contained the same amount or more immunoreactivity to RyR I as a crude secretory vesicle/mitochondria fraction (Fig. 1 A,upper panel). One simple explanation of this observation is that the absolute number of type II RyRs on the ER is very much greater than type I receptors, a difference that may not be apparent given the different antibodies and dilutions used to quantitate each of these isoforms (Fig. 1). However, as an alternative explanation, we next explored the possibility that another Ca2+ release channel may be functional on secretory vesicles, whose presence may stimulate the activity of neighboring RyR I channels. The effects on [Ca2+]SV of the recently identified Ca2+-mobilizing molecule NAADP (25Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Google Scholar, 56Chini E.N. Beers K.W. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3216-3223Google Scholar) were therefore examined in permeabilized cells at a concentration of this compound previously shown to be optimal in human β-cells (31Johnson J.D. Misler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14566-14571Google Scholar) and other mammalian cell types (26Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Google Scholar). 100 nm NAADP caused a small but highly significant decrease in [Ca2+]SV (Fig.3 A) but was completely without effect on [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the effects of NAADP may be mediated by a receptor identical or similar to"

In this study, we found that although both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are able to interact with ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) Mdm2, only expression of β-arrestin2 leads to the relocalization of Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Further study reveals that β-arrestin2 but not β-arrestin1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a leptomycin B-sensitive manner. A hydrophobic amino acid-rich region (VXXXFXXLXL) at the C terminus of β-arrestin2 was further demonstrated to serve as a nuclear export signal responsible for the extranuclear localization of β-arrestin2. In the corresponding region of β-arrestin1, there is a single amino acid difference (Glu instead of Leu in β-arrestin2), and mutation of Glu to Leu conferred to β-arrestin1 similar subcellular distribution to that of β-arrestin2. Moreover, data from a series of deletion mutations demonstrated that the N domain (residues 1–185) was indispensable for the nuclear localization of both β-arrestins, and the results from a Val to Asp point mutation in the N domain also supported this notion. In addition, our data showed that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of β-arrestin2 was required, via protein/protein interaction, for the cytoplasmic relocalization of Mdm2 and JNK3, another well known β-arrestin2-binding protein. Our study thus suggests that both the nuclear export signal motif and the N domain of β-arrestins are critical for the regulation of their subcellular localization and that β-arrestin2 may modulate the function of its binding partners such as Mdm2 and JNK3 by alteration of their subcellular distribution. β-Arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 play a key role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling, whereas the subcellular distribution of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 has been shown to be quite different.

G protein-coupled receptors nuclear export signal leptomycin B extracellular signal-regulated kinase 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP β-arrestin1 β-arrestin2 human embryonic kidney mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 a large cellular membrane receptor family comprised of more than a thousand members, mediate many physiological functions. Agonist binding to GPCRs results in both the initiation of cellular signaling and the receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Arrestins were originally discovered to bind to the phosphorylated GPCRs and function in regulation of the desensitization and internalization of these receptors (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar, 2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351Google Scholar). To date, at least four members of the arrestin gene family have been identified: visual arrestin, cone arrestin, and two β-arrestins (β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2). Visual arrestin and cone arrestin have specialized functions due to their limited localization to the retina, whereas β-arrestins are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues (3Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Google Scholar, 4Yamaki K. Takahashi Y. Sakuragi S. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 904-910Google Scholar, 5Murakami A.

Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are two highly homologous proteins (sharing 78% identity in amino acid composition), and both of them rapidly translocate from the cytoplasm to cell plasma membrane when GPCRs are stimulated. Binding of either β-arrestin to the activated GPCRs can disassociate G proteins from the receptors and thus quench the receptor signaling. In addition, both β-arrestins effectively regulate the internalization of many GPCRs by direct interaction with AP2 and clathrin (7Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-37127Google Scholar, 8Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar). Although β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 perform similar functions in the regulation of GPCR signaling, some differences between them have been reported such as in their binding affinity to different classes of GPCRs (9Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Google Scholar) and in their association with different binding partners (10Miller W.E. McDonald P.H. Cai S.F. Field M.E. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27770-27777Google Scholar). One of the well established differences is their subcellular localization. It is reported that when expressed in HEK293 and HeLa cells, β-arrestin1 is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but β-arrestin2 is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm (9Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Google Scholar, 11Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar). In addition, a very recent study (11Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar) shows that two β-arrestins shuttle differentially between the nucleus and cytoplasm due to the presence of a two-leucine nuclear export signal (NES) in β-arrestin2 that is absent in β-arrestin1. However, the molecular determinant of their nuclear import remains to be further investigated. Novel functions of β-arrestins, such as regulation of the cytoskeletal reorganization via association with Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (Ral-GDS) (12Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Babwah A.V. Dale L.B. Dobransky T. Benovic J.L. Feldman R.D. Verdi J.M. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 547-555Google Scholar) and enhancement of the CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis (13Sun Y. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49219Google Scholar), have been reported recently. One of the most exciting findings is that β-arrestins can serve as a scaffold protein to regulate the functions of ERK and JNK3 cascades by directly interacting with these kinases. For example, β-arrestin2 can simultaneously associate with ERK and its upstream Raf or JNK3 and its upstream ASK1 and thus effectively promotes GPCR-mediated activation of these kinases. Moreover, the interaction of β-arrestin2 with its binding partners such as ERKs and JNK3 can lead to the relocalization of the kinases in the cytoplasm (14Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar). Consequently, the cytoplasmic retention of ERKs inhibits activation of the transcription factor Elk (15Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Google Scholar). Recently, Mdm2, a well known ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) for p53, has been shown to regulate the trafficking of β 2-adrenergic receptor via its direct interaction with β-arrestin2 (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar, 17.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). However, whether the interaction of Mdm2/β-arrestin2 affects the subcellular distribution of Mdm2 remains unclear. Leptomycin B (LMB) and DAPI were obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (12CA5), recognizing influenza HA epitope, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes. Protein-A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-β-arrestin polyclonal antibody was produced in our lab as described (18Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhou T.H. Cen B. Guo S.Q. Pei G. Sheng Wu Hua Hsueh Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Hsueh Pao. 1999; 31: 344-346Google Scholar). Construction of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 expression vectors was described previously (18Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhou T.H. Cen B. Guo S.Q. Pei G. Sheng Wu Hua Hsueh Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Hsueh Pao. 1999; 31: 344-346Google Scholar). pEGFP-N (GFP fused to the N terminus of the targeted protein) was generated by inserting the EGFP coding sequence into HindIII andBamHI sites of pcDNA3. pEGFP-C (EGFP fused to the C terminus of the targeted protein) was generated by inserting the EGFP coding sequence into XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3. All GFP fusion proteins used were constructed using these two plasmids as vector. βarr2-GFP was generated by subcloning the full-length cDNA fragment of human β-arrestin2 into theBamHI and NotI sites of pEGFP-N. βarr1-GFP was created by subcloning full-length human β-arrestin1 cDNA fragments into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pEGFP-N. HA-tagged β-arrestins were generated by subcloning the full-length human β-arrestins cDNA fragments into the pcDNA3-containing coding sequence of HA epitope. Mutant constructs were made by mutating Ile-386, Val-387, Phe-388, Phe-391, Leu-394, Leu-396, and Met-399 of β-arrestin2 to Ala by a PCR-based strategy. To detect the subcellular localization of different parts of β-arrestins, each fragment was amplified by PCR using specific primers that contained recognition sequences for specific restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and inserted into theBamHI-NotI sites of pEGFP-C. The GFP-Mdm2 construct was created by inserting the mouse Mdm2 cDNA fragment (amplified from mouse brain by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) strategy) into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pEGFP-N. An NES mutant of Mdm2 was made by mutating two critical leucines of its NES (Leu-190 and Leu-192) to alanine by PCR-based strategy. GFP-JNK3 construct was made by inserting the JNK3 cDNA fragment into BamHI and XhoI sites of pEGFP-N. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Human Saos2 (osteosarcomal) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Plasmids were transiently transfected in the cells using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (19Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Google Scholar). For the subcellular localization studies of the different GFP fusion proteins, cells were plated onto coverslips in 12-well dishes 16 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of expression vectors for the different GFP fusions. To examine the subcellular localization by DAPI staining, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C, and the DNA was stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI for 2 min at room temperature. HA-tagged arrestins were detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. 24 h after transfection, and the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The fixed cells were incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with the anti-HA antibody (diluted 1:200 in blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature. The immunostaining was developed using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:100 in blocking solution). Visualization was with an Olympus microscope (×60 oil or ×100 oil immersion lens) equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured with a CCD camera and analyzed with the Spot Advanced software. Various HA-β-arrestin constructs were cotransfected with GFP-Mdm2 plasmid. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody for 2 h. Immune complexes were immobilized on protein-A-Sepharose beads for 3 h, washed three times with Lysis buffer, and heated in SDS sample buffer in 50 °C water bath for 20 min. Lysates from cells (48 h after transfection) were boiled for 5 min in Sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). Aliquots containing 30 μg of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins resolved were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-HA primary and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The full length of human β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, respectively, fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse fetal brain complementary DNA library, and Mdm2 was thus identified as a binding partner of both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the abilities of both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 to bind Mdm2 in intact cells (Fig. 1 A), consistent with the recent report (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar). To investigate the potential biological significance of Mdm2/β-arrestin interaction, Mdm2 was fused to GFP at the N terminus (GFP-Mdm2), and the effects of Mdm2/β-arrestin interaction on the subcellular localization of Mdm2 is examined. GFP-Mdm2 was predominantly localized in the nucleus when expressed in Saos2 cells (Fig. 1 B); β-arrestin1 was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas β-arrestin2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (data not shown). No change in the subcellular localization of Mdm2 was observed when Mdm2 was coexpressed with β-arrestin1. However, in strong contrast, coexpression of Mdm2 with β-arrestin2 resulted in a dramatic redistribution of Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig.1 C). The molecular determinant of the differential effects of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 on the subcellular localization of Mdm2 was analyzed next. At first, we tested whether the relocalization of Mdm2 was a result of the enhancement of the Mdm2 export from the nucleus by its interaction with β-arrestin2. Mutant Mdm2 with L190A/L192A substitutions (Mdm2NES−), which greatly impairs export of Mdm2 from the nucleus (20Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Google Scholar), was used in this study. Mdm2NES− was mainly localized in the nucleus when expressed alone (data not shown). However, coexpression with β-arrestin2 caused the significant relocalization of the mutated Mdm2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm (Fig. 2). This result clearly indicates that the relocalization of Mdm2 by β-arrestin2 was independent of the nuclear export of Mdm2. Next, we tested whether the relocalization of Mdm2 by expression of β-arrestin2 is affected by LMB, an antifungal antibiotic, which binds directly and irreversibly to CRM1 and inhibits NES-mediated active nuclear export (21Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Google Scholar, 22Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, Mdm2 was accumulated in the cells coexpressing β-arrestin2 and Mdm2 following LMB treatment since β-arrestin2 was detained in the nucleus by the LMB treatment (Fig. 2). This result strongly suggests that interaction of β-arrestin2 and Mdm2 modulates the nucleus/cytoplasm equilibrium of Mdm2. To further study the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of β-arrestins, we fused GFP to the C termini of β-arrestin1 (βarr1-GFP) and β-arrestin2 (βarr2-GFP). When transiently transfected into Saos2, βarr1-GFP was distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas βarr2-GFP was excluded from the nucleus in most of the transfected cells. Treatment with 5 ng/ml LMB induced the significant nuclear accumulation of βarr2-GFP fusion protein. In contrast, LMB exerted no significant effect on the subcellular distribution of βarr1-GFP (Fig.3 A). A similar result was also obtained using HA-β-arrestins in HEK293 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that β-arrestin2 but not β-arrestin1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in an LMB-sensitive manner. In addition, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of native β-arrestins in HeLa cells was also investigated through immunostaining with the specific anti-β-arrestin antibody that recognizes both β-arrestins. Under resting conditions, endogenous β-arrestins were distributed throughout the HeLa cells with a preferential cytoplasmic localization. LMB treatment induced significant nuclear accumulation of β-arrestins (Fig. 3 B), indicating that endogenous β-arrestins constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm by a mechanism involving a functional cis-acting, LMB-sensitive NES or via an NES-containing interaction partner. Usually, nuclear export in an LMB-sensitive manner depends on a functional NES, and a typical NES possesses a leucine- or other hydrophobic residue-rich motif (23Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Google Scholar). When we compared the amino acid sequence of β-arrestin2 with the reported functional NES sequences (Fig. 4 A), a 10-residue region (residues 385–396) in β-arrestin2 was revealed to constitute a hydrophobic motif similar to the reported NES. To test whether this region is a functional NES of β-arrestin2, we attached the C-terminal peptide (residues 384–409) of β-arrestin2 containing this putative NES to the C terminus of GFP (GFP-C26). As shown in Fig.4 B, GFP, when expressed alone, was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm with slightly more accumulation in the nucleus. In contrast, GFP-C26 showed an evident nuclear exclusion of fluorescence in the cells, and this was reversed by the LMB treatment (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, deletion of the C terminus (residues 384–409) of β-arrestin2 resulted in a significant nuclear accumulation of β-arrestin2 (data not shown). To define the critical residues in the NES motif of β-arrestin2 in addition to the two leucine residues known (11Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar), each of seven hydrophobic residues in the putative NES was replaced with alanine (Fig. 4 C). The β-arrestin2 mutant with Phe-391, Leu-394, or Leu-396 replaced failed to shuttle to the cytoplasm, whereas replacement of Ile-386, Phe-388, or Met-399 produced no change in localization of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 4 D). The V387A mutant behaved in between the above two mutant groups, showing a partial impairment of the NES function (Fig. 4 D). In addition, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of β-arrestin2 mutants R393A and R395A and the clathrin-binding-deficient β-arrestin2 mutant of AAEA (24Krupnick J.G. Goodman O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Google Scholar) was not altered (data not shown). These data strongly support the notion that the whole hydrophobic motif VXXXFXXLXL serves as the functional NES in β-arrestin2. The above results showed that residue Leu-394 was critical for the extranuclear localization of β-arrestin2, and the sequence inspection revealed that the Leu-394 residue is the only different residue among the 7 hydrophobic residues between β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin1 in the region. In β-arrestin1 and visual arrestin, Leu is substituted by Gln at the corresponding site. To determine whether this single amino acid difference determines the differential nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, we generated βarr2L394Q and βarr1Q394L mutants. In contrast to the wild type β-arrestin2, βarr2L394Q was accumulated in the nucleus, and its distribution was insensitive to LMB treatment (Fig. 5). In contrast to the wild type β-arrestin1, βarr1Q394L was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and LMB treatment induced its nuclear accumulation (Fig. 5). Thus, the exchange of a single amino acid between β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin1 can totally convert their subcellular localization, and this result is consistent with the very recent report (11Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar) that Leu/Gln difference at the C terminus of β-arrestin plays a critical role in differential shuttling of β-arrestin2 and β-arrestin1. Proteins larger than 40–60 kDa cannot enter into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex by passive diffusion. GFP-β-arrestins have an apparent molecular mass of about 82 kDa and are apparently too large to diffuse into the nucleus. Thus, it seems logical to assume that β-arrestins may contain a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) or may be transported via interaction with a partner protein containing an NLS. To test the assumption, a series of deletion mutants of β-arrestin2 was created via a GFP fusion protein (Fig. 6 A), and expression of those GFP-fused proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The β-arrestin2 mutants with deletion of its N terminus (residues 1–185) were primarily present in the cytoplasm whether with (data not shown) or without a functional NES (Fig.6 B). In strong contrast, the N-terminal fragment (residues 1–185) of β-arrestin2, which contains the intact N domain of β-arrestin2, was exclusively distributed in the nucleus, clearly indicating that the N terminus of β-arrestin2 contains an essential and sufficient structure for its nuclear localization. The results from β-arrestin1 mutants (β-arrestin11–184 and β-arrestin1185–418) also supported the notion (Fig.6 C). The further attempt to map down the NLS in the region, however, failed to define a classical NLS structure with a motif no larger than 20 amino acids (Fig. 6 B). The mutations of several Lys and Arg residues in the region did not provide any detailed information about the putative NLS (data not shown). We then tested the subcellular distribution of mutant β-arrestin2 with a V54D point mutation in the N domain (βarr2V54D), a widely used dominant negative mutant that inhibits the internalization of GPCRs. Although βarr2V54D was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm in Saos2 cells, the LMB treatment exerted no effect on its subcellular distribution even after longer treatment as compared with the wild type β-arrestin2 (Fig. 6 D). This result not only supports that the structural integrity of N domain is important for the nuclear import of β-arrestin2 but also implies that the N domain of β-arrestin2 may interact with other partner proteins to facilitate its nuclear import. Whether differential nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of two β-arrestins contributes to their different effects on the localization of Mdm2 was further examined. Unlike its wild type counterpart, βarr2L394Q was localized in the nucleus; coexpression of βarr2L394Q with Mdm2 resulted in accumulation of Mdm2 in the nucleus, in contrast to what was observed following coexpression of the wild type β-arrestin2 (Fig. 7 A). This is unlikely to be a result of the impairment of the interaction between βarr2L394Q and Mdm2 since their interaction was not affected by the mutation (data not shown). In addition, the coexpression of βarr1Q394L with Mdm2 also evidently relocalized Mdm2 in the cytoplasm in contrast to the wild type β-arrestin1 (Fig. 7 A). It was reported that the binding to β-arrestin2 keeps JNK3 outside the nucleus (14Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar). We therefore studied the effect of the nuclear import and export of β-arrestin2 on the subcellular localization of JNK3. When expressed alone, JNK3 was distributed evenly in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and coexpression with β-arrestin2 caused the significant extranuclear localization of JNK3 (Fig. 7 B), in good agreement with a previous report (14Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar). When co-expressed with βarr2V54D, JNK3 translocated to the cytoplasm, where it co-localized with βarr2V54D, whereas coexpression of βarr2L394Q did not change the JNK3 localization (Fig. 7 B). Thus, our data indicate that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of β-arrestins modulates subcellular distribution of its binding partner Mdm2 and JNK3. β-Arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 play a critical role in the regulation of the signaling of GPCRs, and accumulating evidence demonstrates that the functions of β-arrestins depend on their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The current study clearly demonstrated that β-arrestins, either endogenous or exogenous, could effectively enter the nucleus, and this is likely mediated by its interaction with an NLS-containing partner since no classical nuclear import sequence was identified in β-arrestins. A similar mechanism has been reported for other regulatory proteins. For example, β-catenin is imported into the nucleus via its interaction with the lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) transcription factor (25Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Google Scholar, 26Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Google Scholar). In addition, our study also established that the N terminus of β-arrestins is essential and sufficient for their nuclear localization. Therefore, it can be speculated that the assumed partner with a functional NLS binds to the N terminus of β-arrestins, and thus, the complex is imported into the nucleus. However, these partners of β-arrestins remain to be identified. The crystal structures of visual arrestin and β-arrestin1 show that a typical arrestin molecule has a central polar core flanked by the N and C domains and a C-terminal tail connecting the two domains (27Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Google Scholar, 28Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of β-arrestin2 is not yet available, it is very likely to possess a similar conformation since two arrestins share a high homology in their amino acid sequences. Our current study has shown that the N terminus of β-arrestins, which contains the intact N domain (residues 6–172 in β-arrestin1), is fully responsible for their nuclear localization. It has been shown that the N domain is more flexible and shares a higher degree of homology than other domains or whole proteins among different arrestins. Moreover, the N domain contains the binding sites for several β-arrestin partners, including a GPCR-binding site. For example, c-Src has been demonstrated to bind to the proline-rich regions at the N domain of β-arrestins (29Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Google Scholar). In addition, our recent data revealed that Mdm2 also binds to the N domain of β-arrestins (data not shown). Thus, the structural integrity of the N domain within the N terminus of β-arrestins is important for their subcellular localization. Results from our current study and the very recent report from another laboratory show that β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1, contains a functional NES at its C terminus (42Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar). It is well established that a typical NES is typically comprised of a 10-amino-acid motif with at least 4 conserved hydrophobic residues. In this study, we identified the hydrophobic motif VXXXFXXLXL as a functional NES for β-arrestin2 in addition to the two leucines reported previously (11Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Google Scholar). More interestingly, the alignment of arrestin amino acid sequences from different species clearly reveals that the typical NES in β-arrestin2 is highly conserved not only in human and rat β-arrestin2 but also in fruit fly, trout, and locust in which only one nonvisual arrestin exists (Fig. 4 A). This suggests the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is very important for the functions of these arrestins. β-Arrestins are originally identified as a negative regulator of GPCR signaling involved in the desensitization and internalization of the receptors. Recent findings of new binding partners of β-arrestins had expanded our knowledge about their functions (14Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Google Scholar). Although the function of β-arrestins as endocytic proteins in the nucleus is still unclear, several other endocytic proteins, such as Epsin1, the clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia, and α-adaptin, have been reported to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and play a direct or indirect role in transcriptional regulation (30Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that some of GPCRs such as angiotensin receptor, prostaglandin ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) receptor, and muscarinic receptor reside on the nuclear membrane (31Bhattacharya M. Peri K.G. Almazan G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Shichi H. Durocher Y. Abramovitz M. Hou X. Varma D.R. Chemtob S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15792-15797Google Scholar, 32Bhattacharya M.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3641-3649Google Scholar) and that some other GPCR signal molecules such as Gα protein, Gβ5, and regulators of G protein are imported into the nucleus (35Takei Y. Kurosu H. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5085-5089Google Scholar, 36Zhang J.H. Barr V.A. Mo Y. Rojkova A.M. Liu S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10284-10289Google Scholar, 37Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar, 38Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that β-arrestins may modulate the transcriptional activity directly via interacting with transcriptional factors or indirectly via regulating the nuclear GPCR signaling. Subcellular localization of proteins is vital to their functions. The nuclear localization of Mdm2 has been known to be important for its ability to degrade p53. Impairment of nuclear import of Mdm2, such as in the cases of the mutant or the alternative spliced form of Mdm2, greatly reduces its ability to degrade p53 (39Evans S.C. Viswanathan M. Grier J.D. Narayana M. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4041-4049Google Scholar). However, the enhancement of Mdm2 nuclear targeting, such as phosphorylation of Mdm2, can increase its function (40Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-983Google Scholar). In the present study, β-arrestin2 was found to be able to alter the subcellular localization of Mdm2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and thus, it is anticipated that β-arrestin2 likely modulates the functions of Mdm2 as well as p53. In fact, our recent data (41Wang P. Gao H. Ni Y. Wang B. Wu Y. Ji L. Qin L. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 17, 10.1074/jbc.M210350200)Google Scholar) indeed provided the evidence for the expectation and demonstrated that β-arrestin2 reduces the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and subsequently enhances p53-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it has been reported (16Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Google Scholar) that β-arrestin2 but not β-arrestin1 can mediate ubiquitination of β2AR. From the results of the current study, the specificity of the effect of β-arrestins can be reasonably explained since only β-arrestin2 can shift the subcellular localization of Mdm2 from nucleus to cytoplasm although both β-arrestins interact well with Mdm2.

This property leads a light buoyant density on sucrose density gradient centrifugation.Cholesterol is an essential component in lipid rafts/caveolae.

Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Google Scholar). These clusters of signal molecules can form “preassembled signaling complexes” on the plasma membrane. In addition, many growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, etc.) (12Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P. J. Biol.

Thus, the enrichment of receptors and signal molecules in lipid rafts/caveolae enables them to be in close contact with each other and makes lipid rafts/caveolae the gateways for signals entering into the cells.Lipid rafts/caveolae are indicated to be important for insulin receptor signaling (30Czech M.P. Nature. 2000; 407: 147-148Google Scholar, 31Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1-E10Google Scholar). Insulin receptors are found to be located in caveolae of adipocyte plasma membrane (27Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Google Scholar), and many signal molecules involved in insulin receptor signal cascade are also found to be enriched in caveolin-enriched plasma membrane domain (32Smith R.M. Harada S. Smith J.A. Zhang S. Jarett L. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 355-362Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, caveolin-1 is phosphorylated by insulin receptor (33Kimura A. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30153-30158Google Scholar, 34Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-enriched lipid raft microdomains and lipid rafts are required for insulin signaling and Glut4 translocation (36Karlsson M. Thorn H. Parpal S. Stralfors P. Gustavsson J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 249-251Google Scholar, 37Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

These results provide compelling evidence that lipid rafts/caveolae are essential for insulin receptor signaling.IGF-11 receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (along with glucocorticoid and cAMP signaling) is required for 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction (40Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Google Scholar, 41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol.

Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Google Scholar). High level insulin or IGF-1 at physiological concentration activates the IGF-1 receptor on the plasma membrane, leading to the initiation of the differentiation program (40Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Google Scholar, 41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar). Two events occur after the activation of IGF-1 receptor in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes: mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation. Previously, we have identified that these two events are both activated by the IGF-1 receptor signaling and can be separately blocked without affecting the other (41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar, 46Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Google Scholar, 47Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Google Scholar). The mitotic clonal expansion is activated by IGF-1 receptor through a signal pathway involving the activation of ERK1 and -2, whereas adipocyte differentiation is initiated through the reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein c-Crk by IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase. These results suggest that IGF-1 receptor activates two separate signal pathways in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes simultaneously.Although some of the cellular functions for IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor are different, structural and signaling similarities between these two receptors have long been recognized. Recently, it has been reported that IGF-1 may also induce caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its translocation in the lipid rafts (48Maggi D. Biedi C. Segat D. Barbero D. Panetta D. Cordera R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1085-1089Google Scholar). Since in 3T3-L1 cells IGF-1 receptor activates more than one signal pathway at the same time, it is likely that IGF-1 receptor on plasma membrane interacts or cross-talks with several signaling pathways. With their preassembled signaling complexes on the intracellular side, lipid rafts/caveolae provide the structural foundation for simultaneous activation or cross-talking of multiple signal pathways by IGF-1 receptor.In the present study, we reported that IGF-1 receptor was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and adipocyte. The integrity of lipid rafts/caveolae was essential for IGF-1 receptor signal transduction during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction. Disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae by cholesterol depletion effectively blocked the downstream signaling of IGF-1 receptor but not IGF-1 receptor activation itself.DISCUSSIONIn many ways, caveolae are lipid rafts enriched with structural protein caveolins, which are the defining protein components in caveolae. Although caveolins have three types, general types caveolin-1 and -2 and muscle-specific caveolin-3 (7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar), cells completely lack caveolae in caveolin-1 knockout mice (53Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Google Scholar). This result from caveolin-1-deficient mice has demonstrated the importance of caveolin-1 in the formation of caveolae and provided support for using caveolin-1 as an indicator for caveolae. By using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1), sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Figs. 2 and 3), and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4), we have identified that IGF-1 receptor was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 cells. To provide further support, we have also shown that IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor, which has been indicated to be located in caveolae of adipocyte plasma membrane (26Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Google Scholar, 51Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Google Scholar), were associated with the same membrane structures in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3 B). These results provided strong evidence that IGF-1 was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes.It was consistently observed that, besides in caveolae, IGF-1 receptor also appeared to be in the membrane structure slightly lighter than caveolae. The peak of IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor was in fractions 6 and 7, whereas the peak of caveolin was in fractions 7 and 8 (Figs. 2 and 3 B). However, in high level insulin-stimulated adipocytes, IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor, and caveolin were better correlated in density gradient separation (Fig.3 B). These results were observed in several independently repeated experiments (results not shown). Thus, it is likely that IGF-1 receptor was also located in the caveolin-free lipid rafts around the caveolae and might further converge into caveolae upon ligand stimulation. Currently, we are investigating this translocation induced by ligand.Although lipid rafts and caveolae are important in signal transduction (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 2Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 6van Meer G. Science. 2002; 296: 855-857Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar), their roles in IGF-1 receptor cellular signaling are not fully understood. The identification of IGF-1 receptor in lipid rafts/caveolae provided us an opportunity to study the role of lipid rafts/caveolae in IGF-1 signaling. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, IGF-1 receptor signal is essential for inducing two cellular responses: adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion. However, these two cellular responses can be separately blocked by inhibitors without affecting the other (41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar, 46Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Google Scholar). PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK-1, blocked mitotic clonal expansion but not adipocyte differentiation, whereas vanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, only blocked adipocyte differentiation. Since lipid rafts/caveolae are on the plasma membrane, which is on the top of the IGF-1 receptor signal cascade, disruption at the level of lipid rafts/caveolae will more likely block all of the cellular responses induced by IGF-1 receptor signaling. Our results clearly supported this hypothesis. Disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae by cholesterol-binding reagents led to the blockade of both cellular responses simultaneously (Figs. 5 and 6). Taken together, these results composed a hierarchy of IGF-1 receptor signaling system in 3T3-L1 cells. The signal generated by IGF-1 receptor requires the assistance of lipid rafts/caveolae on plasma membrane to transmit into the cell and activates different signal pathways, which lead to adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion, respectively.It has been reported that β-methylcyclodextrin treatment does not inhibit insulin receptor-induced ERK1 and -2 activation in primary rat adipocytes (12Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Google Scholar). We observed similar results in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (results not shown). However, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, β-methylcyclodextrin treatment dramatically inhibited IGF-1 receptor-induced ERK1 and -2 activation (Fig. 7). It should be noted that 3T3-L1 adipocytes contain more cholesterol than preadipocytes, and under the same β-methylcyclodextrin treatment, less caveolin-1 was displaced from the low density centrifugation fractions in 3T3-L1 in adipocytes (results not shown). Thus, it is likely that lipid rafts/caveolae in adipocytes were not disrupted by β-methylcyclodextrin treatment as completely as in preadipocytes. Although IGF-1 receptor may employ a different signal pathway from insulin receptor to activate ERK1 and -2, we believe that the discrepancy between 3T3-L1 adipocyte and preadipocyte in the activation of ERK is more likely due to the incomplete disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae in adipocyte.Based on our present studies, only the downstream signal transduction of the receptor required lipid rafts/caveolae (Fig. 7). A possible function of lipid rafts/caveolae in IGF-1 receptor signaling is to recruit intracellular signal molecules for the receptor. Interestingly, studies of the phosphorylation of c-Crk, an endogenous IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase substrate, suggest that physical contact between IGF-1 receptor and c-Crk is essential for the phosphorylation of the substrate by the receptor kinase (54Koval A.-P. Blakesley V.-A. Roberts Jr., C.-T. Zick Y. LeRoith D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 923-932Google Scholar, 55Anafi M. Rosen M.-K. Gish G.-D. Kay L.-E. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21365-21374Google Scholar). IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase can only phosphorylate c-Crk that has bound to the receptor through its Src homology 2 domain. c-Crk protein with the Src homology 2 domain deleted is not phosphorylated by IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Recruitment of signal molecules by lipid rafts/caveolae not only brings the downstream signal molecules into the receptor but also allows the receptor to be in close contact with signal molecules of many signal pathways for which lipid rafts/caveolae act like a signaling hub.Recent studies from caveolin-1 knockout mice indicate that the caveolin-1-deficient mice show some abnormalities in adiposity (56Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8635-8647Google Scholar). The younger caveolin-1-deficient mice have a relatively intact adipocyte tissue except in a few places like in mammary gland and hypodermal fat layers and show similar body weight to their wild type littermates. However, the older caveolin-1-deficient mice have much smaller body sizes than their normal cohorts. This reduced body weight in older caveolin-1-deficient mice is due to reduced adiposity. The Cav-1 knockout mice also appear to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. These results indicate a relatively normal fetal development of adipose tissue in caveolin-1-deficient mice but a problem in adulthood adipose tissue metabolism. In our present studies, lipid rafts/caveolae appeared to be required for adipocyte differentiation induction. Therefore, the caveolaeless knockout mice are probably having problem in adulthood adipocyte differentiation.Adulthood adipocyte differentiation has more and more been considered as one of the leading causes in obesity, especially in hyperplastic obesity (28Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Google Scholar, 45Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Google Scholar). New adipocytes can differentiated from the residual preadipocytes in adipose tissue throughout the life span. The phenotype of caveolin-1-deficient mice suggests that the lipid rafts/caveolae-dependent adipocyte differentiation mechanism in 3T3-L1 cells might more closely resemble adipocyte differentiation in adult animal rather than in embryonic development. Further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. Taken together with the strong evidence from Cav-1 knockout mice, our present study has established the role of lipid rafts/caveolae in the adipocyte differentiation process. Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains, principally composed of cholesterol and sphingolipids, which form liquid-ordered domains of decreased membrane fluidity (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 2Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 6van Meer G. Science. 2002; 296: 855-857Google Scholar). With integration of caveolins into lipid rafts, these microdomains will form caveolae, which are flask-shaped vesicular invaginations in the plasma membrane (2Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar, 4Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). Caveolae are a specific form of lipid rafts and are now considered to be broader than just vesicular membrane invaginations (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). The long saturated lipid tails of sphingolipids impart the lipid rafts a high degree of order further stabilized by interacting cholesterol. This property leads a light buoyant density on sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Cholesterol is an essential component in lipid rafts/caveolae. In caveolae, cholesterol binds directly to caveolins and facilitates the integration of caveolins into membrane (8Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Weiland F. Kurzchalia T. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Google Scholar, 9Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Google Scholar). Depletion of cellular cholesterol with cholesterol-binding reagents, such as methylcyclodextrin or filipin, will remove cholesterol from lipid rafts/caveolae, dissemble the striated caveolin coats, and eventually lead to the disruption of both lipid rafts and caveolae (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar,10Chang W.J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

During recent years, more and more reports confirmed that many signaling molecules are found to be enriched in lipid rafts/caveolae, which serve as platforms and play an important role in regulating signal cascade (1Brown D.A.

Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Google Scholar). These clusters of signal molecules can form “preassembled signaling complexes” on the plasma membrane. In addition, many growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, etc.) (12Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P. J. Biol.

Thus, the enrichment of receptors and signal molecules in lipid rafts/caveolae enables them to be in close contact with each other and makes lipid rafts/caveolae the gateways for signals entering into the cells. Lipid rafts/caveolae are indicated to be important for insulin receptor signaling (30Czech M.P. Nature. 2000; 407: 147-148Google Scholar, 31Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1-E10Google Scholar). Insulin receptors are found to be located in caveolae of adipocyte plasma membrane (27Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Google Scholar), and many signal molecules involved in insulin receptor signal cascade are also found to be enriched in caveolin-enriched plasma membrane domain (32Smith R.M. Harada S. Smith J.A. Zhang S. Jarett L. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 355-362Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, caveolin-1 is phosphorylated by insulin receptor (33Kimura A. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30153-30158Google Scholar, 34Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Google Scholar) and is an activator of insulin receptor signaling (35Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Meyers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Google Scholar). In addition, caveolin-enriched lipid raft microdomains and lipid rafts are required for insulin signaling and Glut4 translocation (36Karlsson M. Thorn H. Parpal S. Stralfors P. Gustavsson J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 249-251Google Scholar, 37Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

These results provide compelling evidence that lipid rafts/caveolae are essential for insulin receptor signaling. IGF-11 receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (along with glucocorticoid and cAMP signaling) is required for 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction (40Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Google Scholar, 41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar, 42Mackall J.C. Student A.K.

High level insulin or IGF-1 at physiological concentration activates the IGF-1 receptor on the plasma membrane, leading to the initiation of the differentiation program (40Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Google Scholar, 41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar). Two events occur after the activation of IGF-1 receptor in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes: mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation. Previously, we have identified that these two events are both activated by the IGF-1 receptor signaling and can be separately blocked without affecting the other (41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar, 46Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Google Scholar, 47Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Google Scholar). The mitotic clonal expansion is activated by IGF-1 receptor through a signal pathway involving the activation of ERK1 and -2, whereas adipocyte differentiation is initiated through the reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein c-Crk by IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase. These results suggest that IGF-1 receptor activates two separate signal pathways in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes simultaneously. Although some of the cellular functions for IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor are different, structural and signaling similarities between these two receptors have long been recognized. Recently, it has been reported that IGF-1 may also induce caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its translocation in the lipid rafts (48Maggi D. Biedi C. Segat D. Barbero D. Panetta D. Cordera R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1085-1089Google Scholar). Since in 3T3-L1 cells IGF-1 receptor activates more than one signal pathway at the same time, it is likely that IGF-1 receptor on plasma membrane interacts or cross-talks with several signaling pathways. With their preassembled signaling complexes on the intracellular side, lipid rafts/caveolae provide the structural foundation for simultaneous activation or cross-talking of multiple signal pathways by IGF-1 receptor. In the present study, we reported that IGF-1 receptor was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and adipocyte. The integrity of lipid rafts/caveolae was essential for IGF-1 receptor signal transduction during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction. Disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae by cholesterol depletion effectively blocked the downstream signaling of IGF-1 receptor but not IGF-1 receptor activation itself. DISCUSSIONIn many ways, caveolae are lipid rafts enriched with structural protein caveolins, which are the defining protein components in caveolae. Although caveolins have three types, general types caveolin-1 and -2 and muscle-specific caveolin-3 (7Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar), cells completely lack caveolae in caveolin-1 knockout mice (53Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Google Scholar). This result from caveolin-1-deficient mice has demonstrated the importance of caveolin-1 in the formation of caveolae and provided support for using caveolin-1 as an indicator for caveolae. By using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1), sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Figs. 2 and 3), and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4), we have identified that IGF-1 receptor was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 cells. To provide further support, we have also shown that IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor, which has been indicated to be located in caveolae of adipocyte plasma membrane (26Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Google Scholar, 51Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Google Scholar), were associated with the same membrane structures in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3 B). These results provided strong evidence that IGF-1 was located in lipid rafts/caveolae in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes.It was consistently observed that, besides in caveolae, IGF-1 receptor also appeared to be in the membrane structure slightly lighter than caveolae. The peak of IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor was in fractions 6 and 7, whereas the peak of caveolin was in fractions 7 and 8 (Figs. 2 and 3 B). However, in high level insulin-stimulated adipocytes, IGF-1 receptor, insulin receptor, and caveolin were better correlated in density gradient separation (Fig.3 B). These results were observed in several independently repeated experiments (results not shown). Thus, it is likely that IGF-1 receptor was also located in the caveolin-free lipid rafts around the caveolae and might further converge into caveolae upon ligand stimulation. Currently, we are investigating this translocation induced by ligand.Although lipid rafts and caveolae are important in signal transduction (1Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 2Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar), their roles in IGF-1 receptor cellular signaling are not fully understood. The identification of IGF-1 receptor in lipid rafts/caveolae provided us an opportunity to study the role of lipid rafts/caveolae in IGF-1 signaling. In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, IGF-1 receptor signal is essential for inducing two cellular responses: adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion. However, these two cellular responses can be separately blocked by inhibitors without affecting the other (41Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Google Scholar, 46Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Google Scholar). PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK-1, blocked mitotic clonal expansion but not adipocyte differentiation, whereas vanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, only blocked adipocyte differentiation. Since lipid rafts/caveolae are on the plasma membrane, which is on the top of the IGF-1 receptor signal cascade, disruption at the level of lipid rafts/caveolae will more likely block all of the cellular responses induced by IGF-1 receptor signaling. Our results clearly supported this hypothesis. Disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae by cholesterol-binding reagents led to the blockade of both cellular responses simultaneously (Figs. 5 and 6). Taken together, these results composed a hierarchy of IGF-1 receptor signaling system in 3T3-L1 cells. The signal generated by IGF-1 receptor requires the assistance of lipid rafts/caveolae on plasma membrane to transmit into the cell and activates different signal pathways, which lead to adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion, respectively.It has been reported that β-methylcyclodextrin treatment does not inhibit insulin receptor-induced ERK1 and -2 activation in primary rat adipocytes (12Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Google Scholar). We observed similar results in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (results not shown). However, in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, β-methylcyclodextrin treatment dramatically inhibited IGF-1 receptor-induced ERK1 and -2 activation (Fig. 7). It should be noted that 3T3-L1 adipocytes contain more cholesterol than preadipocytes, and under the same β-methylcyclodextrin treatment, less caveolin-1 was displaced from the low density centrifugation fractions in 3T3-L1 in adipocytes (results not shown). Thus, it is likely that lipid rafts/caveolae in adipocytes were not disrupted by β-methylcyclodextrin treatment as completely as in preadipocytes. Although IGF-1 receptor may employ a different signal pathway from insulin receptor to activate ERK1 and -2, we believe that the discrepancy between 3T3-L1 adipocyte and preadipocyte in the activation of ERK is more likely due to the incomplete disruption of lipid rafts/caveolae in adipocyte.Based on our present studies, only the downstream signal transduction of the receptor required lipid rafts/caveolae (Fig. 7). A possible function of lipid rafts/caveolae in IGF-1 receptor signaling is to recruit intracellular signal molecules for the receptor. Interestingly, studies of the phosphorylation of c-Crk, an endogenous IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase substrate, suggest that physical contact between IGF-1 receptor and c-Crk is essential for the phosphorylation of the substrate by the receptor kinase (54Koval A.-P. Blakesley V.-A. Roberts Jr., C.-T. Zick Y. LeRoith D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 923-932Google Scholar, 55Anafi M. Rosen M.-K. Gish G.-D. Kay L.-E. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21365-21374Google Scholar). IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase can only phosphorylate c-Crk that has bound to the receptor through its Src homology 2 domain. c-Crk protein with the Src homology 2 domain deleted is not phosphorylated by IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Recruitment of signal molecules by lipid rafts/caveolae not only brings the downstream signal molecules into the receptor but also allows the receptor to be in close contact with signal molecules of many signal pathways for which lipid rafts/caveolae act like a signaling hub.Recent studies from caveolin-1 knockout mice indicate that the caveolin-1-deficient mice show some abnormalities in adiposity (56Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8635-8647Google Scholar). The younger caveolin-1-deficient mice have a relatively intact adipocyte tissue except in a few places like in mammary gland and hypodermal fat layers and show similar body weight to their wild type littermates. However, the older caveolin-1-deficient mice have much smaller body sizes than their normal cohorts. This reduced body weight in older caveolin-1-deficient mice is due to reduced adiposity. The Cav-1 knockout mice also appear to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. These results indicate a relatively normal fetal development of adipose tissue in caveolin-1-deficient mice but a problem in adulthood adipose tissue metabolism. In our present studies, lipid rafts/caveolae appeared to be required for adipocyte differentiation induction. Therefore, the caveolaeless knockout mice are probably having problem in adulthood adipocyte differentiation.Adulthood adipocyte differentiation has more and more been considered as one of the leading causes in obesity, especially in hyperplastic obesity (28Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Google Scholar, 45Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Google Scholar). New adipocytes can differentiated from the residual preadipocytes in adipose tissue throughout the life span. The phenotype of caveolin-1-deficient mice suggests that the lipid rafts/caveolae-dependent adipocyte differentiation mechanism in 3T3-L1 cells might more closely resemble adipocyte differentiation in adult animal rather than in embryonic development. Further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. Taken together with the strong evidence from Cav-1 knockout mice, our present study has established the role of lipid rafts/caveolae in the adipocyte differentiation process. In many ways, caveolae are lipid rafts enriched with structural protein caveolins, which are the defining protein components in caveolae.

Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a potent VSMC differentiation factor; however, it is not known if other TGF-β-superfamily members, in particular the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), modulate VSMC phenotype. Here we demonstrate that a large subset of TGF-β-superfamily members and their type I receptors are differentially co-expressed as VSMC phenotype changes during fetal/neonatal development and that BMP2, -4, and -6 reciprocally regulate SM-marker mRNA and protein expressionin vitro. BMP2 and BMP6 decrease expression of the SM markers α-SM actin, SM22α, and calponin in rat VSMCs, whereas BMP4 increases their expression. The effects of BMP-2, -4, and -6 on SM marker gene transcription are mediated through a consensus TGF-β-controlling element, the TCE, which is common to regulatory regions of SM-marker genes. Moreover, co-treatment experiments revealed that BMP-2, -4, and -6 each inhibit TGF-β1-modulated increases in SM22α reporter gene activity. Regardless of whether they positively or negatively regulate SM marker expression, TGF-β1 and BMP-2, -4, and -6 all induced binding of the Krüppel-like transcription factor, GKLF/KLF4, to the TGF-β control element.

However, BMP expression studies as well as the analysis of BMP mouse knockout models suggest that BMPs exert a broad range of biological activities from cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis to roles during development and that functional differences exist between different BMPs (14Hogan B.L.M.

Furthermore, BMP6 expression has been documented in both human intimal and medial VSMCs (25Schluesener H.J. Meyermann R. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 113: 153-156Google Scholar). Functionally, BMP7 has been implicated in maintaining VSMC phenotype in occluded rat renal arteries, whereas BMP2 instructs 10% of neural crest stem cells to differentiate into SMCs (11Shah N.M.

Expression of the type I TGF-β-superfamily receptors ALK2, -3, -5, and -6 has been shown in cultured adult rat VSMCs (27Agrotis A. Samuel M. Prapas G. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 613-618Google Scholar). ALK3 and ALK6 serve as BMP receptors, ALK5 functions as a TGF-β receptor, and ALK2 can be bound by activin and BMP7 (28ten Dijke P. Yamashita H.

Importantly, mutations in ALK1 result in human type II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a condition characterized by multiple vascular defects thought to result from a deficiency in VMSC differentiation and recruitment, whereas mutations in the BMP type II receptor cause pulmonary hypertension (30Oh S.P. Seki T. Goxx K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. tenDijke P. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Google Scholar, 31Lane K.B. Machado R.D. Pauciulo M.W. Thomson J.R.

Downstream from the receptors, BMP signaling molecules, SMADs, have been shown to be essential for vascular development. SMAD5 null mice lack an organized vasculature and present with large blood vessels containing a paucity of VSMCs, whereas SMAD6 knockout mice exhibit aortic ossification and increased blood pressure (32Chang H.

Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 171-174Google Scholar). In total these studies strongly suggest a role for the BMPs in the regulation of VSMC phenotype and/or vascular development.Because they differentiate/mature, VSMCs progress through a phenotypic continuum that can be divided into fetal, neonatal, and adult stages. During fetal development, cells commit to the VSMC lineage at days 9–10 post-coitus, initiate expression of SM-marker genes, and proliferate rapidly (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar, 22Samaha F.F. Ip H.S. Morrisey E.E. Seltzer J. Tang Z. Solway J. Parmacek M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 395-403Google Scholar, 23Li L. Miano J.M.

Neonatal VSMCs exhibit a reduced proliferative index, increased SM-marker expression, and increased matrix synthesis, whereas adult VSMCs maintain basal expression levels of the SM-markers (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar). Understanding how VSMC phenotypic modulation is regulated during development is particularly important, because intimal VSMCs associated with diseased vascular tissue express a phenotype that resembles that of normal medial VSMCs during fetal and neonatal development (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrate that multiple TGF-β-superfamily members and their receptors are dynamically co-expressed during VSMC differentiation and can reciprocally regulate SM-differentiation marker expression via a TCE- dependent mechanism. In addition, the activity of TGF-β1 can be modulated by other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Mechanistically, TGF-β-superfamily members, whether positive or negative regulators of SM-marker gene expression, induce binding of the transcription factor KLF4/GKLF to the TCE element, demonstrating the importance of multiple TGF-β-superfamily members in VSMC phenotypic regulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrated that multiple TGF-β-superfamily members can modulate expression of VSMC phenotypic markers via a common cis-acting TCE element and that BMPs are able to modulate the effect of TGF-β1 on the transactivation of a SM-specific gene, SM22α. Modulation of SM-marker expression, whether positive or negative, was associated with the induction of a smaller GKLF/KLF4 protein that binds to the TCE element, a sequence common to a number of SM-specific gene promoters. In vivo TGF-β-superfamily members, which are important modulators of VSMC phenotype, are differentially co-expressed during fetal/neonatal to adult development. This suggests that the ratio of different family members during development is important for VSMC phenotypic change and stability. It follows that a shift in the expression ratios of the different family members may act as a catalyst in the induction of vascular disease.Recently, transgenic mice bearing an SM22α-lacZ promoter construct with a mutated TCE element revealed that the TCE element is essential for the in vivo expression of the SM-marker SM22α (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). In our system BMP-2, -4, and -6 were shown to transcriptionally repress SM22α promoter activity. The effects of BMP2 and -6 were consistent with results seen at the mRNA level; however, BMP4 repression of SM22α promoter activity was in contrast to its induction of SM22α mRNA. The difference between the transcriptional reporter assays and the mRNA levels is probably due to the presence of unidentified enhancer elements not present in the promoter regions covered by the p80 and p55 reporter constructs.Utilization of a p80 reporter construct containing a mutated TCE element established that an intact TCE element is required for BMP-modulated SM22α promoter repression. The discovery of TCE-dependent BMP-modulated SM-marker expression suggested that the BMPs might compete with TGF-β1. This was validated in vitro as co-treatment of VSMCs transfected with the p80 reporter, with TGF-β1, and BMP2, -4, or -6 showed that each of these BMPs decreased TGF-β1-induced SM22α promoter activity, emphasizing the importance of the expression levels of multiple TGF-β-superfamily members in the regulation of VSMC phenotype.Both positive and negative regulators of SM22α promoter activity induced TCE binding of VSMC nuclear proteins. Based on work by Adamet al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar), we speculated that TGF-β-superfamily members may induce binding of different Krüppel-like transcription factors to the TCE. Adam et al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar) identify GKLF as a TCE-binding protein using yeast one-hybrid analysis and showed that GKLF expression is down-regulated by TGF-β1. Co-transfection assays in C3H10T1/2 cells revealed that GKLF-repressed TGF-β1 induced α-SM actin and SM22α promoter activity, whereas another Krüppel-like transcription factor, BTEB2/KLF5, activated the SM22α promoter in this cell type (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). Although it is possible that such a reciprocal mechanism may exist in vivo, we were unable to detect BTEB2 binding by EMSA after TGF-β1 or BMP2 treatment nor did we detect BTEB2 protein by Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Of particular note, the BTEB2 antibody used by Adam et al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar) in the EMSA analysis was likely to have cross-reacted with other KLF family members because 10 of the 12 amino acids of the peptide used to generate it are identical to GKLF (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). BTEB2 was originally identified as a marker of dedifferentiated VSMCs because it activates transcription of SMemb/nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-B and has been shown to have a role in vascular remodeling after injury (39Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Google Scholar). It is highly expressed during vascular development but is down-regulated in adult vessels; therefore, its absence in cultured adult VSMCs in serum-free conditions is not unexpected.In this study we identified a shorter GKLF variant that was induced after TGF-β and BMP2 treatment. It is likely that the different GKLF variants are the result of post-translational modification of GKLF; however, this difference was not due to phosphorylation nor acetylation. GKLF has previously been shown to contain both activation and repression domains (40Geiman D.E. Han T.T. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1106-1113Google Scholar). Because both positive and negative regulators of SM markers induce the smaller variant, it is likely that additional trans-acting factors are involved in SM-promoter regulation. These additional factors may bind directly to the GKLF complex or to other cis elements within SM-promoters.In addition to defining a downstream target of TGF-β- and BMP-modulated transcriptional regulation in VSMCs, this is the first report to describe the expression patterns of TGF-β-superfamily type I receptors and their ligands during neonatal VSMC differentiation. The dynamic in vivo expression profiles of these family members and their receptors further supports their role as major effectors of VSMC phenotype. TGF-β isoforms displayed similar expression patterns during neonatal development; however, expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 declined in the adult. Isoform-specific differences in expression have previously been described in rat medial VSMCs 48 h after balloon injury, where TGF-β1 and -3 mRNA expression was elevated, whereas TGF-β2 mRNA expression declined (41Ward M.R. Agrotis A. Kanaellakis P. Dilley R. Jennings G. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2461-2470Google Scholar). Although TGF-β isoforms have similar expression patterns and effects on SM-marker expression, it is possible that they differentially regulate other processes such as fibrogenesis or cell proliferation (42Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Google Scholar).BMP5 and -7 were maximally expressed during fetal development, whereas BMP2, -3, -4, and -6 were up-regulated during neonatal development. Because little is known about the effect of the BMPs on VSMCs, it is difficult to speculate from these expression profiles as to the role of each factor. During neonatal development, a number of significant changes occur in VSMCs, including increased extracellular matrix, SM-contractile protein expression, and decreased proliferation (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar). Recently, the effects of BMP2 and BMP7 have been examined in injured arteries (20Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L. Development. 1990; 109: 833-844Google Scholar, 43Nakaoka T. Gonda K. Ogita T. Otawara-Hamamoto Y. Okabe F. Kira Y. Harii K. Miyazono K. Takuwa Y. Fugita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2824-2832Google Scholar). BMP7 maintained VSMC phenotype in occluded rat renal arteries, and BMP2 was shown to inhibit VSMC proliferation after balloon injury to rat carotid arteries (26Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M. Shepard A. Jin D. Dattatreyamurty B. Jones W. Dorai H. Ryan S. Griffiths D. Maliakal J. Jelic M. Pastorcic M. Stavijenic A. Sampath T.K. J. Clin.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2824-2832Google Scholar). We showed that BMP2 expression increased during the neonatal phase of development, a time when VSMC proliferative index decreases. SM markers are up-regulatedin vivo during this phase, yet in vitro BMP2 down-regulated SM-marker expression. Thus, BMP2 may regulate other aspects of VSMC biology that alter with differentiation, such as proliferation, further supporting the notion that a balance of positive and negative regulators determines VSMC phenotype (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar).In summary, this study has provided mechanistic insight into BMP modulation of VSMC phenotype. Further studies into the roles played by specific BMPs in regulating VSMC phenotype are now required, given the correlation of VSMC phenotypic modulation with vascular disease. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)1 in the adult arterial media exhibit a differentiated phenotype characterized by expression of smooth muscle (SM) contractile genes such as SM22α, SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), α-SM actin, and calponin (1Ross R.

Identification of these regulators may shed light on the mechanisms of VSMC phenotype modulation in the etiology of vascular diseases. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) exerts multiple effects on VSMCs in vitro, including a concentration-dependent effect on proliferation and stimulation of extracellular matrix protein synthesis (1Ross R.

Functionally, BMP7 has been implicated in maintaining VSMC phenotype in occluded rat renal arteries, whereas BMP2 instructs 10% of neural crest stem cells to differentiate into SMCs (11Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Google Scholar, 26Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M. Shepard A. Jin D. Dattatreyamurty B. Jones W. Dorai H. Ryan S. Griffiths D.

Expression of the type I TGF-β-superfamily receptors ALK2, -3, -5, and -6 has been shown in cultured adult rat VSMCs (27Agrotis A. Samuel M. Prapas G. Bobik A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 613-618Google Scholar). ALK3 and ALK6 serve as BMP receptors, ALK5 functions as a TGF-β receptor, and ALK2 can be bound by activin and BMP7 (28ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar, 29ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M.

Importantly, mutations in ALK1 result in human type II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a condition characterized by multiple vascular defects thought to result from a deficiency in VMSC differentiation and recruitment, whereas mutations in the BMP type II receptor cause pulmonary hypertension (30Oh S.P. Seki T. Goxx K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. tenDijke P. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Google Scholar, 31Lane K.B. Machado R.D. Pauciulo M.W. Thomson J.R.

Downstream from the receptors, BMP signaling molecules, SMADs, have been shown to be essential for vascular development. SMAD5 null mice lack an organized vasculature and present with large blood vessels containing a paucity of VSMCs, whereas SMAD6 knockout mice exhibit aortic ossification and increased blood pressure (32Chang H. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Zwijsen A. Development. 1999; 126: 1631-1642Google Scholar, 33Yang S. Castilla L.H. Xu S. Li C. Gotay J. Weinstein M. Liu P.P. Deng C.

Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 171-174Google Scholar). In total these studies strongly suggest a role for the BMPs in the regulation of VSMC phenotype and/or vascular development. Because they differentiate/mature, VSMCs progress through a phenotypic continuum that can be divided into fetal, neonatal, and adult stages. During fetal development, cells commit to the VSMC lineage at days 9–10 post-coitus, initiate expression of SM-marker genes, and proliferate rapidly (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar, 22Samaha F.F. Ip H.S. Morrisey E.E. Seltzer J. Tang Z. Solway J. Parmacek M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 395-403Google Scholar, 23Li L. Miano J.M.

Neonatal VSMCs exhibit a reduced proliferative index, increased SM-marker expression, and increased matrix synthesis, whereas adult VSMCs maintain basal expression levels of the SM-markers (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar). Understanding how VSMC phenotypic modulation is regulated during development is particularly important, because intimal VSMCs associated with diseased vascular tissue express a phenotype that resembles that of normal medial VSMCs during fetal and neonatal development (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that multiple TGF-β-superfamily members and their receptors are dynamically co-expressed during VSMC differentiation and can reciprocally regulate SM-differentiation marker expression via a TCE- dependent mechanism. In addition, the activity of TGF-β1 can be modulated by other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Mechanistically, TGF-β-superfamily members, whether positive or negative regulators of SM-marker gene expression, induce binding of the transcription factor KLF4/GKLF to the TCE element, demonstrating the importance of multiple TGF-β-superfamily members in VSMC phenotypic regulation. DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrated that multiple TGF-β-superfamily members can modulate expression of VSMC phenotypic markers via a common cis-acting TCE element and that BMPs are able to modulate the effect of TGF-β1 on the transactivation of a SM-specific gene, SM22α. Modulation of SM-marker expression, whether positive or negative, was associated with the induction of a smaller GKLF/KLF4 protein that binds to the TCE element, a sequence common to a number of SM-specific gene promoters. In vivo TGF-β-superfamily members, which are important modulators of VSMC phenotype, are differentially co-expressed during fetal/neonatal to adult development. This suggests that the ratio of different family members during development is important for VSMC phenotypic change and stability. It follows that a shift in the expression ratios of the different family members may act as a catalyst in the induction of vascular disease.Recently, transgenic mice bearing an SM22α-lacZ promoter construct with a mutated TCE element revealed that the TCE element is essential for the in vivo expression of the SM-marker SM22α (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). In our system BMP-2, -4, and -6 were shown to transcriptionally repress SM22α promoter activity. The effects of BMP2 and -6 were consistent with results seen at the mRNA level; however, BMP4 repression of SM22α promoter activity was in contrast to its induction of SM22α mRNA. The difference between the transcriptional reporter assays and the mRNA levels is probably due to the presence of unidentified enhancer elements not present in the promoter regions covered by the p80 and p55 reporter constructs.Utilization of a p80 reporter construct containing a mutated TCE element established that an intact TCE element is required for BMP-modulated SM22α promoter repression. The discovery of TCE-dependent BMP-modulated SM-marker expression suggested that the BMPs might compete with TGF-β1. This was validated in vitro as co-treatment of VSMCs transfected with the p80 reporter, with TGF-β1, and BMP2, -4, or -6 showed that each of these BMPs decreased TGF-β1-induced SM22α promoter activity, emphasizing the importance of the expression levels of multiple TGF-β-superfamily members in the regulation of VSMC phenotype.Both positive and negative regulators of SM22α promoter activity induced TCE binding of VSMC nuclear proteins. Based on work by Adamet al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar), we speculated that TGF-β-superfamily members may induce binding of different Krüppel-like transcription factors to the TCE. Adam et al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar) identify GKLF as a TCE-binding protein using yeast one-hybrid analysis and showed that GKLF expression is down-regulated by TGF-β1. Co-transfection assays in C3H10T1/2 cells revealed that GKLF-repressed TGF-β1 induced α-SM actin and SM22α promoter activity, whereas another Krüppel-like transcription factor, BTEB2/KLF5, activated the SM22α promoter in this cell type (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). Although it is possible that such a reciprocal mechanism may exist in vivo, we were unable to detect BTEB2 binding by EMSA after TGF-β1 or BMP2 treatment nor did we detect BTEB2 protein by Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Of particular note, the BTEB2 antibody used by Adam et al. (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar) in the EMSA analysis was likely to have cross-reacted with other KLF family members because 10 of the 12 amino acids of the peptide used to generate it are identical to GKLF (12Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Google Scholar). BTEB2 was originally identified as a marker of dedifferentiated VSMCs because it activates transcription of SMemb/nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-B and has been shown to have a role in vascular remodeling after injury (39Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Google Scholar). It is highly expressed during vascular development but is down-regulated in adult vessels; therefore, its absence in cultured adult VSMCs in serum-free conditions is not unexpected.In this study we identified a shorter GKLF variant that was induced after TGF-β and BMP2 treatment. It is likely that the different GKLF variants are the result of post-translational modification of GKLF; however, this difference was not due to phosphorylation nor acetylation. GKLF has previously been shown to contain both activation and repression domains (40Geiman D.E. Han T.T. Johnson J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1106-1113Google Scholar). Because both positive and negative regulators of SM markers induce the smaller variant, it is likely that additional trans-acting factors are involved in SM-promoter regulation. These additional factors may bind directly to the GKLF complex or to other cis elements within SM-promoters.In addition to defining a downstream target of TGF-β- and BMP-modulated transcriptional regulation in VSMCs, this is the first report to describe the expression patterns of TGF-β-superfamily type I receptors and their ligands during neonatal VSMC differentiation. The dynamic in vivo expression profiles of these family members and their receptors further supports their role as major effectors of VSMC phenotype. TGF-β isoforms displayed similar expression patterns during neonatal development; however, expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 declined in the adult. Isoform-specific differences in expression have previously been described in rat medial VSMCs 48 h after balloon injury, where TGF-β1 and -3 mRNA expression was elevated, whereas TGF-β2 mRNA expression declined (41Ward M.R. Agrotis A. Kanaellakis P. Dilley R. Jennings G. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2461-2470Google Scholar). Although TGF-β isoforms have similar expression patterns and effects on SM-marker expression, it is possible that they differentially regulate other processes such as fibrogenesis or cell proliferation (42Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Google Scholar).BMP5 and -7 were maximally expressed during fetal development, whereas BMP2, -3, -4, and -6 were up-regulated during neonatal development. Because little is known about the effect of the BMPs on VSMCs, it is difficult to speculate from these expression profiles as to the role of each factor. During neonatal development, a number of significant changes occur in VSMCs, including increased extracellular matrix, SM-contractile protein expression, and decreased proliferation (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar). Recently, the effects of BMP2 and BMP7 have been examined in injured arteries (20Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L. Development. 1990; 109: 833-844Google Scholar, 43Nakaoka T. Gonda K. Ogita T. Otawara-Hamamoto Y. Okabe F. Kira Y. Harii K. Miyazono K. Takuwa Y. Fugita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2824-2832Google Scholar). BMP7 maintained VSMC phenotype in occluded rat renal arteries, and BMP2 was shown to inhibit VSMC proliferation after balloon injury to rat carotid arteries (26Vukicevic S. Basic V. Rogic D. Basic N. Shih M. Shepard A. Jin D. Dattatreyamurty B. Jones W. Dorai H. Ryan S. Griffiths D. Maliakal J. Jelic M. Pastorcic M. Stavijenic A. Sampath T.K. J. Clin.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2824-2832Google Scholar). We showed that BMP2 expression increased during the neonatal phase of development, a time when VSMC proliferative index decreases. SM markers are up-regulatedin vivo during this phase, yet in vitro BMP2 down-regulated SM-marker expression. Thus, BMP2 may regulate other aspects of VSMC biology that alter with differentiation, such as proliferation, further supporting the notion that a balance of positive and negative regulators determines VSMC phenotype (5Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Google Scholar).In summary, this study has provided mechanistic insight into BMP modulation of VSMC phenotype. Further studies into the roles played by specific BMPs in regulating VSMC phenotype are now required, given the correlation of VSMC phenotypic modulation with vascular disease. In this study we demonstrated that multiple TGF-β-superfamily members can modulate expression of VSMC phenotypic markers via a common cis-acting TCE element and that BMPs are able to modulate the effect of TGF-β1 on the transactivation of a SM-specific gene, SM22α.

https://openalex.org/W2103456503,"The impact of muscarinic receptor stimulation was examined on apoptotic signaling induced by DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial impairment. Exposure of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin increased p53 levels, activated caspase-3, and caused cell death. Pretreatment with oxotremorine-M, a selective agonist of muscarinic receptors that are expressed endogenously in these cells, did not affect the accumulation of p53 but greatly attenuated caspase-3 activation and protected from cell death to nearly the same extent as treatment with a general caspase inhibitor. Treatment with 50–200 μmH2O2 caused the activation of caspase-3 beginning after 2–3 h, followed by eventual cell death. Oxotremorine-M pretreatment protected cells from H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation and death, and this was equivalent to protection afforded by a caspase inhibitor. Muscarinic receptor stimulation also protected cells from caspase-3 activation induced by exposure to rotenone, a mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor, but no protection was evident from staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation. The mechanism of protection afforded by muscarinic receptor activation from camptothecin-induced apoptotic signaling involved blockade of mitochondrial cytochrome c release associated with a bolstering of mitochondrial bcl-2 levels and blockade of the translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Likely the most proximal of these events to muscarinic receptor activation, mitochondrial Bax accumulation, also was attenuated by oxotremorine-M treatment after treatment with H2O2 or rotenone. These results demonstrate that stimulation of muscarinic receptors provides substantial protection from DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial impairment, insults that may be encountered by neurons in development, aging, or neurodegenerative diseases. These findings suggest that neurotransmitter-induced signaling bolsters survival mechanisms, and inadequate neurotransmission may exacerbate neuronal loss.

Alzheimer's disease 3-aminobenzamide boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase No decision is more important for an individual cell than that which determines whether it will survive or die. It is not surprising that recent research has found this biochemical decision-making process encompasses a regulatory web with a complexity matching the importance of the decision (1Zornig M. Hueber A. Baum W. Evan G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1551: 1-37Google Scholar, 2Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 259-281Google Scholar). Thus, throughout life cells mobilize an active effort to repress programs that could lead to cell death. In many instances, continued survival is dependent upon the environment of the cell, because cell-to-cell contact and signals received from neighboring cells may provide the necessary impetus to bolster defenses against death programs. Eventually, through senescence, insults, and/or loss of adequate inputs, cells are eliminated, often to make room for replacements. In the central nervous system, however, replacement neurons are only available marginally if at all (3Jacobs B.L. van Praag H. Gage F.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 262-269Google Scholar, 4Kempermann G. Bipolar Disord. 2002; 4: 17-33Google Scholar), putting a greater burden on the survival mechanisms of mature neurons. Determining how neurons are able to survive manyfold longer than the average mammalian cell poses one of the great challenges of research in neurobiology (5Miller F.D. Pozniak C.D. Walsh G.S.

This question is more than of academic interest because failure to survive, either during the developmental process, during aging, or upon exposure to potentially lethal insults, is the basis for innumerable neurodegenerative conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases often arise as the result of increased burdens placed on the survival-promoting mechanisms of neurons (7Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Science. 2000; 407: 802-809Google Scholar). The accumulation of mutated proteins or toxic insults can challenge survival mechanisms, causing neurons to prematurely succumb, which in some instances of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders follows decades of heightened challenge (8Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1079-1083Google Scholar). For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD),1 it is apparent that neurons survive many years of heightened stress caused by mutations and/or elevated stressors before the catastrophic effects are evident (9Pratico D. Clark C.M. Liun F. Lee V.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 972-976Google Scholar). Because the establishment of synaptic contacts is a critical factor for neuronal survival during development (10Castagne V. Gautschi M. Lefevre K. Posada A. Clarke P.G. Prog. Neurobiol. (N.Y.). 1999; 59: 397-423Google Scholar, 11Ikonomidou C. Bittigau P. Koch C. Genz K. Hoerster F. Felderhoff-Mueser U. Tenkova T. Dikranian K. Olney J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 401-405Google Scholar), synaptic activity also may be critical for bolstering cellular defenses from toxic insults that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In this regard, it is well known that activation of receptors by neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor, has a profound influence on cell survival (12Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Google Scholar). However, much less is known about the survival-promoting potential of receptors for classical neurotransmitters, such as cholinergic muscarinic receptors. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the extent to which activation of plasma membrane neurotransmitter receptors are capable of providing protection from widely encountered toxic conditions. Considering the substantial but still controversial evidence that loss of cholinergic signaling activity may be an early event in AD (13Bartus R.T. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 495-529Google Scholar), activation of cholinergic muscarinic receptors was used as the model for neurotransmitter input. Three toxic conditions were examined: DNA damage, oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial function. DNA damage is an important initiator of neuronal apoptosis, which is evident in conditions including ischemia, oxidative stress, several neurodegenerative diseases, and after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, as recently reviewed (14Ghahremani M.H. Keramaris E. Shree T. Xia Z. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35586-35596Google Scholar). Experimentally, camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, has been used to generate DNA damage in neuronal model systems. Camptothecin treatment induces p53-dependent neuronal death, which follows activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (15Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Google Scholar, 16Keramaris E. Stefanis L. MacLaurin J. Harada N. Takaku K. Ishikawa T. Taketo M.M. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Slack R.S. Park D.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 368-379Google Scholar, 17Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Google Scholar). Oxidative stress appears to be one of the most prevalent causes of neuronal dysfunction and demise in neurodegenerative disorders and can cause DNA damage. This overproduction of reactive oxygen species or diminished anti-oxidant capacity, is evident in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, aging, stroke, and many other conditions associated with impaired function and loss of neurons (18Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Google Scholar, 19Mattson M.P. Alzheimer's Dis. Rev. 1997; 2: 1-14Google Scholar, 20Behl C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 301-323Google Scholar, 21Halliwell B. Drugs Aging. 2001; 18: 685-716Google Scholar, 22Sayre L.M. Smith M.A. Perry G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 721-738Google Scholar). In addition, oxidative stress is an early event in AD pathology, and the extent and distribution of neurodegeneration in AD parallels indices of oxidative damage (9Pratico D. Clark C.M. Liun F. Lee V.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 972-976Google Scholar, 23Lovell M. Ehmann W. Butler S. Markesbery W. Neurology. 1995; 45: 1594-1601Google Scholar, 24Nunomura A. Perry G. Aliev G. Hirai K. Takeda A. Balraj E.K. Jones P.K. Ghanbari H. Wataya T. Shimohama S. Chiba S. Atwood C.S. Petersen R.B. Smith M.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 759-767Google Scholar, 25Gibson G.E. Huang H.M. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1007-1015Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction also has been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative conditions (26Tatton W.G. Olanow C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 195-213Google Scholar, 27Manfredi G. Beal M.F. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 462-472Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (28Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Krauer K. Ralph S.J. Linnane A.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 40-44Google Scholar) was used in this study because rotenone administration has been used to model the neuronal dysfunction of Parkinson's disease (29Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Google Scholar). The results show that muscarinic receptor stimulation provides remarkably effective protection from each of these three disparate insults. These findings support the notion that synaptic activity, through activation of neurotransmitter receptors, can provide substantial support of cellular survival mechanisms, suggesting that loss of such synaptic input increases vulnerability to insult-induced programmed cell death. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in RPMI medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen), 5% fetal clone II (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Experimental agents used include H2O2, 3-aminobenzamide (3AB), oxotremorine-M, camptothecin, nicotine, carbachol, mecamylamine, atropine, and rotenone from Sigma and boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Caspase-3 activity was assessed by measuring cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate, as described previously (30Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase release was detected using the cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 nm okadaic acid, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were sonicated for 10 s on ice and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic (BCA) method (Pierce). Where indicated, nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (32Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Google Scholar). For preparation of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, harvested cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (33Gottlieb R.A. Adachi S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 213-221Google Scholar) followed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (34Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-33Google Scholar), and immunoblots of tubulin and cytochrome oxidase were used as markers of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p21, cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen), p53, bcl-2, Bax, tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), cytochrome oxidase (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and were quantified by densitometry. We first examined if muscarinic receptor activation is capable of providing protection from apoptosis after DNA damage. To do this, we used camptothecin, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, to generate DNA damage-induced apoptosis, which we recently characterized in SH-SY5Y cells (35Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Google Scholar). As reported, treatment with 1 μm camptothecin caused a large and relatively rapid increase in the activity of caspase-3 (Fig.1 A). Activation of muscarinic receptors with the selective agonist oxotremorine-M (300 μm; 30 min of pretreatment) attenuated by ∼75% caspase-3 activation induced by camptothecin (above the basal level of activity). This protective effect of oxotremorine-M was completely blocked by the specific muscarinic receptor antagonist 1 μm atropine. Equivalent results were obtained when the proteolysis of PARP was used as an indicator of the degree of apoptotic signaling activation. PARP proteolysis increased time-dependently after camptothecin treatment, and oxotremorine-M pretreatment greatly attenuated this response (Fig.1 B). Muscarinic receptor stimulation did not block the initial response to camptothecin, as evidenced by the lack of effect of oxotremorine-M treatment on the accumulation of p53 that followed camptothecin treatment (Fig. 1 C). Additionally, the transcriptional activity of p53 was not blocked by oxotremorine-M pretreatment, as increases in the level of p21waf1/cip1, which is regulated by p53, followed the accumulation of p53 equivalently in the absence or presence of oxotremorine-M (Fig.1 C). This indicates that muscarinic receptor stimulation provided protection at a site downstream from the initial toxic insult, in this case DNA damage and the subsequent accumulation and activation of p53. Examination of lactate dehydrogenase release into the medium as a measure of cell death revealed that oxotremorine-M greatly attenuated cell death (Fig. 1 D). Oxotremorine-M pretreatment provided a degree of protection that was nearly as great as that afforded by the general caspase inhibitor BAF (Fig. 1 D), an inhibitor previously reported to block the early, caspase-3-dependent phase of cell death after camptothecin treatment of primary cortical neurons (16Keramaris E. Stefanis L. MacLaurin J. Harada N. Takaku K. Ishikawa T. Taketo M.M. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Slack R.S. Park D.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 368-379Google Scholar). Furthermore, protection by oxotremorine-M was blocked by atropine. Thus, caspase-3 activation and cell death induced by the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin was substantially attenuated by stimulation of muscarinic receptors. To test if muscarinic receptor stimulation provided protection from oxidative stress, it was first necessary to characterize the H2O2 treatment conditions needed to activate caspase-3 and induce cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. The primary mechanism of apoptotic signaling after oxidative stress ultimately involves activation of the effector enzyme, caspase-3 (1Zornig M. Hueber A. Baum W. Evan G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1551: 1-37Google Scholar). Subsequently, activated caspase-3 cleaves susceptible substrates, such as PARP (36Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity increased after 2.5 h of treatment with 100 μm H2O2 and began to plateau between 4.5 and 5.5 h after treatment (Fig.2 A). The activation of PARP (37Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 225-239Google Scholar), which may follow oxidative stress and DNA damage, can lead to depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP, an effect that can be avoided by the use of PARP inhibitors, such as 3AB (38D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Google Scholar, 39Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to samples treated with 100 μmH2O2 alone, in-parallel H2O2-treated samples PARP was inhibited by pretreatment with 100 μm 3AB. Similar rates and magnitudes of caspase-3 activation were obtained after treatment with 100 μm H2O2 with or without inhibition of PARP (Fig. 2 A). The effects of H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation were reflected in measurements of the proteolysis of PARP, which is mediated by caspase-3 and results in the production of a stable 85-kDa product cleaved from the 116-kDa intact PARP. Treatment with 50–200 μm H2O2 caused a concentration-dependent increase in PARP proteolysis (Fig.2 B) and in caspase-3 activity (see below) that was similar in the presence and absence of 3AB. Cell death, assessed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the media, was prominent between 8 and 24 h after treatment with 100 μm H2O2 in the absence or presence of 3AB (Fig. 2 C). After 24 h, 60% of cells treated with H2O2 had died, and only slightly less (50%) had died after treatment with H2O2plus 3AB. Using these established conditions, we examined if muscarinic receptor stimulation with oxotremorine-M modulated cellular responses to H2O2. Pretreatment with 300 μmoxotremorine-M (30 min) greatly reduced caspase-3 activity induced by 100, 150, and 200 μm H2O2 in the presence or absence of 3AB (Fig.3 A). Remarkably, nearly complete blockade of caspase-3 activation was attained with oxotremorine-M in cells incubated with 100 μmH2O2, and even with the highest concentration of H2O2 tested, 200 μm, caspase-3 activity was reduced more than 50% by treatment with oxotremorine-M. Measurements of PARP proteolysis showed that it mirrored changes in caspase-3 activity, as oxotremorine-M treatment also greatly attenuated the H2O2 concentration-dependent induction of PARP proteolysis (Fig. 3 B). Thus, stimulation of muscarinic receptors provided substantial protection from the activation of caspase-3 caused by oxidative stress induced by H2O2. To evaluate the significance of the protective effect of muscarinic receptor activation, the protection provided by oxotremorine-M was compared with that of a general caspase inhibitor, BAF. These experiments demonstrated that the substantial protection provided by treatment with oxotremorine-M against 100 μmH2O2-induced PARP proteolysis was similar to that afforded by 100 μm BAF (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, the effects of oxotremorine-M and BAF were compared on H2O2-induced cell death, as assessed by measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release into the media at early (11 h) and late (24 h) times of cell death that were determined previously (Fig. 2 C). Treatment with the general caspase inhibitor, 100 μm BAF, blocked cell death by 80% 11 h after treatment, indicating that early cell death induced by 100 μm H2O2 plus 3AB was predominantly caspase-dependent (Fig. 3 D). However, after 24 h, pretreatment with BAF only reduced cell death by 30%, indicating that later cell death is mediated by a caspase-independent mechanism. A similar transition, with protection by BAF at shorter times after oxidative stress followed by loss of protection at 24 h, has been reported previously (40Krishnamurthy P.K. Mays J.L. Bijur G.N. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 515-523Google Scholar). In the same experiments in which BAF was tested, parallel samples were used to determine whether cell death was modulated by activation of muscarinic receptors. Once again, 300 μm oxotremorine-M (30 min preincubation) afforded the same extent of protection as did inhibition of caspases with BAF (Fig. 3 D), reducing cell death by 80% 11 h after treatment with H2O2. The protective effect of oxotremorine-M was completely blocked by pretreatment with the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 μm), confirming that oxotremorine-M action was mediated by a muscarinic receptor-dependent mechanism. There was a lower protective effect of oxotremorine-M 24 h after treatment with H2O2, which matched the diminished effect of BAF. Thus, treatment with H2O2 caused activation of caspase-3 and an early caspase-dependent cell death, and these effects were greatly attenuated by the caspase inhibitor BAF and to a similar extent by muscarinic receptor activation. The complete signaling pathway mediating H2O2-induced caspase-3 activation is not known, but an early event in the response to H2O2 is stabilization, accumulation, and transcriptional activation of the tumor suppressor p53. Treatment with 100 μmH2O2 caused a large increase in the level of p53 that was evident 2 h after treatment, before activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3 E). There was a corresponding increase in the level of the p53-regulated protein p21, indicating the p53 was transcriptionally active (Fig. 3 F). Pretreatment with 300 μm oxotremorine-M (30 min) did not reduce the H2O2-induced increases in p53 or p21 (Fig. 3,E and F), indicating that oxotremorine-M did not exert an antioxidant effect blocking initial responses to H2O2 but, rather, attenuated signaling leading to caspase-3 activation and cell death. To examine if the protection afforded by muscarinic receptor stimulation also was evident in another condition that causes apoptosis, experiments were carried out using rotenone to inhibit the mitochondrial complex 1, which causes oxidative stress (41Zhang Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 240-250Google Scholar). In accordance with our recent report that characterized rotenone-induced caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (42King T.D. Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Brain Res. 2001; 919: 106-114Google Scholar), there was a nearly 6-fold increase in caspase-3 activity after treatment with 5 μm rotenone (Fig.4 A). Pretreatment with 300 μm oxotremorine-M almost completely prevented rotenone-induced activation of caspase-3, whereas activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors with nicotine provided no protection from rotenone. Treatment with carbachol, a nonspecific cholinergic receptor agonist, prevented caspase-3 activation by rotenone to a similar extent as oxotremorine-M, and the protective effect of carbachol was prevented by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine but was unaffected by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine. Thus, activation of muscarinic receptors greatly attenuated caspase-3 activation induced by rotenone as well as by camptothecin and H2O2. It is important to note that not all apoptotic-inducing insults are attenuated by stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Staurosporine is one of the most widely used agents to activate caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and we previously characterized the staurosporine concentration- and time-dependent activation of apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (30Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Google Scholar). Treatment with staurosporine caused a time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity, and there was no attenuation in cells pretreated with oxotremorine-M (Fig.4 B). Thus, muscarinic receptor activation does not cause a global inhibition of the activation of caspase-3 caused by apoptotic stimuli, but it provides protection from a discreet group of insults. We focused on the actions of oxotremorine-M against the deleterious effects of camptothecin to examine the mechanism of protection. To examine if the protective effect of stimulated muscarinic receptors was upstream or downstream of the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, we monitored the mitochondrial and cytosolic levels of cytochrome c. Treatment with camptothecin (1 μm; 4 h) caused a massive release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, resulting in a nearly 4-fold increase in the cytosolic cytochrome c level and a 60% decline in the mitochondrial cytochrome c content (Fig.5). Pretreatment with oxotremorine-M (300 μm; 30 min) completely blocked this displacement of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Thus, the protective effect of muscarinic receptor stimulation targeted a step in the apoptotic signaling pathway preceding cytochromec release from the mitochondria. Members of the bcl-2 family of proteins are key regulators of the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. For example, the pro-apoptotic Bax can translocate to the mitochondria to transmit apoptotic signals, an event that can reduce the mitochondrial level of anti-apoptotic bcl-2. Therefore, we tested if treatment with oxotremorine-M influenced changes in the mitochondrial levels of Bax and bcl-2 after exposure to camptothecin. Treatment with camptothecin increased the level of Bax in the mitochondria by ∼4-fold (Fig.6 A). This translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induced by camptothecin was nearly completely blocked by pretreatment with oxotremorine-M. The mitochondrial bcl-2 levels were regulated opposite to those of Bax. As shown in Fig. 6 B, camptothecin treatment caused a reduction in the mitochondrial level of bcl-2, and pretreatment with oxotremorine-M prevented this loss of mitochondrial bcl-2. Thus, the protective action of stimulated muscarinic receptors after camptothecin treatment is associated with blockade of the activation of pro-apoptotic Bax, which was associated with retention of mitochondrial bcl-2 and cytochrome c. Because the mitochondrial accumulation of Bax is likely most proximal to muscarinic receptors of these events, we examined mitochondrial Bax levels after treatment with H2O2 and rotenone. A similar oxotremorine-M-induced diminution of Bax translocation to the mitochondria was detected after treatment with H2O2 or with rotenone (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that a common survival-promoting mechanism, blockade of Bax activation, is induced by stimulation of muscarinic receptors after each of these insults. This investigation found that activation of muscarinic receptors provided substantial protection from the induction of apoptotic signaling caused by three common insults, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial function. Although cells eventually succumbed because of the extremity of the toxic treatments employed, remarkable protection from the activation of caspase-3 induced by each of these conditions was evident upon stimulation of muscarinic receptors, a protection that was associated with reduced translocation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to the mitochondria. To study this effect in cells with a relatively uniform level of expression of muscarinic receptors, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used because they endogenously express muscarinic receptors predominantly of the M3 subtype (43Lambert D.G. Ghataorre A.S. Nahorski S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 165: 71-77Google Scholar), as opposed to mixed populations of cells and receptors present in most other neuronal preparations. These properties of physiologically relevant levels of receptors and the uniformity of receptor expression were deemed sufficiently advantageous to balance the limitations imposed by the utilization of proliferating cells. In fact, many studies show that exposure to differentiating agents enhances defenses against many insults, such as oxidative stress (44Jackson G.R. Werrbach-Perez K. Pan Z. Sampath D. Perez-Polo J.R. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 285-290Google Scholar, 45Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Google Scholar, 46Kamata H. Tanaka C. Yagisawa H. Hirata H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 212: 179-182Google Scholar), suggesting that this model system imposed a greater challenge for rescuing cells from these insults. However, with this identification of the protective capacity of activated muscarinic receptors, further efforts should be directed toward examining these interactions in mature neurons and determining whether or not stimulation of other G-protein-coupled receptors also provides protection. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors provided protection from three relatively common insults. Oxidative stress contributes to neuronal dysfunction and loss in many neurodegenerative conditions (21Halliwell B. Drugs Aging. 2001; 18: 685-716Google Scholar, 22Sayre L.M. Smith M.A. Perry G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 721-738Google Scholar). For example, much evidence links oxidative stress to the neuropathology of AD (9Pratico D. Clark C.M. Liun F. Lee V.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 972-976Google Scholar, 18Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Google Scholar, 19Mattson M.P. Alzheimer's Dis. Rev. 1997; 2: 1-14Google Scholar, 20Behl C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 301-323Google Scholar, 25Gibson G.E. Huang H.M. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1007-1015Google Scholar), where there is a concomitant loss of cholinergic function (13Bartus R.T. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 495-529Google Scholar), including loss of muscarinic receptor-coupled signaling activities (47Jope R.S. J. Alz. Dis. 1999; 1: 287-295Google Scholar). Based on this co-existence of oxidative stress and loss of muscarinic receptor function, it was of interest to investigate if loss of muscarinic receptor-coupled signaling could contribute to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress by testing if active muscarinic receptors provide protection from caspase activation. The results demonstrated that activation of muscarinic receptors with the selective agonist oxotremorine-M provided significant protection from the apoptosis-signaling cascade induced by H2O2. Muscarinic receptor activation also provided substantial protection from caspase-3 activation ensuing from inhibition of mitochondrial function or DNA damage. These findings suggest that loss of muscarinic receptor activity in neurodegenerative conditions, such as AD, likely increases the vulnerability of cells to the detrimental effects of these insults. The protection provided by muscarinic receptor activation was of a similar magnitude to that of a general caspase inhibitor. For both of these, protection was greatest at lower concentrations of H2O2 and at short times of treatment with H2O2 or camptothecin. The former suggests that muscarinic receptor activation may provide considerable protection from physiologically relevant levels of oxidative stress. The delayed death observed even in the presence of either oxotremorine-M or the caspase inhibitor BAF could be due to necrotic mechanisms contributing to the later cell death, against which these agents were ineffective, or the agents themselves may have lost the ability to provide protection after long incubation periods. For example, the agents may have been degraded or sequestered, or prolonged exposure to oxotremorine-M may have down-regulated relevant signaling activities, which lessened the protection provided from cell death. Regardless of the cause of the temporally limited protection, it is notable that muscarinic receptor activation was essentially equivalent to inhibition of caspases in providing protection, indicating that at physiologically relevant levels of toxic insults, considerable protection is provided by intracellular signals emanating from muscarinic receptors. The signaling mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of muscarinic receptor activation on the detrimental effects of these insults appeared to be directed at Bax. The results clearly showed that oxotremorine-M did not prevent the initial detrimental effects of H2O2 or camptothecin, as exemplified by the equal activation of p53 by each of these agents in the presence and absence of oxotremorine-M. However, oxotremorine-M treatment blocked the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, blocked loss of mitochondrial bcl-2, and blocked cytochrome c release to the cytosol. The latter action leads to activation of caspase-3, indicating that the muscarinic receptor-induced protection from caspase-3 activation likely results from these actions, originating at the point of Bax activation, which is known to mediate apoptosis after a variety of insults, such as DNA damage (48Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Google Scholar). The mechanism by which stimulated muscarinic receptors block apoptotic activation of Bax remains to be determined. In the absence of apoptotic conditions, Bax is predominantly cytosolic, at least partially sequestered by the scaffold protein 14-3-3 (49Samuel T. Weber H.O. Rauch P. Verdoodt B. Eppel J.T. McShea A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2058-2065Google Scholar). Conformational changes in Bax appear to lead to its translocation to the mitochondria and oligomerization (51Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Google Scholar) followed by release of cytochrome c (54Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Google Scholar), although precise details of the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition during apoptotic signaling remain unknown. Our findings suggest that signals from muscarinic receptors attenuate apoptotic activation of Bax, an action that may be mediated by signals (e.g. kinase activities, calcium transients) impinging on Bax, 14-3-3, or other regulatory molecules known to participate in Bax activation (e.g. Refs. 55Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548Google Scholar and 56Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedicy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Google Scholar), retarding its activation and translocation to the mitochondria. However, the precise intermediate steps accounting for Bax activation as well as muscarinic receptor-induced neuroprotection await identification. AD is associated with both increased neuronal oxidative stress and loss of cholinergic function. The results of this study demonstrate that these two conditions likely exacerbate neuronal dysfunction since activation of muscarinic receptor-coupled signaling provides protection from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Thus, as muscarinic receptor-coupled signaling activity becomes impaired during the progression of AD, neurons lose this important mechanism of counteracting the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Interpretation of the results presented here must take into consideration the current controversy about the extent to which apoptosis contributes to Alzheimer's disease as well as other neurodegenerative conditions (57Roth K.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 829-838Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that the protection provided by muscarinic receptors against oxidative stress and the other insults examined might be of greater importance for maintaining neural function and plasticity, which likely are impaired temporally before apoptosis after exposure to these insults, although indicators of apoptotic signaling were used as outcome measures in this study. The findings reported here also may have relevance for developmental regulation of the central nervous system. There is a wealth of information that cholinergic afferents to the cortex and hippocampus serve a growth regulatory function in ontogeny (reviewed in Refs. 58Hohmann C.F. Berger-Sweeney J. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1998; 5: 401-425Google Scholar and 59Nguyen L. Rigo J.M. Rocher V. Belachew S. Malgrange B. Rogister B. Leprince P. Moonen G. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 187-202Google Scholar). The present results suggest that one action of cholinergic activity may be to promote survival of innervated neurons during development by inhibiting apoptotic mechanisms. In this regard, it is of interest that cell loss induced by alcohol exposure has been hypothesized to stem at least in part from inhibitory actions of alcohol on muscarinic receptor signaling (60Costa L.G. Guizzetti M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 721-726Google Scholar). We would speculate that stimulation of other G-protein-coupled receptors activating similar signaling pathways also would bolster neuronal survival, providing a means for innervated cells to survive under conditions that are lethal to cells not connected to sufficiently active networks. In conclusion, these results indicate that in many instances continued neuronal survival is dependent upon the environment of the cell, as cell-to-cell contact and signals received from neighboring cells may provide the necessary impetus to bolster defenses against death programs."

https://openalex.org/W2037506480,"SKIP (skeletal muscle andkidney enriched inositolphosphatase) is a recently identified phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate- and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific 5-phosphatase. In this study, we investigated the intracellular localization of SKIP. Indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation showed that, in serum-starved cells, both endogenous and recombinant SKIP colocalized with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, SKIP transiently translocated to plasma membrane ruffles and colocalized with submembranous actin. Data base searching demonstrated a novel 128-amino acid domain in the C terminus of SKIP, designated SKICH for SKIP carboxyl homology, which is also found in the 107-kDa 5-phosphatase PIPP and in members of the TRAF6-binding protein family. Recombinant SKIP lacking the SKICH domain localized to the ER, but did not translocate to membrane ruffles following EGF stimulation. The SKIP SKICH domain showed perinuclear localization and mediated EGF-stimulated plasma membrane ruffle localization. The SKICH domain of the 5-phosphatase PIPP also mediated plasma membrane ruffle localization. Mutational analysis identified the core sequence within the SKICH domain that mediated constitutive membrane association and C-terminal sequences unique to SKIP that contributed to ER localization. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a novel membrane-targeting domain that serves to recruit SKIP and PIPP to membrane ruffles."

The phosphorylation of tau reduces its ability to bind and stabilize axonal microtubules during axonal growth.

The ability of Cdk5 to phosphorylate tau was higher when in association with p39 than in association with p35. Tau phosphorylation at Ser-202 and Thr-205 was decreased in Cdk5−/− mouse brain but not in p35−/− mouse brain, suggesting that Cdk5/p39 is responsible for the in vivophosphorylation of tau at these sites.

Current evidence supports the view that neuronal microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)1 determine the microtubule rearrangements underlying neuronal morphogenesis (1Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 13-25PubMed Google Scholar). This process can be achieved through the regulation of the expression of particular MAP isoforms at specific subcellular locations and at distinct developmental stages as well as through the modification of MAPs by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (2Riederer B.M. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among the neuronal MAPs, tau protein has attracted a particular interest due to its polar distribution in the axon as compared with the somatodendritic compartment, as well as its developmentally regulated expression and phosphorylation (3Arioka M. Tsukamoto M. Ishiguro K. Kato R. Sato K. Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Caceres A. Potrebic S. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tau is one of several MAPs that regulate the assembly and stabilization of the microtubule network (5Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of tau are generated from a single gene by alternative splicing, leading to the developmentally regulated expression of different isoforms (6Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation provides tau with further molecular diversity; the function of tau as a microtubule-binding protein is regulated by the phosphorylation of specific residues (7Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In general, an increase in tau phosphorylation correlates inversely with its ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. Thus, phosphorylation of tau contributes an additional mechanism to control the balance between microtubule dynamics and stabilization in developing axons (8Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 9Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Six J. Lubke U. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5066-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Several developmental studies have already shown that phosphorylated tau is present in neurons at a high level only during the period of intense neuritic outgrowth and that it becomes barely detectable during the period of neurite stabilization and synaptogenesis (10Brion J.P. Octave J.N. Couck A.M. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Riederer B.M. Binder L.I. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 33: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tau is essential during brain development to maintain a certain degree of microtubule instability, thus affecting the growth of neurites. Tau phosphorylation at specific residues not only occurs during normal brain development but also during pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In normal brain, the equilibrium between tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation modulates the stability of the axonal cytoskeleton and thereby the axonal morphology (12Matsuo E.S. Shin R.W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). However, the breakdown of this equilibrium under pathological conditions results in tau dysfunction, which is considered to be one of the critical events leading to neuronal degeneration (13Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Drewes G. Gustke N. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It has been shown that hyperphosphorylation of tau reduces its affinity for microtubules and can contribute to the self-association of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, one of the major histopathological hallmarks of AD (14Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation is interpreted as abnormal in the sense that this kind of tau phosphorylation has never been observed in normal aged human brain (15Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles has been found to be very similar to a transient hyperphosphorylation of tau that occurs during early development of the brain (8Bramblett G.T.

Therefore, the biochemical pathways that play a role during early brain development are likely to be reactivated in AD brains. Tau is phosphorylated in vitroby several protein kinases, including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (19Scott C.W. Spreen R.C. Herman J.L. Chow F.P. Davison M.D. Young J. Caputo C.B. J. Biol.

Cdk5 is an active enzyme in postmitotic neurons; the activation of Cdk5 requires its association with the neuronal activators, p35 or p39 (29Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T.

Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an additional Cdk5 activator, p39, was identified based on its sequence homology to p35 (31Tang D. Yeung J.

Cdk5 has been shown to play an important role in the development of the nervous system, including neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth (32Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H.

Insights into the critical function of Cdk5/p35 in brain development have been gained from gene targeting experiments (32Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Cdk5−/− mice display extensive defects in all brain areas (35Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This difference in the phenotypic severity suggests the functional importance of another Cdk5 activator, p39, in brain development. Although p39−/− mice have no obvious abnormalities in the brain, p35−/−p39−/− double knockout mice exhibit phenotypes identical to those of Cdk5−/− mice (36Ko J. Humbert S. Bronson R.T. Takahashi S. Kulkarni A.B. Li E. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that p35 and p39 are major activators of Cdk5 in the brain and that their coexistence as Cdk5 activators may contribute to the in vivo activation of Cdk5 in a region-specific or developmentally regulated manner, as proposed by Wu et al.(37Wu D.C. Yu Y.P. Lee N.T.K. Yu A.C.H. Wang J.H.C. Han Y.F. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Developmental regulation of tau phosphorylation is critical in maintaining the balance between microtubule plasticity and stability in developing axons. The phosphorylation pattern of tau in AD brains closely resembles that of tau in embryonic brains (8Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 9Goedert M. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Six J. Lubke U. Vandermeeren M. Cras P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Proc. Natl.

Thus, the developing brain is a useful experimental system to study the mechanisms that control tau phosphorylation. Although Cdk5 has been found to phosphorylate tau in vitro, its in vivoroles remain to be examined. Here, we show that Cdk5 in association with p39 is involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of tau during brain development and that its phosphorylation reduces the ability of tau to bind to microtubules. In addition, Cdk5/p35 and Cdk5/p39 were found to exhibit different abilities for tau phosphorylation, with the higher activity in Cdk5/p39. Considering the temporal and spatial expression patterns of p35 and p39 reported here, the role of tau phosphorylation by Cdk5 is discussed with regard to the regulation of microtubule stability during brain development. Polyclonal antibodies to p35 (C-19) and Cdk5 (C-8) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against p39 was kindly provided by Dr. Tsai (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).

Embryonic and postnatal mouse brains were dissected on ice into various brain regions: cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted from the various brain regions of wild-type mice with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA concentration and purity were determined by UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. For Western blot analysis, each tissue from wild-type, p35−/−, and Cdk5−/− mice was washed in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in 10 volumes of lysis buffer at 4 °C.

Following a 30-min incubation on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined as described (39Lowry O. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Cdk5 kinase activity assay, the brain extracts were prepared with the same lysis buffer except with a NaCl concentration of 50 mm to allow Cdk5 association with p35 and p39. Each sample (20 μg of total RNA) was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After UV cross-linking, the membrane was prehybridized for more than 3 h at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml boiled fragmented salmon sperm DNA. 32P-Labeled probes were added to the prehybridization buffer, and the membrane was incubated overnight at 42 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed two times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 10 min, and two times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. The washed membrane was exposed to x-ray film with double intensifying screens at −80 °C. After stripping the probe, the same membrane was used for hybridization with a new probe. The expression levels of Cdk5, p35, and p39 mRNAs were quantified by measuring the optical densities of specific bands using an image analysis system with NIH Image software, version 1.62. For detection of p35 mRNA, a 924-bp fragment of mouse p35 cDNA containing the entire coding region was used as a probe as previously described (40Ohshima T. Kozak C.A. Nagle J.W. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Genomics. 1996; 35: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A 275-bp fragment used as a p39 probe (nucleotides 891–1165 of the full-length mouse p39 cDNA) was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using the following primers: 5′-CAACGAGATCTCCTACCCGCTC-3′ and 5′-TCATAGTCCAGTGCTTGGCTCC-3′. This fragment excludes the region of homology between p35 and p39 cDNAs, thus minimizing the probability of cross-hybridization. A 560-bp fragment used as a Cdk5 probe (nucleotides 331–890 of the full-length mouse Cdk5 cDNA) was produced by reverse transcription-PCR using the following primers: 5′-AGCTGCAATGGTGACCTGGACC-3′ and 5′-TCCTCTGCTGAGATGCGCTGCA-3′. As an internal control, a 433-bp fragment used as a mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was generated as described previously (41Wüllner U. Isenmann S. Gleichmann M. Klockgether T. Bahr M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 110: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein for each experiment were separated by SDS-PAGE before being transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in 1× PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1:10,000) was performed at room temperature for 60 min. A signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), and relative optical densities of the bands were quantified as described above. For detection of p35, p39, and Cdk5 protein, membranes were incubated with anti-p35 antibody (1:1,000), anti-p39 antibody (1:1,000), and anti-Cdk5 antibody (1:1,000). The phosphorylation state of tau was examined using the AT-8 antibody (diluted to 5 μg/ml), which recognizes tau only when Ser-202 and Thr-205 (numbering based on longest human brain tau isoforms) are phosphorylated (42Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Schroter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To determine total tau levels, the phosphorylation-independent monoclonal antibody TAU-5 (1:5,000) was used (43LoPresti P. Szuchet S. Papasozomenos S.C. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10369-10373Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The data obtained with the AT-8 antibody were normalized to total tau levels on the stripped and reprobed membranes. For reuse, the membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 63 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS. For the detergent extraction assay, the amount of tau was determined with the TAU-5 antibody. Different regions of mouse brain were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as described above. The supernatants (brain extracts) were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with either anti-Cdk5 (C-8), anti-p35 (C-19), or anti-p39 antibodies. The Cdk5 immunoprecipitate was prepared by incubation of 300 μl of the lysate (corresponding to 300 μg of protein) with anti-Cdk5 antibody (3 μg) overnight at 4 °C followed by further incubation with 25 μl of Protein A-agarose beads (50% slurry in lysis buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. For the preparation of p35 or p39 immunoprecipitates, 500 μl of the lysate (corresponding to 1 mg of protein) was incubated with either anti-p35 antibody (3 μg) or anti-p39 antibody (3 μg) as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with the lysis buffer and twice with a kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and resuspended in 60 μl of the kinase buffer. Kinase activity assays were performed using either histone H1 or bacterially expressed human tau as a substrate as described previously (44Li B.S. Zhang L. Gu J. Amin N.D. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6055-6062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tau was purified from the heat-stable supernatant of anEscherichia coli lysate by phosphocellulose column chromatography (45Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R. Ishiguro K. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17166-17172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 59Hashiguchi M. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Hashiguch T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44525-44530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total volume of 50 μl of kinase assay mixture was used, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm microcystin LR, 10 μl of the immunoprecipitate, and either 10 μg of histone H1 or 5 μg of tau protein. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled immediately for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiography was used to detect the phosphorylation of histone H1 or tau. To quantify the Cdk5 levels in the p35 and p39 immunoprecipitates, 10 μl of each immunoprecipitate was immunodetected by Western blotting using an anti-Cdk5 antibody. Primary cultures of cerebellar neurons were prepared as described previously (4Caceres A. Potrebic S. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were dissected from E17 wild-type, p35−/−, and Cdk5−/− mouse brains; dissociated by trituration; counted; and plated at 1 × 105 cells/cm2 onto six-well culture plates previously coated with polyethylenimine (2 μg/ml in 0.1 mboric acid buffer, pH 7.4). After 1 h in 10% horse serum-containing medium, the cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with N2 supplement, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were used for experiments on the 7th day in culture. To investigate the effect of tau phosphorylation on its association with microtubules, a Triton X-100 extraction assay was utilized to separate the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal component from the detergent-soluble cytosolic component. The fractionation of cell lysates was performed by a modification of a previously reported procedure (46Esmaeli-Azad B. McCarty J.H. Feinstein S.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 869-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were washed with prewarmed (37 °C) PBS followed by washing with prewarmed (37 °C) microtubule stabilization buffer (0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 30% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mmβ-phosphoglycerate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged, and the detergent-soluble supernatants were collected. The supernatants were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min following the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. The remaining cellular pellets were solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and incubated in a boiling water bath as above. The relative protein concentration of these samples was determined by densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gel. Equal protein amounts were subsequently electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunodetection was performed with a TAU-5 antibody. Tau is predominantly localized in axons and has a specific function in the formation of the axonal cytoskeleton. A study that demonstrated the temporal and spatial expression patterns of tau mRNA in the rat brain suggested that its expression appeared to coincide with the region-specific onset of axogenesis (47Takemura R. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The onset of tau mRNA expression and its subsequent decrease in the brain stem occurred earlier than those in the cerebral cortex (47Takemura R. Kanai Y. Hirokawa N. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whereas studies have demonstrated the developmental regulation of tau phosphorylation in the brain, its spatial regulation remains less clear. To address this question, we examined the developmental changes in the expression and phosphorylation of tau in different brain regions, t"
https://openalex.org/W2077176397,"SC1, a member of the BM-40 family of extracellular matrix proteins, was recombinantly expressed in a eukaryotic expression system. The full-length protein as well as truncated versions were purified to homogeneity under non-denaturing conditions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of full-length SC1 revealed a mass of 87.8 kDa of which 16.8 kDa is contributed by posttranslational modifications. In electron microscopy, after negative staining, SC1 was revealed as a globule attached to a thread-like structure. A calcium dependence of the SC1 conformation could be demonstrated by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the extracellular matrix of cultured osteosarcoma cells SC1 was found associated with collagen I-containing fibrils, and binding of SC1 to reconstituted collagen I fibrils could be demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. SC1 showed a broad expression in a variety of tissues. SC1, a member of the BM-40 family of extracellular matrix proteins, was recombinantly expressed in a eukaryotic expression system.

SC1 showed a broad expression in a variety of tissues. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight phosphate-buffered saline SC1 was originally cloned from a rat brain expression library by screening with a polyclonal antibody raised against synaptic junction glycoproteins (1Johnston I.G. Paladino T. Gurd J.W. Brown I.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 165-176Google Scholar). Its mRNA is expressed widely in the brain and could be detected in many types of neurons. In immunoblots of brain proteins SC1 was detected as a doublet band of 116 and 120 kDa, whereas the molecular mass predicted from sequence was 70.6 kDa (1Johnston I.G. Paladino T. Gurd J.W. Brown I.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 165-176Google Scholar). A homologous cDNA called hevin was also cloned from a library derived from human high endothelial venule cells (2Girard J.P. Springer T.A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 113-123Google Scholar). Human high endothelial venule cells form specialized postcapillary vascular sites (high endothelial venules) that mediate extensive extravasation of circulating lymphocytes from the blood into lymphoid organs and sites of chronic inflammation. The high sequence identity suggests that hevin is the human SC1 ortholog. SC1/hevin is expressed in many tissues as a secreted glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix. Sequence analysis showed that SC1/hevin belongs to the BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin family of proteins and is composed of a highly acidic domain I without homology to any known protein, a follistatin-like domain (FS) and an extracellular calcium-binding domain (EC) (Fig. 1). The presence of the FS and the EC domain is the hallmark of the BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin family, which consists of BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin, SC1/hevin, QR1, tsc36/flik, the testicans, and the SMOCs (3Vannahme C. Smyth N. Miosge N. Gösling S. Frie C. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Hartmann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37977-37986Google Scholar). Functional assays suggest that SC1/hevin may serve as an antagonist of cell adhesion, an effect also studied extensively for SPARC (4Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Google Scholar). Hevin was shown to inhibit the attachment and spreading of endothelial cells on fibronectin substrates, and it was suggested that hevin modulates the high endothelial venule cell adhesion and phenotype, thus facilitating lymphocyte transendothelial migration (5Girard J.P. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4511-4517Google Scholar). The effects of SC1/hevin on cell adhesion are of particular interest due to the fact that SC1/hevin is down-regulated in many types of cancer cells and may serve as a negative regulator of cell growth and proliferation (6Nelson P.S. Plymate S.R. Wang K. True L.D. Ware J.L. Gan L. Liu A.Y. Hood L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 232-236Google Scholar, 7Bendik I. Schraml P. Ludwig C.U. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 626-629Google Scholar, 8Claeskens A. Ongenae N. Neefs J.M. Cheyns P. Kaijen P. Cools M. Kutoh E. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1123-1130Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of SC1/hevin is associated with the migration of myotomes during somitogenesis in early mouse embryos and undergoes a rapid down-regulation just before myotome emigration from the somitic environment (9Ringuette M. Rogers I. Varmuza S. Rush S. Brown I.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 403-406Google Scholar). In another line of work, SC1/hevin was shown to bind to B-lymphocyte precursors (10Oritani K. Kincaid P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 771-782Google Scholar) and to augment B cell lymphopoiesis (11Oritani K. Kanakura Y. Aoyama K. Yokota T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Tomiyama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kincaid P.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 3404-3413Google Scholar, 12Oritani K. Kincaid P.W. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1998; 32: 1-7Google Scholar), effects that are mediated by the N-terminal acidic domain I. Gene targeting of SC1 in mouse did not show any obvious phenotype (13McKinnon P.J. McLaughlin S.K. Kapsetaki M. Margolskee R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 656-660Google Scholar), a finding that is not too surprising considering the number of members of the BM-40 family that may play a compensatory role. The major objective of this investigation was to characterize SC1/hevin at the protein level, to investigate the functionality of its predicted calcium-binding EC domain, and to identify mechanisms by which it can be integrated into the extracellular matrix. For this purpose we expressed full-length SC1 as well as fragments with domain-specific truncations. These were analyzed for structural features as well as for the ability to bind calcium and collagen fibrils. The purified SC1 FS-EC domain pair was used to raise an antibody with which we could demonstrate a colocalization of SC1/hevin with collagen I in the extracellular matrix of SAOS-2 cells and determine the distribution of SC1 in many tissues also outside the central nervous system. The cDNA clone for mouse SC1 was kindly supplied by Dr. Peter J. McKinnon. Four cDNA fragments, representing the full-length SC1, the pair of I and FS domains, the pair of FS and EC domains, and the EC domain, were generated by PCR using the following primers: forward primer-1, 5′-GCCCCGCTAGCCCCGACAAGTACAAGGTTC, reverse primer-2, 5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTCAAAAGAGGAGGTTTTCAT, forward primer-3, 5′-GCCCCGCTAGCCTCTTGCACGAACTTCCAAT, forward primer-4, 5′-GCCCCGCTAGCCCCTGCTTGTACGGACTTT, and reverse primer-5, 5′-CAATGACTGCGGCCGCTCAAATAGATTTGCAAGCTCCG. Primers 1 and 2 were used for full-length SC1, primers 1 and 5 were used for the pair of I and FS domains, primers 3 and 2 were used for the pair of FS and EC domains, and primers 4 and 2 were used for the EC domain. The primers introduced new restriction sites (NheI, NotI) and a stop codon. The NheI/NotI-restricted PCR products were purified and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pCEP-Pu/BM40 (14Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Google Scholar) to obtain the final expression vectors pCEP-Pu-SC1, pCEP-Pu-SC1-I-FS, pCEP-Pu-SC1-FS-EC, and pCEP-Pu-SC1-EC. The cDNA fragment of I-FS was additionally cloned in the modified expression vector pCEP-Pu with an N-terminal tag consisting of six histidines, a Myc epitope, and an enterokinase recognition site for cleavage of the tag (15Wuttke M. Müller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.-G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen) was used to produce a modified vector pRcCMV/BM40 (5.5 kilobases). Therefore, a HindIII/NotI fragment containing the signal peptide sequence and some of the 5′-untranslated region of BM-40 (105 bp) together with the full-length SC1 sequence (1.9 kilobases) was cleaved from pCEP-Pu-SC1, purified, and ligated to the same restriction sites in pRcCMV. The resulting vector was designated pRcCMV-SC1. The correct insertion and sequences of all amplified fragments were verified by cycle sequencing of both strands using an ABI Prism 377 Automated Sequencer (PE Biosystems). The human embryonic kidney cell line EBNA-293 (Invitrogen), which constitutively expresses the EBNA-1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus was used for transfection with pCEP-Pu-SC1-I-FS, pCEP-Pu-SC1-FS-EC, and pCEP-Pu-SC1-EC and selected with puromycin as described (14Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Google Scholar). The fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Aumailley) was transfected with pRcCMV-SC1. Two days after transfection the cells were split 1:10, and selection was started by adding 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Resistant clones were isolated after 4–5 weeks and then screened for expression of SC1 by immunoblotting with an antibody against the N-terminal portion of SC1 (16McKinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Brain Res. 1996; 709: 27-36Google Scholar). Conditioned serum-free media were stored at −80 °C. Conditioned serum-free medium was dialyzed against 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passed at 4 °C over a DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions that eluted between 0.26–0.33 m NaCl showed immunoreactivity with the antibody to SC1. These were dialyzed against 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, and applied to a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The recombinant protein was eluted at 0.35–0.41m NaCl. Further purification was carried out on a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The protein was eluted at 0.21 mNaCl. After concentration on a Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.0, the protein was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The SC1 pool was dialyzed against 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.9, and final purification was performed on a Resource Q column equilibrated in the same buffer. The pure SC1 eluted at 0.32–0.35m NaCl (linear gradient 0–1 m NaCl) and was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Conditioned serum-free medium was dialyzed against 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.2, and passed over an affinity column with cobalt Talon Metal Affinity Matrix (Clontech). The protein was eluted at a concentration of 20–70 mmimidazole. I-FS-containing fractions were further purified by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-75 equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The final pool was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Conditioned serum-free medium was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and passed over a column of DEAE-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. The recombinant protein was found in the flow-through and was, after dialysis against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.9, applied to a column of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The FS-EC protein eluted at 0.35–0.77 m NaCl and was, after concentration by ultrafiltration (YM-10, Amicon), further purified by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-75 equilibrated in 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6. Fractions containing the FS-EC-protein were dialyzed against 20 mm MES,1 pH 6.0, and subjected to chromatography on Resource S matrix, where it eluted at 0.25 m NaCl. The final pool was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Conditioned serum-free medium was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and passed through a DEAE-Sepharose column at 4 °C. The pH of the flow-through was adjusted to pH 9.0 and concentrated on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The EC domain was eluted at 0.5 m NaCl. Final purification was carried out by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-75 equilibrated in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The identity of all proteins was verified by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting, and in the case of the FS-EC domain pair and the EC domain alone, also by Edman degradation (model 473A, PE Biosystems). Purified proteins (20 pmol) were reduced with 0.5% of mercaptoethanol and denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. After denaturation, the proteins were incubated with 0.3 units of enzyme per mg of protein for 24 h at 37 °C in the buffers recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Digested and non-digested samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Samples for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were prepared as described (17Vorm O. Mann M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 955-958Google Scholar) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) as matrix. Detection and analysis of cations was performed utilizing the high or low mass detector in the linear mode of a Bruker Reflex III. The time of flight analyzer was calibrated using theM r of bovine serum albumin dimer (Sigma) of 132,859.0. Isolated full-length SC1 (5 μg/ml) was visualized by negative staining with 0.75% uranyl formate on carbon-coated grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge (18Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Google Scholar). The samples were examined in a Zeiss E 902 electron microscope. CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco model 715 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 °C in thermostatted quartz cells of 1-mm optical path length. The molar ellipticity [θ] (expressed in deg·cm2·dmol−1) was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. The Ca2+ dependence of the CD spectrum was measured by the addition of 2 mm CaCl2. Reversibility of the conformational change was tested by subsequent addition of 4 mm EDTA. To improve the signal to noise ratio, five spectra were accumulated. A base line with buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. Protein concentrations were determined from UV spectra using extinction coefficients calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The program SELCON was used to estimate the content of secondary structure elements. Intrinsic fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer in 10-mm path length rectangular cells at 25 °C with excitation at 280 nm. Emission spectra for the full-length SC1 (0.5 μm) and the I-FS and FS-EC domain pairs (each 1 μm) were recorded in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and for the EC domain (1 μm) in 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. All spectra were recorded with 2 mmCaCl2 and after the addition of 4 mm EDTA. The percent change in fluorescence intensity was calculated as ΔF 350 = 100 × (F Ca −F EDTA)/F Ca, withF Ca representing the fluorescence signal at Ca2+ saturation, and F EDTArepresenting the signal in the presence of excess EDTA. The purified FS-EC domain pair was used to immunize a rabbit. The antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography on a column with the antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Solutions of highly purified chicken collagen I were prepared in 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Samples were degassed under vacuum and then transferred to microcuvettes (light path, 1 cm) and mixed with an equal volume of distilled water at 4 °C. The cuvettes were sealed and placed into a spectrophotometer (Beckman UV 640, equipped with a multicell holder Micro Auto 12) connected to a water bath at 37 °C. Aggregation was followed by monitoring turbidity at 313 nm. When a plateau was reached, aliquots were spotted onto Parafilm sheets. Nickel grids coated with Formvar/carbon were floated for 5 min on drops to allow adsorption of fibrils. The grids were washed with PBS and treated for 30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The adsorbed fibrils were allowed to react with full-length SC1 or the FS-EC domain pair in 0.15 mNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmCaCl2 for 90 min. After washing 5 times with PBS, the grids were incubated with the affinity-purified SC1 antibody in PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) dried skim milk and, after renewed washing with a suspension of colloidal gold particles (18 nm), coated with goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) dried skim milk. Finally, the grids were washed with distilled water and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 10 min. In control experiments SC1 or the first antibody was omitted. Electron micrographs were taken at 80 kV with a Philips CM 10 electron microscope. The human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 (DSMZ, Braunschweig) was cultivated in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamate, and optionally, 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate. For immunofluorescence microscopy cells were plated onto plastic chamber slides, cultivated until they reached confluency, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunolabeling for SC1 was done by consecutive treatment for 1 h with the affinity-purified rabbit antibody to SC1 followed by a diaminotriazinylaminofluorescein (DTAF)-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG and for collagen with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by Cy™3-conjugated affinity-purified goat antibody against mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Pictures of the cell layers were taken with a fluorescence laser scanning microscope (Leica). Mouse tissues were homogenized and extracted in 5 volumes (ml/g) 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete®, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The homogenates were centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatants were submitted to SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter and developed with the affinity-purified antibody against SC1, followed by peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In inhibition experiments the first antibody was preincubated with 50 μg of the FS-EC domain pair for 2 h at room temperature and then applied to an immunoblot of kidney extract and recombinant SC1 protein. Eukaryotic cells were used for protein expression to ensure proper folding and posttranslational modifications. The use of the BM-40 signal peptide gave targeting through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and secretion into the medium from which recombinant proteins could be purified. The human embryonic kidney cell line EBNA-293 was initially used for expression of all four constructs, corresponding to full-length SC1, the I-FS and FS-EC domain pairs, and the EC domain (Fig. 1). Although the shorter constructs were produced at acceptable levels, expression of full-length SC1 was low in this cell line. As an alternative we transfected the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 with a plasmid coding for full-length SC1 and selected stably transformed clones. One of these showed good SC1 expression and only slight degradation of the protein and was used for recombinant production of the full-length protein. In SDS-PAGE full-length SC1 migrated above the 94-kDa marker, although the calculated peptide mass is only 70.9 kDa (Fig. 2, Table I). The I-FS domain pair was cloned with a His-Myc tag and could be purified by cobalt affinity chromatography. In SDS-PAGE, the protein gave a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa (Fig. 2), in contrast to the calculated mass of 57.6 kDa. The purified FS-EC domain pair gave a single SDS-PAGE band at 33 kDa, whereas the EC domain migrated as a 17 kDa protein (Fig. 2), in both cases in reasonable agreement with their predicted molecular masses. Taken together, the results show an unexpectedly low mobility in SDS-PAGE of the larger proteins, which may be caused by posttranslational modifications within the I and FS domains and/or the highly acidic nature of the I domain.Table IMolecular masses of SC1 or SC1 fragments and their glycan portionsSC1 flI-FStagFS-ECECFSIM r calculated[Da]70,98657,63227,47318,5858,88843,513M r[Da]87,775aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.74,367aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.29,583aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.18,589aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.10,99458,192M r after N-glycosidase F [Da]83,017aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.69,575aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.27,474aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.18,606aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.8,86855,543M r of N-glycans [Da]4,7584,7922,10902,1262,649M r of other posttranslational modifications [Da]12,03111,943121012,030M r after endoglycosidase H [Da]85,335aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.71,984aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.27,769aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.18,606aExperimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values.9,16357,566M r of high mannose and/or hybrid glycans [Da]2,4402,3831,81401,831626fl, full-length.a Experimentally determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and used to calculate the other values. Open table in a new tab fl, full-length. In an attempt to resolve the cause for these discrepancies all proteins were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry either directly or after digestion withN-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H (Table I). All proteins, with the exception of the EC domain, carriedN-glycosidase F-sensitive N-linked glycans. Full-length SC1 contained about 4.8 kDa of N-glycans, of which 2.7 kDa were contributed by domain I and about 2.1 kDa by the FS domain. Potential N-glycosylation sites are located at Asn-12, -131, and -151 in domain I and at Asn-444 in the FS domain. The mass of endoglycosidase H-sensitive high mannose/hybrid glycans in SC1 was about 2.4 kDa, with these structures mostly found on the FS domain (Table I). The masses determined for N-glycosidase F-digested full-length SC1 and domain I-FS were about 12 kDa higher than that predicted. Because the mass of the N-glycosidase F-digested FS-EC domain pair was as expected from sequence, these 12-kDa posttranslational modifications of full-length SC1 and domain pair I-FS are located in domain I. The purified full-length SC1 was visualized by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 3). SC1 was seen as a monomeric particle with a length of about 25 nm composed of a globule with a diameter of 9.5 nm attached to a thread-like structure with a length of about 15 nm. Because the x-ray structure of the FC-EC domain pair from the homologous protein BM-40 shows a rather compact fold (20Hohenester E. Maurer P. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3778-3786Google Scholar), the globule is likely to correspond to the FS and EC domains that make up the C-terminal part of SC1, whereas the thread-like structure is contributed by the highly acidic N-terminal domain I. The conformations of the recombinant proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism in the far-ultraviolet region. Spectra of full-length SC1 and the I-FS domain pair exhibited a marked negative band at 200 nm, indicating a large content of unordered structures (Fig. 4). In contrast the FS-EC domain pair and the isolated EC domain displayed shoulders at 222 nm typical for α-helices. Analysis of the CD spectra (Table II) suggested that the EC domain has the highest content of α-helix followed by the FS-EC domain pair, which also shows a high content of β-sheet. Domain I consists largely of unordered structures, which it contributes to full-length SC1 and the I-FS domain pair. All four proteins gave similar CD spectra when equilibrated in 2 mm CaCl2 or 4 mmEDTA (Fig. 4).Table IISecondary structure of calcium-saturated SC1 proteins calculated from circular dichroism spectraSecondary structureProteinSC1 flI-FStagFS-ECECα-Helix12112132β-Sheet31253018β-Turns28293027Unordered structure29361822Total1001019999Values were calculated using the SELCON software by which fractions are not normalized to 100% and negative values are permitted.

Upon excitation at 280 nm all proteins showed emission maxima between 339 and 351 nm that were not changed by the addition of 2 mm CaCl2 (Fig.5). However, calcium addition led to a decrease in fluorescence intensity for all proteins containing the EC domain, i.e. full-length SC1 (24%), the pair of FS and EC domains (64%), and the single EC domain (97%) itself. The conformational change was reversible when EDTA was added in excess. In contrast, the fluorescence signal of the I-FS domain pair was not influenced by calcium (results not shown). Earlier studies performed with the homologous protein BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin showed a distinct binding of this family member to collagen via its EC domain (21Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 347-357Google Scholar, 22Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Göhring W. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1625-1634Google Scholar) and a loss of BM-40 from the extracellular matrix of collagen I-deficient mice (23Iruela-Arispe M.L. Vernon R.O. Wu H. Jaenisch R. Sage H. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 171-183Google Scholar). Because the EC domain, which has in BM-40 been shown to carry the collagen binding site, is conserved in SC1, we decided to test for affinity to collagen I. As collagen I is present in tissues in fibrillar form, we used reconstituted fibrils prepared from highly purified collagen I to which SC1 was added. Electron microscopy showed a marked binding of both recombinant full-length SC1 and the FS-EC domain pair to such collagen I fibrils (Fig. 6), whereas control experiments, performed by omitting SC1 or the antibody to SC1 used for detection, were negative. The fibrils showed the characteristic periodic banding pattern and carried SC1 bound to their surface. To further analyze the relevance of the interaction between SC1 and collagen I we studied the deposition of the two proteins in the matrix produced by cultured human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. An antiserum was raised in rabbit against the FS-EC domain pair, and specific antibodies were affinity-purified by binding to the original antigen coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. The purified antibodies against SC1 showed no cross-reactivity to other members of the BM-40 protein family,i.e. BM-40, testican-1, -2, -3, TSC-36, SMOC-1, either in native or in SDS-denatured form (results not shown). When ascorbate was present in the SaOS-2 cell culture medium, allowing secretion of collagens, a filamentous extracellular network was produced (Fig. 7, A–C). Immunostaining revealed a colocalization of SC1 and collagen I in large portions of this network. In the absence of ascorbate neither collagen I nor SC1 could be detected in the surrounding space, showing that collagen is required for the deposition of SC1 into the extracellular matrix produced in these cultures (Fig. 7, D–E). Under these conditions the intracellular staining for both proteins was increased, which indicates that SC1 is retained in the secretory pathway when collagen secretion is abolished due to the lack of ascorbate. The tissue distribution of SC1 was studied by immunoblot analysis of extracts of adult mouse tissues (Fig.8 A). The strongest signals were found in extracts of brain, cerebellum, and lung, giving a band migrating at about 116 kDa. Weaker signals with the same apparent molecular mass were detected in samples from heart, eye, and muscle. Another prominent band at about 55 kDa was found in brain, cerebellum, heart, eye, muscle, and kidney. In kidney this was the only form of SC1 detected. To further verify that this lower band represents a true SC1 fragment or variant, recombinant full-length SC1 protein and kidney tissue extract were tested in an inhibition experiment. A dilution of the affinity-purified antibodies was preincubated with the recombinant FS-EC domain pa"

To understand the molecular basis of impaired CRALBP function, we have characterized human recombinant CRALBP containing the disease causing mutations R233W or M225K. Protein structures were verified by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry, retinoid binding properties were evaluated by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy and substrate carrier functions were assayed for recombinant 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (rRDH5). The M225K mutant was less soluble than the R233W mutant and lacked retinoid binding capability and substrate carrier function. In contrast, the R233W mutant exhibited solubility comparable to wild type rCRALBP and bound stoichiometric amounts of 11-cis- and 9-cis-retinal with at least 2-fold higher affinity than wild type rCRALBP. Holo-R233W significantly decreased the apparent affinity of rRDH5 for 11-cis-retinoid relative to wild type rCRALBP. Analyses by heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR demonstrated that the R233W protein exhibits a different conformation than wild type rCRALBP, including a different retinoid-binding pocket conformation. The R233W mutant also undergoes less extensive structural changes upon photoisomerization of bound ligand, suggesting a more constrained structure than that of the wild type protein. Overall, the results show that the M225K mutation abolishes and the R233W mutation tightens retinoid binding and both impair CRALBP function in the visual cycle as an 11-cis-retinol acceptor and as a substrate carrier.

These diseased phenotypes are all characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and night blindness (delayed dark adaptation) but differ in age of onset, rate of progression, and severity. The molecular basis for the clinical differences in these related retinal dystrophies is not well understood and no effective therapies exist for the pathology resulting from impaired CRALBP function. CRALBP is an abundant, 36-kDa protein in the cytosol of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells of the retina where it carries endogenous 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinal (7Saari J.C. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). The CRALBP ligand binding cavity is mapped in the accompanying report (8Wu Z. Yang Y.

Garwin G.G. Huang J. Crabb J.W. Neuron. 2001; 29: 739-748Google Scholar) show that CRALBP serves as a major 11-cis-retinol acceptor in the isomerization step of the visual cycle (7Saari J.C.

However, CRALBP appears to function within an RPE protein complex (12Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar) and to serve multiple functions. In vitro, CRALBP facilitates the oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (12Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C.

Recombinant CRALBP (rCRALBP) containing the R150Q mutation lacks the ability to bind 11-cis-retinal and exhibits low solubility (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J.

Toward a better understanding of the molecular basis of retinal pathology associated with RLBP1gene defects, we report here characterization of rCRALBP containing the M225K or R233W disease-causing mutations (Fig.1). 11-cis-Retinal was obtained from the NEI, National Institutes of Health, and 9-cis-retinal was purchased from Sigma. Tritiated 11-cis-retinol was produced by reduction of 11-cis-retinal with NaB[3H]4 (15Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Google Scholar). Mutant rCRALBP cDNA carrying either the R233W or M225K substitutions were created using The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Briefly, WT human CRALBP cDNA in the pET19b vector (16Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D.

The following complimentary oligonucleotides were used to substitute a Lys for a Met at residue 225 (underlined) in mutant M225K: sense, 5′-GAAGATGGTGGACAAGCTCCAGGATTCCTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AAGGAATCCTGGAGCTTGTCCACCATCTTC-3′. To substitute a Trp for an Arg at residue 233 (underlined) in the R233W mutant, complimentary oligonucleotides were also used: sense, 5′-ATTCCTTCCCAGCCTGGTTCAAAGCCATCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGATGGCTTTGAACCAGGCTGGGAAGGAAT-3′. Each mutagenesis mix was transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene), mutant clones identified by restriction mapping with NspI for M225K and MspI for R233W, were amplified, cleaved with XbaI and HindIII, and ligated back into expression vector pET19b (Novagen). Each insert was sequenced in both directions using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and the model 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems). WT and rCRALBP mutants M225K and R233W were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysS with a N-terminal His tag and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) (16Crabb J.W.

WT and mutant rCRALBPs were produced in bacteria and SDS-PAGE of the crude soluble bacterial lysates and re-suspended pellet fractions showed that the M225K mutant was less soluble than the R233W rCRALBP mutant (Fig. 2). The R233W mutant was present in the soluble lysate fraction in amounts comparable to that of the WT protein (Fig. 2). The purified mutant proteins were characterized by amino acid analysis (Table I) and by LC ESMS and the determined compositions and intact masses found to be in excellent agreement with the sequence calculated values (M225K, Mobs = 39,110 ± 3, Mcalc = 39,107; R233W,Mobs = 39,145 ± 4,Mcalc = 39,140).

Cys and Trp were not determined. UV-visible spectral analysis of purified mutant R233W and WT rCRALBP with bound 11-cis-retinal were essentially identical, however, with bound 9-cis-retinal the ligand absorbance is slightly red-shifted for the R233W mutant (Fig.3). Upon exposure to bleaching illumination, the chromophore absorbance for both holo-proteins shifts to ∼380 nm due to the formation of unbound all-trans-retinal. In contrast, UV-visible spectra of purified mutant M225K exhibit no evidence for binding of either 11-cis or 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 3). Retinoid labeling performed in bacterial lysates prior to protein purification yielded the same UV-visible spectral results (data not shown). Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for mutant R233W rCRALBP complexed with 11-cis- or 9-cis-retinal were determined by fluorescence titration of the apo-protein, monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon ligand binding (Table II). The determinedKd values reveal significantly greater affinity of the R233W mutant for both 11-cis-retinal (Kd ∼ 10 nm) and 9-cis-retinal (Kd ∼ 24 nm) relative to WT rCRALBP (Kd ∼ 21 nm for 11-cis-retinal and ∼53 nm for 9-cis-retinal). The average number of binding sites extracted from the mutant R233W titration data was about 0.6 for either retinoid.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants of rCRALBP with retinoidsrCRALBP preparationApparent Kd11-cis-Retinal9-cis-RetinalnmWild type21.0 ± 3.2 (n = 8)53.3 ± 9.6 (n = 7)R233W10.3 ± 2.0 (n = 3)24.3 ± 5.7 (n = 3)Mean Kd values ± S.E. are shown forn titrations.

When rRDH5 was assayed in the presence of the M225K rCRALBP mutant plus free retinoid, about 3-fold greaterKm values were obtained relative to WT rCRALBP for both oxidation and reduction (Table III). When rRDH5 was assayed using R233W-bound retinoid as substrate, determined Km values were 4- to 7-fold higher than WT rCRALBP (Table III). Relative to the free retinoid controls, neither mutation appeared to significantly effect Vmax(Table III). In vivo CRALBP is thought to facilitate the RDH5-catalyzed oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal (13Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Google Scholar) and in vitro theVmax for WT rCRALBP was ∼207 greater in the oxidation reaction relative to free 11-cis-retinol and ∼10–167 greater than the mutants. No significant difference inVmax was observed using WT rCRALBP or free 11-cis-retinal in the reduction reaction. The results support impaired substrate carrier function in the RDH5 oxidation reaction for the M225K and R233W rCRALBP mutants.Table IIIKinetic parameters of mutant CRALBP substrate carrier function11-cis-Retinol dehydrogenase reaction conditionsKmVmaxॖmnmol/min/mgReduction of 11-cis-retinal to 11-cis-retinol Mutant R233W (n = 6)12.5 ± 0.5475 ± 28 Mutant M225K (n = 6)5.8 ± 0.6367 ± 68 WT CRALBP (n = 6)1.7 ± 0.3411 ± 44 Free 11-cis-retinal (n = 4)6.0 ± 0.2440 ± 40Oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal Mutant R233W (n = 4)10.8 ± 0.5129 ± 09 Mutant M225K (n = 4)6.8 ± 1123 ± 15 WT CRALBP (n = 4)2.5 ± 0.3143 ± 10 Free 11-cis-retinol (n = 4)7.5 ± 0.3117 ± 3Enzymatic reduction and oxidation reactions were measured with purified recombinant 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5) in the presence or absence of the purified mutant and wild type rCRALBP as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Mean values ± S.D. are shown for n independent determinations.

The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra for 15N uniformly labeled holo-R233W rCRALBP and WT holo-rCRALBP were recorded in the dark and overlaid for comparison (Fig.4). Resonances for Trp-165, Trp-244, Met-208, Met-222, and Met-225 in HSQC NMR spectra of WT rCRALBP were assigned in the accompanying report (8Wu Z. Yang Y. Shaw N. Bhattacharya S. Yan L. West K. Roth K. Noy N. Qin J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12390-12396Google Scholar). Tentative assignments have also been made for the other four Met in WT rCRALBP (8Wu Z. Yang Y. Shaw N. Bhattacharya S. Yan L. West K. Roth K. Noy N. Qin J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12390-12396Google Scholar) and randomly designated Ma, Mb, Mc, and Md (Fig. 4). Mutant R233W has a total of three Trp, and Trp-233 was assigned in Fig. 4 based on the one additional resonance in the downfield chemical shift region characteristic of Trp side-chain NH. Conformational differences in holo-protein structures between WT rCRALBP and mutant R233W are demonstrated (Fig. 4) by the WT (blue) and R233W (red) resonances that do not superimpose, such as Md. Structural differences within the retinoid binding cavity are exemplified by Met-222, an apparent retinoid binding pocket component (8Wu Z. Yang Y. Shaw N. Bhattacharya S. Yan L. West K. Roth K. Noy N. Qin J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12390-12396Google Scholar), which clearly does not align with any other signal in the R233W HSQC spectrum. In separate experiments, HSQC NMR spectra were recorded before and after exposure of 15N uniformly labeled holo-R233W rCRALBP to bleaching illumination. The results (Fig.5A) show that the majority of resonances remain unaffected by ligand isomerization. A few chemical shift changes are apparent in the R233W HSQC spectra upon light-induced retinoid isomerization, but the changes are much less extensive than those observed upon bleaching the WT protein (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra of uniform 15N-labeled mutant R233W and WT rCRALBP before and after bleaching.

Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Google Scholar). Retinitis pigmentosa is a family of inherited diseases with many forms and causative genes and classification of the disease types continue to evolve (29Phelan J.K. Bok D. Mol. Vis. 2000; 6 (http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a16): 116-124Google Scholar). Since 1997, five other recessive defects in theRLBP1 gene have been found to cause retinal dystrophies, including the two missense mutations M225K and R233W associated with retinitis punctata albescens and Bothnia dystrophy (2Burstedt M.S.I.

Pathological mutations in the CRALBP gene have now been associated with other phenotypes and detected in pedigrees from Europe, the Middle East, Newfoundland, and India (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B.

Human Genet. 2002; 70: 955-964Google Scholar). RLBP1 gene defects are thought to be a rare cause of retinal disease (4Morimura H. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1000-1004Google Scholar); however, in northern Sweden the high prevalence of Bothnia dystrophy caused by the R233W mutation constitutes a significant medical problem for which therapies are sought (2Burstedt M.S.I. Sandreg O. Holmgren G. Forsman-Semb K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 995-1000Google Scholar, 3Burstedt M.S.I. Sandreg O. Forsman-Semb K. Golovleva I. Janunger T. Wachtmeister L. Sandgren O. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 260-267Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular basis of retinal pathology associated with impaired CRALBP and possibilities for therapeutic intervention, we have pursued structure-function studies of the mutant rCRALBPs containing the disease causing substitutions M225K and R233W. The primary structural integrity of the purified M225K and R233W mutant recombinant proteins was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. In contrast to the largely insoluble R150Q rCRALBP associated with arRP (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Google Scholar), the R233W mutant exhibits solubility comparable to that of WT rCRALBP, whereas the M225K mutant is less soluble than WT rCRALBP but significantly more soluble than the R150Q mutant. With regard to retinoid binding properties, UV-visible spectral analysis revealed that the M225K mutant resembled the R150Q mutant and completely lacked the ability to bind cis-retinoids (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant R233W bound stoichiometric amounts of 11-cis- or 9-cis-retinal based on absorbance spectral ratios (19Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y. Hulmes J.D. West K.A. Kapron J.T. Ruuska S.E. Noy N. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20712-20720Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations yielded apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for the R233W mutant that demonstrated nanomolar affinities for 9-cis- and 11-cis-retinal that were about 2-fold tighter than determined for WT rCRALBP. The variability of the retinoid affinity data (relative standard error of the mean was ∼15–237) was within the limits of experimental error of the titration methodology and due, in part, to the low aqueous solubility of retinoids and variable apo-protein stability. Furthermore, the protein concentration (0.5 ॖm) used in the fluorescence titrations was significantly higher than the apparentKd values, and, under these conditions,Kd values should be considered to be upper limits for the actual values (30Noy N. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 139. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 3-29Google Scholar). The difference between the binding affinities of WT rCRALBP and its R233W mutant may therefore be larger than observed here. Studies with crude extracts from bovine RPE microsomes (13Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Google Scholar), and purified proteins (12Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar) strongly support a substrate carrier interaction between CRALBP and RDH5. The kinetic analyses performed here with purified recombinant proteins demonstrate that rCRALBP harboring either the M225K or the R233W mutations decrease the apparent affinity of rRDH5 for 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinal relative to the WT protein. The Km of rRDH5 for 11-cis-retinoid in the presence of the M225K mutant approximated that for the enzyme reaction with free retinoid (12Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar). An even higher Km was obtained for rRDH5 using the holo-R233W mutant as substrate, reflecting lower affinity between enzyme and retinoid due to the tighter binding of retinoid by R233W. The R233W mutant likely hinders movement of the hydrophobic substrate to the active site of enzyme. These data are consistent with the notion that CRALBP affects the activity of RDH5 by 舠channeling舡 of retinoids to the enzyme, much like cellular retinoic acid binding protein II facilitates delivery of retinoic acid to the retinoic acid receptor (31Dong D. Ruuska S. Levinthal D.J. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23695-23698Google Scholar, 32Budhu A.S. Gillilan R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 939-949Google Scholar). Clues to the structural basis for the tighter retinoid binding properties of the R233W mutant were obtained by two-dimensional NMR. HSQC NMR spectra showed that the three-dimensional structure of the R233W mutant with bound ligand was significantly different than that of WT holo-rCRALBP, including different retinoid-binding cavity conformations. Furthermore, conformational changes observed by NMR after photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal in the ligand binding pocket were much more pronounced for the WT protein (8Wu Z. Yang Y. Shaw N. Bhattacharya S. Yan L. West K. Roth K. Noy N. Qin J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12390-12396Google Scholar) than for the R233W mutant (Fig. 5). Residues Arg-233 and Met-225 are conserved within human, bovine, and mouse CRALBP (Fig. 1), and the present results are consistent with ligand interactions with both residues. Replacing positively charged Arg-233 with apolar tryptophan likely strengthens nonionic interactions within the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket, resulting in a more constrained, less flexible R233W protein structure. Likewise, inserting charged lysine in place of apolar Met-225 appears to disrupt critical interactions within the retinoid binding cavity, perhaps by opening the hydrophobic region to greater solvent accessibility, which in turn precludes specific ligand interaction and lowers M225K protein solubility. The function of CRALBP in the visual cycle depends upon the rapid association and dissociation of retinoid from the ligand binding pocket. The results of this study implicate impairment of both retinoid binding and release as causes of the night blindness and retinal pathology reported for human patients with CRALBP mutations. CRALBP serves as the major 11-cis-retinol acceptor in the isomerization reaction of the rod visual cycle, therefore the lack of retinoid binding by M225K rCRALBP significantly slows the enzymatic conversion of all-trans to 11-cis-retinol, as observed for the CRALBP knockout mouse (9Saari J.C. Nawrot M. Kennedy B.N. Hurley J.B. Garwin G.G. Huang J. Crabb J.W. Neuron. 2001; 29: 739-748Google Scholar). Binding of 11-cis-retinol by apoCRALBP, coupled with its oxidation to 11-cis-retinal by RDH5, provides a strong driving force for isomerization (13Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Google Scholar, 33McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Google Scholar). Interactions with other proteins likely facilitate the release of ligand from the CRALBP binding pocket, promoting catalytic rather than stoichiometric retinoid binding (9Saari J.C. Nawrot M. Kennedy B.N. Hurley J.B. Garwin G.G. Huang J. Crabb J.W. Neuron. 2001; 29: 739-748Google Scholar,12Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar). The R233W mutation results in tighter rCRALBP retinoid binding and lower rRDH5 affinity for rCRALBP bound retinoid. The overly tight retinoid binding caused by the R233W mutation appears to hinder the rapid release of ligand, resulting in a 舠full house舡 effect that impairs 11-cis-retinol acceptor function and slows the isomerization of all-trans to 11-cis-retinol.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol affects NMDARs are not well understood. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of ethanol, phosphorylation of the NMDAR potentiates channel currents (Lu, W. Y., Xiong, Z. G., Lei, S., Orser, B. A., Dudek, E., Browning, M. D., and MacDonald, J. F. (1999) Nat. Neurosci.2, 331–338). We have previously shown that protein kinase C activators induce tyrosine phosphorylation and potentiation of the NMDAR (Grosshans, D. R., Clayton, D. R., Coultrap, S. J., and Browning, M. D. (2002) Nat. Neurosci. 5, 27–33). We therefore hypothesized that the ethanol inhibition of NMDARs might be due to changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits. In support of this hypothesis, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of both NR2A and NR2B subunits was significantly reduced following in situ exposure of hippocampal slices to 100 mm ethanol. Specifically, phosphorylation of tyrosine 1472 on NR2B was reduced 23.5%. These data suggest a possible mechanism by which ethanol may inhibit the NMDAR via activation of a tyrosine phosphatase. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that ethanol inhibited NMDAR field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and amplitude to a similar degree as previously reported by our laboratory and others (Schummers, J., Bentz, S., and Browning, M.

Inclusion of bpV(phen), a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, in the recording chamber prior to and during ethanol exposure significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDAR field excitatory postsynaptic potentials.

N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptor field excitatory postsynaptic potential long term potentiation artificial cerebrospinal fluid bovine serum albumin amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline 4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine NMDA1 receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate calcium and sodium entry into neurons. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, activation of these receptors is known to be required for induction of long term potentiation (LTP), a cellular process proposed by many as a possible mechanism of memory formation. Aberrant NMDA receptor function can result in cell death and may have implications in pathophysiologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy as well as age-related dementias like Alzheimer's disease (7Greenamyre J.T. O'Brien C.F. Arch. Neurol. 1991; 48: 977-981Google Scholar, 8Greenamyre J.T. Young A.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 593-602Google Scholar, 9Herron C.E. Williamson R. Collingridge G.L. Neurosci.

Sci. 1996; 17: 348-355Google Scholar). NMDA receptors are heteromeric assemblies of NR1 and NR2 subunits. The NR1 family is composed of a single gene, which can be alternatively spliced to generate eight theoretical splice variants (12Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Uhl G.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9359-9363Google Scholar). The NR2 family includes four genes, each encoding a unique subunit: NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D (13Meguro H. Mori H. Araki K. Kushiya E. Kutsuwada T. Yamazaki M. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 357: 70-74Google Scholar). A third gene family, NR3, has been discovered, but the function of these subunits is not well understood. Whereas the NR1 subunit is required for a functional channel, differential incorporation of NR2 subunits regulates receptor function. The NR2 subunits, particularly NR2A and NR2B, have been shown to influence the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to ethanol block in cultured neurons as wells as transfected HEK293 cells and oocytes (14Popp R.L. Lickteig R. Browning M.D. Lovinger D.M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 45-56Google Scholar, 15Chu B. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 140-148Google Scholar, 16Mirshahi T.

More recent studies have indicated that NR1 subunits may also play a key role in mediating the effects of ethanol on channel activity (18Kumari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29764-29771Google Scholar, 19Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Google Scholar, 20Maldve R.E. Zhang T.A. Ferrani-Kile K. Schreiber S.S. Lippmann M.J. Snyder G.L. Fienberg A.A. Leslie S.W. Gonzales R.A. Morrisett R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 641-648Google Scholar). Ethanol is known to have widespread effects on the central nervous system. Ethanol inhibits transmission at the NMDAR subtype of glutamatergic excitatory synapses and enhances inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission. In addition, we and others have demonstrated that ethanol blocks LTP in the hippocampus (6Schummers J. Bentz S. Browning M.D. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 404-408Google Scholar, 21Blitzer R.D. Gil O. Landau E.M. Brain Res. 1990; 537: 203-208Google Scholar, 22Morrisett R.A. Swartzwelder H.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2264-2272Google Scholar, 23Sinclair J.G. Lo G.F. Gen. Pharmacol. 1986; 17: 231-233Google Scholar). Given that NMDA receptors are both required for induction of LTP and inhibited by ethanol, it is likely that inhibition of LTP by ethanol in the hippocampus is due, at least in part, to inhibition of NMDA receptors. The molecular mechanisms of this inhibition however, remain unknown. One hypothesis that we favor is that ethanol may inhibit the NMDAR by reducing its phosphorylation. Indeed, ethanol has been shown to enhance protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity and also inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase activity (24Seiler A.E. Henderson A. Rubin R. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 24: 1869-1872Google Scholar, 25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies suggest that Fyn, a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, may be a key player in regulating the sensitivity of NMDARs to ethanol in the hippocampus (26Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Google Scholar, 27Kalluri H.S. Ticku M.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 68: 159-168Google Scholar, 28Anders D.L. Blevins T. Sutton G. Swope S. Chandler L.J. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1389-1393Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that Src kinase regulates NMDAR channel gating by increasing mean channel open time and open probability (29Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Google Scholar). Complementary studies demonstrated that Src activation of NMDARs is tonically opposed by striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase (30Pelkey K.A. Askalan R. Paul S. Kalia L.V. Nguyen T.H. Pitcher G.M. Salter M.W. Lombroso P.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 127-138Google Scholar). The striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase family of tyrosine phosphatases was originally characterized in the striatum, but subsequent studies demonstrated that striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatases are expressed throughout the brain including the hippocampus (31Boulanger L.M. Lombroso P.J. Raghunathan A. During M.J. Wahle P. Naegele J.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1532-1544Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings led us to hypothesize that ethanol may inhibit the NMDA receptor by reducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits. Utilizing the rat hippocampal slice preparation, electrophysiology, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting, we examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in mediating the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDA receptors in area CA1 of the hippocampus. Our results indicate that reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits correlates with ethanol inhibition of NMDAR fEPSPs. Furthermore, pretreatment with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor significantly reduces ethanol inhibition of NMDAR activity. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NR2A and NR2B subunits and to phospho-Tyr-1472 of NR2B have been characterized previously (32Snell L.D. Nunley K.R. Lickteig R.L. Browning M.D. Tabakoff B. Hoffman P.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 71-78Google Scholar, 33Grosshans D.R. Browning M.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 737-744Google Scholar, 34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad. Hippocampal CA1 minislices were prepared with a slight modification of a previously described procedure (5Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.R. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Google Scholar, 35Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.A. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/oc-sigtrans; 2002/137/pI8)Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6–9 weeks) were used for all experiments. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. After sacrifice, the brain was quickly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF: 124 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 1 mm KH2PO4, 25.7 mmNaHCO3). Both hippocampi were dissected out and unrolled along the hippocampal fissure. Two cuts were then made to isolate area CA1 of each hippocampus before preparing 400-μm slices on a McIlwain tissue chopper. Slices were then incubated at interface in an aCSF-filled chamber humidified with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 32 °C. Because sacrifice can alter the basal state of the tissue, such as the polarization of neurons and the phosphorylation state of proteins, the slices were allowed to recover under these conditions for 90 min, with fresh aCSF being added every 20–30 min. aCSF was then drained from the incubation chamber, and aCSF containing drug or aCSF alone was added. Slices were harvested at the times indicated; sonicated in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS; and frozen until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Immunoprecipitations were performed using Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) as previously described (33Grosshans D.R. Browning M.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 737-744Google Scholar, 36Nayak A. Zastrow D.J. Lickteig R. Zahniser N.R. Browning M.D. Nature. 1998; 394: 680-683Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation under these conditions was previously shown to isolate 90 ± 1% of NR2A and 93 ± 1% NR2B subunits as determined by Western blotting of pellets and final supernatants (33Grosshans D.R. Browning M.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 737-744Google Scholar). Previous studies also demonstrated that the antibodies to NR2A and NR2B do not cross-react in immunoprecipitation or Western blotting experiments (32Snell L.D. Nunley K.R. Lickteig R.L. Browning M.D. Tabakoff B. Hoffman P.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 71-78Google Scholar, 33Grosshans D.R. Browning M.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 737-744Google Scholar). Control experiments were conducted in which the fusion protein used to generate the NR2A and NR2B antibodies was absorbed with the respective antibody for 1 h prior to immunoprecipitation. Preabsorbtion of the antibody with its respective fusion protein completely blocked the immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Samples from immunoprecipitation experiments and CA1 homogenates were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% gels. Separated proteins were transferred to PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were blocked in 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated overnight with general anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:5000) or the site-specific anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 (1:500) in 1% BSA at 4 °C. Alternatively, blots were blocked in 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then subjected to three 10-min washes in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) before incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (general anti-phosphotyrosine) or goat anti-rabbit (site-specific anti-phospho-Tyr-1472) secondary antibody (1:10,000) in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, three additional 10-min TBST washes were performed, and immunodetection was accomplished using the Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit and the Alpha Innotech imaging system. Each blot was stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-NR2A (1:1000) or anti-NR2B (1:3000). Quantitation was performed using AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotech) and Excel (Microsoft). Standard curves were included on each Western blot, and analyzed bands were always within the linear range of detection for each antibody. Where indicated, statistical analysis was evaluated by Student's paired t test. Slices were prepared as described above, except the hippocampus remained intact such that “whole” hippocampal slices were generated. The slices were placed in a perfusion chamber containing aCSF flowing at >3 ml/min. After a >90-min recovery, fEPSPs were recorded in area CA1. fEPSPs in CA1 were elicited by stimulation of Schaeffer collateral-commissural fibers with a bipolar nichrome-stimulating electrode. Extracellular recordings were obtained with a silver electrode contained within a drawn glass capillary containing aCSF, placed in the dendritic layer. NMDAR responses were isolated by simultaneous application of 2 μm NBQX and 50 μm picrotoxin for at least 60 min. Electrophysiological data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference testpost hoc tests to determine the pvalue of each measurement. The effect of 100 mm ethanol on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in hippocampal CA1 minislices was examined. We chose this particular concentration of ethanol as well as the exposure time of 10 min based on previous experiments in CA1 minislices, which demonstrated that 100 mm ethanol inhibited NMDAR fEPSP slope by ∼23% and nearly completely (>95%) blocked LTP (6Schummers J. Bentz S. Browning M.D. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 404-408Google Scholar). To facilitate direct examination of the effect of ethanol on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B, these subunits were first immunoprecipitated from hippocampal homogenates. The immunoprecipitates were then probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) to assess the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2A (Fig.1 a) and NR2B (Fig.1 b) proteins. The experimental design employed was identical to that used to measure the effects of ethanol on NMDAR function presented in Fig. 5. Pretreatment with the AMPAR and GABAAreceptor antagonists NBQX and picrotoxin, respectively, had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2 subunits. Subsequent ethanol treatment resulted in a significant reduction of phosphotyrosine on both NR2A (37.4%) and NR2B (36.4%) subunits (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1, c and d). Treatment with ethanol alone in the absence of NBQX and picrotoxin resulted in a similar reduction of phosphotyrosine on both NR2A and NR2B (data not shown). In order to confirm that these results were not due to changes in the levels of the NR2A or NR2B protein, each Western blot was stripped and reprobed with the respective antibody (Fig. 1, a andb). No significant difference in NR2A or NR2B levels were observed in control versus ethanol-treated samples (Fig. 1,c and d).Figure 5Tyrosine phosphatase inhibition significantly reduces ethanol inhibition of the NMDA receptor. a, pharmacological isolation of NMDAR fEPSPs. AMPAR and GABAAreceptor responses were blocked by application of NBQX and picrotoxin, respectively. The resulting NMDAR fEPSP was amplified by increasing the stimulus intensity 100–300%. Perfusion of the NMDAR antagonistdl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid verified that the isolated responses were indeed NMDAR-mediated. b, data for a series of recordings where 100 mm ethanol was applied for 30 min. Each point represents the mean amplitude ± S.E. of five fEPSPs measured every 30 s. Open circles, control data (n = 8 slices). Closed circles, experiments where 10 μm bpV(phen) was included in the perfusion solution for 25 min before and during ethanol treatment (n = 11 slices). c, bar graph showing the average percentage inhibition (mean ± S.E.) of NMDAR fEPSP slope and amplitude by 100 mm ethanol aloneversus 100 mm ethanol following pretreatment with 10 μm bpV(phen) for 25 min. Percentage inhibition was calculated based on averages of 21 consecutive sweeps taken from the base-line period before ethanol application as compared with 21 consecutive sweeps taken from 5 to 15 min after ethanol was applied. Ethanol alone significantly inhibited NMDAR fEPSP slope (19.5 ± 3.2%, n = 8 slices, p < 0.01) and amplitude (44.0 ± 8.4%, n = 8 slices,p < 0.01). Pretreatment with bpV(phen) almost completely blocked the effect of ethanol on NMDAR fEPSP slope (5.7 ± 3.0% inhibition, n = 11 slices) and significantly reduced the effect of ethanol on NMDAR fEPSP amplitude (21.7 ± 4.6%, n = 11 slices). *, p < 0.01. There was no significant effect of bpV(phen) alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been suggested that Fyn tyrosine kinase may be important for determining an animal's sensitivity to ethanol and that this effect may be due to direct phosphorylation of the NMDAR by Fyn (26Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Google Scholar). There are several tyrosine residues in the NR2B subunit that are phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar). It has been shown that phosphorylation of one of these tyrosines, residue 1472, is increased following induction of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar). Using a previously characterized antibody to Tyr-1472 (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar), we next attempted to establish whether this particular tyrosine was also subject to reduced phosphorylation following ethanol treatment. The amino acids surrounding Tyr-1472 of NR2B share greater than 50% identity with the homologous region of the NR2A subunit. Of the remaining residues, several are conservative substitutions between the two subunits. Like NR2B, NR2A is a substrate of Fyn kinase (37Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 582-588Google Scholar). Therefore, we first confirmed the specificity of the Tyr-1472 antibody for NR2B in our immunoprecipitates. Western blots of our NR2A and NR2B immunoprecipitates demonstrated that only immunoprecipitates of NR2B reacted with the Tyr(P)-1472 antibody (data not shown). Following treatment with 100 mm ethanol for 10 min, the level of Tyr(P)-1472 in the NR2B immunoprecipitates was evaluated by Western blotting with the site-specific anti-Tyr(P) antibody. A representative Western blot (Fig.2 a) shows that ethanol treatment resulted in a significant reduction of Tyr(P)-1472 (23.5%, p < 0.01; see Fig. 2 b). No difference in the total amount of NR2B reactivity was seen between treatments (Fig. 2 a). We next used PP2, a selective inhibitor of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, as a positive control to assess the relative magnitude of the dephosphorylation effect. When slices were exposed to 10 μm PP2 for 10 min, tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits was reduced ∼35% as compared with control slices (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3,a and b). After exposure to PP2 for 30 min, an even more robust effect was observed (∼60% reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation). The concentration of ethanol used in these studies was chosen based on previous studies in our laboratory, which demonstrated that 100 mm ethanol reduces NMDAR fEPSP slope and completely blocks LTP in CA1 minislices (6Schummers J. Bentz S. Browning M.D. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 404-408Google Scholar). Because this concentration of ethanol is usually associated with severe intoxication, we examined the effect of lower doses of ethanol on tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits. The effects of 10 min exposure to 25, 50, 75, or 100 mm ethanol on tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits are summarized in Fig. 4. When tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A subunits was measured, only 75 mm ethanol produced a significant effect similar in magnitude to 100 mm ethanol (Fig. 4 a). Cumulative data demonstrate that 50 and 75 mm ethanol significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits (Fig.4 b). Overall, 100 mm ethanol produced the most robust effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits. If ethanol affects on NMDAR function are indeed due to enhanced dephosphorylation of the receptor, we should be able to reduce ethanol's effect by blocking tyrosine phosphatase activity. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of ethanol on NMDAR activity in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bpV(phen). Pharmacologically isolated NMDAR fEPSPs were recorded in area CA1 of hippocampal slices (Fig. 5 a). Application of 100 μm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid confirmed that observed responses were NMDAR-mediated. The slope and amplitude of the NMDAR fEPSPs was measured during a 30-min exposure to 100 mm ethanol. The graph of NMDAR fEPSP amplitude as a function of time shown in Fig. 5 b demonstrates that ethanol inhibition reaches a maximum after 10 min of ethanol exposure. Pretreatment with bpV(phen) significantly reduced the effect of ethanol on NMDAR function. Cumulative data shown in Fig. 5 cdemonstrates that the percentage inhibition of NMDAR fEPSP slope and amplitude by ethanol alone was consistent with previous reports. Perfusion of 10 μm bpV(phen), a selective phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, for 25 min before and during ethanol exposure significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDAR function (Fig. 5 c). Specifically, bpV(phen) almost completely blocked the effect of ethanol on NMDAR fEPSP slope (5.7 ± 3.0% inhibition, p < 0.01). However, bpV(phen) reduced the effect of ethanol on NMDAR fEPSP amplitude by only 50%. These latter results may indicate that additional mechanisms may contribute to the full effect of ethanol on NMDAR function. There was no significant effect of bpV(phen) alone on NMDAR function. Taken together, these data suggest that reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly as a result of ethanol-stimulated tyrosine phosphatase activity (25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Google Scholar), may account, at least in part, for the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the NMDA receptor in area CA1 of the hippocampus. A number of previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol inhibit NMDAR function in the hippocampus (6Schummers J. Bentz S. Browning M.D. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 404-408Google Scholar, 22Morrisett R.A. Swartzwelder H.S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2264-2272Google Scholar, 38Lovinger D.M. White G. Weight F.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1721-1724Google Scholar). Conversely, tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR has been shown by a number of laboratories to produce potentiation of receptor function (39Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 445-452Google Scholar, 40Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Google Scholar). We and others have hypothesized, therefore, that ethanol may inhibit NMDARs by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR. However, there has been no direct evidence that ethanol can produce such an effect. We tested the effect of several doses of ethanol on tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits in area CA1 of rat hippocampus. We demonstrated that ethanol doses as low as 75 mm produce a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of both NR2A and NR2B. Given that tyrosine phosphorylation enhances NMDAR function, this reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B may be responsible, at least in part, for the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDA receptor function in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus. A previous study suggested that ethanol exposure in vivoresults in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits assayedin vitro (26Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Google Scholar). One possible interpretation of these results is that ethanol enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR. Given that ethanol inhibits NMDAR function, such an interpretation conflicts with data from a number of laboratories showing that phosphorylation enhances NMDAR function. A possible explanation of these results may be that ethanol treatment was delivered in vivo and phosphorylation was assayed in vitro after sacrifice of the animals. Sacrifice is known to produce extremely rapid and profound alterations in phosphorylation state. It is possible that the effects of sacrifice may have obscured the effects of ethanol on tyrosine phosphorylation. To minimize sacrifice effects, the data presented in this paper were generated using an in situhippocampal slice preparation. We assayed the effects of ethanol on the NMDAR in hippocampal slices that had recovered from the sacrifice. Following treatment, the slices were immediately sonicated in SDS to rapidly halt phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes. Using such an assay, our data clearly show that ethanol reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR. An additional issue of significant import is which tyrosine residue(s) on the NMDA receptor subunits is/are responsible for the observed change in phosphorylation. There are many tyrosine residues on the NR2 subunits that could be subject to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Moreover, both NR2A and NR2B subunits are known to be substrates of Fyn kinase (37Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 582-588Google Scholar, 41Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Google Scholar). Several of the C-terminal tyrosines on the NR2B subunit, including residue 1472, are phosphorylated by Fyn (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of residue 1472 is increased following induction of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus (34Nakazawa T. Komai S. Tezuka T. Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Semba K. Mishina M. Manabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Google Scholar). We used a site-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to assay for changes in phosphorylation of this residue after ethanol treatment. Our results show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 1472 on NR2B is reduced following treatment with 100 mm ethanol. Thus, ethanol may be exerting its effects on the NMDAR and LTP by reducing Fyn phosphorylation of the receptor. In support of this finding, basal tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits was reduced in fyn mutant mice (41Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Google Scholar), and inhibition of recombinant NMDA receptors by 100 mm ethanol was reduced under conditions of enhanced Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (28Anders D.L. Blevins T. Sutton G. Swope S. Chandler L.J. Woodward J.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1389-1393Google Scholar). Last, LTP is inhibited in mice lacking the gene for Fyn (42Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Google Scholar), and Fyn-deficient mice are more sensitive to ethanol than wild type animals (26Miyakawa T. Yagi T. Kitazawa H. Yasuda M. Kawai N. Tsuboi K. Niki H. Science. 1997; 278: 698-701Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies and the work we have presented here suggest that Fyn kinase may be a key player in the inhibition of LTP by ethanol as well as in regulating the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to ethanol in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the ethanol-mediated reduction in phosphorylation of tyrosine 1472 is nearly as great in magnitude as the reduction of total phosphotyrosine on NR2B. Due to differences in antibody affinity and other technical constraints, we cannot draw any conclusions as to whether the effect on residue 1472 can account for the entire effect seen on total tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B. Site-directed mutagenesis studies would be a potential method of addressing this issue. There may be multiple mechanisms that mediate ethanol effects on the NMDARs. Certainly, one mechanism occurs very rapidly (10–100 ms), since single channel studies of NMDARs indicated that ethanol is an allosteric modulator of channel gating (43Wright J.M. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 249-256Google Scholar). It has been argued by some that such an effect is too rapid to be mediated by phosphorylation effects. However, the turnover numbers for kinases and phosphatases clearly show that these enzymes can mediate events in the low millisecond time scale. Moreover, there is clear precedent for phosphorylation regulation of NMDAR channel gating (29Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Google Scholar, 30Pelkey K.A. Askalan R. Paul S. Kalia L.V. Nguyen T.H. Pitcher G.M. Salter M.W. Lombroso P.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 127-138Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it is simply not possible for us to examine biochemical changes due to alcohol in the millisecond time scale. Studies of C-terminally truncated NR2A and NR2B subunits in human embryonic kidney 293 cells demonstrated that a site of action of ethanol is probably at a locus exposed to the extracellular environment (44Peoples R.W. Stewart R.R. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1681-1691Google Scholar, 45Gordey M. Mekmanee L. Mody I. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 987-997Google Scholar). However, these studies also demonstrated that the C termini of NR2 subunits are important for regulating the ethanol sensitivity of NMDARs. In addition to the direct action of ethanol on NMDARs, it is likely that NMDAR response to ethanol is regulated by indirect mechanisms. Because ethanol can rapidly diffuse across the cell membrane, kinases and phosphatases are likely intracellular targets of ethanol. Indeed, ethanol has been shown to accelerate the kinetics of protein dephosphorylation by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (25Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11797-11804Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, our results demonstrate that pretreatment with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor occludes ethanol inhibition of NMDAR activity. These data indicate that ethanol may be exerting its effect on the NMDAR by enhancing the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. This model has been supported by recent data showing that activation of an endogenous protein phosphatase inhibitor, DARPP-32, regulates the ethanol sensitivity of NMDARs in the nucleus accumbens and may promote ethanol reinforcement (20Maldve R.E. Zhang T.A. Ferrani-Kile K. Schreiber S.S. Lippmann M.J. Snyder G.L. Fienberg A.A. Leslie S.W. Gonzales R.A. Morrisett R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 641-648Google Scholar). Thus, dopamine was shown to activate this phosphatase and thereby reduce the effect of ethanol on the NMDAR. In addition, dopamine failed to reduce ethanol effects on the NMDAR in DARPP-32 knockout mice. Although DARPP-32 expression appears to be largely absent in the hippocampus (46Barbas H. Gustafson E.L. Greengard P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 334: 1-18Google Scholar, 47Perez R.G. Lewis R.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 318: 304-315Google Scholar), these data provide support for the very provocative hypothesis that it may be possible to diminish the effects of ethanol on NMDARs by activating endogenous phosphatase inhibitors. It is important to note that DARPP-32 is a serine phosphatase inhibitor and that the focus of the aforementioned report was on serine phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR. We are also very interested in the mechanism by which reduced phosphorylation, possibly of tyrosine 1472, might be transduced into reduced NMDAR responses. Potential mechanisms downstream of a change in phosphorylation include modulation of channel properties, regulation of protein-protein interactions, and altered receptor localization. Recent studies of glutamate receptors and LTP have focused on the idea of dynamic regulation of surface expression as a mechanism of plasticity (48Malinow R. Mainen Z.F. Hayashi Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 352-357Google Scholar, 49Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Google Scholar). For example, it is believed that AMPARs move rapidly between the cell's surface and interior (50Passafaro M. Piech V. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 917-926Google Scholar, 51Luscher C. Xia H.

Zaman S.H. Wenthold R.J. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Google Scholar) very early in development (5Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.R. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Google Scholar,56Pickard L. Noel J. Henley J.M. Collingridge G.L. Molnar E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7922-7931Google Scholar, 57Petralia R.S. Esteban J.A. Wang Y.X. Partridge J.G. Zhao H.M. Wenthold R.J. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 31-36Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that surface expression of NMDA receptors is a dynamic process regulated by phosphorylation events (58Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune L.C. Ehlers M.D. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 794-802Google Scholar,59Dunah A.W. Standaert D.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5546-5558Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that LTP stimulation promotes membrane insertion of the NMDAR and that this effect is blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibition (5Grosshans D.R. Clayton D.R. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 27-33Google Scholar). Thus, reduced tyrosine phosphorylation may be a signal for endocytosis of NMDARs. Consistent with this hypothesis, tyrosine 1472 on NR2B is part of a consensus motif (YppØ) for AP-2 binding, a protein that mediates endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (60Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2002; 109: 413-416Google Scholar). Studies in immune cells have demonstrated that T cell receptors preferentially interact with AP-2 when a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is nonphosphorylated (1Shiratori T. Miyatake S. Ohno H. Nakaseko C. Isono K. Bonifacino J.S. Saito T. Immunity. 1997; 6: 583-589Google Scholar, 61Bradshaw J.D. Lu P. Leytze G. Rodgers J. Schieven G.L. Bennett K.L. Linsley P.S. Kurtz S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15975-15982Google Scholar). Roche et al. (58Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune L.C. Ehlers M.D. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 794-802Google Scholar) have shown that NMDAR internalization in dissociated hippocampal neurons is clathrin-mediated. Thus, it is possible that enhanced endocytosis of the NMDA receptor due to a decrease in phosphorylation of tyrosine 1472 could serve as a mechanism of receptor down-regulation in response to ethanol. The viability of this hypothesis is limited by a number of facts including tethering of NMDAR subunits to the postsynaptic density by scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95. However, it is possible that changes in phosphorylation also modulate NMDAR-PSD protein-protein interactions. For example, it has been reported that binding of the AMPAR-targeting protein stargazing to PSD-95 is negatively regulated by protein kinase A phosphorylation (2Chetkovich D.M. Chen L. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5791-5796Google Scholar, 3Choi J. Ko J. Park E. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Lim S. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12359-12363Google Scholar, 4.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Alternative to the hypothesis of endocytosis, NMDARs may also diffuse between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites in response to ethanol. In summary, we have demonstrated that pharmacologically relevant doses of ethanol significantly reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor. Specifically, we find that tyrosine phosphorylation of residue 1472 on NR2B, a known Fyn kinase site, is specifically reduced with ethanol treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor occludes ethanol inhibition of NMDAR activity. Taken together, these data suggest that reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits, possibly via activation of a tyrosine phosphatase, may underlie the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the NMDA receptor. There are still a number of questions that must be answered including the mechanism by which ethanol reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits, the time course of ethanol-mediated changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits, and how the change in phosphorylation level is transduced into inhibition of receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2044771066,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been shown to functionally inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor and to inhibit p53-responsive gene expression and apoptosis. To better understand the role of MIF in cell growth and tumor biology, we evaluated MIF-null embryonic fibroblasts with respect to their immortalization and transformation properties. Although minor deviations in the growth characteristics of MIF−/−fibroblasts were observed under normal culture conditions, MIF-deficient cells were growth-impaired following the introduction of immortalizing oncogenes. The growth retardation by the immortalized MIF−/− cultures correlated with their reduced susceptibility to Ras-mediated transformation. Our results identify E2F as part of the restraining mechanism that is activated in response to oncogenic signaling and show that the biological consequences of E2F induction in MIF−/− fibroblasts vary depending on the p53 status, inducing predominantly G1 arrest or apoptosis in p53-positive cells. This E2F activity is independent of Rb binding, but contingent on binding DNA. Resistance to oncogenic transformation by MIF−/− cells could be overcome by concomitant interference with p53- and E2F-responsive transcriptional control. Our results demonstrate that MIF plays a role in an E2F/p53 pathway that operates downstream of Rb regulation and implicate MIF as a mediator of normal and malignant cell growth.

Bennet B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Google Scholar, 2David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Google Scholar). Subsequent work defined MIF as a potent cytokine with mitogenic and pro-inflammatory functions (3Metz C.N. Bucala R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 197-223Google Scholar, 4Metz C.N. Bucala R. Oppenheim J. Feldmann M. Cytokine Reference. I. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 703-717Google Scholar). However, efforts aimed toward identifying a cellular receptor for MIF have been unsuccessful to date; thus, the process by which extracellular MIF may exert its effect on target cells is not understood. Early evidence suggesting a role for MIF in cell growth and/or differentiation came from the observations of its expression in developing mouse embryos. The MIF gene is expressed at early embryonic stages prior to implantation (5Suzuki H. Kanagawa H. Nishihira J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 51: 141-147Google Scholar); and at mid-gestation, its expression pattern parallels tissue specification and organogenesis (6Kobayashi S. Satomura K. Levsky J.M. Sreenath T. Wistow G.J.

However, MIF appears to be dispensable for normal development because MIF-null mice reproduce and grow normally (9Bozza M. Satoskar A.R. Lin G. Lu B. Humbles A.A. Gerard C. David J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 341-346Google Scholar, 10Honma N. Koseki H. Akasaka T. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Serizawa I. Akahori H. Osawa M. Mikayama T. Immunology. 2000; 100: 84-90Google Scholar). Among cytokines, MIF is unique in terms of its abundant expression by various cell types (4Metz C.N. Bucala R. Oppenheim J. Feldmann M. Cytokine Reference. I. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 703-717Google Scholar), as well as storage within the cytoplasm (11Bacher M. Meinhardt A. Lan H.Y. Mu W. Metz C.N. Chesney J.A. Calandra T. Gemsa D. Donnelly T. Atkins R.C. Bucala R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 235-246Google Scholar). A recent study (12Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Google Scholar) proposed an intracellular function for MIF in cell cycle regulation via modulation of the transcription factor AP-1. MIF deficiency has also been associated with decreased NF-κB activity (13Roger T. David J. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Google Scholar), whereas Hudsonet al. (14Hudson J.D. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1375-1382Google Scholar) demonstrated that MIF functionally inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor. The p53 gene has become the focus of intense investigation since it became clear that p53 mutations are the most common genetic alteration found in human tumors (15Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Google Scholar). However, in a proportion of tumors in which p53 is functionally inactivated, the gene remains intact, suggesting altered activity of p53-specific regulators (16Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Google Scholar, 17Maestro R. Gloghini A. Doglioni C. Gasparotto D. Vukosavljevic T. De Re V. Laurino L. Carbone A. Boiocchi M. Blood. 1995; 85: 3239-3246Google Scholar). Coincidentally, MIF overexpression has been reported in various tumors (18Meyer-Siegler K. Hudson P.B. Urology. 1996; 48: 448-452Google Scholar, 19Kamimura A. Kamachi M. Nishihira J. Ogura S. Isobe H. Dosaka-Akita H. Ogata A. Shindoh M. Ohbuchi T. Kawakami Y.

Gullans S.R. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 21-33Google Scholar), raising the possibility that MIF overexpression may contribute to tumor proliferation via p53 inhibition. To better understand the role of MIF in cell growth and tumor biology, we analyzed MIF-null embryonic fibroblasts with respect to their immortalization and transformation properties. The data presented here implicate MIF as a mediator of normal and malignant cell growth. MIF-knockout mice were kindly provided by Dr. John R. David (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston). Animals were maintained on a mixed 129Sv × C57Bl/6 background (F1). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from day 14.5 embryos using standard techniques, and passage 4–6 MEFs were used in most experiments. Unless specified, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Fibroblast proliferation was measured by plating equal cell numbers onto six-well dishes in duplicate, followed by direct counting of trypsinized cells using a Coulter counter. Each growth curve represents at least two independent experiments. As an alternative, cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Briefly, 3 × 104 cells were plated per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following 48 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, and radioactive incorporation was determined by β-scintillation counting (Packard Instrument Co.). The data are reported as the average cpm ± S.D. (n = eight wells/condition). Two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. Cell viability was assessed using MEFs that were grown until confluent and either kept in serum-containing DMEM or placed in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. Cells were harvested using enzyme-free dissociation solution (Invitrogen) and analyzed using the TACS™ annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The replication-defective retroviral expression vector REBNA has been described previously (21Petrenko O. Beavis A. Klaine M. Kittappa R. Godin I. Lemischka I.R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 691-700Google Scholar). Retroviral vector REBNA/IRESGFP contains a poliovirus internal ribosomal entry site element followed by green fluorescent protein cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Sergei Zolotukhin, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) placed downstream of the multiple-cloning site in REBNA. Retroviral vector REBNApuro contains a puromycin resistance cassette and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter placed upstream of the multiple-cloning site in REBNA. The following cDNAs were used for retroviral expression: mouse c-myc (a gift from Dr. Michael J. Cole, Princeton University); a dominant-negative human p53H175 mutant (a gift from Dr. Dan Notterman, Princeton University); SV40 large T-antigen (a gift from Dr. Robert Kalejta, Princeton University); E1A12S and E1A mutants E1AΔN and E1AΔCR1, which contain deletions of amino acids 2–36 and 68–85, respectively (a gift from Dr. Scott Lowe, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory); a dominant-negative human E2F1374 mutant (a gift from Dr. Steven F. Dowdy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO); and a human H-ras V12 mutant (a gift from Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi, State University of New York, Stony Brook). Retroviral stocks were produced as previously described (21Petrenko O. Beavis A. Klaine M. Kittappa R. Godin I. Lemischka I.R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 691-700Google Scholar). For viral infections, 105 MEFs plated onto a 6-cm dish were incubated overnight with an appropriate amount of the corresponding retroviral stock. Multiple infections were performed sequentially, with a 12–24-h interval between each infection. When required, infected fibroblasts were selected for 2 days in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Typically, the efficiency of infection of primary MEFs ranged from 60 to 70%, whereas the efficiency of infection of immortalized cells was >95% as determined using retroviral constructs containing the green fluorescent protein marker. Cells were analyzed for the corresponding protein levels 2–4 days post-infection. Soft agar colony formation was examined in 0.25% Noble agar/DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen). For focus formation assays, 3 × 103 virus-infected fibroblasts were mixed with 105 uninfected MEFs and plated onto 6-cm dishes. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic. The growth medium was changed every 3 days. In 12–14 days, transformation efficiency was evaluated by counting individual colonies. All transformation assays were repeated at least three times. Data are shown as the average number ± S.D. of foci/plate using triplicate plates. Representative plates were stained with Giemsa and photographed. Aliquots of whole-cell lysates (50–100 μg of protein) were separated on an 8% SDS-acrylamide gel and blotted onto a Protran BA83 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). They were then incubated with antibodies specific for p16 (M-156), p21 (C-19), p53 (FL-393), p107 (C-18), cyclin A (C-19), cyclin D1 (C-20), cyclin E (M-20), CDC6 (180.2), E2F1 (KH-95), E1A (135-5), B-Myb (N-19), and c-Myc (N-262) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CDK2 (C18520), CDK4 (C18720), and Ras (R02120) (Transduction Laboratories); p19ARF (ab80; Novus Biologicals); MAPK (3A7; Cell Signaling), Rb (554136; Pharmingen); and SV40 T-antigen (Ab-2;Calbiochem) to detect the respective proteins. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences). The ECL protein detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Nuclear cell extracts were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). Trypsinized MEFs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for at least 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FBS, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FBS and 25 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Prior to flow cytometry, 100 μl of propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 0.1% sodium citrate) was added to the cell suspension and incubated for 1 h on ice. The staining was assessed using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software following calibration using DNA QC™ beads (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using ModFit software (BD Biosciences). To examine the role of MIF in cell growth, MEFs were derived from MIF-knockout and wild-type mice and assayed in several experimental settings. Under normal growth conditions, MIF−/−fibroblasts proliferated slightly more slowly than wild-type MEFs and became contact-inhibited at cell densities that were 20–25% lower than those of the wild-type controls (Fig.1 A). Immunoblot analysis showed that these differences were not associated with alterations in the expression levels of p53 (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, following infection of the cells with retroviruses encoding viral or cellular oncogenes, such as SV40 large T-antigen (LT), adenoviral E1A, and c-myc, the induction of p53 in both wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts was similar (Fig. 1 B). To test the possibility that the observed growth differences in cells lacking MIF were related to p53 function, we investigated whether interference with p53 activity can alter these effects. For this purpose, a dominant-negative p53H175 allele was introduced into fibroblasts using a replication-defective retrovirus. The functionality of this p53 mutant, including its ability to interfere with p53-dependent transcription, has been documented in previous studies (22Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Google Scholar, 23Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Google Scholar). Contrary to expectations, the expression of p53H175 failed to reverse the difference in the growth phenotype between the wild-type and MIF−/−fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A). The delayed growth rate of MIF−/− cells was not accounted for by differences in mutant p53 expression (Fig. 1 B). Because the oncogenic capacity of LT depends in large part on its ability to block the function of p53 (24Ali S.H. DeCaprio J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 15-23Google Scholar), we examined wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts transduced with LT-expressing retroviruses. As expected, introduction of LT into the wild-type or MIF−/− fibroblasts produced immortalized cell lines. However, subsequent examination revealed that LT-expressing MIF−/− fibroblasts were clearly growth-retarded compared with the corresponding wild-type controls (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblot analyses showed no variations in the levels of LT expression (Fig. 2 A); LT-induced p53 stabilization (Fig. 1 B); or LT binding to Rb, p107, and p130 (data not shown). Although LT has functions outside p53 neutralization, these results suggest that MIF affects cell growth, in part, through a p53-independent mechanism. Because the deficiency in tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, facilitates oncogenic transformation, we next determined whether MEFs expressing p53H175 are susceptible to transformation. Introduction of the activated ras(H-ras V12) allele into control wild-type fibroblasts expressing p53H175 led to their clear morphological transformation (Fig. 2 B) and the loss of contact inhibition, one of the hallmarks of the tumorigenic state. Subsequently, these cells produced 50 ± 10 transformed colonies/plate in several independent experiments (Fig. 2 C). In marked contrast, expression of p53H175 and activatedras in MIF−/− fibroblasts resulted in enlarged cellular morphology (Fig. 2 B) and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). Accordingly, these cells remained contact-inhibited and produced only 1.8 ± 1.5 foci/plate, despite containing equivalent levels of the mutant Ras protein (Fig. 2 A) or growth regulatory molecules, such as ARF and p16 (Fig. 2 D). Transactivation mediated by p53 was inhibited in cells expressing p53H175 andras, as evidenced by decreased Apaf-1 and p21 expression (Fig. 2 D). However, MIF−/− fibroblasts accumulated higher levels of the transcription factor E2F1, whereas higher levels of c-Jun and c-Myc were found in the transformed wild-type cells (Fig. 2 D). It has been noted that a modest reduction in c-Myc expression dramatically reduces susceptibility to Ras transformation (25Bazarov A.V. Adachi S. Li S.F. Mateyak M.K. Wei S. Sedivy J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1178-1186Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the observed difference in transformation between wild-type and MIF−/− cells was independent of MIF loss, we reintroduced the MIF gene into MIF−/− fibroblasts. Restoration of MIF expression in populations expressing p53H175 and H-ras V12 led to efficient focus formation (Fig.2 C). However, we were unable to rescue the transformed phenotype of MIF−/− fibroblasts using various concentrations of recombinant murine MIF purified from bacteria or wild-type MEF-conditioned medium (data not shown). Likewise, MIF−/− fibroblasts expressing both p53H175and H-ras V12 failed to produce transformed colonies when plated on a monolayer of wild-type MEFs. These results suggest that the effects of MIF on cell growth and transformation are independent of its proposed role as a secreted cytokine. Furthermore, our experiments imply that the functional inactivation of p53 is insufficient to render MIF-deficient cells susceptible toras-mediated transformation. Alternatively, a complete inactivation of p53 requires MIF involvement, even in the presence of excess interfering mutant p53. To address these possibilities, we performed the following experiments. To rule out the possibility that MIF−/− fibroblasts are unable to become oncogenically transformed, we examined cells expressing LT, whose activity is associated with the disruption of the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways (24Ali S.H. DeCaprio J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 15-23Google Scholar). Following the introduction of oncogenic rasinto wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts expressing LT, both cell types were readily transformed and invariably produced numerous foci (Fig. 3 A), thus demonstrating that inactivation of the p53 and Rb tumor suppressors renders these cells susceptible to transformation. However, cell cycle analysis revealed that the transformed MIF−/− fibroblasts accumulated in the G2/M phase (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, when assayed for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, LT- and ras-transformed MIF−/−fibroblasts developed colonies with a 2–3-day delay compared with the wild-type cells (data not shown). MIF−/− fibroblasts coexpressing the E1A and Ras oncoproteins also showed a 40% lower focus-forming ability compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 3 A). This correlated with the observed 20–30% slower proliferation by the transformed MIF−/− cultures (data not shown). Because fibroblasts that coexpress E1A and oncogenic ras are prone to p53-mediated apoptosis in response to various insults, such as contact inhibition, we next examined cells expressing E1A deletion mutants E1AΔN and E1AΔCR1 (Fig. 3 C). In previous work, these E1A mutants showed a differential capacity to affect the functions of p300/CBP coactivators and displayed a complete and partial defect, respectively, in apoptosis induction (26Samuelson A.V. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12094-12099Google Scholar, 27Kannabiran C. Morris G.F. Labrie C. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 507-515Google Scholar, 28Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Google Scholar). Remarkably, E1AΔN-expressing wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts showed similar growth properties and focus-forming abilities when tested in transformation assays (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, E1AΔCR1-expressing MIF−/− fibroblasts consistently produced fewer transformed colonies than the corresponding wild-type cells (Fig. 3 A), thus indicating that p53 is more responsive to oncogenic activation in MIF−/− cells. To explore the association between the p53-dependent and p53-independent growth inhibitory responses resulting from MIF deficiency, we utilized the c-myc proto-oncogene. Unlike E1A, mycpromotes cell growth bypassing the normal Rb control (29Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Google Scholar, 30Beier R. Burgin A. Kiermaier A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3497-3509Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, however, overexpression of myc can cause p53-dependent proliferative arrest or augment p53-dependent apoptosis (32Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Google Scholar). Expression ofmyc in MIF−/− fibroblasts consistently produced cell populations that proliferated at lower rates compared with the corresponding wild-type controls (Fig.4 A) Morphologically, MIF−/− populations contained many highly condensed cells (Fig. 4 B) and were blocked in the G1 phase compared with myc-transduced wild-type cells (data not shown). Although wild-type MEFs generally tolerated higher levels of the exogenous Myc protein than MIF−/− cells, the expression levels of the key functional targets of Myc regulation, such as cyclins D1, cyclin E, CDK2, and p53, were similar in both cell types (data not shown). Of note, equivalent levels of these proteins were also found in wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts immortalized by LT and E1A (data not shown). However, combined expression of myc and p53H175 led to a greater increase in proliferation by MIF−/− cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4 A). These results are consistent with the reported ability of MIF to bypass p53-mediated growth arrest without altering p53 protein expression (14Hudson J.D. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1375-1382Google Scholar). The growth properties of MIF−/− fibroblasts coexpressingmyc and H-ras V12 paralleled those of MIF−/− cells transduced with myc alone. Thus, the expression of myc and ras consistently resulted in fewer transformed foci produced by MIF−/−cells compared with the respective wild-type cells (Fig.5 A). This correlated with slower proliferation by myc- and ras-expressing MIF−/− fibroblasts than by the wild-type controls (Fig.5 B). In addition, myc- andras-transduced MIF−/− cultures contained a larger percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells (Fig. 5 C). Moreover, the proportion of live myc- andras-expressing MIF−/− fibroblasts rapidly decreased when shifted to low serum conditions (Fig. 5 C). Immunoblot analysis of myc- and ras-transformed wild-type and MIF−/− cells showed similar expression levels for several growth regulatory molecules, including p53 and ARF (Fig. 5 D). However, the levels of pro-apoptotic molecules (Apaf-1, caspase-3, and caspase-7) were higher in MIF−/−MEFs coexpressing the exogenous Myc and H-RasV12 proteins (Fig. 5 D). Accordingly, sequential introduction of p53H175, myc, and ras into MIF−/− MEFs resulted in a 5-fold increase in focus formation, whereas the corresponding wild-type cells produced a 2-fold increase (Fig. 5 A). Noteworthy, transformation of wild-type MEFs by coexpressing myc and ras correlated with a significant up-regulation of MIF protein levels (Fig.5 D). Because the pro-apoptotic activity of c-Myc has been linked to E2F1 expression (32Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Google Scholar,34Leone G. Sears R. Huang E. Rempel R. Nuckolls F. Park C.H. Giangrande P. Wu L. Saavedra H.I. Field S.J. Thompson M.A. Yang H. Fujiwara Y. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Smith C. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 105-113Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the differences observed in transformation assays were related to E2F1 function. For this purpose, cells transduced with myc and ras were infected with a control green fluorescent protein-expressing retroviral vector or a vector encoding E2F1374, a competitive inhibitor of endogenous E2F activity (Fig. 5 E). This E2F1 mutant contains the DNA-binding domain, but lacks the transactivation and Rb-binding regions and has been shown to block E2F-responsive gene activation (35Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Google Scholar, 36Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Google Scholar, 37Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Google Scholar). The effect of green fluorescent protein expression on the transforming capacity of the MEFs was insignificant (data not shown). A mild inhibitory effect of E2F1374 expression on focus formation was observed in mycandras wild-type cells (Fig. 5 A), whereas introduction of E2F1374 into myc andras MIF−/− fibroblasts increased the efficiency of focus formation. These results suggest thatmyc induces distinct proliferative and growth inhibitory responses in MIF−/− MEFs. Although the intrinsic growth-promoting myc activity cooperates with rasin transformation, the growth inhibitory response observed in MIF−/− cells is likely the result of inappropriate induction of E2F activity and can be partially blocked by interfering with p53 function. The Rb/E2F regulatory pathway controls the activity of numerous genes essential for DNA replication and cell cycle progression (37Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Google Scholar, 38Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Google Scholar, 39Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Google Scholar). Continuously growing MIF−/− cells showed normal expression levels of several E2F-responsive genes, such as cyclin A, cyclin E, cdc6, B-myb, and p107 (data not shown). To assess the effect of MIF deficiency on cell cycle regulation of E2F target genes, MEFs were synchronized by serum deprivation for 72 h and then serum-stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle. Subsequent examination of protein patterns showed no differences between the wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts in serum-induced accumulation of E2F-regulated gene products, such as p107, cyclin A, B-Myb, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig.6 A) (data not shown). However, the induction of cyclin E and cdc6was delayed by an average of 4 h as MIF−/− cells progressed toward S phase (Fig. 6 A). The delay in E2F-responsive gene expression observed in MIF−/− MEFs could result from either inadequate E2F-mediated gene activation or continued gene repression. BecauseE2f1 is an E2F-regulated gene (40Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 690-703Google Scholar), we examined E2F1 expression levels in wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts immortalized by various oncogenes. Notably, E2F1 expression was up-regulated in MIF−/− cells containing p53H175 (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). By contrast, c-Myc expression was similar between the corresponding wild-type and MIF−/− fibroblasts (data not shown). Because activated Ras can increase E2F1 protein levels through both Rb-dependent and Rb-independent mechanisms (29Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Google Scholar, 41Peeper D.S. Upton T.M. Ladha M.H. Neuman E. Zalvide J. Bernards R. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Nature. 1997; 386: 177-181Google Scholar, 42Berkovich E. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42851-42856Google Scholar), we examined whether interference with the E2F DNA-binding activity can affect ras-mediated transformation in the absence of exogenous Myc expression. Several attempts to express a DNA binding-defective E2F1E132 mutant in MIF−/−fibroblasts resulted in rapid cell death. The activity of this mutant has been associated with sequestration of Rb and constitutive expression of E2F target genes (43Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Mandigo C.E. Miglarese M.R. Oncogene. 1998"
https://openalex.org/W2017120435,"Several signaling pathways have been implicated in mediating TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix production and fibrosis. We have shown recently that induction of biglycan (BGN) expression by TGF-β1 depended on a functional Smad pathway (Chen, W.-B., Lenschow, W., Tiede, K., Fischer, J. W., Kalthoff, H., and Ungefroren, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem.277, 36118–36128). Here, we present evidence that the ability of TGF-β1 to induce BGN mRNA, in addition to Smads, requires p38 MAPK signaling, because 1) pharmacological inhibitors of p38 dose-dependently inhibited the TGF-β effect without significantly affecting the transcriptional activity of a constitutively active mutant of the TGF-β type I receptor or Smad2 phosphorylation at concentrations up to 10 μm, 2) the up-regulation of BGN mRNA was preceded by a delayed increase in the phosphorylation of p38 and its upstream activator MKK6 in TGF-β1-treated PANC-1 cells, 3) inhibition of the p38 pathway by stable retroviral transduction with a dominant negative mutant of either p38 or MKK6 reduced TGF-β1-induced BGN mRNA expression, and 4) overexpression of wild-type p38 or MKK6, but not MKK3, augmented the TGF-β1 effect on BGN mRNA. We further demonstrate that the (delayed) p38 activation by TGF-β1 is downstream of Smads and requires a functional Smad pathway, because blocking TGF-β-induced p38 activity with SB202190 had no effect on Smad2 phosphorylation, but blocking Smad signaling by forced expression of Smad7 abolished TGF-β1 induction of p38 activation and, as shown earlier, BGN mRNA expression; finally, re-expression of Smad4 in Smad4-null CFPAC-1 cells restored TGF-β-induced p38 phosphorylation and, as demonstrated previously, BGN mRNA accumulation. These results clearly show that TGF-β induction of BGN expression in pancreatic cells requires activation of MKK6-p38 MAPK signaling downstream of Smad signaling and provide a mechanistic clue to the up-regulation of BGN seen in inflammatory response-related fibrosis and desmoplasia. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in mediating TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix production and fibrosis. We have shown recently that induction of biglycan (BGN) expression by TGF-β1 depended on a functional Smad pathway (Chen, W.-B., Lenschow, W., Tiede, K., Fischer, J.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). TGF-β1, one of three mammalian TGF-β isoforms, TGF-β1–3, is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix formation and has been implicated as the key mediator of fibrogenesis and desmoplasia in a variety of tissues (3Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, TGF-β, besides its powerful antiproliferative function, induces morphological and biochemical changes toward a mesenchymal phenotype designated epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) (4Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Google Scholar). A hallmark of both fibrogenesis and EMT is the TGF-β-induced up-regulation of matrix-associated proteins, such as certain integrins and their extracellular matrix ligands (collagens, fibronectin, proteoglycans). The TGF-β responses are initiated by the interaction of the TGF-β ligand with cell surface receptors that form a heterotetrameric complex of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (5Ebner R. Chen R.H. Shum L. Lawler S. Zioncheck T.F. Lee A. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1344-1348Google Scholar, 6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar). The activated ligand-receptor complex, in turn, activates one or more downstream signaling pathway, the most prominent one being the Smad pathway (7Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar, 8Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). This pathway is initiated with the phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3, which then heterodimerize with the co-Smad, Smad4, followed by translocation of the Smad2/3-Smad4 complex to the nucleus; here, it binds directly or via other DNA-binding proteins to the promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes to stimulate or repress their transcription (7Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar, 8Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). Activation of Smad signaling is blocked by Smad7, which inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by the type I receptor thereby preventing their association with Smad4 (9Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 549-551Google Scholar, 10Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Google Scholar). Evidence over the past few years suggests that TGF-β may also stimulate other downstream pathways, involving RhoA (11Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.-H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Google Scholar), as well as the MAP kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (12Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (13Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

However, the question whether MAP kinases depend on a functional Smad pathway and, if so, how both pathways interact, has only been addressed in a few cases (13Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Google Scholar, 14Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Google Scholar, 15Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M.

Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence to suggest a functional separation among the individual signaling pathways (for review see Ref. 21Massagué J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar). Smads, but not p38 MAPKs, appear to be required for TGF-β-induced growth inhibition of epithelial cells through their ability to transcriptionally up-regulate the promoters of p15INK4b, p21CIP1, and c-myc (22Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schrader M. Eilers M. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Google Scholar, 23Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

In contrast, TGF-β-induced apoptosis in mouse mammary gland epithelial cells is Smad-independent but requires activation of p38 (18Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 14: 3749-3759Google Scholar). Still other biological outcomes, e.g. EMT, seem to require activation of both pathways (18Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 14: 3749-3759Google Scholar). Among the proteoglycans that are up-regulated by TGF-β in vitro is biglycan (BGN), a prototype member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family (reviewed in Refs. 25Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Google Scholar, 26Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Google Scholar, 27Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Google Scholar). BGN can be considered a marker gene for TGF-β activity that is reflectedin vivo by the close spatial and temporal association of both proteins under physiological and various pathophysiological conditions. BGN has been implicated in the regulation of matrix assembly, cellular adhesion (28Nelimarkka L. Kainulainen V. Schonherr E. Moisander S. Jortikka M. Lammi M. Elenius K. Jalkanen M. Jarvelainen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12730-12737Google Scholar), migration (29Kinsella M.G. Tsoi C.K. Jarvelainen H.T. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 318-325Google Scholar), and growth factor,e.g. TGF-β, activity (30Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Google Scholar). Recently, BGN has been shown to directly inhibit the growth of cancer cells in a TGF-β-independent manner (31Weber C.K. Sommer G. Michl P. Fensterer H. Weimer M. Gansauge F. Leder G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 657-667Google Scholar), a biological effect that it shares with its close homologue decorin (32De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Google Scholar). In conjunction with our recent observations that pancreatic tumor cells themselves synthesize and secrete BGN in response to TGF-β in vitro and that a functional Smad pathway is crucial for this to occur (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar), we have proposed a novel tumor suppressor function for Smad4: growth inhibition via autoinhibitory BGN. In the pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC-1 the dramatic (up to 50-fold) TGF-β-induced increase in BGN mRNA and a concomitant, albeit smaller, rise in core-protein synthesis and release occurred in a BGN promoter-independent fashion and by far exceeded the Smad-dependent transcriptional activation of a heterologous reporter in these cells (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar). This observation implies the existence of an additional signaling pathway(s) that function(s) to amplify Smad-mediated signaling. PANC-1 cells undergo EMT in response to TGF-β (34Ellenrieder V. Hendler S.F. Boeck W. Seufferlein T. Menke A. Ruhland C. Adler G. Gress T.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4222-4228Google Scholar), which is characterized by adoption of a fibroblastoid morphology, a down-regulation of epithelial markers, and an up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, e.g. BGN. As mentioned above, EMT requires activation of both Smad and p38, and it is thus conceivable that this may be reflected at the level of particular genes involved in EMT. Finally, formation of fibrotic tissue with enhanced BGN production often results from a previous inflammatory reaction known to be associated with increased p38 MAPK signaling (35Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). Together, these observations led us to hypothesize that efficient BGN induction by TGF-β, in addition to the well characterized Smad pathway, requires activation of p38 MAPK. Using a combination of specific pharmacologic inhibitors, as well as overexpression of wild-type proteins from the p38 MAPK cascade and their dominant negative mutants, we present first-hand evidence that the p38 pathway is essential for TGF-β-mediated induction of BGN and that it cooperates with the Smad pathway. We further demonstrate that activation of p38 is secondary to and dependent on activation of Smad proteins. This is the first report demonstrating the involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in the TGF-β control of BGN and small leucine-rich proteoglycan gene expression. The p38 MAPK pathway inhibitors SB203580, SB202190, and SKF86002 and the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in water (SB203580) or dimethyl sulfoxide (all others). The selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB239063 was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline. Human recombinant TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems, and anisomycin was from Sigma. The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or obtained from Dr. W. von Bernstorff (University of Kiel), respectively. Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 cells stably transduced with recombinant retrovirus were cultured in the presence of 700 μg/ml (PANC-1) or 350 μg/ml (CFPAC-1) geneticin (biologically active concentration; Invitrogen) or 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-SAPK/JNK, anti-phospho-MKK3/MKK6 (Ser189/Ser207), anti-phospho ATF-2 (Thr71) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-MKK6 (V-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MKK3 (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/Ser467) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY/Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), anti-Smad2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Berlin, Germany), anti-Smad4 (B-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Smad7 (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-β-actin (AC-15; Sigma). FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from cells with RNA Clean (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The general RT-PCR protocol and the oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of BGN and GAPDH mRNAs were described in detail earlier (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar, 36Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 276: 15787-15795Google Scholar). For semiquantification of BGN, PAI-1, and GAPDH mRNAs we carried out a competitive approach using gene-specific internal standards (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar). Briefly, for each target mRNA multiple reactions were run in parallel containing identical amounts of cDNA (corresponding to 100 ng of total RNA) but different concentrations of internal standard DNA. For this purpose, the standard DNA was serially diluted (0.9, 0.8, … , 0.09, 0.08, … and so forth). To keep reactions in the exponential phase, the number of cycles with an annealing temperature of 59 °C was adjusted to 16 cycles for BGN and 8 cycles for GAPDH. Following electrophoretic separation of PCR products on agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide photographs were taken and densitometrically scanned using the NIH Image software (version 1.62). TGF-β induction of BGN and PAI-1 mRNA was assessed from those reactions that showed an equimolar concentration of target and internal standard. The corresponding amount of target mRNA in these reactions was considered to be accurately determined when this ratio and the target to standard ratios of at least two neighboring reactions plotted against the corresponding standard dilutions on a semilogarithmic scale formed a linear relationship. Relative values for BGN and PAI-1 mRNA concentrations were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. For each stimulation experiment at least two independent competitive RT-PCR assays were performed yielding the same results. For retroviral transduction, cDNAs for murine flag epitope-tagged kinase-inactive versions of p38α (p38AF, harboring T180A and Y182F amino acid substitutions) and MKK6 (MKK6Ala) in pcDNA3 (both generously provided by Dr. S. Ludwig, Würzburg, Germany) were amplified with T7 and SP6 primers using Turbo-Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned in sense orientation into the PmeI site of the retroviral vector TJBA5bMoLink-neo (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar). The coding sequences for wild-type p38α and MKK3 were generated by RT-PCR with primers p38-forward, 5′-AAAATGTCTCAGGAGAGGCCCACG-3′ (start codon underlined) and p38-reverse, 5′-TCAGGACTCCATCTCTTCTTGGTC-3′ (stop codon underlined) and MKK3-forward, 5′-ACCATGTCCAAGCCACCCGCACC-3′ and MKK3-reverse, 5′-CCCTATGAGTCTTCTCCCAGGATC-3′, respectively, using Turbo-Pfu polymerase and PANC-1 cDNA as template. The resulting fragments were gel-purified and ligated in sense orientation into PmeI-restricted TJBA5bMoLink-neo vector (MKK3) orSnaBI-restricted pBABEpuro (p38). In both cases sequencing revealed authenticity with the published mRNA sequences. The generation of a retrovirus encoding Smad4 was described in detail earlier (33Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Google Scholar). A retrovirus for Smad7 was prepared by releasing the Smad7 cDNA from pcDNA3 (a generous gift from Dr. C.-H. Heldin, Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) followed by directional cloning into BamHI/PmeI-restricted TJBA5bMoLink-neo. Positive clones (evaluated by PCR, restriction analysis, and sequencing of the plasmid-cDNA junctions) were cotransfected into human embryonic kidney 293T producer cells, along with retroviral packaging vectors, as described previously (37Howard B.D. Boenicke L. Schniewind B. Henne-Bruns D. Kalthoff H. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 927-938Google Scholar). Retroviral particles released by human embryonic kidney 293T cells were used to infect PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 cells. Pools or individual clones (obtained by limited dilution) of productively infected cells were obtained by selection with geneticin (TJBA5bMoLink-neo) or puromycin (pBABEpuro) and were analyzed for expression of the desired proteins by RT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting. In the case of Smad7 only, transduced cells were used for experimentation 48 h after infection without prior geneticin selection. For transient transfections followed by quantification of BGN mRNA, PANC-1 cells (4 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates on day 1 and transfected on day 2 with an expression vector for MKK6 (pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK6; a kind gift of Dr. S. Ludwig) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following a period of 24 h in normal growth medium to allow expression of proteins from the transfected plasmids, cells were starved (0.5% FCS) for another 24 h and stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) in the same medium for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were processed for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. For detection of luciferase activity, PANC-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well. On the next day cells were cotransfected with the TGF-β responsive reporter p3TP-lux and a plasmid encoding a constitutively active mutant of TGF-β receptor type I/ALK5 (ALK5T204D; both plasmids kindly provided by Dr. J. Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) using LipofectAMINE Plus. After removal of the transfection mixture, cells were incubated in normal growth medium for 24 h. For analysis of the effect of the MAPK inhibitors on ALK5T204D activity, different amounts of SB203580 were then added to the medium for another incubation period of 24 h. Following lysis in Glo lysis buffer luciferase activities were determined with the Bright Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) in the MicroBeta TriLux 1450 system (Wallac, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 2 s. The mean ± S.D. for each sample and treatment were determined from 6–8 wells processed in parallel. Because control experiments showed that the overall results were not affected by unequal transfection efficiencies, normalization to β-galactosidase activity was omitted. For immunoprecipitation cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented withComplete TM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti FLAG-antibody, followed by adsorption with protein G-Sepharose. Protein G beads were then washed in lysis buffer five times, boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. For direct immunoblot analysis, cells were either lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate andComplete TM in PBS) or, for detection of phosphorylated proteins, were lysed directly in 2× Laemmli buffer. 40 μg of total cellular protein (measured with BCA protein assay reagent; Pierce) from cleared lysates or equal volumes of Laemmli lysates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted on to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk, washed several times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with the primary antibody. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, TBST (Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20) plus 5% bovine serum albumin was used for membrane blocking, and TBST was used for washing. After washing, blots were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL or ECL+Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots for the detection of activated MAP kinases were first incubated with the respective phosphospecific antibody and then stripped and reprobed with an antibody against the corresponding total protein or β-actin to confirm equal loading. Several observations suggested that in PANC-1 cells an additional pathway is activated by TGF-β that, together with the Smad pathway, functions to amplify the TGF-β signal for the BGN mRNA up-regulation (see Introduction). To analyze whether p38 MAP kinases or ERKs are involved in the TGF-β effect on BGN expression, we used pharmacological inhibitors that specifically block these pathways. The pyridinylimidazole-based compounds SB203580 and SB202190 inhibit the activity of p38 for its substrate but do not block its phosphorylation. Pre-incubation of the cells with SB203580 or SB202190 strongly suppressed the TGF-β effect on BGN mRNA (Fig.1 A) and proteoglycan synthesis (data not shown) in a dose-dependent manner. Successful inhibition of p38 was verified for SB202190 by reduced phosphorylation of ATF-2, a nuclear target of the p38 pathway (Fig. 1 A,inset). SB202190 inhibition of TGF-β-induced BGN mRNA was also seen in other cell types, e.g. osteoblastic MG-63 cells (data not shown). Pre-incubation of PANC-1 cells with PD98059 or U0126, two inhibitors of MEK1, the upstream kinase that activates ERK1/2, did not inhibit TGF-β induction of BGN mRNA. Rather, the MEK1 inhibitors slightly enhanced the TGF-β effect (Fig.1 B), which would be compatible with an inhibitory effect of the ERKs on TGF-β-induced BGN expression (see “Discussion”). SB203580 and SB202190 were shown recently (38Eyers P.A. Craxton M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Goedert M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 321-328Google Scholar, 39Laping N.J. Grygielko A. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 58-64Google Scholar) to inhibit ALK5 function at higher concentrations because of similar critical amino acid sequences in the kinase domains (ATP binding pocket) of ALK5 and p38 MAPK. To further exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect of these compounds on TGF-β-induced up-regulation of BGN mRNA was because of inhibition of ALK5 rather than p38, we sought to assess the functional effect of SB203580 on ALK5 more directly. To do this, we transiently cotransfected PANC-1 cells with ALK5T204D, a constitutively active ALK5 mutant, along with the TGF-β responsive reporter p3TP-lux and measured ALK5T204D activity in the presence or absence of SB203580. As shown in Fig. 1 C, concentrations of up to 10 μm SB203580 did not significantly affect ALK5T204D transcriptional activity. Finally, we used the chemically related compound SB239063, which is considered to be selective for p38 (40Behr T.M. Nerurkar S.S. Nelson A.H. Coatney R.W. Woods T.N. Sulpizio A. Chandra S. Brooks D.P. Kurnar S. Lee J.C. Ohlstein E.H. Augermann C.E. Adams J.L. Sisko J. Sackuer-Bernstein J.D. Willette R.N. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1292-1298Google Scholar). 2N. Laping, personal communication. Like SB203580 and SB202190, SB239063 potently inhibited the TGF-β effect on BGN with an IC50 of ∼ 2 μm (Fig. 1 D). Notably, SB239063 only marginally affected TGF-β induction of PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 1 D) indicating that SB239063 is not a general inhibitor of TGF-β signaling. From these results we conclude that the inhibition of TGF-β1-induced BGN mRNA expression by SB203580 and SB202190 was not caused by inhibition of ALK5 activity. Instead, the data presented suggest that TGF-β mediated part of its effect on BGN expression via the p38 MAPK pathway. Several MAPK pathways have been shown to be activated in response to TGF-β in PANC-1 cells (41Giehl K. Seidel B. Gierschik P. Adler G. Menke A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4531-4541Google Scholar). Because pharmacological inhibitors of the p38 MAPK cascade blunted the TGF-β effect, we investigated whether p38 was activated in response to TGF-β1 by analyzing the phosphorylation state of p38 by immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody. From Fig.2 it is evident that TGF-β1 induced an increase in p38 activation that was first noticed 1 h after TGF-β1 addition, peaked at 2–4 h, and returned to baseline levels thereafter. Interestingly, another member of the stress-activated protein kinases, SAPK/JNK, was not activated following TGF-β treatment in PANC-1 cells, although it was readily activated by anisomycin, a known activator for both JNK and p38 (Fig. 2). Because p38 is activated by the two upstream MAPK kinases, MKK3 and MKK6 (42Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar), we predicted that these, too, were activated by TGF-β in a temporal fashion similar to that of p38. This was confirmed by immunoblot analyses using a phosphospecific antibody against these two kinases (Fig. 2). In accordance with activation of p38 but not SAPK/JNK, MKK4, the upstream kinase of SAPK/JNK, was not activated in response to TGF-β1 (data not shown). To more specifically demonstrate the involvement of p38 MAPK in TGF-β-regulation of BGN, we inhibited p38 function by stable retrovirus-mediated expression of a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of p38α, p38AF, that has been shown to act in a dominant negative fashion (43Ludwig S. Hoffmeyer A. Goebeler M. Kilian K. Hafner H. Neufeld B. Han J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1917-1922Google Scholar). Analysis of a pool of PANC-1 transductants, as well as several individual clones by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-p38 immunoblotting, indicated expression of the mutant construct (Fig.3 A, inset). The amount of immunoprecipitated protein correlated well with the degree of inhibition of the TGF-β effect on BGN mRNA (Fig.3 A). Moreover, overexpression of wild-type p38 in a clone pool of transduced cel"

Triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) recognize and bind specific sequences via the major groove of duplex DNA and may have potential for gene targetingin vivo. We have constructed chemically modified, psoralen-linked TFOs that mediate site-specific mutagenesis of a chromosomal gene in living cells. Here we show that targeting efficiency is sensitive to the biology of the cell, specifically, cell cycle status. Targeted mutagenesis was variable across the cycle with the greatest activity in S phase. This was the result of differential TFO binding as measured by cross-link formation. Targeted cross-linking was low in quiescent cells but substantially enhanced in S phase cells with adducts in ∼20–30% of target sequences. 75–80% of adducts were repaired faithfully, whereas the remaining adducts were converted into mutations (>5% mutation frequency). Clones with mutations could be recovered by direct screening of colonies chosen at random. These results demonstrate high frequency target binding and target mutagenesis by TFOs in living cells. Successful protocols for TFO-mediated manipulation of chromosomal sequences are likely to reflect a combination of appropriate oligonucleotide chemistry and manipulation of the cell biology.

Successful constructs must be functional in the nuclear environment of living cells. Furthermore, their intended targets must be accessible despite the packaging and condensation of nuclear DNA by chromosomal proteins. One targeting strategy that has been of interest for many years is based on triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (TFOs).1 A DNA triple helix can form when a TFO lies in the major groove of intact duplex DNA (1Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Google Scholar, 2Moser H.E. Dervan P.B. Science. 1987; 238: 645-650Google Scholar, 3Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

The most stable structures assemble on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences with hydrogen bonds formed between the bases in the third strand and those in the purine strand of the duplex. The purine or pyrimidine motif third strands may be involved in triplex formation depending on the target sequence, and a binding code for the design of the third strands has been defined (6Letai A.G. Palladino M.A. Fromm E. Rizzo V. Fresco J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9108-9112Google Scholar). Although conventional oligonucleotides have features that limit their activity under physiological conditions, there is a variety of chemical modifications that ameliorate these limitations (7Fox K.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 17-37Google Scholar). Thus, for pyrimidine TFOs, the replacement of cytosine by 5-methylcytosine and the use of 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe)-modified sugars permit stable triplex formation at physiological pH in vitro(8Lee J.S.

Although chemical modifications can enhance TFO affinity and triplex stability, they obviously cannot address the issue of access to chromosomal targets inside living cells. In biochemical experiments, it has been shown that sequences in nucleosomes are poor candidates for triplex formation (19Brown P.M. Fox K.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 607-611Google Scholar, 20Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Martinez-Balbas A. Azorin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31807-31812Google Scholar, 21Brown P.M. Fox K.R. Eur. J.

Thus, in the cell, a TFO is likely to confront the same issues of target accessibility described for sequence specific regulatory proteins (23Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Google Scholar). Of course, reports of gene targetingin vivo by TFOs imply, of necessity, some degree of target access (14Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Google Scholar). We have employed an Hprt knock-out assay to measure the activity of TFOs linked to the DNA cross-linker psoralen (pso-TFOs). The assay reflects the binding of the target sequence by the TFO and, following photoactivation of the psoralen, the generation of an inactivating mutation as a result of cellular processing of the cross-link. We have used this approach to measure the activity of TFOs carrying sugar and base modifications and have shown that TFOs with 2′-O-aminoethyl (2′-AE) substitutions are bioactive (18Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7716-7724Google Scholar). We have now asked whether the biological state of the cell could influence TFO activity. Here we show that the frequency of mutagenesis induced by a pso-TFO differs in quiescent and S phase cells. The difference reflects the levels of targeted cross-links in the two cell populations. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) AA8 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin. Prior to an experiment, the cells were grown in HAT medium (10−4m hypoxanthine, 5 × 10−5m aminopterin, 10−5m thymidine) for 1 week. The cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by a variation of the method described by Sawai et al. (29Sawai M. Takase K. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 4-10Google Scholar). Cells were plated at subconfluent levels, and on the next day, the medium changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and 2% Me2SO. After 48 h, the cells were washed (∼85% G0/G1 cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis) and either electroporated or fed with complete medium (for G1 phase experiments) or incubated with complete medium containing 100 μm mimosine for 16 h to block them in early S phase (∼90% early S cells) (for complete details on this procedure, see Ref. 30Orren D.K. Petersen L.N. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3722-3730Google Scholar). After 16 h, the cells were released from the mimosine block by feeding with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were suspended at 107/ml and mixed with TFO at 5 μm. The cells were electroporated (Bio-Rad) followed by incubation at room temperature for 3 h and a 3-min exposure in a Rayonet chamber to UVA light at 1.8 J/cm2. The electroporation conditions were chosen to minimize cell toxicity (trypan blue staining showed ∼95% viable cells after UVA treatment). Cells treated with free psoralen were incubated with 5 μmpsoralen for 30 min followed by UVA treatment. The cells were passaged and then exposed to thioguanine selection (17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar). Following TFO electroporation, UVA treatment, and culture for 3–5 days to permit mutagenesis, 100 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in standard growth medium. Individual colonies were expanded, and the DNA was extracted followed by amplification of the I4E5 target region and digestion of the PCR products with XbaI. After UVA exposure of cells treated with the pso-TFO, the DNA was extracted and digested withEcoRI. 10 μg in 10 μl of solution were then mixed with 45 μl of 98% formamide and heated at 77 °C for 15 min. The samples were electrophoresed in an agarose gel in neutral buffer and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a 2-kb EcoRI fragment containing the I4E5 target region and adjacent sequence. The probe was labeled by random priming and incubated overnight with a blank membrane in hybridization buffer to remove radioactive species that bound nonspecifically. This step greatly reduced nonspecific binding to the nylon. In other experiments, following TFO/UVA treatment, genomic DNA was exhaustively digested withEcoRI and XbaI, blotted, and hybridized. To control for triplex formation resulting from the interaction of unbound TFO and the target during DNA purification (31Becker N.A. Maher III, L.J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 313-316Google Scholar), we mixed AE-07 and cells and then isolated genomic DNA and digested it. There was noXbaI-resistant band. The triplex target sequence is in the fourth intron next to Exon 5 of the CHOHprt gene (Fig.1 a). The sequence consists of a 17-base polypurine:polypyrimidine sequence ending in a 5′-TA step, which is appropriate for T–T interstrand cross-linking by psoralen (32Hearst J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 69-75Google Scholar). The A is the first base of the AG splice acceptor sequence, and point mutations at this site have been reported previously (33Cariello N.F. Craft T.R. Vrieling H. van Zeeland A.A. Adams T. Skopek T.R. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1992; 20: 81-83Google Scholar). The intron/exon junction also contains a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme XbaI (TCTAGA). The TFO used in these studies, AE-07, was linked to psoralen and contained a patch of four 2′-AE substituted nucleotides, whereas the remainder of the molecule contained 2′-OMe sugars (Fig. 1, a and b). We have described the synthesis and characterization of TFOs containing 2′-AE substitutions in previous publications (17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar, 18Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7716-7724Google Scholar). The 2′-AE residues are protonated at physiological pH. They reduce the charge repulsion between the third strand and the duplex target, thus lowering the requirement for Mg2+ (34Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Google Scholar, 35Blume S.W. Lebowitz J. Zacharias W. Guarcello V. Mayfield C.A. Ebbinghaus S.W. Bates P. Jones Jr., D.E. Trent J. Vigneswaran N. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 695-702Google Scholar). They also establish a stabilizing interaction with phosphates in the purine strand of the duplex target (36Carlomagno T. Blommers M.J. Meiler J. Cuenoud B. Griesinger C. J. Am. Chem Soc. 2001; 123: 7364-7370Google Scholar). Psoralen-linked TFOs containing the appropriate amount and distribution of this modification are active in theHprt assay (18Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7716-7724Google Scholar). AE-07 was introduced by electroporation into quiescent CHO cells and into cells at different times after release from quiescence (see “Materials and Methods”) (for fluorescence-activated cell sorter profiles of quiescent and mid S phase cells, see Fig. 2 a). The psoralen was photoactivated, and the frequency of cells with inactivating mutations in the Hprt gene was determined via conventional thioguanine selection. The mutation frequency was quite low in the cells in G0/G1 but increased in cells traversing G1 and appeared maximal in S phase cells. To more precisely define the time of peak activity in S phase, the cells were released from G0/G1 block and then blocked again in early S phase by treatment with complete medium containing mimosine (30Orren D.K. Petersen L.N. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3722-3730Google Scholar). The cells were released from this block and, as before, were treated at various times with AE-07/UVA followed by determination of thioguanine-resistant colonies. The greatest activity was seen 4–6 h after release during which time the cells were in mid-to-late S phase. Results from selected time points are shown in Fig. 2 b. The mutation frequency of cells treated in mid-S phase was 0.15–0.22%, whereas the level in quiescent cells was 0.02–0.03%. Our previous work (14Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Google Scholar) shows that the appearance of mutant cells required photoactivation. Thus, the actual mutagen was the psoralen cross-link. Consequently, it was of interest to question whether Hprtmutagenesis by free psoralen would show cell cycle variability. We treated cells at different phases of the cell cycle with psoralen (see “Materials and Methods”) and processed them as before. Thioguanine-resistant colonies were recovered at frequencies a few fold over the background (0.004–0.005 versus 0.001%), consistent with similar experiments with psoralen by other groups (37Laquerbe A. Guillouf C. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 38-49Google Scholar,38Chiou C.C. Yang J.L. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1357-1362Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the previous experiment, the mutation frequency was essentially unchanged across the cell cycle (Fig.2 c). Several control experiments were performed. Cells at different times of the cycle were treated with nonspecific TFOs or the specific TFO without photoactivation, or they were mock-electroporated and UVA-treated. We saw no increase in mutation frequency relative to cells that received no treatment in any of these experiments. We also measured the efficiency of electroporation in G0/G1 and S phase cells using a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid assay. We found only a modest difference in efficiency in S phase (60–70% positive cells) as compared with G0/G1 cells (40–50%). The assay was repeated with fluorescent oligonucleotides. Approximately, 50% G0/G1 cells showed nuclear fluorescence versus 80% for those in the S phase, again too small to explain the differences in Fig. 2 b. The Aprt gene has polypurine:polypyrimidine elements similar but not identical to the Exon 5 target in Hprt. There are straightforward selection protocols for identifying cells with mutations in Aprt. We have used this assay to monitor the specificity of the TFOs designed for the Hprt target. In previous work (14Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Google Scholar), we found that although AE-07 treatment mutagenizedHprt, it had no effect on Aprt. We repeated this experiment with cells in mid-S phase but again found no increase over background in the frequency of cells with mutations in theAprt gene (data not shown). The results of these experiments suggested that the differences in pso-TFO activity in quiescent and S phase cells were not artifacts of electroporation efficiency differences or because of a loss of target specificity (with an attendant increase in random mutagenesis) in S phase. The indifference to cell cycle position of mutagenesis by free psoralen indicated that there was a fundamental difference between the two reagents. Two nonexclusive explanations for the variability of the TFO-targeted mutagenesis appeared possible. The first explanation that the frequency of TFO targeted cross-links was the same in G0/G1 and S phases and that the kinds of mutations or perhaps the efficiency of mutagenesis of the TFO cross-links varied. Alternatively, the frequency of TFO-mediated cross-link formation might be different in G0/G1 and S phases. The published spectra of psoralen-induced mutations in Hprt are dominated by base substitutions (37Laquerbe A. Guillouf C. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 38-49Google Scholar, 38Chiou C.C. Yang J.L. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1357-1362Google Scholar). We have performed experiments with mutation reporter plasmids carrying TFO-psoralen cross-links in the Hprt target sequence embedded in the supFreporter gene. These mutation profiles were also dominated by base substitutions. Almost all were located at T of the 5′-TA cross-link site (data not shown) (for schematic of the reporter gene, see Ref.17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar). Targeted point mutations were also the major event in earlier studies (39Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Google Scholar, 40Raha M. Lacroix L. Glazer P.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 67: 289-294Google Scholar) with psoralen-linked TFOs and supF reporter genes. However, in our analysis of pso-TFO-targeted mutations at the endogenous chromosomal Hprt target site, we found that ∼90% thioguanine-resistant clones carried deletions in the target region extending into Exon 5 (14Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Google Scholar, 17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar) and no point mutations were observed at the T of the 5′-TA cross-link site. This disparity could result from marked differences in the processing of the pso-TFO cross-link in the chromosomal target as compared with the shuttle vector plasmid (and the free psoralen) or might simply reflect the failure of the thioguanine resistance assay to report base substitutions at this site. We tested the latter possibility by isolating DNA from colonies chosen at random following pso-TFO/UVA treatment (no selection was applied). The PCR products of the I4E5 target region from these clones were digested with XbaI whose recognition site is coincident with the cross-link target site (Fig. 1 a). We screened 800 colonies from S phase experiments and recovered 54 digestion-resistant clones (6.8%) (Fig. 3). The analysis was performed on G0/G1 colonies, and 6 of 731 were resistant (0.8%). Sequence analysis of resistant PCR fragments (43 S phase and 4 G0/G1 phase) indicated that 41 of 43 were T → C at the T of the 5′-TA cross-link site (the others were point mutations at adjacent bases within the XbaI site). Two hundred colonies from mock-transfected/UVA-treated cells were also analyzed. There were no XbaI-resistant clones. These results showed that the actual frequency of targeted mutations was much higher (30-fold) than reported by the thioguanine selection. However, they confirmed the disparity between the G0/G1 and S phase mutation frequencies. The difference in targeted mutation frequency between quiescent and S phase cells could be the result of cell cycle variability in mutagenesis functions (41Hendrickson E.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 795-800Google Scholar) or a difference in the efficiency of pso-TFO cross-link formation. To test the latter possibility, we treated G0/G1 and S phase cells with the pso-TFO and UVA and then isolated total genomic DNA. We used the classical denaturation resistance technique to measure the level of cross-links in a restriction fragment containing the target sequence (42Hartley J.A. Souhami R.L. Berardini M.D. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 618: 277-288Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with EcoRI, and the digests were denatured and electrophoresed on neutral agarose gels. The gels were blotted onto a nylon filter and hybridized with a probe specific for the 2-kb fragment containing the target sequence. In initial control experiments, purified genomic DNA was incubated with the pso-TFO and was UVA-treatedin vitro, restricted, and then either run separately or mixed with an equal amount of untreated DNA. The hybridization pattern showed clear resolution between the cross-linked and non-cross-linked samples and run separately or in mixture (Fig.4 a). The hybridization signal of the cross-linked fragment was ∼50% of the non-cross-linked control, reflecting the reduced efficiency of hybridization and/or the reduced retention on the filter of cross-linked DNA. The analysis of the DNA from the treated cells showed a greater extent of cross-linking in S phase than in G0/G1. Quantitation by PhosphorImager indicated that ∼19 ± 2% S phase DNA was cross-linked (seven experiments), whereas the G0 level was 4 ± 2%. To control for nonspecific cross-linking, the blots were stripped and rehybridized with a probe to a 3-kb fragment of theDhfr gene (Fig. 4 b). There were no denaturation-resistant fragments in any of the samples, suggesting that the resistance was specific to the fragment containing the target sequence. The difference in targeted TFO-psoralen adducts in cells in S phase or G0/G1 was also shown by restriction digestion protection. DNA from treated cells was digested with EcoRI and XbaI followed by blotting and hybridization. The level of the XbaI-resistant fragment was severalfold higher in the S phase (25–30% protection) sample than G0/G1(4–5%) (Fig. 4 c). The greater signal from this assay may reflect the inhibition of the restriction enzyme by both psoralen mono-adducts and cross-links, whereas only the cross-links are reported by the denaturation resistance assay. The pso-TFOs (43Grigoriev M. Praseuth D. Guieysse A.L. Robin P. Thuong N.T. Helene C. Harel-Bellan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3501-3505Google Scholar) are two component reagents with the extent of cross-linking (and the mutational consequences thereof) dependent upon and serving as a measure of the bound TFO at the time of photoactivation. The data presented here and in our previous publications (17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar, 18Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7716-7724Google Scholar) show that both the chemistry of the oligonucleotide and the biology of the cell are important determinants of TFO binding at a chromosomal target. The biochemical measurement of the frequency of targeted cross-links combined with the frequency and kinds of mutations affords an initial insight into the relative importance of the several pathways available for processing cross-links. Approximately, 20–30% of the target sequences were cross-linked when the cells were treated in S phase. However, the overall mutation frequency was ∼7%. This indicates that as many as 75% of the cross-links were resolved without mutagenesis. >95% of the mutations were single base substitutions, whereas the deletions accounted for the remainder. Mutagenesis and repair of psoralen cross-links have been examined by many groups, and multiple pathways are involved (44Cole R.S. Sinden R.R. Basic Life Sci. 1975; 5B: 487-495Google Scholar, 45Vos J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 50: 789-799Google Scholar, 46Greenberg R.B. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Chua M.A. Saffran W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31551-31560Google Scholar, 47Grossmann K.F. Ward A.M. Matkovic M.E. Folias A.E. Moses R.E. Mutat. Res. 2001; 487: 73-83Google Scholar, 48Wang X. Peterson C.A. Zheng H. Nairn R.S. Legerski R.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 713-720Google Scholar). Current models involve the generation of single strand gaps at the cross-link site, perhaps requiring the activity of the XPF·ERCC1 (XPF, the gene mutated inXeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group F; ERCC1, excision repair cross complementing gene 1) complex (49Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26632-26636Google Scholar). Recombinational repair of the gap using another intact copy of the target region as a donor would yield an unaltered version of the original target. Alternatively, the gap could serve as a template for synthesis by one or another of the damage bypass polymerases (50Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Google Scholar). This synthesis could have mutagenic consequences or might be error-free. Presumably, this would be the source of the point mutations. A second cycle of excision repair and synthesis would eventually produce either a mutant or wild type target sequence. Our base substitution data are in good agreement with a previous study (51Barre F.X. Asseline U. Harel-Bellan A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1379-1387Google Scholar) of pso-TFO mutagenesis of plasmids in yeast that elucidated mutagenesis from the furan or pyrone side of the psoralen cross-link (51Barre F.X. Asseline U. Harel-Bellan A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1379-1387Google Scholar, 52Barre F.X. Giovannangeli C. Helene C. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 743-749Google Scholar). This work showed mutation patterns consistent with preferential excision of the duplex on the transcribed strand and also on the furan side of the cross-link. When both conditions applied as would be the case with the I4E5 target, the mutations were generated at the T at the pyrone side of the cross-link. The majority of thioguanine-resistant clones contains deletions in which the psoralen target site and flanking sequence are lost (occasionally, we recover mutations at the A of the TA cross-link site). The deletions extend at least through the splice acceptor site, the minimum required to inactivate the gene. Our earlier sequence analysis of the deletions suggested that most of these were derived from double strand breaks (14Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Google Scholar, 17Puri N. Majumdar A. Cuenoud B. Natt F. Martin P. Boyd A. Miller P.S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28991-28998Google Scholar). Deletions could be caused by successive cycles of incisions by excision repair enzymes or as a consequence of collisions with replication forks (53McHugh P.J. Sones W.R. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3425-3433Google Scholar). Whatever the molecular pathways for the deletions, they are exercised much less frequently than those producing point mutations. The recombinational repair pathway would not be operable in quiescent cells but would be available during the mid-S phase of our experiments as Hprt replicates early in S phase (54Riddle J.C. Hsie A.W. Mutat. Res. 1978; 52: 409-420Google Scholar, 55Subramanian P.S. Chinault A.C. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 97-109Google Scholar). The similar ratios of base substitution and deletion mutations (albeit at different frequencies) from G0/G1 and S phase cells may indicate that the same mutation pathways operate in both conditions. Alternatively, it is also possible that the mutant cells recovered from the G0/G1 cells were actually derived from a small number of S phase cells that escaped quiescence. Why the greater frequency of targeting in S phase? There would seem to be at least three possible explanations. One is that the G0/G1 cells are inefficiently electroporated relative to S phase cells. Our analysis of the electroporation efficiencies of the green fluorescent protein plasmid and the fluorescent oligonucleotides does not appear to support this contention. It is true that the physical presence of the fluorescent oligonucleotide in the nuclei of the G0/G1cells is not evidence of a functional presence. However, the green fluorescent protein plasmid results clearly reflect a functional, nuclear presence, and our experience has been that plasmid and oligonucleotide electroporation efficiencies are well correlated. A second possibility is that the stability of triplexes once formed is much greater in S phase cells than G0/G1 cells. We have shown that triplexes are less stable in cells than in “physiological buffer” in vitro, perhaps because of cellular enzymes that can disrupt triplexes (56Lin F.L. Majumdar A. Klotz L.C. Reszka A.P. Neidle S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39117-39124Google Scholar). These include helicases and the translocases found in chromatin-remodeling complexes (57Kopel V. Pozner A. Baran N. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 330-335Google Scholar, 58Brosh Jr., R.M. Mazumdar A. Desai S. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3024-3030Google Scholar, 59Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar). However, this suggestion is somewhat counterintuitive since we generally associate chromatin remodeling with gene activation andHprt gene expression is quite low in quiescent cells (60Steen A.M. Sahlen S. Lambert B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 77-85Google Scholar). A third possibility is that the levels of TFO binding reflect the accessibility of the target sequence. Triplex formation by 15–20 nucleotide TFOs on nucleosomal sequences is impeded by the requirement of the third strand to occupy the major groove, 8–10 base pairs of which would be exposed with the remainder turned against the histone core complex. In vitro studies indicate that nucleosomal sequences associated with the nucleosomal core are inaccessible to TFOs, whereas those at the ends or in internucleosomal linker regions are more available (20Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Martinez-Balbas A. Azorin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31807-31812Google Scholar, 21Brown P.M. Fox K.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 301-310Google Scholar, 22Brown P.M. Madden C.A. Fox K.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16139-16151Google Scholar, 61Westin L. Blomquist P. Milligan J.F. Wrange O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2184-2191Google Scholar). Although direct experiments have not been performed, one implication is that nucleosomal DNA whose association with the histone core has been relaxed by ATP-dependent remodeling (62Lorch Y. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 89-95Google Scholar, 63Gavin I. Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 97-104Google Scholar, 64Peterson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 319-322Google Scholar) or certain histone modifications (65Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar) would be more open for triplex formation. TheHprt gene is a member of a group of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes (including DHFR) whose expression is quite low in quiescent cells (60Steen A.M. Sahlen S. Lambert B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 77-85Google Scholar, 66Jiralerspong S. Patel P.I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 116-127Google Scholar). Transcript levels increase markedly upon growth stimulation and, in the case of DHFR, are dependent on E2F transcription factors (67Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Google Scholar). This family also includes repressors of E2F-dependent promoters, which are involved in silencing genes in quiescent cells via mechanisms that include alterations in histone modification and chromatin structure (68Rayman J.B. Takahashi Y. Indjeian V.B. Dannenberg J.H. Catchpole S. Watson R.J. te Riele H. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 933-947Google Scholar, 69Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Google Scholar). Assuming that these alterations extend to nucleosomes downstream of the promoter region, it may be that TFO bioactivity reflects the chromatin structural dynamics of theHprt target. The results presented here have practical significance. TFOs have been of interest for many years because of potential applications as gene-targeting reagents for manipulation of genomic sequences. TheHprt gene target has been instrumental in the development of bioactive TFOs because of the opportunity for facile and quantitative selection of cells with targeted events. However, most genes of interest do not have a selection option available for identification and analysis of cells with the desired end point. Thus, it will be important to develop protocols that permit recovery of clones of interest with a minimum of effort. The data presented here suggest that successful procedures will require effective oligonucleotide chemistry combined with manipulation of the cell biology. This will be an important consideration for gene targeting in hematopoietic stem cells, which are largely quiescent (70Zhang X.W. Audet J. Piret J.M. Li Y.X. Cell Prolif. 2001; 34: 321-330Google Scholar). We thank JiLan Liu and Nicholas McCollum for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2046546728,"Here we report on the identification of peptides targeting the X-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). XIAP functions as a caspase inhibitor and is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins. IAPs are often overexpressed in cancers and leukemias and are associated with an unfavorable clinical prognosis. We have selected peptides from a phage library by using recombinant full-length human XIAP or a fragment containing only the baculovirus IAP repeat 2 (BIR2) domain. A consensus motif, C(D/E/P)(W/F/Y)-acid/basic-XC, was recovered from two independent screenings by using different libraries. Phage-displaying variations of the consensus sequence bound specifically to the BIR2 domain of XIAP but not to other IAPs. The interaction was specific as it could be blocked by the cognate synthetic peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Phage displaying the XIAP-binding motif CEFESC bound to the BIR2 domain of XIAP with an estimated dissociation constant of 1.8 nm as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-7 (but not caspase-8) blocked the binding of the CEFESC phage to XIAP, indicating that this peptide targets a domain within XIAP that is related to the caspase-binding site. In fact, the sequence EFES is homologous to a loop unique to the executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 that are targeted by XIAP. Finally, we demonstrated that an internalizing version of the XIAP-binding peptide identified in our screenings (PFKQ) can induce programmed cell death in leukemia cells. Peptides interacting with XIAP could serve as prototypes for the design of low molecular weight modulators of apoptosis.

Phage-displaying variations of the consensus sequence bound specifically to the BIR2 domain of XIAP but not to other IAPs. The interaction was specific as it could be blocked by the cognate synthetic peptides in a dose-dependent manner. Phage displaying the XIAP-binding motif CEFESC bound to the BIR2 domain of XIAP with an estimated dissociation constant of 1.8 nm as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-7 (but not caspase-8) blocked the binding of the CEFESC phage to XIAP, indicating that this peptide targets a domain within XIAP that is related to the caspase-binding site. In fact, the sequence EFES is homologous to a loop unique to the executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 that are targeted by XIAP. Finally, we demonstrated that an internalizing version of the XIAP-binding peptide identified in our screenings (PFKQ) can induce programmed cell death in leukemia cells. Peptides interacting with XIAP could serve as prototypes for the design of low molecular weight modulators of apoptosis.

Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). We have performed mutagenesis-based studies to show that in the context of XIAP, the second of the three BIR domains (BIR2) is necessary and sufficient to inhibit the effector proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7 (10Takahashi R.

In contrast, for XIAP to suppress caspase-9, the third BIR domain is required (11Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H. Welsh K. Salvesen G. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a single BIR domain can mediate anti-apoptotic activity. To map functionally relevant interacting sites within molecules associating with XIAP, we screened peptide libraries using the full-length protein and on the isolated BIR2 domain. We identified XIAP ligands containing the motif CEFESC. This motif appears to mimic the XIAP-binding site within specific caspases because the binding of this peptide to XIAP is inhibited by preincubation with caspase-3 and caspase-7 but not by caspase 9. Binding assays using individual phage displaying this motif and a panel of purified targets confirmed that the phage interacts specifically with the BIR2 domain in a pattern consistent with caspase-type ligands. No binding was observed when BIR1, BIR3, or the RING finger domain of XIAP were tested nor when other IAP family members such as cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, and Survivin were evaluated under the same experimental conditions. We also show that XIAP-binding peptides can affect cell viability. Taken together, our results contribute to the understanding of the structural requirements and functional domains that are important in the regulation of programmed cell death. Cloning and synthesis of full-length XIAP and the XIAP fragments BIR1, BIR2, BIR3, BIR1–2, BIR2–3, and RING as well as full-length cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, and Survivin have been described previously (4Roy N.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar) and were a gift from Dr. G. Salvesen (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). fUSE5-based phage peptide libraries displaying either cyclic or linear random peptides (CX4C orX6; C = cysteine and X = random amino acid) were made and screened as described previously (13Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar, 14Koivunen E. Wang B. Dickinson C.D. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 346-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Polystyrene 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl/well of 1 mg/ml GST-XIAP fusion protein or GST fusion proteins of various fragments of XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, Survivin, BSA, or GST in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBS, blocked with 3% BSA (first round of panning), casein (second round), or γ-globulins (third round) for 1 h, and incubated with 1010 transducing units (TU) of the primary library for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed nine times in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20 to remove unbound phage and once with PBS. Bound phages were eluted by adding 200 μl of a log-phase K91Kan terrific broth culture and amplified overnight in 10 ml of LB medium containing 40 μg/ml tetracycline. Randomly selected phage clones from the third round of panning were sequenced as described previously (15Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Individual phage clones displaying similar peptide motifs were tested for specific binding to GST fusion proteins of XIAP, fragments of XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, Survivin, BSA, or GST alone. These binding assays were performed following the protocol of the initial screening. The number of bound phage was determined by plating serial dilutions of the recovered phage-bacteria mixture on LB agar plates containing 40 μg/ml tetracycline. Peptides were synthesized with an ACT-350 multiple peptide synthesizer by using Fmoc synthesis on Rink amide MBHA resin or Fmoc-Lys(-LC-d-Biotin)-Rink amide-MBHA resin for C-terminally biotinylated peptides. The peptides were cleaved with 92.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, 2.5% EDTA, and 2.5% TIS and precipitated with cold ethyl ether. Quantitative cyclization was achieved in 20% Me2SO, H2O, pH 4.0–7.0 in 1 day as described previously (16Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Crude peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse phase C-18 column with a gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptides showed one peak by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography, and the molecular weight was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Inhibition of phage binding to XIAP by recombinant caspases was assayed by coating polystyrene 96-well plates with 1 μg/well of recombinant XIAP protein (50 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution), various fragments of XIAP, or control proteins (as indicated) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed once with PBS, blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h, washed again, and incubated with various amounts of recombinant active caspases-3, -7, or -8 for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were then washed once with PBS, and XIAP-binding or control phage was added (108 TU/well) and incubated for 30 min. Wells were then washed nine times with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, and washed once more in PBS. Bound phage were eluted by adding 200 μl of a log-phase K91Kan terrific broth culture. The number of bound phage was determined as described above. The interaction of XIAP-binding phage and control phage with the BIR2 domain of XIAP was investigated using the BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). GST-BIR2 was covalently attached by its primary amine residues to CM5 sensor chips (17Xie Z. Schendel S. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Binding was detected in resonance units after injecting phage in a range of concentrations in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 0.15 m NaCl, 3.0 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20). After each run, the chip surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm glycine, pH 4.5. Non-linear regression analysis was used to determine equilibrium-binding constants that fit to a single site-binding model (18Kalinin N. Ward L. Winzor D. Anal.

Uptake of penetratin-linked peptides into OCI/AML-4 cells (an acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line, for review see Ref. 21Koinstinen P. Wang C. Yang G.S. Wang Y.F. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Minden M.D. McCulloch E.A. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar) was monitored as described previously (22Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells growing in 24-well plates were incubated with increasing doses (1–20 μm) of penetratin alone, synthetic peptides alone (CEFESC, CPFKQC, or ARGKER), or penetratin-linked versions of each peptide. Cell viability was assessed at different time points (12, 24, and 72 h). XIAP-binding peptides were identified by selecting phage display peptide libraries on immobilized human GST-XIAP. The libraries contained six amino acid inserts in which either all six residues were randomized or the first and last positions were fixed as cysteines to promote cyclization by disulfide bonding (X6 or CX4C libraries, respectively). The enrichment of phage on XIAP was monitored by counting the number of TU recovered from the XIAP-coated wells versus the number recovered from wells coated with the control protein. We observed a pronounced enrichment for phage binding to GST-XIAP (Fig. 1). The DNA inserts of 36 randomly chosen phage clones (18 from theX6 library and 18 from the CX4C library) recovered from the third round of biopanning on XIAP were sequenced. A total of 32 phage clones derived from both libraries displayed the consensus motif C-(E/D/P)-(aromatic amino acid = W/Y/F)-charged amino acid-(X = random)-C (Table I). In addition, marked enrichment was observed for phage displaying the motif (8 of 18 in the second round and 16 of 18 in the third round by using theX6 library). In contrast, biopanning experiments using the same libraries on other IAPs such as Survivin or on GST protein alone failed to select for phage with the above consensus motif, demonstrating the specificity of the selection process.Table ISequences of XIAP-binding peptidesCDWTHCCDWRVCCDWLTCCDWLTCCDWLTCCDWNQCCDFIMCCDWVFCCDFKACCDFVGCCEYKECCEENLCCEFLFCCEFFFCCEKFPCCEFAQCCEFAQCCEHYPCCEFESCCPFIRCCPFTECCPFDRCCPYRHCCPFMACCPFKECCPFHTCCPYKQCCPFKQCCPFAACCPYHECCPYRRCCPYRFCMotif:CD/E/PAromatic+/−XC Open table in a new tab The specificity of XIAP-binding phage was tested in individual phage-binding assays on immobilized GST-XIAP or GST fusion proteins of other members of the IAP family such as Survivin, cIAP1, cIAP2, and NAIP. Representative data are shown for two of the XIAP-binding phage displaying the CEFESC- or the CPFKQC-peptide. Controls were insertless fd-tet phage and phage-displaying ARGKER, an unrelated control insert. In these assays, both the CEFESC and CPFKQC phage bound to XIAP but not to the other IAP family members, BSA, or GST. Control phage did not bind to GST-XIAP, indicating specificity. These data confirm the specificity of phage clones displaying the consensus motif for XIAP binding (Fig. 2). We next mapped the domain within XIAP that mediates the binding of the isolated phage clones using a panel of XIAP deletion mutants expressed as GST fusion proteins. XIAP-binding phage bound to GST fusion proteins containing the BIR2 domain of XIAP alone or the BIR2 domain in combination with flanking domains. In contrast, fragments of XIAP containing only the BIR1, BIR3, or RING domains failed to adsorb XIAP-binding phage. The insertless fd-tet phage as well as the control ARGKER-phage did not bind to either GST-XIAP or GST-BIR2, indicating that the target proteins do not bind recombinant phage nonspecifically (Fig. 3). To further confirm that the peptides displayed on XIAP-binding phage interact with XIAP independently of other phage components, experiments were performed using synthetic peptides. Cyclic peptides corresponding to the sequences displayed by XIAP-binding phage clones were synthesized and tested for their ability to specifically inhibit phage binding to GST-XIAP and GST-BIR2. The cyclic peptides but not the irrelevant control peptides inhibited phage binding of the corresponding phage clones in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Non-cyclic versions of the same peptides failed to prevent phage binding. To further characterize the interaction of XIAP-binding phage with the BIR2 domain, we used surface plasmon resonance. The BIR2 domain of XIAP was conjugated to the chip surface (solid phase) and phage displaying a XIAP-binding peptide were used as an analyte (mobile phase). A variety of concentrations of phage displaying CEFESC, CPFKQC, or CDFKAC were injected, and the CEFESC-phage clone was the strongest binder of the three phages analyzed (Fig. 5). This phage bound to BIR2 with an estimated ka of 4.9 × 105m−1s−1. Upon switching to phage-free flow solution, a very slow dissociation of phage from the chip surface was observed with an approximatekd of 8.6 × 10−4. AKD of 1.8 nm was estimated for binding of the CEFESC-phage to BIR2 as compared with a KD of >10 μm for either insertless fd-tet phage or phage displaying a control peptide-ARGKER. Because the BIR2 domain of XIAP has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for binding caspases-3 and -7 (10Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we asked whether these caspases compete with XIAP-binding phage for binding to XIAP. GST-BIR2 or various GST control proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with XIAP-binding CEFESC-phage in the presence or absence of recombinant caspase-3 or -7. Recombinant caspase-8 was used as a control because it does not bind XIAP (3Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The binding of CEFESC-phage to BIR2 was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner upon the addition of caspase-7 or caspase-3. In contrast, neither BSA nor caspase-8 blocked the binding of CEFESC-phage to XIAP (Fig. 6). These data suggest that phage displaying the CEFESC-peptide occupy sites on the BIR2 domain that overlap with or are adjacent to sites involved in caspase binding. To determine whether the XIAP-targeting peptides could affect cell viability, we designed and synthesized internalizing versions of the CEFESC-, CPFKQC-, or ARGKER-peptides (negative control) by using the penetratin system for intracellular delivery. Penetratin (Pen) is a peptide containing 16 amino acids that is part of the third helix of the antennapedia protein homeodomain (22Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because penetratin has translocating properties, it is capable of carrying hydrophilic compounds across the plasma membrane and delivering them directly to the cytoplasm without degradation (22Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We fused the XIAP-binding peptides or a control unrelated peptide to penetratin and added a biotin moiety to visualize internalization. We used leukemia cells (OCI/AML-4) as a model system to test the effect of the internalizing peptides because these cells (i) express XIAP and caspases and (ii) respond to regulators of apoptosis (21Koinstinen P. Wang C. Yang G.S. Wang Y.F. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Minden M.D. McCulloch E.A. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). Pen-linked peptides were internalized and remained in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Penetratin alone was also internalized and uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. Peptides lacking penetratin were not internalized (data not shown). We evaluated cell survival in the cells exposed, internalizing versions of the XIAP-binding peptides. After a 72-h incubation, reduced cell viability was observed in cells treated with Pen-CPFKQC (Fig.7). No cell death was observed when cells were untreated, treated with penetratin alone, or treated with an unrelated control peptide fused to penetratin. Moreover, incubation with non-internalizing versions of each synthetic peptide had no effect (Fig. 7). IAPs are overexpressed in a variety of cancers and leukemias, and antagonistic small molecules could be useful for modifying the antiapoptotic activity of XIAP in vivo. In this study, we screened phage-display peptide libraries in search of short peptide motifs capable of binding this caspase-inhibitory protein. An analysis of the peptides displayed by phage binding to XIAP revealed a consensus sequence in which position 1 is invariably a cysteine, position 2 is either an acidic residue (aspartic acid or glutamic acid) or a proline, and position 3 is usually an aromatic amino acid (tryptophan, phenylalanine, or tyrosine) followed by two variable amino acids and finally a cysteine. Although position 4 was variable among the XIAP-binding phage randomly sequenced, the most highly represented types of amino acids at position 4 were charged (lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid in 13 of 32 cases). The binding of these phage to XIAP was highly selective with no evidence of significant interactions with other members of the IAP family of proteins such as cIAP1, cIAP2, NAIP, or Survivin. Thus, the XIAP-binding phage recognize a binding site unique to XIAP, which may be exploitable for applications aimed either at detecting XIAP or selectively inhibiting XIAP function. We showed that the isolated peptides bind to the BIR2 domain of XIAP. The specificity of the motif for BIR2 was confirmed independently by repeating library screenings using GST-BIR2 as a target, resulting in the selection of phage whose inserts shared the same consensus sequence, which was obtained originally using GST full-length XIAP. Interactions of these peptide motifs with BIR2 are biologically relevant, because our previous studies indicate that the BIR2 domain is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting caspases-3 and -7 (10Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Functional studies using the cyclic XIAP-binding peptides show that these probes do not act as repressors of XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition. We also show that an internalizing version of the XIAP-binding peptide identified in our screenings (PFKQ) can induce programmed cell death in leukemia cells in a specific, dose-dependent, and time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that development of peptidomimetics following affinity maturation strategies to increase binding affinity may lead to tools that can be used as modulators of programmed cell death. During programmed cell death, effector caspase zymogens are cleaved at conserved aspartic acid residues, generating large and small subunits, which together constitute the active protease. The activation of effector caspases such as caspases-3 and -7 is a nearly universal event associated with apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli. Our previous observation that XIAP and other IAP family proteins directly bind active executioner caspases-3 and -7, resulting in their potent suppression in vitro and in cultured cells (3Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 4Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takashashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), suggests a general mechanism for IAP-mediated apoptosis inhibition. Recently, a naturally occurring IAP inhibitor termed Smac/DIABLO has been identified (23Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 24Hegde R. Srinivasula S. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Smac performs a critical function in apoptosis by eliminating the inhibitory effect of IAPs on caspases. Smac promotes not only the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 but also the enzymatic activity of mature caspase-3, both of which depend upon the ability of Smac to interact physically with IAPs. A seven-residue peptide derived from the N terminus of Smac promotes procaspase-3 activation in vitro (23Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequence of this peptide is different from our sequences, identification of Smac and Omi provides further evidence that inhibition of IAPs by peptides represents a viable approach to induction of apoptosis in mammalian cells. Interestingly, the sequence EFES, which is embedded in one of the XIAP-binding phage in a cyclic context (CEFESC), occurs in caspase-3, a protease that binds to BIR2 of XIAP with a KD≤5 nm (10Takahashi R.

This sequence is located in the 381-loop of caspase-3 in a region only found in caspases-3 and -7. Because this loop is important in the binding of BIR2 to caspases-3 and -7 (5Riedl S.J. Renatus M.

Sci. 2002; 27: 94-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), one might speculate that the EFES-containing peptide corresponds to an important region within the caspase-3-XIAP interacting site. In fact, the recently reported x-ray crystallographic structure of the XIAP-BIR2 domain/caspases-3 and -7 complex shows that the substrate-binding pocket within these caspases is formed by four surface loops, L1, L2, L3, and L4 (5Riedl S.J.

The sequence EFES is exposed for binding within the 381-loop, and the second Glu residue in the sequence corresponds to an interaction site between caspase-3 and BIR2 (5Riedl S.J. Renatus M.

This observation underscores the power of phage display technology for the mapping for biologically relevant protein-interacting sites. Although XIAP is widely expressed, abnormally high levels of XIAP have been observed in certain types of leukemias and solid tumors (28Tamm I. Kornblau S.M. Segall H. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Scudiero D.A. Tudor G. Myers T. Qui Y.H. Monks A. Sausville E. Andreeff M. Reed J.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1796-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of XIAP has also been shown to render tumor cells more resistant to apoptosis induction by anti-cancer drugs in vitro (2LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Thus, agents that interfere with XIAP activity may be useful to treat cancers. The phage-derived peptides described here could provide a starting point for the generation of small molecule compounds that bind to and inhibit XIAP, thereby providing a new approach to the treatment of malignancies.

To determine the relative importance of each module for recognition of gelatin, recombinant green fluorescent fusion proteins were prepared in which individual modules or groups of modules were deleted, and the resulting proteins were tested for binding to gelatin by analytical affinity chromatography. Deletion of both type II modules did not eliminate binding, confirming that at least some of the type I modules in this region are able to bind gelatin. It was found that deletion of type I module 6 tends to increase the affinity, whereas deletion of any other module decreases it. Deletion of module I9 had a large effect but only if module II2 was also present, suggesting an interaction between these two noncontiguous modules. Analysis of more than 20 recombinant fusion products led to the conclusion that all modules contribute to the interaction either directly by contacting the ligand or indirectly through module-module interactions.

It interacts with a variety of other macromolecules including integrin receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, fibrin, tenascin, and several types of denatured collagens (gelatins). Here we focus on the interaction with gelatin. The gelatin-binding sites of fibronectin are confined to a region having four type I and two type II modules in the following order: I6-II1-II2-I7-I8-I9(Fig. 1). This region can be isolated as a 42-kDa fragment (42-kDa GBF)1 that binds to gelatin with affinity only slightly lower than that of the parent protein (1Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Isaacs B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4624-4628Google Scholar). Fragments outside this region including an amino-terminal 29-kDa fragment (type I modules 1 through 5) and a carboxyl-terminal 19-kDa fragment (type I modules 10 through 12) do not bind gelatin. The 42-kDa fragment contains the only type II modules in fibronectin, modules that are thought to play a role in binding to gelatin not only in fibronectin but in other gelatin-binding proteins (especially some matrix metalloproteinases where type II modules are also found) (2Banyai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 403-407Google Scholar). However, the 42-kDa GBF can be further cleaved into two non-overlapping subfragments, I6-II1-II2-I7 and I8-I9, both of which also bind gelatin, albeit with ∼10-fold lower affinity than the parent fragment (3Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16977-16980Google Scholar). This suggests that type II modules are not essential for binding of fibronectin to gelatin, although they may contribute, and that some type I modules can bind. It was recently reported that a recombinant two-module fragment, II1-II2, bound weakly to gelatin but that the affinity was about 5-fold higher in a three-module fragment, I6-II1-II2(4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar). The latter fragment was shown in the same study to have a hairpin-like structure in which module I6 interacts strongly with II2 despite the intervening II1. This highlights the fact that affinity for gelatin may be affected not only by the presence of a given module but by the interaction of that module with neighboring modules. In the present study we have prepared a large number of recombinant fragments in which one or more modules have been deleted from 42-kDa GBF to further understand the importance of all the modules for binding to gelatin. We have shown that modules II2 and I9 are most critical for binding but that all six modules contribute directly or indirectly to the binding site. Polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was purchased from Clontech.Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells adapted to grow in serum-free medium Sf900-II were obtained from Invitrogen. Swine skin gelatin (type I) was from Sigma. The 42-, 30-, and 21-kDa gelatin-binding fragments were purified from a thermolysin digest of human plasma fibronectin as described previously (5Litvinovich S. Strickland D. Medved L. Ingham K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 563-575Google Scholar). A vector (pENTR11-MHG) encoding a secretion signal, His6 tag, and GFP tag at the amino terminus was described previously (6Katagiri Y. Ingham K.C. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 24-26Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the gelatin-binding domain of rat fibronectin and its variants were amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) followed byBamHI-HindIII digestion and then subcloned intoBglII-HindIII sites of pENTR11-MHG. The primers used for amplification are given in TableI where amino acids are numbered from the amino terminus (pyroglutamic acid) of the processed fibronectin.

A bacterial strain (DH10Bac) was transformed with recombinant plasmids, and colonies containing recombinant bacmids were grown for isolation of the resulting viral DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants of transfected Sf9 cells were used to infect more Sf9 cells through two or three stages of amplification. Sf9 cells (2 × 108) were then infected with recombinant viruses, and supernatants were harvested 48 or 72 h after infection. Recombinant GFP-fibronectin fragments were purified on Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech), eluting with 150 mm imidazole, and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The identity of each fragment was verified by detection of the appropriate viral DNA in the infected cells with PCR and by the apparent molecular weight of the purified protein on SDS-PAGE. Yields varied between 0.5 and 1.2 mg/100 ml of culture supernatant. Analytical affinity chromatography was performed as described previously using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) (7Isaacs B.S. Brew S.A. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 842-850Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant protein was injected onto a gelatin-Sepharose column equilibrated with PBS and pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing, a linear gradient of urea (0–6 m) was applied between 10 and 30 min, and the bound GFP fusion proteins were detected with a fluorescence monitor (Shimadzu Model RF535). In some experiments, unbound and bound fractions were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibody (8Katagiri Y. Hirata Y. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31278-31284Google Scholar). The variable amount of unbound green fluorescence in the analytical runs is due to varying degrees of proteolytic cleavage at the flexible linker between GFP and the GBFs during handling and/or storage of the samples. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates were coated with 10 ॖg/ml gelatin in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing and blocking with 17 bovine serum albumin in PBS, the plates were incubated with various concentrations of recombinant proteins for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with 0.27 bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 40 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, plates were developed with peroxidase substrate. Absorbance was measured with a Dynatec plate reader, andC507 values were obtained by fitting the data to a simple binding isotherm using Sigmaplot. Since each of the six modules in the 42-kDa gelatin-binding fragment of fibronectin has a unique number, 6, 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, those numbers are used as a shorthand notation to specify the modular composition of the various mutants, and dashes (-) are used to designate deletions. Various combinations of these modules were expressed as fusion proteins with enhanced GFP using a baculovirus expression system. Initially we used gelatin-Sepharose in conjunction with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to assess binding. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2 where it can be seen that the pair of type II modules alone does not bind to gelatin-Sepharose, whereas a fragment containing type I modules 7, 8, and 9 does bind. These data suggest that type II modules alone are neither sufficient nor essential for binding to gelatin and that at least some type I modules are able to bind without the help of type II modules. Analytical affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose was used to rank the relative affinities of the various fusion proteins using green fluorescence to monitor elution in a urea gradient. The results for all products are presented in Fig.3, where panel Arefers to the wild type fusion protein, designated 612789. Its peak elution occurs at 3.3 m urea, very close to that observed with natural 42-kDa GBF as reported previously (6Katagiri Y. Ingham K.C. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 24-26Google Scholar). This elution profile is reproduced as a dotted line in all other panels for easy comparison. Except for those panels where no peak is evident, the profiles have been normalized to give the same amplitude at their peak elution. The urea concentrations at peak elution are summarized in Table II.Table IISummary of binding parameters for green GBFsTrace (Fig. 3)Fragment[Urea] at peak elution from gelatin-SepharoseC507 by ELISAॖmA6127893.30.25–0.69B-127893.70.27–0.62C6-27892.30.49–1.2D61-7892.60.73–1.8E612-893.00.79–0.81F6127-92.350.51–0.61G61278-2.151.4–2.5H6127–2.153.2–4.7I612—No binding322-aValues correspond to Kd values reported by Pickford et al.

Column 4 presents the range ofC507 values obtained in at least two independent ELISA experiments. The next six panels, B through G, in Fig.3 show results for all single module deletions from amino to carboxyl terminus, respectively. Although none of these deletions abolishes binding, all of them have a measurable effect on the elution position. Interestingly removal of module 6 actually increases the concentration of urea required for elution to about 3.7 m (panel B). The other deletions shift the elution to lower urea in varying degrees with loss of module 7 having the smallest effect and module 9 having the largest. These results alone lead to the conclusion that all six modules play a role, directly or indirectly, in binding to gelatin. Panels G, H, and I of Fig. 3 show the effects of successive deletions from the carboxyl-terminal end. Once module 9 has been removed, further deletion of module 8 has very little effect as if its only role is to tether 9 in the appropriate position. Further deletion of module 7 yields a three-module fragment, 612—, which fails to bind to gelatin-Sepharose, although slight retardation is evident. This lack of binding of 612— was confirmed in a separate experiment using an immunoblotting approach like that in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Panels J, K, and L of Fig.3 represent successive deletions of modules from the amino-terminal end. As noted above, deletion of module 6 increases the affinity (panel J is identical to panel B). Further deletion of module 1 seems to reverse the effects of deleting module 6 so that the elution of the four-module fragment –2789 is indistinguishable from that of the full-length fragment. The next deletion produces the three-module fragment —789, which despite its lack of type II modules is able to bind (as in Fig. 2), albeit with lower affinity than –2789. This proves again that type II modules are not essential for binding of fibronectin to gelatin, although the second one has some effect. Fig. 3, panel M, shows the results for a four-module fragment lacking both terminal type I modules 6 and 9. It was shown above (panel G) that deletion of module 9 causes the largest decrease in affinity of any single module deletion, while deletion of module 6 (panel B) caused an increase in affinity. Here it is seen that the enhancing effect of deleting module 6 also occurs upon its removal from 61278-, shifting the peak elution from 2.15 to 2.45m urea and partially compensating for the effect of removing module 9. Deletion of either terminal module 1 or 8 from -1278- had very little further effect (Fig. 3, panels N and O), but deletion of both to produce the bimodular fragment –27– (panel P) caused a noticeable weakening with substantial amounts of protein bleeding from the column during the wash phase prior to application of the urea gradient. Module 7 binds slightly better when partnered with module 8 (panel R) than with module 2 (panel P). Panel Q shows that a lone pair of type II modules (-12—) does not bind tightly enough to survive the wash phase, consistent with its absence in the sixth lane of Fig.2. However, deletion of this type II pair from the full-length fragment to yield 6–789 significantly lowers the affinity (panel S). Fragment –2789 is the only four-module fragment that binds with full affinity. Removal of either of its terminal modules substantially lowers that affinity by a similar amount (Fig. 3, panels K,L, and N). However, deletion of the interior modules 7 and 8 from –2789 generates a bimodular fragment containing only 2 and 9, which failed to bind with significant affinity although retardation was evident (panel T). If modules 7 and 8 in either –2789 or in the full-length fragment are replaced by homologous modules 4 and 5 from outside the gelatin-binding region, the binding is essentially abolished (panels U andV). The effect of deleting modules 7 and 8 from the full-length fragment (panel W) is much less severe than replacing them with modules 4 and 5. That modules 7 and 8 serve more than a spacer function is evident from the fact that they can bind independently as a pair (panel R). From the foregoing results it is apparent that all six modules in the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin play a role in ligand recognition, either directly through contact with gelatin or indirectly by influencing neighboring modules. ELISA analysis was used as an alternative measure of the affinity of some of the fusion proteins for gelatin. Plastic microtiter wells were coated with gelatin and incubated with increasing concentrations of the fusion protein, and binding was detected immunologically with antibody to GFP. Representative data are shown in Fig.4. The concentrations required for half-saturation (C507) in this and other experiments not shown varied between 0.2 and ∼5 ॖm as summarized in Table II. The range of values ofC507 obtained for the full-length fragment is in good agreement with Kd values between 0.6 and 1.2 ॖm determined previously in the fluid phase (Ref. 3Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16977-16980Google Scholar and references therein). In Fig. 5, the values of C507 are plotted against the urea concentration required for peak elution. Despite considerable scatter in the data, there is a reasonable correlation. Most of the scatter can be attributed to uncertainties in the C507values determined by ELISA, which is not the optimum method for weak interactions. The affinity chromatography results, although only qualitative, are quite reproducible and thus provide a more reliable determination of the rank order of affinities.Figure 5Correlation betweenC507 values obtained by ELISA and the concentrations of urea required for peak elution of the fusion proteins from gelatin-Sepharose as in Fig. 3.

Note how module 6 stands out from the others in that its deletion consistently enhances binding, whereas most of the others, especially 1 and 9, have a weakening effect when deleted. The results presented here indicate that recognition of gelatin is a robust property of fibronectin. Any one of the six modules within the 42-kDa gelatin-binding domain (612789) can be deleted without abrogation of binding. At the same time, all six modules appear to play some role since each of their deletions has a measurable effect on affinity. Thus the situation is more complicated than is often found with domain deletion experiments of this type. For example, the fact that fragment –2789 binds with the same affinity as the full-length fragment would suggest that modules 6 and 1 are not important. But this conclusion is rendered invalid by the observation that removal of 6 alone actually increases the affinity, while removal of 2 alone decreases it by a similar degree. When both are removed the effects appear to compensate. There are two ways in which a given module might contribute to the interaction with gelatin. The first is direct, i.e. the module engages the ligand, and the other is indirect, i.e.the module interacts with and affects the conformation or disposition of neighboring modules that actually make contact. Some modules could operate at both of these levels. The three-dimensional structure of the trimodular fragment I6II1II2 (Fig.1) shows that modules need not be contiguous to engage in such interactions; I6 forms an extensive interface with II2 despite the intervening II1 (4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of II2 in that structure is located such that the following module, I7, could also interact with I6 as was inferred from earlier observations that the thermal stability of I6 was greater in fragments where I7 was present (5Litvinovich S. Strickland D. Medved L. Ingham K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 563-575Google Scholar). Thus, there is reason to suspect that the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin is folded back upon itself providing numerous opportunities for interactions between noncontiguous modules such that the deletion of any one of them could perturb the overall arrangement of the others. Additional evidence for long range interaction between modules comes from examination of the effect of deleting module 9. As shown in Fig.6, deletion of this module from 612789, -12789, or –2789 consistently reduces the affinity for gelatin by a similar amount; the Δ[urea] values vary between −1.1 and −1.25 m (Fig.6). The fact that this effect is lost in fragment —789 could suggest some type of interaction between modules 2 and 9 that is important for binding. It should also be mentioned that deletion of modules could allow new interactions between other modules. For example, a weak interaction between modules 1 and 2 that was observed in the isolated pair (9Bocquier A.A. Potts J.R. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Structure. 1999; 7: 1451-1460Google Scholar) was not present in a larger fragment that also contained module 6 (4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar). Replacement of type I modules 7 and 8 with type I modules 4 and 5 from the amino-terminal region abolishes binding both in the full-length fragment and in –2789. This is consistent with modules 7 and 8 serving as more than mere spacers as further evidenced by the fact that the pair alone is able to bind even better than the pair of type II modules. Modules 4 and 5 constitute a rigid pair with an extensive interface (10Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L.I. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Google Scholar). Whether a similar interaction exists between modules 7 and 8 remains to be determined. There is no such interaction between type I modules 1 and 2 in the fib-1 region of fibronectin (11Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Google Scholar). If the connection between modules 7 and 8 is flexible, then replacing them with modules 4 and 5 may introduce constraints that prevent other interactions that are important for the overall structure and for binding. This is consistent with the fact that simply deleting modules 7 and 8 had less effect than replacing them with 4 and 5. Module 6 stands out as the only one whose deletion actually enhances binding (Fig. 6). Note, however, that the enhancing effect is greatly diminished in fragments that lack module 2. This suggests that the above-mentioned interaction between modules 2 and 6, which is well documented in the known structure of 612 (Fig. 1), imposes a constraint on the overall structure that slightly impedes the interaction with gelatin. This is opposite to what was reported by the group who determined that structure. Pickford et al. (4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar) reported that both 612— and -12— bound to gelatin-Sepharose and provided evidence from surface plasmon resonance measurements to suggest that removal of module 6 from 612— increased the affinity toward immobilized α(1) chain of human type I collagen ∼10-fold. The discrepancy could relate to the different species of collagen and fibronectin used in the two studies. 2We routinely use swine skin gelatin for affinity chromatography, and the recombinant fragments used in the current study were encoded by cDNA from rat fibronectin. The full-length fragment behaves identically to natural 42-kDa GBF derived from human plasma fibronectin. The species of gelatin used by Pickfordet al. (4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar) was not specified. We also find that the affinity of the 42-kDa GBF for α chains and CNBr fragments of bovine type I collagen (Ref. 12Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 217-223Google Scholar and Y. Katagiri, S. A. Brew, and K. C. Ingham, unpublished results) is significantly lower than for those from rat tail collagen (1Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Isaacs B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4624-4628Google Scholar). TheKd values that were estimated from limited SPR data by Pickford et al. (4Pickford A.R. Smith S.P. Staunton D. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1519-1529Google Scholar) are designated by +symbols in our Fig. 5. Their position on the urea axis would be consistent with the failure of our corresponding fragments, if they had similar affinities, to bind to our gelatin-Sepharose. A recent report from this laboratory highlighted the fact that each of the α chains in type I collagen contains multiple sites with similar affinity for 42-kDa GBF (12Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 217-223Google Scholar). The nature of those sites remains unclear. Since it is denatured collagen, i.e. gelatin, that is recognized by fibronectin, it is assumed that what is being recognized is some linear sequence as opposed to a well defined tertiary structure. As of yet the relevant sequence has not been defined, i.e. there is no synthetic collagen-like peptide that has been shown to bind fibronectin with significant affinity. It is not even certain whether the various active subfragments of 42-kDa GBF, such as those described here, are all recognizing the same sequence in gelatin. It is conceivable that neighboring sequences of the collagen chains interact with different parts of 42-kDa GBF. This would provide additional opportunities for module-module interactions to play a role in defining the binding site. The present analysis of more than 20 recombinant fusion products clearly illustrates that all six modules in 42-kDa GBF contribute to its interaction with gelatin either directly by contacting the ligand or indirectly through module-module interactions. Determining which is which will probably require a high resolution structure of a complex between GBF and an appropriate segment of gelatin."
https://openalex.org/W2004638925,"The Ras-GRF1 exchange factor, which is regulated by increases in intracellular calcium and the release of G beta gamma subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins, plays a critical role in the activation of neuronal Ras. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors stimulates an increase in the phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 at certain serine residues. The first of these sites to be identified, Ser(916) in the mouse sequence (equivalent to Ser(898) in the rat sequence), is required for full activation of the Ras exchange factor activity of Ras-GRF1 by muscarinic receptors. We demonstrate here that Ras-GRF1 is highly expressed in rat brain compared with the Sos exchange factor and that there is an increase in incorporation of (32)P into Ser(898) of brain Ras-GRF1 following activation of protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 at Ser(916) is also required for maximal induction of Ras-dependent neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. A novel antibody (termed 2152) that selectively recognizes Ras-GRF1 when it is phosphorylated at Ser(916/898) confirmed the regulated phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 by Western blotting in both model systems of transfected COS-7 and PC12 cells and also of the endogenous protein in rat forebrain slices. Indirect confocal immunofluorescence of transfected PC12 cells using antibody 2152 demonstrated reactivity only under conditions in which Ras-GRF1 was phosphorylated at Ser(916/898). Confocal immunofluorescence of cortical slices of rat brain revealed widespread and selective phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 at Ser(898). In the prefrontal cortex, there was striking phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 in the dendritic tree, supporting a role for Ras activation and signal transduction in neurotransmission in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2013325586,"We have isolated six novel galectin cDNAs from a Xenopus laevis kidney cDNA library. The newly identified X. laevisgalectins (xgalectins) comprise one proto type (xgalectin-Vb), one chimera type (xgalectin-VIIa), and four tandem repeat types (xgalectin-IIb, -IIIb, -VIa, and -VIIIa). Thus, together with those mentioned in our previous work (Shoji, H., Nishi, N., Hirashima, M., and Nakamura, T. (2002) Glycobiology 12, 163–172), the 12 xgalectins are classified into three types based on their domain structures, as in mammals. The xgalectins whose counterparts in other species have not been identified (xgalectin-IVa, -Vb, and -VIa) were confirmed to possess lactose-binding activity by expression of their recombinant forms. This shows that they truly function as animal lectins. The protein purification study revealed that the major xgalectins in kidney are xgalectin-Ib, -IIa, -IIb, -IIIa, and -VIIa. The mRNAs of xgalectin-IIb, -IIIb, -Vb, and -VIa were localized to specific adult tissues, whereas those of xgalectin-VIIa and -VIIIa were broadly distributed. The temporal expression patterns of the mRNAs of the 12 xgalectins during embryogenesis were analyzed and categorized into three groups: 1) mRNA observed to exist throughout embryogenesis, i.e. maternal mRNA also exists (xgalectin-Ia, -IIa, -IIIa, -IIIb, -Va, -VIIa, and -VIIIa); 2) mRNA observed from the gastrula stage (xgalectin-VIa); and 3) mRNA observed from the tail bud or the tadpole stage (xgalectin-Ib, -IIb, -IVa, and -Vb). The mRNA of the most abundant xgalectin in embryos, xgalectin-VIIa, was localized to the surface layer of embryos, the epidermis, the cement gland, and various placodes. Xgalectin-VIIa protein was also observed to exist throughout embryogenesis by Western blot analysis with specific antiserum. These results show that the expression of each member is spatiotemporally regulated from eggs to adulthood, suggesting that galectins play multiple roles not only in adults, but also in development.

Fourteen galectins have been isolated from mammals and are classified into the proto, chimera, and tandem repeat types based on their structures (3Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem.

Proto-type galectins contain one carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD),1 a structurally conserved domain that specifically recognizes a ॆ-galactoside-containing carbohydrate; and chimera-type galectins consist of one CRD and an N-terminal elongating protein domain. Mammalian galectin-1 (proto type) and -3 (chimera type) are the most extensively studied galectins (9Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Google Scholar). They have been proposed to play roles in tissue organization, development, immunity, and cancer growth and metastasis by regulating such processes as cell adhesion and apoptosis. Tandem repeat-type galectins contain two CRDs covalently linked through a unique link peptide. Tandem repeat-type galectins are less well understood, but they have been shown to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner in adult animals as well as in mouse embryos. Also, our recent studies revealed that they play roles in immunity,e.g. the chemoattractant activity of galectin-9 for eosinophils (10Matsumoto R. Matsumoto H. Seki M. Hata M. Asano Y. Kanegasaki S.

Nakamura, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the galectin family seems to be significantly associated with development, immunity, and tumorigenesis, but the details of their functional mechanisms remain unclear. Studies have been recently accumulating that indicate that the galectin family play roles in the development of vertebrate embryos. The expression of some members is temporally and spatially regulated during embryogenesis (13Poirier F. Timmons P.M. Chan C.T. Guenet J.L. Rigby P.W.

Milos N.C. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 1996; 16: 74-93Google Scholar, 25Frunchak Y.N. Martha G.N. McFadden K.D. Milos N.C. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 299-316Google Scholar) have extensively studied the endogenous ॆ-galactoside-binding lectins inXenopus embryos and have proposed that these lectins are important for the development of neural crest cells, craniofacial tissue, and heart, etc. Although the identity of these ॆ-galactoside-binding lectins has not yet been determined, they are very likely to be members of the galectin family. Our purpose is to clarify the functions of the galectin family in animal development using the Xenopus system. However, when we started this project, only one proto-type galectin had been identified in Xenopus (26Marschal P. Herrmann J. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12942-12949Google Scholar). Therefore, in a previous work (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar), we reported the isolation and characterization of five novel galectins from Xenopus liver, which seemed to be the most suitable organ for identifying novel galectins. In this study, we choseXenopus kidneys to further identify novel galectins because they contain large amounts of tandem repeat-type galectins, including other protein(s) that are absent in the liver (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). We successfully identified six novel galectins, with all three types, i.e.the proto, chimera, and tandem repeat types, being represented. We have comprehensively analyzed the expression of all the xgalectins identified so far and have demonstrated that they are specifically regulated throughout, from eggs to adulthood. Female frogs were used for the protein purification study and expression analysis of adult tissues, except for testis. To obtain embryos, mature eggs were collected after injection of 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (GONATROPIN®, Teikokuzouki, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) into females.In vitro fertilized eggs were dejellied with 37l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in Steinberg's solution and then cultured at 20 °C. Albino embryos were used only for whole-mount in situhybridization. Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (28Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone (1080-bp insert) of xgalectin-IIb was isolated by screening aXenopus kidney λ cDNA library (Stratagene) using a cDNA fragment of xgalectin-IIa (nucleotides 1–786, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB060970) as a probe. Partial cDNA clones of xgalectin-IIIb were isolated by screening the kidney library using a cDNA fragment of xgalectin-IIIa (nucleotides 26–452; accession number AB060971) as a probe. Because all the clones lacked the 5′-region (even the clone with the longest insert lacked nucleotides 1–77), 5′-RACE-PCR was performed with a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) and kidney mRNA. A specific primer with the following sequence was used: 5′-ATTCGGTGATGGTATTCCAAGTAA-3′. As a result, a cDNA fragment of 422 bp covering the entire 5′-region of xgalectin-IIIb was obtained. The full-length sequence (2000 bp) of xgalectin-IIIb was reconstructed by combining the sequence of the 5′-RACE-PCR product and that of the clone with the longest insert. A partial cDNA fragment of xgalectin-Vb was isolated by degenerate oligonucleotide-based PCR cloning as described (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). A sense primer (Gd4, 5′-CACTTYAAYCCNCGNTTY-3′) (where Y = T or C and N = G or A, or T or C) corresponding to highly conserved amino acids in members of the galectin family, HNFPRF, and an antisense primer (Gd7, 5′-TTCTTTNCCRTCNGGNA-3′) (where R = G or A) corresponding to the amino acid sequence of Xenopus skin 16-kDa galectin/xgalectin-Va (26Marschal P. Herrmann J. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12942-12949Google Scholar), LPDGKE, were used for amplification from kidney mRNA. The resultant cDNA fragment (183 bp) was used as a probe to screen the kidney library, and a full-length clone (583 bp) was isolated. A cDNA clone of xgalectin-VIa was isolated in the same way. First, sense primer Gd4 and another antisense primer (Gd9, 5′-CATATGYTGNCCRTTNAC-3′) corresponding to the amino acid sequence of mouse galectin-9 (29Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6078-6086Google Scholar), VNGQHM, were used, and a partial cDNA fragment of xgalectin-VIa (177 bp) was isolated from mRNA of whole embryos (tail bud stage). The resultant cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen the kidney library, and a full-length clone (1427 bp) was isolated. Although the mRNA of xgalectin-VIa was under the detectable level in kidney by Northern analysis, we observed weak expression by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis (data not shown). To isolate xgalectin-VIIa and -VIIIa, we utilized expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence data from the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession numbers AW765695 for xgalectin-VIIa and AW782523 for xgalectin-VIIIa). We generated specific primers to amplify partial cDNAs (nucleotides 28–578 of AW765695 and 1–486 of AW782523) by RT-PCR according to the sequence data. The cDNA fragments obtained from kidney total RNA were used as probes to screen the kidney cDNA library. Full-length clones of xgalectin-VIIa (1074 bp) and xgalectin-VIIIa (1456 bp) were isolated. The details of the library screening and DNA sequencing methods are given in our previous report (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). Recombinant xgalectin-IVa, -Vb, and -VIa proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) using the GST fusion system (Amersham Biosciences). Each cDNA encoding an open reading frame was inserted into pGEX-4T, and the expression plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coliBL21. Expression of fusion proteins was carried out as described in our previous work (11Matsushita N. Nishi N. Seki M. Matsumoto R. Kuwabara I. Liu F. Hata Y. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8355-8360Google Scholar). The extracted recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a lactosyl-agarose column (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo). The proteins bound to the lactosyl-agarose were eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 mm lactose and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purification of xgalectins and amino acid sequence analysis were performed as described in our previous work (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus kidneys obtained from adult females were homogenized in a 5-fold volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdiisopropylphosphofluoridate, and the homogenate was centrifuged. 0.1 volume of 4 m NaCl (final concentration of ∼0.5m) and 0.01 volume of 17 CHAPS (Sigma) were added to the supernatant recovered, and then the mixture was further centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was directly applied to a lactosyl-agarose column (2 ml) and washed extensively with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.017 CHAPS and then with the same buffer, except the NaCl concentration was 0.15 m. Proteins adsorbed to the affinity resin were eluted with buffer containing 200 mm lactose. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The protein mixture eluted from the lactosyl-agarose resin was separated into two fractions by anion-exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through (30–36-kDa proteins) and adsorbed (14-kDa proteins) fractions were separately pooled to examine the amino acid sequence. The 14- and 30–36-kDa kidney xgalectins were treated with 17 SDS and 207 methanol and then directly dot-blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blotted proteins were reduced andS-pyridylethylated on the membranes by the method of Iwamatsu and Yoshida-Kubomura (30Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 29-34Google Scholar). The denatured proteins were digested with trypsin (0.6 ॖg/450 ॖl) at 25 °C for 18 h, and the fragments liberated from the membranes were purified on a ॖBondasphere 5C18 column (Waters Associates) in a reverse-phased high performance liquid chromatography system (Tohso Co., Tokyo). The N-terminal 10 amino acids of each peptide were determined with an ABI 492 gas-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Total RNAs were extracted from adult tissues and embryos at various stages using Isogen (Nippon GENE, Tokyo). RT-PCR was performed using an RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) and 1 ॖg of each total RNA for each reaction. Synthesis of first-strand cDNA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. The primers used for PCRs were as follows: Ia, 5′-CACGGAGACACAAATAAGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCCTGGAGTGCATTATGG-3′ (antisense); Ib, 5′-GAAGGCGACACCAACAAAATA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTAATGAAGCGAGATAGCCT-3′ (antisense); IIa and IIb, 5′-TCAACAGCAGCAGCTTTGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCTTGATTTGGGAACATGG-3′ (antisense); IIIa and IIIb, 5′-AATACCATCACCGAATCCCAATAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TATGAAACCTTTTTGGGTTTGCAG-3′ (antisense); IVa, 5′-CATTGTTTGGGGCATCTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGAATTGTACGTAGGATA-3′ (antisense); Va, 5′-GATAACCAACCTCAACCTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGCCAATAGCATAACAGCAGA-3′ (antisense); Vb, 5′-ATGGACATGCAGCCAGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTAATGAACCGAGATGGA-3′ (antisense); VIa, 5′-GGCTTCAGGTGACAGGAGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGAAATGTACAAAGCA-3′ (antisense); VIIa, 5′-GAACCTCCTAAACCATCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAGACCATGGTAACATT-3′ (antisense); VIIIa, 5′-ATGGCCCAAACAGGACTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTACCAGATGCGCACATC-3′ (antisense); elongation factor-1α (EF-1α), 5′-GTCGCCCAACTGATAAGCCTCTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGCCTTCTTTTCCACTGCCTTGAT-3′ (antisense); ornithine decarboxylase, 5′-GTCAATGATGGAGTGTATGGATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCATTCCGCTCTCCTGAGCAC-3′ (antisense). The primers for ornithine decarboxylase were prepared according to Yamada et al. (31Yamada K. Takabatake Y. Takabatake T. Takeshima K. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 318-330Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by thermal cycles of the following: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. For analysis of adult tissues, reactions were repeated for 30 cycles; and for embryos, the cycle numbers were as indicated in legend to Fig. 5. Ornithine decarboxylase or EF-1α (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M25504) was amplified as an internal control. All PCR products were analyzed by 27 agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Control experiments to show the specific amplification of xgalectin-Ia, Ib, Va, and -Vb were performed using 1 ng of each plasmid clone as template DNA in each reaction. A control experiment to show the simultaneous and equal amplification of xgalectin-IIa and -IIb was performed by adding 0.1 pg of each plasmid clone used as template DNA to the reaction mixture. A control experiment for xgalectin-IIIa and -IIIb was performed in the same way. Specific amplification with each primer pair was confirmed by a reaction without reverse transcriptase and also by sequence analysis of the PCR products (data not shown). Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from adult tissues. RNA (1 ॖg) from each sample was fractionated and blotted onto a nylon membrane. cDNA fragments with the following sequences were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR and then used as probes: xgalectin-VIa, nucleotides 693–1427; xgalectin-VIIa, nucleotides 1–1074; xgalectin-VIIIa, nucleotides 96–1043; and EF-1α, nucleotides 758–1378 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M25504). Hybridization, washing, and detection were performed as described previously (32Nishi N. Oya H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Miyanaka H. Wada F. Prostate. 1996; 28: 139-152Google Scholar). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed by the method described previously (33Okabayashi K. Shoji H. Onuma Y. Nakamura T. Nose K. Sugino H. Asashima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 42-48Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled complementary RNA probes were synthesized with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A plasmid clone with a cDNA fragment (nucleotides 84–864) of xgalectin-VIIa was used as template DNA. A sense probe was used as a negative control. Preparation of recombinant xgalectin-VIIa was performed as described (11Matsushita N. Nishi N. Seki M. Matsumoto R. Kuwabara I. Liu F. Hata Y. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8355-8360Google Scholar). A plasmid clone carrying the entire open reading frame was constructed on the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was expressed as a fusion protein with GST. The purified recombinant protein was used to immunize Japanese white rabbits as described (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). For late tadpole stage samples (stages 57–59), whole protein was extracted from whole embryos or epidermis removed from embryos by homogenization in a 5-fold volume of 807 methanol and 207 Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). The extracts were centrifuged, and the precipitates were dissolved in the general sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Proteins derived from 1 mg of wet tissues were applied to each lane. At first, the same protocol was used for younger embryos; but in this case, the huge amount of vitellogenin disturbed the SDS-PAGE. To overcome this, unfertilized eggs and embryos (gastrula/early tadpoles) were homogenized in buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm lactose, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm benzamidine HCl and then centrifuged. Under these conditions, most of the vitellogenin precipitate and xgalectin-VIIa are recovered in the supernatant. Proteins in supernatants were precipitated by adding a 9-fold volume of methanol and then dissolved in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The protein amount for unfertilized eggs and embryos (gastrula/early tadpoles) subjected to SDS-PAGE was standardized as to the number of embryos, and protein equivalent to 0.5 embryos was applied to each lane. Western blotting was performed in the same way as described in our previous work (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar), except that anti-xgalectin-VIIa serum was used at a dilution of 1:500. We have isolated and named six novel xgalectin cDNAs. As described in our previous report (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar), a Roman numeral and letter were assigned to each Xenopus galectin not according to the number of mammalian galectins, but according to the order of their discovery, because complete correspondence of the members of the Xenopus and mammalian galectin families was impossible. A novel proto type (xgalectin-Vb) was structurally most similar toXenopus skin 16-kDa galectin (787 amino acid identity) (Fig. 1A), which was previously described by Marschal et al. (26Marschal P.

As these two xgalectins are structurally similar and also exhibit similar expression patterns, being abundant in adult skin (to be described below), we propose the designations xgalectin-Va for the skin 16-kDa galectin and xgalectin-Vb for the newly identified galectin. Mammalian counterparts of xgalectin-Va and -Vb have not been identified. One chimera-type galectin, xgalectin-VIIa, was cloned, and its complete sequence was determined. In the course of this study, we found nineXenopus EST clones similar to galectin-3, a mammalian chimera type, and the full coding sequence was reconstructed by combining them. The amino acid sequence deduced from the consensus nucleotide sequence is identical to that of xgalectin-VIIa (Fig.1B). Thus, the xgalectin-VIIa and EST clones must have originated from the same gene. As the amino acid sequence of xgalectin-VIIa is highly similar to that of mammalian galectin-3 (TableI), xgalectin-VIIa seems to be aXenopus homolog of mammalian galectin-3.Table IRelationship of Xenopus and mammalian galectinsTypeXenopusMammalianAmino acid sequence identity1-aFull sequences of human and Xenopushomologues were compared.ProtoXgalectin-Ia and -IbGalectin-149Tandem repeatXgalectin-IIa and -IIbGalectin-4 (galectin-6)1-bGalectin-6 is closely related to galectin-4 but has been identified only in mouse.50–51Tandem repeatXgalectin-IIIa and -IIIbGalectin-942Tandem repeatXgalectin-IVaUnknownProtoXgalectin-Va and -VbUnknownTandem repeatXgalectin-VIaUnknownChimeraXgalectin-VIIaGalectin-342Tandem repeatXgalectin-VIIIaGalectin-8531-a Full sequences of human and Xenopushomologues were compared.1-b Galectin-6 is closely related to galectin-4 but has been identified only in mouse. Open table in a new tab Four tandem repeat-type galectins, xgalectin-IIb, -IIIb, -VIa, and -VIIIa, were newly identified. Two of them, xgalectin-IIb and -IIIb, are structurally very similar to xgalectin-IIa and -IIIa, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B), which we described in a previous work (27Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Nakamura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 163-172Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the CRDs in xgalectin-IIa and -IIb or in xgalectin-IIIa and -IIIb are 88–907 identical. The major structural difference between each pair of isoforms is the length of the link peptides. The link peptide of xgalectin-IIa is longer by 12 amino acids compared with that of xgalectin-IIb, and the link peptide of xgalectin-IIIa is 35 amino acids longer than that of xgalectin-IIIb (Fig. 2, A andB). Based on the sequence similarity, both xgalectin-IIa and -IIb seem to be Xenopus homologs of mammalian galectin-4, and both xgalectin-IIIa and -IIIb seem to be Xenopushomologs of mammalian galectin-9 (Table I). There are three Xenopus EST clones related to xgalectin-VIa, and the amino acid sequence deduced from the consensus nucleotide sequence completely matches that of part of the N-terminal CRD of xgalectin-VIa (Fig. 2C). Thus, the xgalectin-VIa and EST clones must have originated from the same gene. A mammalian counterpart of xgalectin-VIa has not been identified. One EST clone related to xgalectin-VIIIa was found. Although the partial amino acid sequence encoded by the EST sequence is only 887 identical to that of xgalectin-VIIIa, the entire nucleotide sequence of the EST clone matches the cDNA sequence of xgalectin-VIIIa (967 identity), even though most of the compared region corresponds to the 3′-noncoding sequence (Fig. 2D). Thus, the disagreement between the sequences of xgalectin-VIIIa and the EST clone may be due to allelic differences and/or sequence errors, and the xgalectin-VIIIa and EST clones may have originated from the same gene. Xgalectin-VIIIa seems to be a Xenopus homolog of mammalian galectin-8 because its amino acid sequence is highly similar to that of mammalian galectin-8 (537 identical to human galectin-8) (Table I). Of the 12 xgalectins we have identified so far, there are four xgalectins whose counterparts in other species have not been identified, xgalectin-IVa, -Va, -Vb, and -VIa (Table I). As described above, xgalectin-Va has been well characterized as skin 16-kDa galectin by Marschal et al. (26Marschal P. Herrmann J. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12942-12949Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind lactose with high affinity. To clarify whether xgalectin-IVa, -Vb, and -VIa truly act as lectins, we tested the lactose-binding activity of their recombinant forms. Recombinant xgalectin-IVa, -Vb, and -VIa proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on a lactosyl-agarose column. As shown in Fig.3, recombinant xgalectin-IVa, -Vb, and -VIa proteins were successfully recovered from the adsorbed fractions of each E. coli extract on the lactosyl-agarose column. To identify the major xgalectins in kidney, we determined the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of xgalectins purified from kidney. Xgalectins were purified by an affinity chromatography method using lactosyl-agarose resin, and the eluted proteins were further fractionated into 14-kDa protein-rich and 30–36-kDa protein-rich fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. From the 14-kDa protein-rich fraction, only the sequence of xgalectin-Ib or the common sequence of xgalectin-Ia and -Ib was obtained, and no particular peptide for xgalectin-Ia was recovered (Table II). From the 30–36-kDa protein-rich fraction, three sequences of xgalectin-"

The lectin, designated P. aureum lectin (PAL), is composed of two identical subunits of ∼15 kDa associated by noncovalent bonds. From a cDNA library and synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on a partial amino acid sequence, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends allowed the generation of two similar full-length cDNAs, termed PALa and PALb, each of which had an open reading frame of 438 bp encoding 146 amino acid residues. The two proteins share 88% sequence identity and showed structural similarity to jacalin-related lectins. PALa contained peptide sequences exactly matching those found in the isolated lectin. PALa and PALb were expressed in Escherichia coli using pET-22b(+) vector and purified by one-step affinity chromatography. Native and recombinant forms of PAL agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes and precipitated with yeast mannan, dextran, and the high mannose-containing glycoprotein invertase. The detailed carbohydrate-binding properties of the native and recombinant lectins were elucidated by agglutination inhibition assay, and native lectin was also studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. Based on the results of these assays, we conclude that this primitive vascular plant, like many higher plants, contains significant quantities of a mannose/glucose-binding protein in its storage tissue, whose binding specificity differs in detail from either legume mannose/glucose-binding lectins or monocot mannose-specific lectins. The identification of a jacalin-related lectin in a true fern reveals for the first time the widespread distribution and molecular evolution of this lectin family in the plant kingdom.

Hughes R.C. Monsigny M. Osawa T. Sharon N. Nature. 1980; 285: 66Google Scholar). They are ubiquitous in the biosphere, having been found in viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (2Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 3-80Google Scholar). Among the divisions of the plant kingdom, the Pteridophyta, which includes the class Filicinae, or true ferns, have been largely overlooked in the study of lectins. Lectins of known specificity serve as valuable reagents in glycobiological research. They can be employed for the detection and preliminary characterization of glycoconjugates on the surface of cells. Although many lectins belong to the same major specificity group of mannose- or mannose/glucose-binding lectins, their different reactivities toward more complex oligo- and polysaccharides render many of them specifically valuable for recognizing a particular type of saccharide structure and fuel the search for yet more novel lectins (3Goldstein I.J. Winter H.C. Poretz R.D. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1997: 403-474Google Scholar). Lectins are found in greatest quantity and are most readily purified from plant sources, especially storage tissues such as seeds, bark, bulbs, rhizomes, etc. Many lectins have been isolated and characterized from angiosperm subdivision of seed plants. On the basis of structural and evolutionary development, most of these plant lectins have been classified into seven families: legume lectins, chitin-binding proteins, type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins, monocot mannose-binding lectins, amaranthins, curcurbitaceae phloem lectins, and jacalin-related lectins (JRLs)1 (4Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Barre A. Rouge P. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1998; 17: 575-692Google Scholar). Each family has its own characteristic carbohydrate recognition domain. Jacalin, the prototype of JRLs, was isolated from seeds of jack fruit (Artocarpus integrifolia; Moraceae) (5Sastry M.V.K. Banerjee P. Patanjali S.R. Swamy M.J. Swarnalatha G.V. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11726-11733Google Scholar). Subsequently, JRLs have also been isolated and characterized from various plant families of angiosperms such as Convolvulaceae (6Peumans W.J. Winter H.C.

Nagano C.S. Cavada B.S. Calvete J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4414-4422Google Scholar). Although JRLs are widely distributed in higher plants, no information on JRLs outside of angiosperms is available except for a recently isolated lectin from the Japanese cycad (Cycas revoluta) of gymnosperm subdivision (15Yagi F. Iwaya T. Haraguchi T. Goldstein I.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4335-4341Google Scholar). In an ab initio search for lectins in understudied groups of plants, we examined the large, fleshy, mesoterranian rhizomes of the tropical fern Phlebodium aureum for the presence of cell-agglutinating activity. We report herein the purification ofP. aureum lectin (PAL), a mannose/glucose-specific lectin present in the rhizomes of this member of the Polypodiaceae family, as well as the cDNA cloning, expression, and characterization of this mannose/glucose-binding lectin and a closely related protein also having lectin activity. cDNA sequencing revealed that these fern lectins are novel members of the JRLs. This is the first report of the molecular cloning of JRLs from a lower plant, fern, which shows the structural and evolutionary relationship of JRLs in the plant kingdom. The two lectin genes were expressed in E. coli, and their physicochemical characterization is described and compared with the native lectin. This expression system should also be useful for mutagenesis studies to elucidate the structure-function relationship of JRLs. Rhizomes of Phlebodium aureum (L) J. Smith (also classified as Polypodium aureum L.) were collected from a specimen plant growing in the greenhouse at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens of the University of Michigan. Positive identification was provided by Dr. David Michener, collections curator of the botanical gardens. Unless stated otherwise, saccharides and their derivatives and glycoproteins were purchased from Sigma. Ovine submaxillary mucin was a gift of Dr. R. N. Knibbs (University of Michigan). Mannose-Sepharose, prepared by divinyl sulfone coupling of mannose to Sepharose CL-4B (16Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Google Scholar), and yeast invertase-Sepharose, prepared using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose, were available from previous studies. All procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Pieces of rhizome from P. aureum were scraped to remove the soft, fuzzy layer and chopped into approximately 5-mm cubes. The light green chopped tissue (146 g fresh weight) was homogenized and extracted for 2–3 h with 600 ml of extraction buffer (PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.135 mm CaCl2, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.2) containing 10 mm thiourea, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 g/liter ascorbic acid), with the addition of 10 g of poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone). The homogenate was squeezed through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. To the supernatant solution was added solid ammonium sulfate to 10% saturation. After stirring overnight, any precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered through coarse filter paper to remove a small amount of floating debris and was made 80% saturated with ammonium sulfate. After stirring for several hours followed by centrifugation, the precipitated protein was dissolved in approximately 60 ml of PBS, dialyzed against 2–3 2-liter changes of PBS, and clarified by centrifugation. This 10–80% precipitated protein solution was applied onto a column (14 × 2.5 cm; bed volume of 68 ml) of mannose-Sepharose, which had been equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with PBS until the absorbance of the effluent at 280 nm decreased to a minimum value. The affinity-adsorbed lectin was desorbed with 0.1 m Me α-Man in PBS, dialyzed against PBS, and rechromatographed on the same column. Approximately 12 mg of purified lectin was obtained from 146 g of rhizome tissue. Protein concentration was determined by a modified method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total neutral sugar was determined colorimetrically by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (18DuBois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar). Specific sugars were identified on reverse-phase HPLC by the method of Fu and O'Neill (19Fu D. O'Neill R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 377-384Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on 0.75-mm slab gels in alkaline buffer system (Tris/glycine, pH 8.3) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), using a mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). BenchMark protein molecular mass standards used in SDS-PAGE were from Invitrogen. The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin was determined by a 2-fold serial dilution procedure using formaldehyde-treated (21Novak T.P. Barondes S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 393: 115-123Google Scholar) human and rabbit erythrocytes as described previously (22Mo H. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10623-10629Google Scholar). The hemagglutination titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution exhibiting observable hemagglutination. Inhibition of agglutination by haptenic saccharides was assayed by serially diluting the solution of saccharide in the microtiter wells, followed by the addition of four agglutinin units of the lectin, followed by the addition of erythrocyte suspension after 30 min. The lowest concentration of saccharide that visibly decreased the extent of agglutination was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration. The molecular mass and subunit structure of purified P. aureum lectins were determined by gel filtration through a G2000-SWXL Progel-TSK column (30 × 0.78 cm; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) using a Beckman System Gold HPLC system as described previously (23Winter H.C. Mostafapour K. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14996-15001Google Scholar) and by SDS-PAGE performed on samples with and without heating for 5 min in boiling water and in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The amino acid composition and the N-terminal sequence of the purified lectin or peptides therefrom were analyzed by the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Core Facility. Quantitative precipitation assays were performed by a microprecipitation technique as described previously (22Mo H. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10623-10629Google Scholar). Briefly, varying amounts of glycoproteins or polysaccharides, ranging from 0 to 100 μg, were added to 50 μg of purified PAL in a total volume of 250 μl of PBS, pH 7.2. In some experiments, 20 μg of lectin in a total volume of 120 μl was used. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were stored at 4 °C for 48–72 h. The precipitates formed were centrifuged, washed two times with 400 μl of ice-cold PBS, dissolved in 0.05 m NaOH, and evaluated for protein content by the Lowry method (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Hapten inhibition was performed in the same system with increasing amounts of potentially inhibitory saccharides added to the reaction mixture containing 50 μg of the purified lectin and 8 μg of precipitating polysaccharide in 250 μl. The concentration of saccharide required for 50% inhibition was interpolated from corresponding inhibition curves. Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out, and results were calculated as previously described (11Mo H. Winter H.C. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Misaki A. Goldstein I.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2609-2615Google Scholar) using lectin concentrations of approximately 4 mg/ml, equivalent to a subunit concentration of approximately 0.25 mm. Titrations generally were conducted by 25 additions of 5 μl of ligand solutions having concentrations between 1 and 50 mm, depending on the expected range of binding constant. For RNA isolation, chopped rhizome tissue was immediately ground to a powder with a pestle under liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Concert Plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen), and subsequently poly(A)+RNA was isolated with the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Using this protocol, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per 10 g of rhizome was isolated. An adapter ligated cDNA library was constructed with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Two degenerate forward primers (PALF1, CARGTNGTNTAYGGNAAYGGNACNACNAAR; PALF2, GCNAAYGGNCARACNAARGARATHGAYGTN) were designed from the amino acid sequence VNGLQVVYGNGTTKLHGXANGQTKEIDV of a cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment of fern lectin for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). 3′-RACE was conducted with a combination of primers, adapter primer 1 (Invitrogen) and PALF1, and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as follows. DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by three-step cycles (40 cycles) (92 °C for 0.5 min, 50 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 1 min), and further extended at 65 °C for 15 min. This amplified DNA fragment was subsequently amplified with adapter primer 2 (Invitrogen) and PALF2. The amplified 0.5-kbp fragment was cloned using Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Inserted DNA was sequenced with T7 and SP6 primers by the DNA Sequencing Core Facility of the University of Michigan, and two similar but different genes (termed PALa and PALb) including poly(A)+ were obtained. Two specific reverse primers for each gene (PALaR1, GCCTAGTAAAGCGACCGACATGGCTACAAGAGCGCTAC; PALbR1, GACATAGAGGCCGAGGCGATCCAAACGGTCTCC) were designed, and 5′-RACE was conducted with adapter primer 1 and PALaR1/PALbR1, respectively. The full-length coding sequence PCR products of PALa and PALb incorporating NdeI and XhoI sites into its forward and reverse primers, respectively, were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently cloned into expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen) to generate carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged proteins, yielding pET-PALa and pET-PALb, respectively. The Nova Blue (DE3) strain of E. coliharboring expression plasmid pET-PALa and pET-PALb was precultured in 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 3 h and was added to 1 liter of medium. After the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4–0.6, 1 ml of 1m isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside was added to the medium, and the cells were further cultured at 25 °C for 6 h. The induced cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a lysis buffer (PBS, containing 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Recombinant PALa (rPALa) and recombinant PALb (rPALb) were purified from the soluble fraction by absorption on a mannose-Sepharose 4B column and elution by 0.2 m Me α-mannose. To examine their thermostability, lectin solutions (0.1 mg/ml in PBS) were incubated for various periods at 40, 50, 55, 60, or 70 °C. After 10 μl of lectin solution was cooled on ice, its hemagglutination activity was assayed as described above. pH stability of the lectins were determined in the following buffers: 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.0–3.0), 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0–5.0), 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–7.0), 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0–9.0), and 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0). Lectin solution (10 μl) was incubated with 10 μl of buffer at 4 °C overnight. After adjusting to pH 8.0 by the addition of 30 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, the hemagglutination activity of the lectin was assayed as described above. Multiple sequence alignment was performed by the ClustalW program (25Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Homologous sequences were searched for by the FASTA program. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining algorithm based on an evolutionary distance matrix constructed by Kimura's method (26Kimura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 1181-1188Google Scholar) The degrees of confidence for internal lineages in phylogenetic trees were calculated by the bootstrap procedure. Crude extracts from P. aureum rhizomes weakly agglutinated formaldehyde-stabilized rabbit erythrocytes (titer = 32–64) but not sheep nor any type of human erythrocytes. After purification as described below, the lectin agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes at a minimum concentration of 1 μg/ml (titer at 4 mg/ml = ∼4,000), whereas sheep or any type of human erythrocytes required approximately 150 μg/ml for agglutination (titer at 4 mg/ml = ∼64). Lectin that was dialyzed extensively against metal-free, EDTA-containing buffer and assayed in the same buffer had identical hemagglutination titer against rabbit erythrocytes, indicating that it has no requirement for metal ions. Because the hemagglutination activity of crude extracts of P. aureum was inhibited by d-mannose, mannose-Sepharose was used as an affinity absorbent for isolation of the lectin. After elution of nonabsorbed protein from the mannose-Sepharose column, 0.1m Me α-Man eluted a sharp band of protein, which in a second affinity chromatography was totally bound and eluted in a similar manner (Fig. 1). The lectin was also bound to and eluted from a column of immobilized yeast invertase under the same conditions. As shown in Fig.2 A, upon SDS-PAGE at pH 8.3 with unheated samples, the lectin preparation obtained from affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose or invertase-Sepharose showed a major band at approximately 38 kDa. The low, broad band appearing before and after elution of the sharp lectin peak (Fig. 1 A) appeared to contain several bands of nearly equal intensity. Upon rechromatography of the eluted lectin fraction (Fig. 1 B), this contaminating broad band was allowed to wash off before commencing elution of the lectin with a haptenic sugar, yielding a slightly more purified material. When lectin samples were boiled in SDS with 2-mercaptoethanol, a single band of approximately 15 kDa was observed (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the native structure is a dimer of this monomer. The earlier and later contaminating material gave a single band at slightly lower mass. We have not investigated the nature of this apparent contaminant further.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of P. aureum lectin fractions, all from preparation I except where indicated.

The purified lectin migrated as a single, nearly symmetrical band of approximately 31 kDa, based on standardization with known proteins (data not shown). Together with the SDS-PAGE analysis, these results indicate that the lectin exists as a dimer of approximately 15-kDa subunits that requires boiling in SDS to dissociate completely. The amino acid composition of the purified fern lectin (data not shown) indicated that it contains a single residue each of methionine and histidine and the typically large amounts of aspartic acid/asparagine, serine, and glycine observed in many other lectins. Attempts to sequence the N-terminal region were not successful; however, after cyanogen bromide cleavage, a large peptide having theN-terminal sequence VNGLQVVYGNGTTKLHGXANGQTKEIDV was detected. Cleavage withAchromobacter protease I yielded a peptide with the partial sequence LGPWGGSGGDSFDDGSDNGG. No periodate-Schiff staining bands were observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the purified native lectin, although a small amount of neutral sugar (approximately 0.8–1.5 hexose units/subunit) was detected in some preparations at high concentration by the phenol/sulfuric acid assay. Analysis of such PAL preparations by the method of Fu and O'Neill (19Fu D. O'Neill R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 377-384Google Scholar) indicated primarily mannose to be present. Although the partial sequence shown above contains a putative glycosylation sequence (NGT), the asparagine residue must be largely or totally nonglycosylated to be detected by automated sequencing. Most likely, the mannose arises from trace amounts of endogenous mannan or high mannose glycoprotein contaminants, which remain associated with the lectin during the purification procedures, but the lectin itself is not glycosylated. The ability of a number of mono- and oligosaccharides to inhibit agglutination of formaldehyde-treated rabbit erythrocytes is shown in Table I. It is evident that branched mannose oligosaccharides are the best inhibitors, whereas glucose-containing disaccharides were much less effective. This result indicates that PAL is a mannose/glucose-binding lectin.Table IInhibition of hemagglutination activity of native and recombinant fern lectins by mono- and oligosaccharidesSaccharideNative PALrPALaP rrPALb P rI50aMinimum concentration causing visible inhibition of agglutination of 4 arbitrary units of lectin. d-Galactose,l-mannose, l-fucose, l-rhamnose,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, l-xylose,d-lyxose, d-ribose, 2-deoxy-d-ribose, melibiose, lactose, laminaribiose(Glcβ1,3Glc), Me α-Frucf, and Me α-Gal exhibited no inhibition at 50 mm.P rbPotency relative to Me α-Man with nPAL.mmMannose1.6[1]10.5Me α-Man1.6110.25p-Nitrophenyl α-Man>8.8<0.2<0.32<0.32p-Nitrophenyl β-Man6.40.250.130.251,5-Anhydro-d-mannitol0.82.02.00.5Glucose6.40.250.250.13Me α-Glc250.060.06<0.06Me β-Glc>25<0.06<0.06<0.062-Deoxy-Glc6.40.250.130.13GlcNAc12.80.130.130.06Fructose12.80.130.060.06Me β-Frucp12.80.130.130.06Manα1,2Man1.251.31.30.5Manα1,3Man0.28.08.02.0Manα1,6Man1.61.01.00.5Manα1,3ManαOMe0.315.25.25.0Manα1,4ManαOMe6.20.260.260.13Manα1,6ManαOMe1.61.01.00.5Man30.35.25.22.5Man50.0820205.0Manα1,6[Glcα1,3]Man1.51.01.01.0Manβ1,4Man>25<0.06<0.06<0.06Galα1,3ManαOMe>12.5<0.13<0.13<0.13Glcβ1,3ManαOMe3.10.5n.d.n.d.Glcα1,2Glc(kojibiose)6.40.250.250.08Glcα1,3Glc(nigerose)12.80.130.130.13Glcα1,4Glc(maltose)500.030.030.03Glcα1,4Glcα1,4Glc(maltotriose)250.060.060.06Glcα1,6Glc(isomaltose)12.50.130.13<0.13Glcβ1,2Glc(sophorose)6.20.250.250.13Glcα1,2Glc(gentiobiose)250.06<0.13<0.13a Minimum concentration causing visible inhibition of agglutination of 4 arbitrary units of lectin. d-Galactose,l-mannose, l-fucose, l-rhamnose,N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, l-xylose,d-lyxose, d-ribose, 2-deoxy-d-ribose, melibiose, lactose, laminaribiose(Glcβ1,3Glc), Me α-Frucf, and Me α-Gal exhibited no inhibition at 50 mm.b Potency relative to Me α-Man with nPAL.

Quantitative precipitin assays (Fig. 3) confirmed that the two yeast mannans precipitated to a significant extent with an equal weight of lectin; dextran B-1355-S at 3–4-fold higher concentration by weight also strongly precipitated the lectin. Two other dextrans from L. mesenteroides, B-742-S and B-742-L (27Jeanes A. Haynes W.C. Wilham C.A. Rankin J.C. Melvin E.H. Austin M.J. Cluskey J.E. Fisher B.E. Tsuchiya H.M. Rist C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5041-5052Google Scholar), partially precipitated the lectin at much higher concentrations. Among glycoproteins, only yeast invertase, a high mannose glycoprotein, partially precipitated the lectin. Soybean agglutinin, which also contains a high mannose glycan, was inactive. Precipitation of yeast mannan was inhibited 50% by Man3 at 3.1 mm, mannose at 19 mm, Me α-Man at 80 mm, or Me β-Man at 130 mm (data not shown). These results are in qualitative agreement with the inhibition of agglutination but show that the precipitation of mannan involves a considerably stronger interaction than does rabbit erythrocyte agglutination, since higher concentrations of inhibitory sugars are required. Thermodynamic parameters for the binding of various mannose and glucose-containing saccharides are shown in Table II. These results also agree with the previous data, confirming that the branched mannose trisaccharide and pentasaccharides are the best ligands, with the additional mannose units strongly enhancing the binding.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of carbohydrate binding to native PALSaccharideSubunit concentrationnK dK a−ΔH aBased on 1 binding site for mono- or oligosaccharide per subunit.−ΔG−TΔSmmmm103m−1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molMe α-Man0.135[0.75]bBrackets denote data fitting with value of nfixed.0.9781.027.904.073.8Man30.4160.750.1357.4310.335.235.1Man50.2441.00.02539.4712.296.216.09Manα1,3ManαOMe0.301.00.06914.518.535.632.9Manα1,3Man0.2441.00.07613.118.165.572.6Manα1,6ManαOMe0.21[0.75]0.3083.258.384.753.6Manα1,6Man0.2440.750.2693.7111.04.826.12Manα1,2Man0.320.450.1835.465.635.090.54Me α-Glc0.248[0.75]7.19.1395.222.902.3a Based on 1 binding site for mono- or oligosaccharide per subunit.b Brackets denote data fitting with value of nfixed.

https://openalex.org/W2144060095,"Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are critical for attenuating G protein-coupled signaling pathways. The membrane association of RGS4 has been reported to be crucial for its regulatory activity in reconstituted vesicles and physiological rolesin vivo. In this study, we report that RGS4 initially binds onto the surface of anionic phospholipid vesicles and subsequently inserts into, but not through, the membrane bilayer. Phosphatidic acid, one of anionic phospholipids, could dramatically inhibit the ability of RGS4 to accelerate GTPase activity in vitro. Phosphatidic acid is an effective and potent inhibitor of RGS4 in a Gαi1-[γ-32P]GTP single turnover assay with an IC50 ∼ 4 μm and maximum inhibition of over 90%. Furthermore, phosphatidic acid was the only phospholipid tested that inhibited RGS4 activity in a receptor-mediated, steady-state GTP hydrolysis assay. When phosphatidic acid (10 mol %) was incorporated into m1 acetylcholine receptor-Gαqvesicles, RGS4 GAP activity was markedly inhibited by more than 70% and the EC50 of RGS4 was increased from 1.5 to 7 nm. Phosphatidic acid also induced a conformational change in the RGS domain of RGS4 measured by acrylamide-quenching experiments. Truncation of the N terminus of RGS4 (residues 1–57) resulted in the loss of both phosphatidic acid binding and lipid-mediated functional inhibition. A single point mutation in RGS4 (Lys20 to Glu) permitted its binding to phosphatidic acid-containing vesicles but prevented lipid-induced conformational changes in the RGS domain and abolished the inhibition of its GAP activity. We speculate that the activation of phospholipase D or diacylglycerol kinase via G protein-mediated signaling cascades will increase the local concentration of phosphatidic acid, which in turn block RGS4 GAP activity in vivo. Thus, RGS4 may represent a novel effector of phosphatidic acid, and this phospholipid may function as a feedback regulator in G protein-mediated signaling pathways.

Classically, this signaling system is composed of three major components: G protein-coupled receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins, and second messenger-producing effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar). Recently, regulators of G-proteinsignaling (RGS)1have been identified as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for Gα subunits, thereby attenuating a number of G-protein-dependent signaling cascades (Ref. 2Zheng B. Ma Y.C. Ostrom R.S. Lavoie C. Gill G.N. Insel P.A. Huang X.Y. Farquhar M.G. Science. 2001; 294: 1939-1942Google Scholar, and for review see Ref. 3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). Members of this protein family share a conserved domain of ∼120 amino acid residues, defined as the RGS domain. This domain retains GAP activity in vitrocomparable with the full-length RGS protein (4Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Google Scholar). The structure of the RGS4·Gαi1 complex in the presence of both GDP and AlF4− shed light on the mechanism whereby RGS proteins promote the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits (5Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Google Scholar). Flanking sequences outside the RGS domain exhibit considerable diversity and constitute additional domains that enable RGS proteins to interact with membranes or proteins beyond Gα subunits (6De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Google Scholar). The membrane binding of RGS proteins is essential for their physiological functions. RGSZ1, a Gz-selective RGS protein in the brain, requires membrane association for its GAP activity toward Gz (7Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y.P. Kozasa T. Aebesold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Google Scholar). The association of RGS4 with the plasma membrane occurs through an N-terminal α-helix that is also found in RGS16 and RGS2. Plasma membrane association is required for most RGS proteins to inhibit G-protein signaling in vivo and confers receptor selectivity (8Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Google Scholar, 9Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Google Scholar, 10Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that RGS4 binds to phospholipid surfaces in a slow, multistep process where the binding of RGS4 is initially reversible but becomes irreversible within minutes (12Tu Y.P. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Google Scholar). However, whether RGS4 is simply bound to the membrane surface or can penetrate into the membrane bilayer remains unknown. It has been previously reported that RGS4 binds to anionic phospholipid liposomes (13Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Google Scholar). However, relatively little is known about what modulates RGS4 activity on signaling pathways when bound to the membrane. RGS4 must bind to model membranes in a specific orientation for its optimal GAP activity in vitro (12Tu Y.P. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Google Scholar). Popov and co-workers (14Popov S.G. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18962-18968Google Scholar) reported that RGS4 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, another anionic phospholipid, at a site within the RGS domain distinct from and opposite to the RGS/Gα contact face. As a consequence, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate binding inhibits GAP activity of RGS4 (14Popov S.G. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18962-18968Google Scholar, 15Ishii M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4325-4330Google Scholar). Using model membranes, we demonstrate here that RGS4 can insert into one leaflet of some anionic phospholipid membranes following its initial membrane association. Although both phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are effective in promoting RGS4 insertion into the membrane bilayer, PA selectively inhibits its GAP activity in both single-turnover and reconstituted vesicle assays. PA-mediated inhibition of GAP activity of RGS4 requires its N-terminal domain. Also, a mutation of Lys20 in the N terminus of RGS4 blocks the PA-induced conformational change in the RGS domain and diminishes PA-conferred inhibition of its GAP activity. PA is a putative second messenger (21English D.Y. Cui Y. Siddiqui R.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 117-132Google Scholar) and arises principally from two major signal transduction pathways via phospholipase D (PLD) (16Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Google Scholar) and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) (17Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Google Scholar, 18Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Google Scholar), both of which are regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (19Fahimi-Vahid M.

Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Google Scholar). Based on our results, we speculate that RGS4 may represent a novel effector of phosphatidic acid. Myristoylated Gαi1, RGS4 wild type, and the N-terminal truncation mutant (Δ57RGS4) with an N-terminal His6 tag were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (12Tu Y.P. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Google Scholar). Untagged RGS4 was a gift from Maurine Linder (Washington University School of Medicine). Gαq (22Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar) were purified from Sf9 cells. PS (bovine brain), phosphatidylinositol (egg yolk), cardiolipin (bovine brain), cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), dansyl-PE, imidazole, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) (bovine brain), phosphatidic acid (egg yolk), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (bovine brain), and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(5-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPC) were products of Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. GTPγS and GTP were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acrylamide (Ultrapure) was from Invitrogen. The antibody to the C terminus of RGS4 and secondary antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was from Ameresco. The 96-well microtiter plates were obtained from Nunc. Other reagents were of analytic grade available in China. RGS4K20E was generated by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following primers (the mutated codons are in bold): primer 1, GCAAAGGATATGGAACATCGGCTGGG, and primer 2, CCCAGCCGATGTTCCATATCCTTTGC. RGS4W59A was generated using Gene Editor (Promega). The mutagenic oligonucleotide (the mutated codon is in bold) was: GAAGTCAAGAAAGCGGCTGAATCGCTG. RGS4 coding regions of all constructs were sequenced to verify that only the desired mutations had been introduced. Lipids of desired compositions were mixed in chloroform/methanol (3:1) and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Residual solvents were removed under vacuum for 3–4 h. The phospholipid films were then resuspended in an appropriate buffer and vortexed thoroughly for hydration. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by sonicating lipid suspensions to optical clarity at ∼2–3-min intervals. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared according to Rietveld et al. (25Rietveld A. Jordi W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3846-3856Google Scholar). For centrifugation binding experiments, large unilamellar vesicles were made in 10 mmPipes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. For fluorescence measurements, SUVs were prepared in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Phospholipid concentration was determined after perchloric acid digestion (26Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Google Scholar). RGS4 (0.6–1.8 μg) was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of large unilamellar vesicles with the desired components at varied concentrations. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. In a control experiment, RGS4 was centrifuged without phospholipid vesicle preincubation. The supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted (27Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar). The amount of unbound RGS4 was estimated by comparing the amount of RGS4 found in the supernatant with varying amounts of defined RGS4 standards. The bound RGS4 was determined by subtraction of the unbound protein from the total. The RGS4 in the supernatant from control experiments was used as the total to calculate the binding efficiency of RGS4 to vesicles. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophans in the RGS4 protein (excitation at 280 nm) and dansyl in the phospholipid (emission at 515 nm) was used to monitor the association of protein with phospholipid vesicles (28Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Google Scholar). Direct excitation of the dansyl group at 280 nm produced a reference emission intensity (F 0). Fluorescence energy transfer was expressed as (F −F 0)/F 0, whereF and F 0 are the fluorescence emission intensities of phospholipid at 515 nm with and without addition of RGS4, respectively. Dansyl-PE was mixed at 5 mol % in SUVs with the desired phospholipid compositions. The measurements were performed at 30 °C in a Hitachi F4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. All procedures were performed as described previously (29Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Google Scholar). In brief, PA solutions (10 μg/well) diluted in methanol were allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C. The following ELISA steps were performed at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, for 2 h. RGS4 or RGS4 mutants were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Bound proteins were detected using anti-RGS4 C terminus goat polyclonal antibody (1:500) followed by donkey anti-goat IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:8000) and developed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The resulting absorbance was read at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). The magnitude of the absorbance was directly related to the bound amount of RGS4 and/or its mutant proteins, and this measurement was used to determine the dissociation constant according to the one-site binding equation. The monolayer surface pressure (π), defined as the change in surface tension after spreading a monolayer on a water surface, was measured by the Wilhelmy plate method with a Han-2000 microbalance designed by Dr. X. H. Han in our laboratory (30Han X.H. Sui S.F. Yang F.Y. Thin Solid Films. 1996; 284/285: 789-792Google Scholar). The temperature was controlled at 20.0 ± 1.0 °C. Phospholipid monolayers were formed from a chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v) stock solution of PC, PS, or PA (250 μg/ml). The experiments were performed as follows. The circular trough used for the penetration assay was filled with 3 ml of Pipes buffer (10 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Then, the phospholipid monolayers were prepared by carefully spreading aliquots of phospholipid solution on the buffer surface. After the film pressure stabilized at a constant value (defined as the initial surface pressure (πi)), RGS4 was injected through a side sample hole into the subphase containing a magnetic stirring bar. The pressure changes were recorded until the increase of surface pressure (Δπ) reached a maximal value. To measure the ability of RGS4 to insert into the phospholipid monolayers, the values of Δπ at 270 nm RGS4 were plotted as a function of varied initial surface pressure (πi). The plot of Δπ versusπi yields a straight line with a negative slope that intersects the abscissa at a limiting surface pressure. This limiting surface pressure is named the exclusion pressure (πex) and is the point at which RGS4 no longer penetrates into the phospholipid monolayer. Calcein-enclosed vesicles were prepared and release experiments were performed as previously reported (31Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Google Scholar). Liposomes were made from PC, PA, PE, and CHS (3:3:1:1). Calcein-containing liposomes were separated from free calcein by AcA34 chromatography and used immediately. Fluorescence was monitored on a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation was at 490 nm and emission was monitored at 520 nm. RGS4 contains two tryptophans at positions 59 and 92. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of RGS4 was measured using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 1-cm quartz fluorescence cuvette. RGS4 was incubated with the indicated liposomes at 30 °C for 30 min before measurements. For the quenching experiments, excitation was set at 295 nm instead of 280 nm to excite only Trp residues. After each addition of a quencher, the mixture was stirred and equilibrated for at least 5 min before the emission intensity at 340 nm was recorded. Background fluorescence in samples without protein was subtracted, and the data of emission fluorescence intensities were determined from the corrected spectra. Unless otherwise noted, the emission and excitation slit widths were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The temperature was maintained at 30 °C. The assay buffer was 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. For the depth quenching experiments, DPC was incorporated into the SUVs at a concentration of 10% (molar percent). Aliquots of SUVs with and without DPC were added to the cuvette containing RGS4 (3.2 μm). The F 0/F values were obtained from the corrected spectra described above by using the fluorescence intensities of samples without and with DPC labels. Acrylamide, a hydrophilic quencher, was used to determine the conformational change in hydrophilic regions of RGS4. Acrylamide was added to the assay buffer containing 1.4 μm RGS4 or RGS4 mutants plus PA vesicles (100:1 molar ratio of vesicles to proteins). The acrylamide quenching data were corrected for dilution and background contributions and fitted by the Stern-Volmer equation (32Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar):F 0/F = 1 +K SV [Q], whereF 0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, [Q] is the concentration of quencher andK SV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (m−1). Single turnover assays using ∼100 nmGαi1-[γ-32P]GTP were performed on ice as described previously (12Tu Y.P. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Google Scholar). Briefly, purified Gαi1 (2 μm) was first bound to [γ-32P]GTP in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was chilled on ice and Gαi1-[γ-32P]GTP was immediately purified by centrifugal gel filtration. The rate of Gαi1-[γ-32P]GTP hydrolysis was measured in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm free Mg2+ in the presence or absence of RGS4. 2 μm RGS4 was preincubated with the indicated lipids (25–750 μm) (Fig. 4) or 200 μm PA vesicles (Fig. 6) for 30 min at 4 °C before initiation of the reaction. In this assay, GAP activity is defined as the increase in the first-order hydrolysis rate constant (k hydrol) or is approximated as an increase in the initial rate of hydrolysis (33Wang J. Tu Y.P.

A, binding of wild type RGS4 or its mutants to PA as determined by ELISA. Each well of an ELISA plate was coated with 10 μg of PA and blocked using bovine serum albumin. Then, the wells were incubated with increasing amounts of RGS4 or its mutants as indicated in the figure. The bound proteins were analyzed using an antibody to the C terminus of RGS4.

GAP activity was assayed as in Fig. 4. Values shown are averages of three experiments ± S.D. C, acrylamide quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of RGS4 and mutants in the presence and absence of PA vesicles.

Reconstitution of m1 AchR with Gq was performed as described (22Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Google Scholar). We kept PE/CHS/PS at a constant molar ratio of 60:10:20 in our reconstituted vesicles and added PC, PS, PG, or PA at 10 mol % to evaluate the effect of different phospholipids on GAP activity of RGS4. RGS4 was added to the vesicles and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C prior to assay. Steady-state assays were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min. Data are given as increases in steady-state GTPase activity (34Tu Y.P. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Google Scholar). RGS4 was incubated with vesicles composed of the indicated phospholipids, and then unbound RGS4 was separated from the membrane-bound population by sedimentation of vesicles using ultracentrifugation. The amount of RGS4 present in each supernatant was determined by Western blotting (not shown), and the amount of RGS4 bound under each condition was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To investigate whether the binding of RGS4 to membranes depends on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles, we first examined the ability of RGS4 to bind to vesicles containing PS/PC (PS, 20 mol %), PA/PC (PA, 20 mol %), PE/PC (PE, 20 mol %), or PC alone. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that RGS4 did bind to vesicles containing anionic phospholipids in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, no RGS4 was associated with vesicles composed exclusively of the neutral phospholipids PC and PE, implying that electrostatic interaction plays a role in binding. These results are consistent with what has been observed previously (12Tu Y.P. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Google Scholar, 13Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Google Scholar). The nature of the binding interaction between RGS4 and PA was further investigated using liposome association experiments. PE/CHS/PA liposomes (400 μm) containing constant CHS (10 mol %) and varying mole fractions of PA (0–30 mol %) were prepared and incubated with RGS4 (1 μm). The amount of RGS4 bound was quantitated as described above, and plotted as a function of the concentration of PA. The results of the liposome association experiment are shown in Fig. 1 B. Notably, a significant increase in RGS4-PA association was observed at more than 10 mol % PA. The data was plotted and fit to the Hill equation for receptor-ligand binding (35Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Google Scholar). Using a sigmoidal fit, the half-maximal binding affinity (apparent K d) of RGS4 for PA was estimated to be 8 ± 1 mol % PA. A Hill coefficient of about 2.5 was also obtained, suggesting positive cooperativity of binding of RGS4 to membranes. This observation may reflect cooperative sequestering of PA around RGS4. To corroborate these results, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer, a more sensitive assay, to monitor the association of RGS4 with vesicle membranes. Dansyl-PE, labeled at the head group of phospholipids, accepts tryptophan-donated energy from the protein and undergoes a change in its fluorescence intensity as the protein binds to phospholipid vesicles (28Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, there were significant increases in 515 nm fluorescence when anionic phospholipid vesicles were titrated with RGS4, whereas no fluorescence energy transfer was observed in the presence of the vesicles composed exclusively of PC. This result further confirms that RGS4 binding to phospholipid vesicles requires the presence of anionic phospholipids. Whereas we have not attempted to analyze the selectivity of RGS4 among phospholipids in great detail, PA was the most efficient anionic phospholipid tested in facilitating its binding to liposomes. This is surprising because other phospholipids, such as cardiolipin, have higher negative charge density than PA. We therefore studied the effect of increasing ionic strength on RGS4-PA interaction and the results are shown in Fig. 1 D. At each concentration of RGS4 tested (0.5 and 1.5 μm), its binding to PA/PC (400 μmPA, 20 mol %) vesicles is weak in the absence of salt. RGS4/lipid vesicle binding progressively increases up to 100 mm NaCl, after which additional increases in salt concentration (up to 1m) diminish the binding. Protein/lipid binding cannot be completely blocked even at 1 m NaCl, suggesting that other forces besides electrostatic interactions (e.g. hydrophobic interactions) may have a role in stabilizing the RGS4-PA interaction. It has been previously reported that PA can induce membrane regions to adopt a concave surface contour and to form a hexagonal phase (36Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Google Scholar). It is possible that such distinctive properties of PA may contribute to its strong enhancement of RGS4 binding to membranes. It should be mentioned that data shown in this paper used N-terminal His6-tagged RGS4, but similar results were obtained in experiments using untagged RGS4 (data not shown). Whereas the binding of RGS4 to phospholipid vesicles appears to be dependent on anionic phospholipids, it is unclear whether RGS4 simply attaches on the surface of membranes or inserts into the phospholipid bilayer. To answer this question, we utilize the monolayer technique to evaluate the capability of RGS4 penetrating into membranes. First we measured the penetration of RGS4 into an air/water interface without spread to the phospholipid monolayer to acquire the appropriate conditions of the following experiments. The maximal increase of surface pressure induced by RGS4 itself was found to be 23.5 mN/m and the minimal concentration of RGS4 to reach such a maximum was 270 nm. Therefore, we kept the initial surface pressures (πi) of phospholipid monolayers spread onto the subphase surface at 23.5 mN/m or higher and the concentration of RGS4 injected into the subphase at 270 nm in the following experiments. Subsequently, we monitored the insertion of RGS4 into PA monolayers. Our results indicated that 270 nm RGS4 dramatically increased the surface pressure of the PA monolayer, whereas injecting only buffer or proteinase K-treated RGS4 did not alter the surface pressure (data not shown). It has been previously established that proteins that exclusively interact with the phospholipid surface headgroups do not increase the surface pressure of the monolayer (for review see Ref. 37Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Google Scholar). Therefore, a change in the surface pressure (Δπ) following the addition of RGS4 indicates that this protein inserted into the phospholipid monolayer. We also measured Δπ for RGS4 under different initial surface pressures, πi (Fig. 2). The resulting plot of Δπ versus πi yielded a straight line with a negative slope that intersects the abscissa at the limiting surface pressure, πex. πex is the maximum surface pressure at which RGS4 can penetrate into the different phospholipid monolayers (37Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Google"
https://openalex.org/W2101043399,"The spatio-temporal relationship between a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and externalization of phosphatidylserines (PS) during induction of apoptosis was investigated in single freshly isolated hepatocytes. Apoptosis was induced in the hepatocytes in three different ways: attack by activated Natural Killer cells, exposure to ATP, or exposure to the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide. Fluorescence microscopy showed staining of externalized PS at those areas where the staining for MMP was lost whereas in other areas the mitochondria remained intact for longer periods of time, indicating coupling between local loss of MMP and local PS exposure. To discriminate whether the decrease in MMP itself or a decrease in ATP induced PS externalization, hepatocytes were treated with rotenone, which resulted in a rapid collapse of cellular ATP but left the MMP intact for a much longer period. Addition of fructose prevented the decrease of ATP to ∼307 and also delayed the collapse of the MMP. This indicates that ATP was needed for the maintenance of the MMP probably via reverse action of the ATP synthase. In a subsequent study hepatocytes were incubated with Natural Killer cells for induction of apoptosis followed by addition of rotenone to deplete ATP. Under these conditions the PS staining co-localized with mitochondrial MMP indicating that PS externalization does not require a collapse in MMP. Moreover, exposure of PS was evenly distributed over the whole plasma membrane. In conclusion, we propose that after an apoptotic stimulus some mitochondria start to loose their MMP, which results in cessation of ATP production and perhaps even consumption of ATP. This results in an overall decrease in cellular ATP. ATP-consuming enzyme reactions most distal from still intact mitochondria will be most sensitive to such a decrease. Apparently the translocase that keeps phosphatidylserines inward-oriented is such a sensitive enzyme."

Little is known about this signal transduction pathway and the role of the α subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (αGMR) in modulating transporter activity. We examined the function of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake and found that PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, completely blocked the GM-CSF-dependent increase of glucose uptake in Xenopus oocytes expressing the low affinity αGMR and in human cells expressing the high affinity αβGMR complex. We identified a Src homology 3 domain-binding motif in αGMR at residues 358–361 as a potential interaction site for the PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit, p85. Physical evidence for p85 binding to αGMR was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies to αGMR and p85, and an αGMR mutant with alteration of the Src homology 3 binding domain lost the ability to bind p85. Experiments with a construct eliminating most of the intracellular portion of αGMR showed a 50% reduction in GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake with residual activity blocked by wortmannin. Searching for a proximally generated diffusible factor capable of activating PI 3-kinase, we identified hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), generated by ligand or antibody binding to αGMR, as the initiating factor. Catalase treatment abrogated GM-CSF- or anti-αGMR antibody-stimulated glucose uptake in αGMR-expressing oocytes, and H2O2 activated PI 3-kinase and led to some stimulation of glucose uptake in uninjected oocytes. Human myeloid cell lines and primary explant human lymphocytes expressing high affinity GM-CSF receptors responded to αGMR antibody with increased glucose uptake. These results identify the early events in the stimulation of glucose uptake by GM-CSF as involving local H2O2 generation and requiring PI 3-kinase activation.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1145Google Scholar). The receptor for GM-CSF is composed of two subunits, α (αGMR) and β (βGMR), and is found on hematopoietic cells, myeloid progenitors, mature granulocytes, and mononuclear phagocytes (2McKinstry W.J.

The isolated αGMR binds GM-CSF with low affinity (K d 2–5 nm) and forms a complex with βGMR to create the high affinity receptor (K d 30 pm). While the GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-3 receptors share a common β chain (βGMR), the α subunit is unique to each receptor and determines the binding specificity and the distinct responses mediated by each ligand (13Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 159-162Google Scholar, 14Geijsen N. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 19-25Google Scholar). The βGMR subunit plays a central role in GM-CSF cell signaling (15Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Google Scholar); however, the α subunit is also required for signaling mediated by the high affinity receptor beyond its role in ligand binding (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531Google Scholar, 17Moon B.G. Yoshida T. Shiiba M. Nakao K. Katsuki M. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Immunology. 2001; 102: 289-300Google Scholar). A direct signaling function for an isolated α subunit was recently elucidated by the finding that the α IL-5 receptor interacts with syntenin, inducing IL-5-mediated transcriptional responses (18Geijsen N. Uings I.J. Pals C. Armstrong J. McKinnon M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1136-1138Google Scholar). It has long been known that cytokines like IL-3 and GM-CSF modulate glucose uptake in hematopoietic cells (19Whetton A.D. Bazill G.W. Dexter T.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 123: 73-78Google Scholar, 20Nefesh I. Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Golembo M. Ben-Neriah Y. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 827-831Google Scholar, 21Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Bazill G.W.

Stimulation of cellular glucose uptake by cytokines is believed to be part of their function as survival factors by enhancing the availability of substrate for energy generation required for cell metabolism (25Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Google Scholar). Non-hematopoietic cells expressing high affinity GMR and melanoma cells expressing an isolated αGMR also respond to GM-CSF by increasing glucose uptake (12Zambrano A. Noli C. Rauch M.C. Werner E. Brito M. Amthauer R. Slebe J.C. Vera J.C. Concha I.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 625-634Google Scholar, 26Spielholz C. Heaney M.L. Morrison M.E. Houghton A.N. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 973-980Google Scholar). We previously found that Xenopus oocytes expressing only the isolated αGMR respond to GM-CSF with increased glucose uptake (27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). The only physiological signaling role tentatively assigned to the low affinity GM-CSF receptor, independent of the βGMR, is the regulation of glucose uptake (22Tan A.S. Ahmed N. Berridge M.V. Blood. 1998; 91: 649-655Google Scholar, 27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). The in vivo relevance of GM-CSF in mediating glucose uptake was demonstrated in the development of preimplantation embryos in mice where an isolated αGMR is expressed without βGMR. Signaling through this low affinity receptor is associated with increased glucose uptake and enhanced proliferation and viability of blastomeres (28Robertson S.A. Sjoblom C. Jasper M.J. Norman R.J. Seamark R.F. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1206-1215Google Scholar). Studies with bone marrow from βGMR-null mice, however, have suggested that βGMR may be required for GM-CSF signaling for glucose transport in mouse bone marrow cells (29Scott C.L. Hughes D.A. Cary D. Nicola N.A. Begley C.G. Robb L. Blood. 1998; 92: 4119-4127Google Scholar). Neoplastic transformation and viral infection increase cellular glucose uptake through augmented facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) expression on the cell surface (30Medina R.A. Owen G.I. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 9-26Google Scholar, 31Siegert W. Monch T. Blut. 1981; 43: 297-305Google Scholar, 32Corkey R.F. Corkey B.E. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 106: 425-434Google Scholar). Similarly insulin and certain growth factors cause increased GLUT translocation to the cell membrane that is dependent on activation of PI 3-kinase and its downstream targets (33Ishizuka T. Kajita K. Miura A. Ishizawa M. Kanoh Y. Itaya S. Kimura M. Muto N. Mune T. Morita H. Yasuda K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E196-E204Google Scholar, 34Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Google Scholar). Up-regulation of glucose transport in a cell model for chronic myeloid leukemia is also mediated via activation of PI 3-kinase (35Bentley J. Walker I. McIntosh E. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Baldwin S.A. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 212-215Google Scholar). The ability of GM-CSF to decrease the apparentK m of GLUT1 without changing theV max suggests that initial signaling from the GMR results in modulation of the intrinsic properties of the transporters (26Spielholz C. Heaney M.L. Morrison M.E. Houghton A.N. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 973-980Google Scholar, 36Ahmed N. Kansara M. Berridge M.V. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 369-375Google Scholar, 37Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Google Scholar). GM-CSF also signals for increased transport of the oxidized form of vitamin C, as dehydroascorbic acid, through GLUT1 by a similar mechanism (37Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Golde D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 2536-2546Google Scholar). To elucidate this signaling process and the role of the isolated αGMR, we undertook experiments in frog oocytes expressing αGMR and human cells expressing both the αGMR and βGMR subunits. The results reported here point to a central role for PI 3-kinase in signaling for increased glucose uptake and indicate that hydrogen peroxide generated proximally at the receptor is a key initial signaling event. 293T cells (38Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1%l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Neutrophilic and promyelocytic HL-60 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Leukopacks from normal donor blood were provided by the New York Blood Center, and the lymphocytes were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation followed by plastic adherence depletion of monocytes/macrophages. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid containing human αGMR cDNA cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) was linearized with NotI. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol, and RNA was transcribed in vitro(Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V and VI oocytes were harvested from the ovaries of adult female Xenopus laevis frogs (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson, WI) and cultured in OR2 (Bufferad Inc.) as described previously (27Ding D.X.

After 48 h of culture, 20 ng of capped mRNA in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate water was microinjected into the vegetal pole of the oocytes as described previously (27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). Glucose uptake experiments were performed 48 h postinjection. αGMR mutants were generated in pcDNA4/His-V5c (Invitrogen). RNA was generated by in vitro transcription of these plasmids, linearized with XhoI, and injected as described. The uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) by Xenopus oocytes was measured as described previously (27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes (15 per group) were incubated with GM-CSF (1 nm) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or the antibodies S20 (0.4 μg/ml) (recognizing an extracellular epitope of αGMR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), 17A (0.4 μg/ml) (recognizing an extracellular epitope of αGMR, Sigma), or N20 (0.4 μg/ml) (recognizing the extracellular portion of βGMR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h. Oocytes were incubated with 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and DOG to a final concentration of 0.1–0.4 μCi/ml and 0.2 mm, respectively. After 10 min at room temperature, DOG uptake was terminated by dilution with OR2, and the oocytes were washed with cold OR2 medium four times. Oocytes were then lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS, and the amount of radioactive DOG trapped intracellularly was measured by scintillation counting. The uptake of DOG in HL-60, U937 cells, and human lymphocytes was measured as described above. Catalase (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1900 or 3800 units/ml for 5 min before GM-CSF treatment. 293T cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) in 100-mm plates at 50% confluence with 5 μg of plasmids for αGMR, αGMR-PA, αGMR-A351, or αGMR-YA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cleared lysates were further treated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Anti-αGMR antibody S20 was added at 1 μg per sample for 2 h, and the antibodies were captured on protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer four times, and the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Anti-αGMR antibodies C18 and S50 and anti-p85 antibody were used for detection of αGMR and p85, respectively. Lysates from HL-60 cells with or without treatment with GM-CSF were incubated with 1 μg of anti-αGMR antibody (S20) for 16 h at 4 °C on an oscillating platform. Protein G-agarose (20 μg) was then added and left for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein G beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The supernatants were removed carefully, and the beads were resuspended with 1× sample loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C before separation by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting to analyze the PI 3-kinase (p85) was performed in the following manner. Nonspecific sites were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline before incubating the blot with anti-p85 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 16 h at 4 °C at a final dilution of 1:1000 in fresh blocking buffer. The membrane was washed three times in Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:4000 in blocking buffer, and washed with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, and proteins were revealed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Human αGMR was subcloned into HindIII and NotI sites of pcDNA4/His-V5c (Invitrogen) using the following 5′ primer: GCCGCAAGCTTAGCACCATGCTTCTCCTGGT GACA-3′. The reverse primer for full-length αGMR was GATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCGGTAATTTCCTTCACGGT to generate plasmid αGMR. The reverse primer for the carboxyl-terminal deletion αGMR-A351 was 5′-TTTAAAAGGTTCCTTAGGGCGGCCGCTAAACTATC-3′. Site-specific mutants were generated in the plasmid αGMR using a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, αGMR-containing plasmid was denatured and annealed with oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. The following primers were used for proline substitution by alanine: forward primer, 5′-CTTAGGATACAGCGGCTGTTCGCAGCAGTTGCACAGATCAAAGACAACTGAAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATTCAGTTTGTCTTTGATCTGTGCAACTGCTGCGAACA GCCGCTGTA TCCTAAG-3′. For tyrosine substitution by alanine the forward primer was 5′-ATCATCTGGGAGGAATTCACCCCAGAGGAAGGGAAAGGCGCACGCGAAGAGGT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GACCTCTTCGCGTGCGCCTTTCCCTTCCTCTGGGGTGAAT TCCTCCCAGATGAT-3′. The mutagenic primers were incorporated usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The non-mutagenic methylated parental DNA template was digested with DpnI. The resultant circular nicked double-stranded DNA was transformed into XL10-Gold ultra competent cells (Stratagene). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the resultant plasmids. We investigated the role of PI 3-kinase in GM-CSF-stimulated transport of glucose in Xenopus oocytes expressing the human αGMR. Oocytes injected with αGMR RNA expressed αGMR as detected by immunoblotting using an anti-αGMR antibody, C18 (Fig.1 A). Reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated that Xenopus oocytes do not express a βGMR transcript detectable by primers specific for human βGMR (data not shown). Also βGMR protein was not detectable by immunoblotting using anti-human β subunit antibody. These results are consistent with our previous finding that oocytes expressing the αGMR had only low affinity GM-CSF binding. Oocytes expressing the αGMR and incubated with 1 nm GM-CSF for 1 h showed a 2-fold increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 1 B) (27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). The increase in glucose uptake was completely inhibited by incubation with 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min prior to GM-CSF treatment, while the vehicle control buffer had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Wortmannin is a highly specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (39Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar), and the inhibitory effect of wortmannin was dose-dependent and did not affect the basal level of glucose transport. The IC50for inhibition of GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake by wortmannin was 2 nm (Fig. 1 C). LY294002, a structurally distinct synthetic inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, also suppressed GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake. At 50 μm, LY294002 completely inhibited GM-CSF-induced glucose uptake with no effect on basal glucose transport (Fig. 1 D). In these experiments the vehicle control (ethanol) slightly inhibited the stimulation by GM-CSF, but the effect of LY294002 was dose-dependent with IC50 of 2 μm. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in αGMR-dependent signaling for glucose transport. GM-CSF induces glucose uptake in human cells expressing the high affinity receptors αGMR and βGMR (27Ding D.X. Rivas C.I. Heaney M.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2537-2541Google Scholar). We evaluated the effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin on GM-CSF-induced glucose uptake in neutrophilic HL-60 cells (40Tomonaga M. Gasson J.C. Quan S.G. Golde D.W. Blood. 1986; 67: 1433-1441Google Scholar). Cells treated with 1 nm GM-CSF showed a 2.1-fold increase in glucose uptake that was completely inhibited by 50 nm wortmannin (Fig.1 F). These results suggest that signaling for GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake in cells expressing the high affinity receptor is also PI 3-kinase-dependent. To investigate the mechanism of activation of PI 3-kinase pathway by αGMR we performed experiments to determine whether the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85) interacts with αGMR. The αGMR monoclonal antibody S20 was used to immunoprecipitate cellular extracts from HL-60 cells treated or untreated with GM-CSF. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-p85 antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, there is a ligand-independent interaction between αGMR and p85. The interaction between αGMR and p85 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-p85 antibody and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-αGMR antibody (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate a physical interaction between PI 3-kinase and αGMR. p85 associates with αGMR whose cytoplasmic domain has 54 amino acid residues. We identified an SH-3 domain-binding motif consisting of a proline-rich segment (PPVP) proximal to the transmembrane domain of the αGMR that could potentially be an anchoring site for p85. Distal to this region near the carboxyl terminus is the only tyrosine residue in the carboxyl terminus. To investigate the role of these residues, alanine substitution mutations were introduced whereby proline-rich SH-3 domain-binding region (PPVP) was changed (AAVA) using site-directed mutagenesis to generate the plasmid αGMR-PA, and the tyrosine residue was mutated (Y389A) to generate the plasmid αGMR-YA. We also generated a truncation mutant, αGMR-A351, that carries a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain retaining only four amino acid residues proximal to the transmembrane domain. A schematic representation of the αGMR constructs is shown in Fig. 3 A. Wild type or mutant plasmid cDNA was transfected into 293T cells, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-αGMR antibody (S20), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-p85 antibody. While the wild type receptor showed binding to p85, there was loss of binding to the truncation mutant αGMR-A351 and to the αGMR-PA (Fig. 3 B, top panel). The mutant αGMR-YA, however, retained binding, suggesting that the proline motif is critical for binding to p85 in quiescent cells. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-αGMR antibodies. C18 antibody recognizes an intracellular epitope and therefore does not recognize the truncation mutant αGMR-A351. Antibody S50 against an extracellular epitope was used to detect the expression of all the constructs (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). These results point to the proline-rich motif as the site of p85 binding to αGMR. RNA from the wild type (αGMR) and mutant plasmids αGMR-A351, αGMR-PA, and αGMR-YA was injected into oocytes and tested for the ability to mediate increased glucose uptake in response to GM-CSF (Fig.4 A). GM-CSF-treated oocytes expressing wild type αGMR showed a 2.5-fold increase in glucose uptake; however, oocytes injected with βGMR RNA alone did not respond to GM-CSF. GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake in oocytes expressing the αGMR mutant αGMR-PA was decreased but not eliminated (Fig.4 A). When the truncation mutant of the cytoplasmic domain of αGMR-A351 was used in the same experiment there was approximately a 50% decrease in the stimulated glucose uptake compared with the wild type receptor. The αGMR-YA mutant mediated a moderately attenuated glucose uptake compared with the wild type αGMR (Fig. 4 A). The expression levels of the different αGMR constructs were comparable (data not shown). We addressed the question whether the residual glucose uptake induced by GM-CSF through αGMR-A351 is dependent on PI 3-kinase. Oocytes injected with αGMR-A351 and wild type αGMR were preincubated with wortmannin and treated with GM-CSF. As shown in Fig. 4 Bwortmannin inhibited the stimulation of glucose uptake in the truncation mutant. These results indicate that GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake is attenuated by deletion of the intracellular domain of αGMR but that the residual activity is also dependent on PI 3-kinase. These results imply that there is PI 3-kinase activation by GM-CSF even when p85 cannot bind to αGMR. It is known that GM-CSF uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) as second messenger molecules in its signaling pathway (41Carcamo J.M. Borquez-Ojeda O. Golde D.W. Blood. 2002; 99: 3205-3212Google Scholar, 42Sattler M. Winkler T. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 2928-2935Google Scholar) and that ROS in the form of hydrogen peroxide has a role in stimulating glucose uptake (43Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Google Scholar, 44Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21938-21942Google Scholar). We hypothesized that GM-CSF binding to the low affinity receptor generates H2O2 extracellularly, and H2O2 diffuses through the plasma membrane to activate PI 3-kinase. Oocytes expressing αGMR or the truncation mutant receptor αGMR-A351 were incubated with different concentrations of catalase for 5 min before treatment with GM-CSF. As shown in the Fig. 5 A catalase markedly inhibited GM-CSF-stimulated glucose uptake indicating a key role for H2O2 in stimulating glucose transport. To further establish the role of H2O2 in stimulated glucose uptake we directly tested the effect of peroxide on glucose uptake in control oocytes and oocytes expressing αGMR constructs. Exposure to 50 μmH2O2 for 30 min caused about 2-fold stimulation of glucose uptake in oocytes expressing αGMR (Fig. 5 B). Oocytes injected with αGMR-A351 showed only a 1.3-fold activation in response to H2O2, a result similar to that in uninjected oocytes (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate a role for H2O2 in stimulating glucose transport and show that αGMR plays an important but not essential role in mediating the response. The activation of glucose transport in the truncation mutant is similar to uninjected oocytes indicating that PI 3-kinase can be activated by H2O2 in oocytes. We further tested the effect of wortmannin on H2O2-induced glucose uptake in oocytes injected with αGMR or the truncation mutant αGMR-A351. As in GM-CSF-stimulated oocytes, the peroxide-induced stimulation of glucose uptake in oocytes expressing wild type or mutant αGMR was inhibited by 25 nm wortmannin (Fig. 5 C). These findings link peroxide generation to PI 3-kinase activation and indicate the role of p85 binding site in αGMR in the stimulation of glucose uptake. It has been shown that antibody-antigen interaction can lead to the generation of hydrogen peroxide (45Wentworth Jr., P. Jones L.H. Wentworth A.D. Zhu X. Larsen N.A. Wilson I.A. Xu X. Goddard III, W.A. Janda K.D. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1806-1811Google Scholar). We reasoned that, similar to ligand, antibody to αGMR could lead to the generation of H2O2 and stimulation of glucose uptake. We investigated whether the commercially available anti-αGMR antibodies S20 and 17A, which recognize the extracellular region of αGMR, could stimulate glucose uptake. Fig.6 A shows that anti-αGMR monoclonal antibodies S20 and 17A stimulated glucose transport about 2-fold in oocytes injected with αGMR. In contrast, the polyclonal antibody N20 that recognizes an extracellular epitope of βGMR had no effect. Oocytes injected with H2O and incubated with GM-CSF, S20, 17A, and N20 antibodies showed no stimulation of glucose uptake. Oocytes expressing αGMR and incubated with the antibodies 17A and S20 for 15 min showed an increase in glucose uptake of about 2-fold. After 60 min of incubation, similar levels of stimulation of glucose uptake were induced by the antibodies and GM-CSF (Fig.6 B). The stimulation of glucose uptake by S20 antibody w"

A rare type of collagen mutation consists of a duplication or deletion of one or two Gly-X-Y triplets. These mutations shift the register of collagen chains with respect to each other in the helix but do not interrupt the triplet sequence, yet they have severe clinical consequences. We investigated the effect of shifting the register of the collagen helix by a single Gly-X-Y triplet on collagen assembly, stability, and incorporation into fibrils and matrix. These studies utilized a triplet duplication in COL1A1 exon 44 that occurred in the cDNA and gDNA of two siblings with lethal OI. The normal allele encodes three identical Gly-Ala-Hyp triplets at aa 868–876, whereas the mutant allele encodes four. The register shift delays helix formation, causing overmodification. Differential scanning calorimetry yielded a decrease in T m of 2 °C for helices with one mutant chain and a 6 °C decrease in helices with two mutant chains. An in vitro binary co-processing assay of N-proteinase cleavage demonstrated that procollagen with the triplet duplication has slower N-propeptide cleavage than in normal controls or procollagen with proα1(I) G832S, G898S, or G997S substitutions, showing that the register shift persists through the entire helix. The register shift disrupts incorporation of mutant collagen into fibrils and matrix. Proband fibrils formed inefficiently in vitroand contained only normal helices and helices with a single mutant chain. Helices with two mutant chains and a significant portion of helices with one mutant chain did not form fibrils. In matrix deposited by proband fibroblasts, mutant chains were abundant in the immaturely cross-linked fraction but constituted a minor fraction of maturely cross-linked chains. The profound effects of shifting the collagen triplet register on chain interactions in the helix and on fibril formation correlate with the severe clinical consequences.

Its most significant clinical feature is skeletal fragility, causing the bones of affected individuals to be susceptible to fracture from minimal trauma or nontraumatic impact (1Van der Hoeve J. de Kleyn A. Arch. Ophthal. 1918; 95: 81-93Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Other symptoms of OI include short stature, blue sclerae, joint laxity, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and hearing loss (2Marini J.C. Chernoff E.J. Cassidy S.B. Allanson J.E. Management of Genetic Syndromes. Wiley-Liss, New York2001: 281-300Google Scholar). The severity of OI varies widely, ranging from perinatal lethal to barely detectable, as delineated by the Sillence classification (3Sillence D.O. Senn A. Danks D.M. J. Med. Genet. 1979; 16: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). The full clinical spectrum of OI is caused by defects in the structure or synthesis of type I collagen, the most abundant protein of the extracellular matrix of bone, skin, and tendon (4Byers P.H. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar, 5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Defects in COL1A1 that result in the synthesis of half the normal amount of collagen cause the mildest form of the disease (OI type I) (6Willing M.C. Deschenes S.P. Scott D.A. Byers P.H. Slayton R.L. Pitts S.H. Arikat H. Roberts E.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 638-647PubMed Google Scholar). The clinically significant forms of OI (OI types II, III, and IV) are caused by structural defects in either the α1(I) or α2(I) chains. Over 250 such mutations have now been delineated in individuals with OI (7Dalgleish R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Dalgleish R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The overwhelming majority (about 85%) are point mutations that result in the substitution of the glycine residue in a typical collagen tripeptide, Gly-X-Y, by another amino acid. Substitution mutations are thought to exert a detrimental effect on collagen function, because their side chains are larger than that of glycine and cause local interference with the folding of the triple helix (9Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Willing M.C. J. Med. Genet. 1991; 28: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A smaller fraction (about 10%) of collagen mutations result in single exon skipping. These mutations maintain the Gly-X-Y triplet pattern but may cause local looping out of chains in the triple helix (4Byers P.H. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar). An even less common set of structural mutations is located in the C-terminal propeptide. Since the C-propeptide is cleaved from the mature collagen molecule before incorporation into fibrils, the mutant region of the chain is not incorporated into matrix. Instead, they are thought to exert their effect by delaying the incorporation of the mutant chains into collagen trimer (10Pace J.M. Kuslich C.D. Willing M.C. Byers P.H. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: 443-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional rare and interesting group of mutations consists of deletions or duplications of the codons for one or two Gly-X-Y triplets. Only 10 cases of single triplet deletion or duplication have been reported (11Hawkins J.R. Superti-Furga A. Steinmann B. Dalgleish R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22370-22374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Starman B.J. Byers P.H. J. Biol.

Mutat. 2001; 18: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including five deletions and three duplications in the α1(I) chain and 2 deletions in the α2(I) chain. There are also four cases involving deletion or duplication of two triplets, all in the α2(I) chain (14Pace J.M. Atkinson M. Willing M.C. Wallis G.A. Byers P.H. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 18: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Horwitz E.M. Prockop D.J. Fitzpatrick L.A. Koo W.W. Gordon P.L. Neel M. Sussman M. Orchard P. Marx J.C. Pyeritz R.E. Brenner M.K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). These mutations are of special interest because they must disrupt collagen functioning by a mechanism quite different from that initiated by glycine substitutions. A priori, one might have expected mild functional defects from mutations that shift the Gly-X-Y register of the collagen helix by a single triplet unit rather than interrupt helix folding in the manner of a glycine substitution. In fact, small register shifts cause a lethal or severe phenotype. Determinations of helix stability and procollagen processing were reported for two lethal cases with deletion of one of the three Gly-Ala-Hyp triplets at aa 868–876 in α1(I) exon 44 (11, 12). These deletions decreased collagen helixT m by only 0–1 °C. Processing of proband collagen by pericellular enzymes and purified N-proteinase was indistinguishable from normal, as was cleavage by vertebral collagenase. The processing data led investigators to propose that there was limited propagation of the register shift toward the N-terminal end of the procollagen trimer. We report here a single triplet duplication in α1(I)E44 in siblings with lethal type II OI. Determinations of thermal stability and N-protease cleavage indicate that the register shift is propagated the full length of the collagen helix. In vitro fibrillogenesis and matrix deposition studies demonstrate that presence of the register shift impairs incorporation into fibrils and cross-linking into matrix. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of register shift mutations in collagen disorders. The probands were the male and female offspring of a 22-year-old gravida II para1 (G2P1) mother and a 25-year-old father, born at 32 and 37 weeks gestation, respectively. Prenatal ultrasound at 18–22 weeks gestation detected a short-limbed skeletal dysplasia in each child. The male child was delivered vaginally with forceps due to breech presentation. Weight was appropriate for age (2013 g), but crown to heel length was 38 cm (50% for 28 weeks gestation). At delivery, he had a soft skull with an anterior laceration, draining blood and cerebrospinal fluid, a narrow chest, and bowed extremities. He died 1 h after birth. The female child was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Birth weight was appropriate for age (2770 g), but length was short (43 cm; 50% for 32 weeks gestation). Deformities noted at birth included a soft cranium with mineralized bone only on lateral portions of the skull, blue sclerae, a high arched palate, and a narrow chest. Extremities had rhizomelic shortening and bowing and were abducted into an extreme frog-legged position. Radiograms showed multiple fractures of ribs and all long bones. The infant died at age 1 month of respiratory insufficiency. Cultures established from dermal biopsies were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with 10% serum and 2 mm glutamine. For large scale procollagen preparation, confluent cells of Proband 1, father, control, and α1(I) G832S, G898S, and G997S were treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbate in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Medium was harvested at 24-h intervals for 2 days and brought to 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm EDTA, 0.2% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Ammonium sulfate-precipitated procollagen was collected by centrifugation. To label steady state procollagens, confluent cells were incubated without serum for 2 h with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and then 16 h with 260 μCi/ml 3.96 TBq/mmoll-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline. Procollagens were harvested, and collagen was prepared as described (16Bonadio J. Holbrook K.A. Gelinas R.E. Jacob J. Byers P.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). α1(I) exon 41–49 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using 1 μg of RNA, 20 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and oligo(dT). The cDNA was amplified by PCR (19Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A.

Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 5 min; then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 72 °C for 7 min. 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized for the aa 787–1173 region of α1(I) collagen (20Grange D.K. Gottesman G.S. Lewis M.B. Marini J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4227-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Riboprobe and exon 41–49 cDNA were mixed for DNA:RNA hybrid analysis, as described (20Grange D.K. Gottesman G.S. Lewis M.B. Marini J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4227-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, cDNA amplification used a sense primer in exon 43 (5′-CCTGGACGAGACGGTTCTCCTGGCGCCAAG-3′) and an antisense primer complementary to exon 45 (5′-GCCGACAGGACCGGCGGGACCAGCAGGACC-3′). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 69 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and finally 72 °C for 7 min. For genomic PCR, DNA was isolated from parental leukocytes and proband fibroblasts with the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Reactions used 500 ng of DNA and 1.0 units of Amplitaq. The sense primer corresponded to nt 13240–13269 of COL1A1 intron 43 genomic sequence (5′-TGACCCATATTCCCCTGCTCTCCCCGCCAG-3′), and the antisense primer was complementary to nt 13378–13407 (5′-GGTACAGGGAACTGGAGCCCAGCTACTTAC-3′) in intron 44.

RT-PCR and genomic PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and then visualized with ethidium bromide. The exon 43–45 RT-PCR and intron 43–44 gDNA PCR products were subcloned and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) with the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Biosciences). The sequencing primer for cDNA subclones corresponded to cDNA nt 3189–3218 in α1(I) exon 43 (5′-CCTGGACGAGACGGTTCTCCTGGCGCCAAG-3′). The sequencing primer for genomic DNA subclones corresponded to COL1A1 nt 13240–13269 in intron 43 (5′-TGACCCATATTCCCCTGCTCTCCCCGCCAG-3′). Confluent fibroblasts were stimulated every other day for 9 days with 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid and then incubated for 24 h with 260 μCi/ml [3H]proline in serum-free medium. Procollagens in media were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Matrix collagens were serially extracted, as described (22Bateman J.F. Golub S.B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, newly synthesized collagens were extracted for 24 h with neutral salt (0.15 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Collagens with acid-labile cross-links were extracted for 24 h with 0.5 m acetic acid. Collagens with mature cross-links were extracted by pepsin digestion (0.1 mg/ml) for 24 h. All matrix fractions were precipitated with 2 m NaCl. Confluent fibroblasts were stimulated every other day for 9 days with 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid, incubated for 48 h with 260 μCi/ml [3H]proline in serum-free medium, and then chased with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm nonradioactive proline. Individual cultures were harvested at 24-h intervals for 5 days, and the matrix layer was processed with protease inhibitors, as described (22Bateman J.F. Golub S.B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Matrix extracts were resuspended in 0.5 macetic acid and digested overnight with pepsin. Collagens were precipitated with 2 m NaCl. Ammonium sulfate protein precipitates were redissolved in 0.1 msodium carbonate, 0.5 M NaCl (pH 9.3) at 0.2 mg/ml collagen concentration. Cy2 and monoreactive Cy5 dyes (Amersham Biosciences) (23Southwick P.L. Ernst L.A. Tauriello E.W. Parker S.R. Mujumdar R.B. Mujumdar S.R. Clever H.A. Waggoner A.S.

Procollagen was added to lyophilized dye aliquots, 100 μl of protein solution/10 μl of dye aliquot for Cy5, and 100 μl of protein solution/50 μl of dye aliquot for Cy2 labeling, shaken for 30 min at room temperature, analyzed by SDS-PAGE for labeling efficiency, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Labeled procollagen was transferred into 50 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 4 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% Brij 35 (pH 8) on AutoSeq G-50 microspin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Collagen concentration was adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml. All possible binary mixtures of Cy2- and Cy5-labeled procollagens were prepared (e.g.C-Cy2/C-Cy5, C-Cy2/OI-INS-Cy5, C-Cy5/OI-INS-Cy2, and OI-INS-Cy2/OI-INS-Cy5 were made) to compare cleavage kinetics of C and OI-INS. N-proteinase (25Colige A. Beschin A. Samyn B. Goebels Y. Van Beeumen J. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. J. Biol.

Sample aliquots were collected at different times after the start of the reaction, mixed with a lithium dodecyl sulfate gel sample buffer (Invitrogen) with added dithiothreitol and EDTA, and rapidly frozen. Samples were analyzed on precast 6% Tris/glycine and 7% Tris acetate minigels (Invitrogen). The gels were scanned on a FLA3000 fluorescence scanner (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) at 50 × 50-μm resolution. Fractions of the cleaved proteins were determined from band intensities using PeakFit software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), corrected for the cleaved protein in the initial mix and for the effect of the fluorescent label on the cleavage by using control mixtures (e.g. C-Cy2/C-Cy5 and OI-INS-Cy2/OI-INS-Cy5 for the C versus OI-INS experiment). The effect of the fluorescent label did not exceed 10%. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Ammonium sulfate procollagen precipitate was doped with 10% Cy5-labeled procollagen. The mixture was chromatographed on two 1.6 × 5-cm columns of DEAE-cellulose (DE52; Whatman) as described (26Fiedler-Nagy C. Bruckner P. Hayashi T. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 212: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Fiedler-Nagy C. Bruckner P. Hayashi T. Fietzek P.P. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

First, the mixture was loaded in 2 m urea, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and eluted with the same buffer. Second, the mixture was loaded in 2 murea, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) and eluted with an NaCl gradient. Fractions containing procollagen on SDS-PAGE were pooled and concentrated by pressure ultrafiltration through an Amicon YM30 membrane. Procollagen was transferred into 50 mm Tris, 0.5m NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.02% Brij 35 (pH 8) and simultaneously digested by N- and C-proteinase at 32 °C. C-proteinase was the generous gift of Prof. K. E. Kadler (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). Cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Complete digestion was observed at 40–70 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Collagen was precipitated twice by 0.6 mNaCl in 0.5 m acetic acid and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE. DSC scans from 10 to 50 °C were performed at 0.125 to 1 °C/min heating rates in a Nano II DSC instrument (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., American Fork, UT) as described (29Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Pepsin digestion (∼1:10 pepsin/collagen) of ammonium sulfate precipitates in 0.5 m acetic acid at 4 °C overnight resulted in complete removal of N- and C-propeptides. To prevent fibrillogenesis, 0.1–1.2 mg/ml procollagen, full-length collagen, or pepsin-treated collagen solutions in either 2 mm HCl (pH 2.7) or 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 0.5m glycerol (pH 7.4) were used. The denaturation temperature (T m) in phosphate/glycerol buffers was used to extrapolate T m to physiological conditions (29Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), but better resolution of mutant collagen forms was achieved in 2 mm HCl. At 5 °C, full-length collagen in 2 mm HCl (pH 2.7) was mixed 1:1 with 0.26 mNaCl, 6 mm sodium phosphate (final pH 6.9), transferred into a precooled quartz cuvette (1-cm path length), and placed into a V-560 spectrophotometer (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Fibrillogenesis was initiated by a temperature jump to 36.6 °C and monitored by turbidity measurement (optical density at 350 nm, A 350) (30Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AfterA 350 reached saturation, fibers were pelleted (5 min at 10,000–14,000 × g) and redissolved in 2 mm HCl for subsequent analysis by DSC. Supernatant was dialyzed against 2 mm HCl for DSC analysis. Collagen concentration before fibrillogenesis and in supernatant after fibrillogenesis were measured by Sircol assay (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast, Northern Ireland). Aliquots from fibers and supernatant were labeled with Cy5 and analyzed on 3–8% Tris acetate or 4–12% Bis-Tris minigels (Invitrogen). The type I collagen produced by the cultured dermal fibroblasts of both probands displayed identical electrophoretic abnormalities on SDS-urea-PAGE. The α1(I) chain was doubled in width, consisting of a normal and an electrophoretically delayed form (Fig. 1 A). The α2(I) band was slightly broadened with a delayed base line. The abnormal collagen was secreted from the cell as efficiently as normal collagen. All CNBr peptides from the α1(I) chain of the proband showed both normal and electrophoretically delayed forms (Fig.1 B). Since the α1(I) chains were overmodified along their full length, the mutation was localized to the COOH-terminal quarter of either α chain. The mother had a lighter, less tightly resolved band just above the α1(I) band in cell layer collagen (not shown). This pattern is characteristic of a low percentage of α1(I) chains with excess posttranslational modification. Given the clinical information that the unaffected parents have two children with a dominant genetic disorder, this finding prompted further investigation of the mother as a likely mosaic carrier of the collagen mutation. The α1(I) and α2(I) cDNA coding for the C-terminal quarter of the collagen helix were examined by RNA:DNA hybrid analysis (20Grange D.K. Gottesman G.S. Lewis M.B. Marini J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4227-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using RNase A, we detected a mismatch in the cDNA coding for exons 41–49 of the α1(I) chain. RT-PCR screening of α1(I) cDNA localized the mismatch to exon 44 (Fig. 2 A). Both normal and more slowly migrating products were detected in the probands' cDNA. The more slowly migrating product was faintly visible in the mother's sample. This electrophoretically slower product was shown to be a heteroduplex of normal and mutant fragments. The small fraction of mutant α1(I) transcripts in maternal cells can be easily visualized because of the sensitivity of heteroduplex analysis for structurally distinct products. The localization of the collagen mutation to exon 44 was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA (Fig.2 B). Sequencing of subclones of proband cDNA exons 43–45 and proband and mother gDNA intron 43-intron 44 revealed the same relatively unusual type of collagen mutation, confirming the mother as a mosaic carrier. The mutant allele has a 9-bp insertion (5′-GGT GCT CCT-3′), coding exactly for an extra Gly-Ala-Hyp triplet (Fig.3). The insertion is a duplication in a highly repetitive region. The normal allele has two identical 9-bp sequences coding for aa 868–873 and an adjacent 9 bp that differs by only one nucleotide. The mutant allele has three of the identical 9-bp units. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms of proband collagen (OI-INS) were done at acidic and neutral pH (Fig.4). Since mutant collagen has three species (α12α2, α1(ins)α1α2, and α1(ins)2α2), up to three different peaks may be expected on thermograms. All three peaks are clearly visible at acidic pH, compared with the single normal peak of the control (father (C-F), Fig. 4). Based on relative intensity ratios determined by Gaussian deconvolution, 0.25 (35 °C):0.5 (39 °C):0.25 (41 °C), these peaks correspond to molecules with two, one, and no mutant α1 chains, respectively. Only two peaks with the melting temperature (T m) difference of ∼2 °C and a long low temperature tail can be resolved at neutral pH. The difference between thermograms at neutral and acidic pH and the change in the overallT m of the triple helix suggest that the register shift propagates through the triple helix. We compared the kinetics of N-propeptide cleavage in the insertion mutation (OI-INS), paternal control collagen (C-F), unrelated control collagen (C), and three-glycine substitution mutations in the region of α1(I) around the insertion, G832S (31Marini J.C. Grange D.K. Gottesman G.S. Lewis M.B. Koeplin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11893-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), G898S, and G997S. 2W. A. Cabral, H. Nishioka, and J. C. Marini, unpublished data. These Gly → Ser substitutions should have post-translational modification similar to that of the triplet duplication. By high pressure liquid chromatography, we determined that lysine hydroxylation of all mutant collagens was about double that of control: 21 ± 0.5% in C-F, 43 ± 1.5% in OI-INS, 40 ± 1.0% in G832S, 39 ± 0.5% in G898S, and 38 ± 1.0% in G997S. Gel migration of α1(I) chains (Fig. 1 A) indicated that all mutations had a similar extent of lysine glycosylation. Most importantly, the N-terminal CB 8 + 5 peptide of OI-INS and OI-G997S had identical glycosylation (Fig. 1 B), so the effect of overmodification on cleavage of N-propeptide from these mutant procollagens should be the same. In order to detect small differences in cleavage kinetics, we analyzed all possible binary combinations in a co-processing assay. In each pair, two proteins with different fluorescent labels were processed in the same test tube by N-protease under identical conditions, co-electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and distinguished by fluorescence scanning. This assay yielded reproducible detection of differences in cleavage kinetics as small as 5–10%. The results of N-propeptide co-processing of different mutant procollagen pairs is shown in Fig. 1,C–F. The triplet insertion causes substantially slower α1 N-propeptide cleavage than from control or glycine substitutions with equivalent overmodification. Thus, the decrease in kinetics of N-propeptide cleavage in the insertion mutation is related to the register shift per se. This supports the interpretation of the DSC thermograms that the register shift persists through the entire helix. Classical fibrillogenesis kinetics, a lag phase followed by rapid fiber growth (30Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was observed for both mutant and wild type collagens (Fig.5 A). Mutant collagen formed fibrils more slowly than control and required a higher initial concentration to achieve a similar extent of fiber formation. Virtually all control collagen formed fibers, since collagen was not detected in the fibrillogenesis supernatant. In contrast, over 20% of molecules remained in the supernatant after fibrillogenesis of proband collagen. The fraction of mutant collagen that did not form fibrils contained helices with a greater extent of posttranslational overmodification (Fig. 5 B) and, therefore, a higher content of molecules containing mutant chains. DSC thermograms (Fig. 5 C) demonstrated that only molecules with no or one mutant chain w"

We characterized thelola locus and provide evidence that it is a complex locus from which at least 17 different splice variants are likely to be generated. Fifteen of these each have a different zinc finger domain, whereas two are without. This potential for expression of multiple gene products suggests that they serve diverse functional roles in different developmental contexts. By Northern and Western blot analyses we demonstrate that the expression of Lola zf5 is developmentally regulated and that it is restricted to early embryogenesis. Immunocytochemical labeling with a Lola zf5-specific antibody of Drosophila embryos indicates that Lola zf5 is localized to nuclei. Furthermore, by creating double-mutant flies we show that a reduction of Lola protein levels resulting from mutations in the lola locus acts as a dominant modifier of a hypomorphic JIL-1 allele leading to an increase in embryonic viability. Thus, genetic interaction assays provide direct evidence that gene products from the lola locus function within the same pathway as the chromosomal kinase JIL-1.

Wang Y. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 267-277Google Scholar). We have recently identified a chromosomal tandem kinase, JIL-1, that modulates chromatin structure inDrosophila (4Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Google Scholar, 5Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J.

JIL-1 is an essential kinase, and in JIL-1 nulls and hypomorphs euchromatic regions of chromosomes are severely reduced and the chromosome arms are condensed (6Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Google Scholar). These changes are correlated with decreased levels of histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation (6Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Google Scholar). JIL-1 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, as it localizes to the gene-active interband regions of interphase larval polytene chromosomes (4Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Google Scholar) and has been found to associate with at least one chromatin-remodeling complex, the male specific lethal (MSL)1 dosage compensation complex (5Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Google Scholar). The MSL complex is required for the necessary hypertranscription of genes on the male X chromosome for dosage compensation in flies (reviewed in Ref. 7Meller V.H. Kuroda M.I. Adv. Genet. 2002; 46: 1-24Google Scholar). This enhanced transcription is thought to arise from MSL complex-induced histone H4 acetylation generating a more open chromatin structure (8Smith E.R. Pannuti A. Gu W. Seurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 312-318Google Scholar). The increased histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation levels that JIL-1 promotes on the male X may also play a role in maintaining a more open and active chromatin structure (5Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Google Scholar, 6Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether physiological substrates of JIL-1 may include other proteins such as transcription factors or whether there are proteins directly regulating the function of JIL-1. To identify proteins that interact with JIL-1 we carried out yeast two-hybrid screens using different JIL-1 regions as baits. Here we report that a novel splice form from the lola locus, which we have named Lola zf5, was identified in such a screen to interact with the first kinase domain (KDI) of JIL-1. The lola locus was first characterized as a mutation affecting longitudinal axon growth within the central nervous system (9Seeger M. Tear G. Ferres-Marco D. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 409-426Google Scholar). Two isoforms from the lola locus have been previously described, Lola long and Lola short (10Giniger E. Tietje K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1385-1398Google Scholar). Lola long contains two zinc finger motifs and is a transcription factor with DNA binding activity (10Giniger E. Tietje K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

The lola locus mediates decreased copiaretrotransposon mRNA expression in the central nervous system while upregulating its expression in gonads (11Cavarec L. Jensen S. Casella J.-F. Cristescu S.A. Heidmann T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 482-494Google Scholar). In addition,lola is required for proper expression of the axonal guidance proteins Robo and slit in the central nervous system (12Crowner D. Madden K. Goeke S. Giniger E. Development. 2002; 129: 1317-1325Google Scholar). Although both Lola isoforms share a BTB/POZ domain (13Godt D. Couderc J.L. Cramton S.E. Laski F.A.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2473-2484Google Scholar, 22Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Google Scholar, 23Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol.

In this study we characterized the genomic organization of thelola locus and show that it is a complex locus from which at least 17 different splice variants are likely to be transcribed. All isoforms from the lola locus share a common BTB domain, whereas 15 of the splice variants each contain a different zinc finger domain. We show that one of these variants, Lola zf5, physically interacts with the JIL-1 kinase and that its expression is developmentally restricted to early embryogenesis. Furthermore, we show that a P element insertion in the lola locus enhances the viability of a hypomorphic JIL-1 allele, indicating opposing functions of the JIL-1 and lola loci. Although only Lola long and Lola short have so far been studied in detail, it has long been known that P insertion mutations in lola that prevent the expression of some if not all the isoforms have very complex phenotypes (10Giniger E.

Our findings suggest that this complexity may derive from the expression pattern of multiple gene products from thelola locus that are likely to serve diverse functional roles in different cellular and developmental contexts. Fly stocks were maintained according to standard protocols (29Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1986Google Scholar). Oregon-R was used for wild type preparations.JIL-1 EP(3)3657 and JIL-1 z2alleles have been previously described (6Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M.

Hatch rates were determined by counting the number of eggs laid on standard apple juice/agar plates and then counting the number of unhatched eggs at 22 h and again at 48 h after egg laying. All genetic crosses and interaction assays were conducted at 23 °C. JIL-1 cDNA sequence encoding a 304-amino acid fragment (Tyr251-Glu554) comprising the first kinase domain (JIL-1 KDI) of JIL-1 was subcloned in-frame into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pGBKT7 (Clontech) using standard methods (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and verified by sequencing (Iowa State University Sequencing Facility). The JIL-1 KDI bait was used to screen the Clontech MatchmakerTM 0–21 h embryonic Canton-S yeast two-hybrid cDNA library according to the manufacturer's instructions. A positive cDNA clone KDIJ1 was isolated, retransformed into yeast cells containing the JIL-1 KDI bait to verify the interaction, and sequenced. Homology searches identified SW59 (GenBankTMZ97377) as well as thelola locus. We obtained the SW59 cDNA from Dr. D. Zhao (University of Edinburgh) and lola ESTs (LD28033, LD33478, and LD17361) from ResGen Invitrogen and assembled the full-length Lola zf5 coding sequence. We note a few differences between Z97377 and the Lola zf5 full-length cDNA assembled in this study: 1) 62 nucleotides at the most 5′-end of Z97377 may be a library construction artifact, because they are not present in other Lola zf5 EST clones or the reported lola genomic sequence (32Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

Sequencing of EST clones LD28033 and LD33478 support the presence of two Lola zf5 splice isoforms using alternative 5′-UTR sequences (5′-a and 5′-c, respectively) but we have not confirmed use of 5′-b and 5′-d UTR alternative exons for Lola zf5, as predicted in the November 30th, 2002 genome project update. Rabbit anti-Lola common region polyclonal antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Edward Giniger and has been previously characterized (10Giniger E. Tietje K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1385-1398Google Scholar). Hope and Odin rabbit anti-JIL-1 polyclonal antibodies were described in Jin et al.(4Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Google Scholar). Affinity purification of anti-Lola and anti-JIL-1 polyclonal antibodies was as described in Giniger et al. (10Giniger E. Tietje K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1385-1398Google Scholar) using lacZ-Lola and GST-JIL-1 fusion proteins, respectively. To generate Lola zf5-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7F1, the KDIJ1 cDNA fragment (encoding Lola zf5 amino acid residues 427–748) was cloned in the correct reading frame into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), verified by sequencing, and GST-zf5 fusion protein was induced inEscherichia coli according to standard protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Injection of GST-zf5 fusion protein into BALB/C mice, and generation of monoclonal hybridoma lines was performed by the Iowa State University Hybridoma Facility according to standard protocols (34Harlow E. Lane E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Embryos were dechorionated in 50% Chlorox solution, washed with 0.7 m NaCl/0.2% Triton X-100 and fixed in a 1:1 heptane:fixative mixture for 20 min with vigorous shaking at room temperature. The fixative was either 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Bouin's Fluid (0.66% picric acid, 9.5% formalin, 4.7% acetic acid). Vitelline membranes were then removed by shaking embryos in heptane-methanol (35Mitchison T. Sedat J. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 261-264Google Scholar) at room temperature for 30 s. Embryos were blocked in PBS with 1% normal goat serum (Cappel) and 0.4% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight in mAb 7F1 primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Embryos were washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100, incubated for 2.5 h with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200) (Cappell), washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100 followed by a PBS-only wash. For visualization of DNA the antibody-labeled embryos were incubated in 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min. The final preparations were mounted in glycerol with 5%n-propyl gallate and viewed with a 40× NeoFluor objective on a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with filter sets optimized and selective for rhodamine and UV detection. Digital images were obtained using a Spot-cooled charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Approximately 1 g of wild type Oregon-R animals from different stages was collected and ground under liquid nitrogen, and total mRNA was purified using the Poly(A)+ mRNA purification kit (Ambion). 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from each stage was fractionated on 1% agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to Duralon-UVTMnylon membrane (Stratagene), and hybridized with32P-labeled probe overnight at 65 °C according to standard high stringency protocols (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Lola zf5 isoform-specific probes were generated by purifying 1.8 kb of unique 3′-end Lola zf5 cDNA sequence using a QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and synthesizing random primer 32P-labeled probe using the Prime-A-Gene kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a loading control, a cDNA fragment of RP49 (ribosomal protein L32) (36Ruhf M.-L. Braun A. Papoulas O. Tamkun J.W. Randsholt N. Meister M. Development. 2001; 128: 1429-1441Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified from the Clontech yeast two-hybrid cDNA library described above and confirmed by sequencing. After stripping the Lola zf5 signal, labeled RP49 cDNA was used to probe the same membrane to normalize mRNA loading levels. Protein extracts were prepared from staged dechorionated embryos, larvae, pupae, or adults that were homogenized in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmNa3VO4, pH 8.0) with added protease inhibitors 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Proteins were boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% Blotto, and incubated with anti-JIL-1 or anti-Lola antibody overnight. Blots were then washed three times for 10 min in TBST (0.9% NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:3000) (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in TBST, and the antibody signal was detected with the ECL chemiluminescence kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 5 μg of GST-KDIJ1 (Lola zf5 C terminus) fusion protein or GST protein alone was coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated with 0.5 ml of S2 cell lysates (3 × 106 cells) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at low speed and washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 μg of aprotinin, pH 8.0) for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by Western blot analysis using affinity-purified Hope anti-JIL-1 polyclonal antibody. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-JIL-1, anti-Lola zf5, or control normal rabbit antibodies were coupled to protein G beads as follows: 30 μl of Odin anti-JIL-1 serum, 30 μl of normal rabbit control serum, or 1 ml of 7F1 hybridoma supernatant was coupled to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel in 50 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The appropriate antibody-coupled beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 300 μl of 0–6 h embryonic lysate on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed four times for 10 min each with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer with low speed pelleting of beads between washes. The resulting bead-bound immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting according to standard techniques as described in Jin et al. (4Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C.

Consensus zinc finger motifs include CXXC, HXXXXC, and HXXXXH (X represents any amino acid) using the “Find” function under “Edit” menu of Microsoft Word 98 software. In most cases, when an open reading frame (ORF) contained two of the three consensus sequences, it was considered a potential zinc finger motif and further analyzed. PCR primers were designed to amplify Lola sequences containing the putative cDNA fragments specific to the predicted zinc finger motifs using standard PCR protocols (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer ZnF5P (5′-GGATGAACTTGGACTAATGGC-3′) consists of Lola common core sense sequence derived from exon IV, whereas reverse PCR primers were designed to be isoform-specific, with individual reverse primers comprised of antisense sequence based on the 3′-end of each separate predicted zinc finger motif. Oligonucleotides were designed using the Oligo 5.0 program. cDNA templates for PCR reactions were from the 0- to 21-h cDNA MatchmakerTMyeast two-hybrid library (Clontech) or a 3- to 12-h cDNA library (Stratagene). PCR conditions were optimized for each primer pair, respectively, and PCR products were directly sequenced. The lola genomic sequence was also used to search for homologs in the Drosophila EST databases with FLYBLAST (available at www.fruit fly.org/blast/) (33Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M.

https://openalex.org/W2020218233,"Most bacteria produce the dUMP precursor for thymine nucleotide biosynthesis using two enzymes: a dCTP deaminase catalyzes the formation of dUTP and a dUTP diphosphatase catalyzes pyrophosphate release. Although these two hydrolytic enzymes appear to catalyze very different reactions, they are encoded by homologous genes. The hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii has two members of this gene family. One gene, at locus MJ1102, encodes a dUTP diphosphatase, which can scavenge deoxyuridine nucleotides that inhibit archaeal DNA polymerases. The second gene, at locus MJ0430, encodes a novel dCTP deaminase that releases dUMP, ammonia, and pyrophosphate. Therefore this enzyme can singly catalyze both steps in dUMP biosynthesis, precluding the formation of free, mutagenic dUTP. Besides differing from the previously characterized Salmonella typhimurium dCTP deaminase in its reaction products, this archaeal enzyme has a higher affinity for dCTP and its steady-state turnover is faster than the bacterial enzyme. Kinetic studies suggest: 1) the archaeal enzyme specifically recognizes dCTP; 2) dCTP deamination and dUTP diphosphatase activities occur independently at the same active site, and 3) both activities depend on Mg2+. The bifunctional activity of this M. jannaschii enzyme illustrates the evolution of a suprafamily of related enzymes that catalyze mechanistically distinct reactions.

The bifunctional activity of this M. jannaschii enzyme illustrates the evolution of a suprafamily of related enzymes that catalyze mechanistically distinct reactions. dCTP deaminase dUTP diphosphatase pyrophosphate N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight trimethylsilyl electron impact-mass spectrometry Deoxyuridine nucleotides pose severe problems for cells. Although necessary precursors for thymine nucleotide biosynthesis, deoxyuridine nucleotides can interfere with DNA polymerase activity, either by inhibiting polymerases or by causing them to misincorporate 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (dUTP) in place of 2′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (dTTP) (1Slupphaug G. Alseth I. Eftedal I. Volden G. Krokan H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 164-169Google Scholar, 2Poole A. Penny D. Sjoberg B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 147-151Google Scholar). Ubiquitous DNA glycosylase enzymes remove uracil bases from DNA, which are otherwise formed by spontaneous cytosine deamination. The resulting apyrimidinic sites are cleaved by endonucleases, fragmenting cellular DNA (3Sancar A. Sancar G.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 29-67Google Scholar). At temperatures of 70–95 °C, rate constants for spontaneous cytosine deamination (in denatured DNA or cytidine nucleotides) are several orders of magnitude higher than those measured at more moderate temperatures (4Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Google Scholar). Therefore hyperthermophilic archaea that grow at such temperatures counter the mutagenic effects of cytosine deamination with a variety of thermostable uracil-DNA glycosylase enzymes (5Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar). As a consequence of having efficient base excision repair mechanisms, these organisms must avoid misincorporating deoxyuridine nucleotides into DNA during replication by using highly discriminatory DNA polymerases and by maintaining low dUTP levels in the cell (1Slupphaug G. Alseth I. Eftedal I. Volden G. Krokan H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 164-169Google Scholar, 6Hogrefe H.H. Hansen C.J. Scott B.R. Nielson K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 596-601Google Scholar). Eukaryotes, some bacteria and some archaea use zinc-dependent cytidine or deoxycytidine deaminase enzymes to produce uridine or deoxyuridine nucleotides. Yet many bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, produce most of their 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate (dUMP) from 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (dCTP) using two different enzymes. These bacteria use dCTP deaminase (DCD,1 EC 3.5.4.13) to catalyze the nucleophilic substitution of a hydroxide ion for the 4-amino group of the cytosine base (7Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 96: 1519-1527Google Scholar). A second enzyme, dUTP diphosphatase (DUT, EC 3.6.1.23), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the dUTP α-phosphorus anhydride bond to produce pyrophosphate (diphosphate) and dUMP, the obligatory precursor for thymidine nucleotides synthesis (8Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3305-3312Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Due to the toxicity of dUTP produced by DCD, the DUT enzyme is required to remove the accumulated product. Null mutations in the E. coli dut gene are lethal unless suppressed by null mutations in the dcd gene (9Wang L. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5647-5653Google Scholar). Despite catalyzing markedly different hydrolytic reactions, DUT and DCD proteins are encoded by homologous genes (9Wang L. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5647-5653Google Scholar, 10Prangishvili W. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6024-6029Google Scholar). dUTP diphosphatase enzymes have been extensively studied, and four crystal structure models have been published for DUT proteins from E. coli(11Larsson G. Svensson L.A. Nyman P.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 532-538Google Scholar), human (12Mol C.D. Harris J.M. Mclntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Google Scholar), and two retroviruses (13Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. Laco G.S. Hasselkus-Light C. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2429-2437Google Scholar, 14Dauter Z. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Nyman P.O. Wilson K.S. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 655-673Google Scholar). However, only one DCD enzyme from S. typhimurium has been partially purified and characterized (15Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Google Scholar) and the dcd gene was subsequently identified in E. coli (9Wang L. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5647-5653Google Scholar). DUT proteins share five conserved signature motifs with the DCD proteins; four of these correspond to conserved uridine binding regions in DUT. These conserved domains have been used to identify dUTP diphosphatase homologs from diverse organisms (16McGeoch D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4105-4110Google Scholar) and to predict that two paralogous genes in the hyperthermophilic archaeonMethanococcus jannaschii encode DCD and DUT proteins (10Prangishvili W. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6024-6029Google Scholar). The original annotation of the complete genome sequence from that organism described both gene products as dCTP deaminases because of their considerable sequence divergence from canonical DUT proteins (17Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischman R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Doughterty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the characterization of two paralogous genes from M. jannaschii that are members of thedut-dcd family. Both genes were cloned inE. coli, and the heterologously expressed proteins were purified and characterized. The protein encoded by locus MJ1102 was shown to be a dUTP diphosphatase, similar to previously characterized DUT homologs. Unexpectedly, the enzyme encoded by locus MJ0430 was found to be a dCTP deaminase/diphosphatase (MjDCD-DUT). It has two functions, catalyzing both the deamination of dCTP and release of pyrophosphate to produce dUMP. It also acts as a dUTP diphosphatase with a lower affinity for dUTP than for dCTP. Compared with theS. typhimurium dCTP deaminase, MjDCD-DUT has a higher affinity for dCTP and is a more active deaminase. The discovery of this bifunctional enzyme ties together the apparently unrelated deaminase and diphosphatase activities of DCD and DUT homologs and shows howM. jannaschii circumvents the problem of accumulating dUTP during thymidine biosynthesis. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Stock solutions of nucleotides were prepared in deionized water. Nucleotide concentrations were determined in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl) by UV spectroscopy using established molar extinction coefficients for cytidine nucleotides, uridine nucleotides, adenosine nucleotides, and guanosine nucleotides (18Dawson R.M. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1985: 103-114Google Scholar). The M. jannaschii genes at loci MJ0430 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q57872) and MJ1102 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q58520) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers synthesized by Invitrogen. The MJ0430 gene was amplified using primers: Fwd, (5′-GGTGGTCATATGATTCTTAGTGATAAAG-3′) and Rev, (5′-GATCGGATCCTTAATCTTTTTTATGATTGTC-3′). The MJ1102 gene was amplified using primers: Fwd, (5′-GGTGGTCATATGGTGGTGAAATTAATG-3′) and Rev, (5′-GATCGGATCCTTATCTCCCTTTATAAATTC-3′). The forward primers introduced an NdeI restriction site at the 5′-end of the amplified DNA whereas reverse primers introduced a BamHI site at the 3′-end. PCR amplifications were performed as described previously using a 50 °C annealing temperature for MJ0430 and a 55 °C annealing temperature for MJ1102 (19Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3688-3692Google Scholar). PCR products were purified using a QIAQuick spin column (Invitrogen) and then digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes (Invitrogen). Bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) was used to ligate the MJ0430 and MJ1102 genes into compatible sites in plasmids pET17b (Novagen) or pT7–7, respectively (20Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar). DNA sequences were verified by dye-terminator sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA facility. The resulting recombinant plasmids were transformed intoE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) cells. Transformed E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (200 ml; Difco) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were shaken at 37 °C until they reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8. Recombinant protein production was induced with 28 mmlactose. After an additional 2-h incubation with shaking at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 5 min) and frozen at −20 °C. Induction of the desired proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of total cellular proteins. To test the possible function of conserved Asp135 and Glu145 residues of MjDCD-DUT, Asp135 was replaced by Asn (D135N) and Glu145 was replaced by Gln (E145Q). The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with template pMJ0430 (MJ0430 in pET17b). The oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen) used were D135N-Fwd (5′-CTGCTGGATGGATTAACGCTGGATTTAAAGG-3′), D135N-Rev (5′-CCTTTAAATCCAGCGTTAATCCATCATCCAGCAG-3′), E145Q-Fwd (5′-GGAAAAATAACCTTGCAGATTGTTGCTTTCG-3′), and E145Q-Rev (5′-CGAAAGCAACAATCTGCAAGGTTATTTTTCC-3′). DNA sequences of the mutated genes were confirmed by dye-terminator sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA facility. Heterologously expressed MjDCD-DUT protein was purified from soluble cell-free extract by heat treatment and chromatographic methods. E. coli cells (13 g, wet weight) were suspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.6) and sonicated in a 50-ml plastic tube using a microprobe tip driven by a W-385 Ultrasonic processor (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.) operating at 50% power output. Samples cooled by ice water were sonicated for 8 min with 3 s on/off intervals. Soluble cell-free extract was obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The E. coli proteins were denatured by heating the soluble cell-free extract at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material. Heat-soluble cell extract (16 ml) was applied to a Mono Q HR anion-exchange column (1 × 8 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). Pumps attached to the column were controlled by a Biologic HR workstation (Bio-Rad). Bound protein was eluted with a 45-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions containing dCTP deaminase activity were pooled and concentrated in a N2-pressurized stirred cell with a YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore). Concentrated protein was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR size exclusion column (1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.2). MjDCD-DUT protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and was collected in 1-ml fractions. Fractions containing dCTP deaminase activity were pooled and concentrated in a N2-pressurized stirred cell with a YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) and then stored at −70 °C. Heterologously expressed MJ1102-encoded protein and the MjDCD-DUT D135N and MjDCD-DUT E145Q variant proteins were purified by the same procedure. Protein purity was evaluated by silver diamine staining of proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% T, 4% C acrylamide) using a Tris/glycine buffer system. Sizes of the denatured proteins were determined by comparison to low molecular weight protein standards (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford total protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature on a Superose 12HR column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated in buffer B and run with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Protein standards used to calibrate the sizing column were horse spleen apoferritin (440,000), potato β-amylase (200,000), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29,000), and horse heart cytochromec (12,400). Eluted protein was detected by their absorbance at 280 nm and/or dCTP deaminase activity. Purified MjDCD-DUT protein was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified MjDCD-DUT (0.5 μl of a 2.2 mg/ml protein solution) was mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution on a stainless steel target (Kratos Analytical). Dried, crystalline samples were washed with 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried under a stream of N2 gas. Samples were analyzed in a Kratos KOMPACT SEQ MALDI-TOF instrument (Kratos Analytical) operated on the linear mode at 20 kV. For each sample, 50 spectra were collected by scanning across the sample. Average masses were identified using the combined sample set. Ions of sodium, matrix, bovine serum albumin, bovine pancreas insulin chain B (oxidized), and horse heart cytochrome cwere used for mass calibration. dCTP deaminase activity was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (15Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Google Scholar). In a thermostated quartz cuvette, the following reaction mixture (1 ml) was equilibrated at 60 °C for 15 min: 50 mm TES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm 2-mecaptoethanol (Fisher), and enzyme (0.1–1 μg). The reaction was initiated by addition of dCTP to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The decrease in absorbance as a result of deamination of cytosine compounds was measured at 284 nm with an UV-VIS recording spectrophotometer UV-160A (Shimadzu). The molar extinction coefficient difference between deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine compounds is 3.8 × 103m−1 cm−1 (15Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Google Scholar). Standard dUTP diphosphatase activity assays included 50 mm TES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm 2-mecaptoethanol, and enzyme in 200 μl. The reaction mixture was pre-incubated at 60 °C for 15 min before the addition of dUTP. After 10 min of incubation, reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm pH 8.0 EDTA and cooled on ice. Pyrophosphate released from dUTP was measured using an enzymatic assay in a pyrophosphate reagent kit (Sigma). Alternatively, inorganic phosphate was produced from pyrophosphate by including a thermostable coupling enzyme in the dUTP diphosphatase assay. The coupling enzyme used was purified, heterologously expressed GTP cyclohydrolase from M. jannaschii, which has pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase activity, but has no effect on pyrimidine nucleotides (21Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 41: 15074-15084Google Scholar). Inorganic phosphate was then quantified by the malachite green dye-enhanced phosphomolybdate assay (21Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 41: 15074-15084Google Scholar). Inorganic phosphate concentrations were calculated from a standard curve using 0–8 nmol of KH2PO4 in 700 μl deionized H2O. Absorbances from reactions incubated without enzyme were subtracted from absorbances of the enzymatic reactions to calculate activities. The nucleotide products of the enzymatic reaction were analyzed by separation on a Mono Q HR anion-exchange column (0.5 × 5 cm, Amersham Biosciences). Bound nucleotides were eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5m NaCl in a 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The nucleotides eluted were monitored at 254 nm. Nucleotide standards were analyzed on the column before and after the sample runs for calibration. The nucleotides (and their retention times) were dCMP (20.1 min), dUMP (21.5 min), dCDP (24.1 min), dUDP (25.3 min), dCTP (26.9 min), and dUTP (27.9 min). To 35 μl of buffer containing 50 mmTES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm mercaptoethanol were added 45 μl of H218O (98 atom% 18O) and 5 μl of a 2.2 mg/ml solution of the MjDCD-DUT protein. The sample was incubated at 60 °C for 15 min before 10 μl of 0.1 m dCTP was added. After an additional 15 min at 60 °C the sample was evaporated to dryness with a stream of dry nitrogen gas, and the residue was reacted at 100 °C with 20 μl of a TMS reagent composed of trimethylchlorosilane, hexadimethyldisilazane, and pyridine (1:3:9, v/v/v). After removal of the insoluble material by centrifugation, electron impact-mass spectrometry (EI-MS) analysis of the soluble material was performed using a VG-70–70EHF instrument (VG Analytical) operating at 70 eV with a direct probe inlet (probe temperature programmed from room temperature to 400 °C at 5 °C/s). The mass range scanned was 50–750 m/z at 5 s/decade. To test the heat stability, purified MjDCD-DUT was incubated for 10 min at temperatures from 60 to 100 °C and then assayed for dCTP deaminase activity using the standard assay at 60 °C. The effect of pH on dCTP deaminase activity of MjDCD-DUT was studied using a three-component buffer system in the pH range 5.0–9.8 (22Pham D.N. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13725-13731Google Scholar). Buffer mixture containing 75 mm bis-Tris, 38 mm HEPPS, and 38 mm CHES were adjusted to pH 5.5–9.5 using either NaOH or HCl. Effects of NaCl (Fisher), DTT, and 2-mecaptoethanol (Fisher) were tested in standard dCTP deamination assays. Divalent cation dependence was examined using enzyme, TES buffer, and dCTP freed of divalent cations by passage through a 7.5 mm × 5 cm column of Chelex 100-Na+ (Bio-Rad) (21Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 41: 15074-15084Google Scholar, 23Poyner R.R. Cleland W.W. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8009-8017Google Scholar). MjDCD-DUT elution was monitored by its absorbance at 280 nm. Metal replacement reactions included 5 mm concentrations of MgCl2·6H2O (Fisher), MnCl2·4H2O (Fisher), CaCl2·6H2O (Fisher), NiCl2·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O (J. T. Baker Inc.), CuCl2·6H2O (J. T. Baker Inc.), BaCl2·2H2O (Fisher), or ZnSO4·7H2O. The substrate specificity of MjDCD-DUT was investigated using a spectroscopic assay. Nucleotide substrates tested at 0.2 and 1 mm concentrations included dCDP, dCMP, CTP, CDP, CMP, cytosine, deoxycytidine, ATP, dTTP, UTP, and GTP. The products of each reaction were identified by the Mono Q HR anion-exchange column (0.5 × 5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) as described above. Inhibitory effects of various nucleotides on MjDCD-DUT dCTP deaminase activity were also examined. Enzyme activity was measured by quantifying the production of pyrophosphate. These reactions included 0.2 mm dCTP and 1 mm concentrations of other nucleotides. For both dCTP deaminase and dUTP diphosphatase activities of MjDCD-DUT, initial reaction rates were measured in standard assays at various concentrations of dCTP (0–100 μm) or dUTP (0–800 μm). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min, and then reactions were started by the addition of substrate. A curve from the Michaelis-Menten equation was fit through the initial rate data by nonlinear regression, using the Sigma Plot 2000 program (SPSS Science). dCTP deaminase/dUTP diphosphatase homologs have been identified in the genomes of several archaea (10Prangishvili W. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6024-6029Google Scholar). Two homologs, MJ0430 and MJ1102, were found in the complete genome sequences of M. jannaschii (17Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischman R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Doughterty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L. Geoghagen N.S. Venter J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether one gene product functions as a dUTP diphosphatase and the other as a dCTP deaminase. We cloned both genes and expressed both proteins in E. coli for purification and characterization. The recombinant MjDCD-DUT (encoded by MJ0430) was purified through heating, anion-exchange, and gel-filtration chromatography. Table I shows the purification of 33 mg of MjDCD-DUT from 13 g of E. coli cells. The specific activity of purified MjDCD-DUT was 10.5 μmol/min/mg. Enzyme specific activity increased 4.2-fold though the purification, which indicates the MjDCD-DUT constitutes 24% of the total E. coli soluble protein.Table IPurification of M. jannaschii MjDCD-DUTStepaMjDCD-DUT was purified from 13 g of E. coli cell paste.VolumeTotal proteinbProtein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad).Total activitySpecific activitycSpecific activity was measured with the standard dCTP deamination assay.Yieldmlmgμmol/minμmol/min/mg%Crude extract2881020252.5100Heat treatment161046346.131Mono Q11.4544438.122Sephacryl 2008.93334710.517a MjDCD-DUT was purified from 13 g of E. coli cell paste.b Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad).c Specific activity was measured with the standard dCTP deamination assay. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the purified MjDCD-DUT by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed a molecular mass of 23,619 ± 94 Da, which is close to its predicted 23,432 Da molecular mass from the genomic data. The denatured protein migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel an apparent molecular mass of 30,800 Da. From a Sepharose 12 HR size exclusion column, MjDCD-DUT eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 136,000 Da. This elution pattern suggests that native MjDCD-DUT protein may form a hexamer. When MjDCD-DUT was incubated with 0.2 mm dCTP at 60 °C, the enzyme not only catalyzed the deamination of dCTP, but also catalyzed the release of pyrophosphate to form dUMP. MjDCD-DUT can also catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to form dUMP and pyrophosphate. These results show that MjDCD-DUT is bifunctional: it catalyzes two consecutive reactions to form dUMP using dCTP as substrate. In contrast, γ-proteobacteria require separate dCTP deaminase and dUTP diphosphatase enzymes to catalyze the reactions (Fig.1) (15Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Google Scholar). Enzymes can catalyze pyrophosphate release by promoting the nucleophilic substitution by water at either the α- or β-phosphorus atoms of nucleotide triphosphates (24Weber D.J. Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16939-16942Google Scholar). To test the regiospecificity of MjDCD-DUT, the enzyme was incubated with dCTP in H218O, and the reaction products were converted to TMS derivatives. EI-MS analysis identified two compounds. The first corresponded to the (TMS)4 derivative of pyrophosphate, M+ = 466 m/zand M+-15 = 451 m/z. Isotopic clusters of these ions had the same relative intensities observed for unlabeled pyrophosphate and showed no 18O incorporation. The second identified compound consisted of the (TMS)4derivative of dUMP M+-15 = 509m/z. The isotopic cluster of this ion showed the incorporation of two labeled oxygens each with ∼50% 18O enrichment. A fragment ion 299 m/z originating from the phosphate of the dUMP derivative contained only a single18O confirming that one of the oxygens resided on the phosphate. The other oxygen was incorporated at the C-4 position of uracil during deamination. These data suggest that the phosphate anhydride cleavage proceeds by attack of activated water at the α-phosphate of 5′-nucleotide triphosphates. The standard dCTP deaminase assay was used to characterize the purified MjDCD-DUT under various reaction conditions. When incubated with 0.1 mNaCl, the enzyme exhibited its maximum activity, compared with no NaCl (70%), 0.05 m (70%), 0.15 m (90%), or 0.2m NaCl (90%) added. No change of enzyme activity was observed when MjDCD-DUT was assayed in 50 mm TES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), or 50 mmMOPS/NaOH (pH 7.5) buffer. Nor did addition of 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm DTT affect the activity, although 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added in the standard assay. Purified MjDCD-DUT is a thermostable enzyme. When heated at 90 °C for 10 min, MjDCD-DUT retained over 70% of its activity, assayed at 60 °C. Assays of MjDCD-DUT dCTP deaminase activity at various pH showed maximum activity at pH 7.5. As shown in Fig.2, over the range from pH 6 to 9, the enzyme retains more than 50% of its maximum activity. The substrate specificity of MjDCD-DUT was investigated using the standard deamination assay with 1 mm concentrations of other cytidine nucleotides. dCDP is a very poor substrate; MjDCD-DUT catalyzes its deamination and hydrolysis to form dUMP at only 4% of the rate of dCTP deamination. None of the following nucleosides or nucleotides was deaminated by MjDCD-DUT: dCMP, CTP, CDP, CMP, cytosine, or deoxycytidine. Neither ATP, dTTP, UTP, or GTP were substrates for MjDCD-DUT. Nor was pyrophosphate released in these assays. These results indicate that MjDCD-DUT is highly specific for dCTP as its substrate for deamination. The MjDCD-DUT activity requires metals. Divalent cation requirement was examined by assaying metal-free MjDCD-DUT. No activity was detected in reactions without added metals. Maximum dCTP deamination activity was observed with the addition of 2–5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 0.2 mm dCTP. No other divalent cations supported full activity at the concentration of 5 mm (Table II). Compared with its dCTP deaminase activity, dUTP diphosphatase activity of MjDCD-DUT showed a similar pattern of metal activation (Table II).Table IIEffects of added divalent cations on MjDCD-DUT dCTP deamination and dUTP diphosphatase activityAdded cationRelative activityaRelative activities are expressed as the percentage of activity compared to that obtained with 5 mm Mg2+.

https://openalex.org/W2158330467,"We have recently shown that a heterotrimeric Gi protein is coupled to the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor. The Gi protein constitutively associates in its heterotrimeric form with the intracellular domain of Epo receptor (EpoR). After Epo stimulation Gi is released from the receptor and activated. In the present study we have investigated the functional role of the heterotrimeric Gi protein bound to EpoR. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing EpoR, the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2 activation induced by Epo. Epo-dependent MAPK activation was also sensitive to the Gβγ competitive inhibitor βARK1-ct (C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase), to the Ras dominant negative mutant RasN17, and to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY 294002. A region of 7 amino acids (469–475) in the C-terminal end of EpoR was shown to be required for Gi binding to EpoRin vivo. Deletion of this region in EpoR abolished both MAPK and PI3K activation in response to Epo. We conclude that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Epo activates MAPK via a novel pathway dependant on Gi association to EpoR, Gβγ subunit, Ras, and PI3K. The tyrosine kinase Jak2 also contributes to this new pathway, more likely downstream of βγ and upstream of Ras and PI3K. This pathway is similar to the best characterized pathway used by seven transmembrane receptors coupled to Gi to activate MAPK and may cooperate with other described Epo-dependent MAPK activation pathways in hematopoietic cells.

The EpoR recruits several SH2-containing proteins through its intracellular phosphorylated tyrosines as well as adaptor molecules (for review, see Ref. 14Damen J. Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1455-1459Google Scholar). We previously developed an expression cloning strategy to characterize new proteins implicated in EpoR signaling. The strategy was based on the reactivity of such components with antibodies produced against proteins reactive with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibodies, isolated from the Epo-stimulated hematopoietic cell line UT7. This led us to isolate a cDNA encoding Gβ2, the β2 subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, and to demonstrate that an heterotrimeric Gi protein is constitutively associated with EpoR in hematopoietic cell lines as well as in normal erythroid progenitor cells. The Gi-EpoR interaction occurs through the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. After Epo activation the Gi protein is activated and released from the receptor, most likely with the concomitant dissociation of Gi α and βγ subunits (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). Defined signal functions of Gi include inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, regulation of phospholipase Cβ, and activation of K+ channels (16Johnson G.L. Gardner A.M. Lange-Carter C. Qian N.X. Russell M. Winitz S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 415-422Google Scholar). G proteins such as Gq and Gi also regulate cell growth and differentiation through the stimulation of a large number of complex cascades, leading to the activation of MAPKs. Agonist stimulation of seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and the subsequent dissociation of the α-GTP and βγ subunits. Although the main functional properties of G proteins were initially thought to be essentially determined by the identity of the α subunit, βγ complexes also regulate a number of effectors. The mechanisms of the Erk1/2 MAPK activation by GPCR has been explored in cell lines that are readily transfected, such as COS-7 cells. The best characterized and probably the main pathway used by GPCR to activate MAPK via the pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive Giprotein depends on the release of free Gβγ subunits acting on a Ras-dependent pathway (17Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Google Scholar, 18Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Google Scholar, 19van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Google Scholar). MAPK activation is initiated by the Gβγ-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and proceeds through a Shc/Grb2/Sos pathway common to both GPCR and tyrosine kinase receptors (19van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Google Scholar). PI3K activity also participates in Gβγ-mediated MAPK activation upstream of Ras (20Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Google Scholar, 21Hawes B.E.

Gi may also regulate MAPK activation through α subunits. Indeed, activating mutations have been identified in the Gαi2 gene, referred to asgip2 (24Gupta S.K. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Google Scholar, 25Pace A.M. Wong Y.H. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Google Scholar). The MAPKs Erk1/2 play important role in Epo-induced proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (26Jacobs-Helber S.M. Ryan J.J. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 933-940Google Scholar, 27Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Google Scholar, 28Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 94: 853-863Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells Epo activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway by recruitment of Grb2 either directly or indirectly via adaptor molecules such as Shc (29Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Google Scholar, 30Damen J. Liu L. Cutler R. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Google Scholar) or SHP-2 (31Tauchi T. Feng G. Shen R. Hoatlin M. Bagby G.J. Kabat D.

This interaction allows the guanine nucleotide release factor Sos, constitutively bound to Grb2, to convert Ras to an active GTP-bound form. Furthermore, C3G, an other guanine nucleotide exchange factor, through its interaction with CrkL, has also been found participating in Epo-mediated MAPK signaling pathway via Ras (33Nosaka Y. Arai A. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30154-30162Google Scholar) and Rac (34Arai A. Kanda E. Miura O. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2641-2651Google Scholar). PI3K and protein kinase C have also been implicated in Raf/MAPK activation by Epo (35Devemy E. Billat C. Haye B. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 41-46Google Scholar, 36Klingmuller U. Wu H. Hsiao J.G. Toker A. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3016-3021Google Scholar). Our demonstration that heterotrimeric Gi proteins associate with EpoR and that receptor activation leads to the activation and dissociation of Gi from the receptor led us to investigate the downstream targets of Gi. We considered the possibility that Epo may activate MAPK via the Gi protein bound to EpoR-like seven-transmembrane receptors. In this study, we characterized a new Epo-activated MAPK pathway dependent on Gi. This pathway, similar to the best characterized MAPK pathway used by GPCR coupled to Gi, is the main pathway for Epo-dependent MAPK activation in CHO cells. It proceeds through the βγ subunit of the Gi bound to EpoR and involves the activation of Jak2, Ras, PI3K, and MEK. Our data also demonstrate that Gi plays a crucial role for Epo-induced PI3K activation in CHO cells. Purified recombinant human Epo (specific activity 120,000 units/mg) was a kind gift of Dr. M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar) was kindly provided by R. Jockers at Institut Cochin, Paris, France. The expression plasmid pcDNA3/HA-RasN17 was a gift from A. Eychène and the pXM/EpoR-W282R from J. Ihle. Different constructs of murine EpoR cytoplasmic regions (Leu-433–Pro-459, Gly-458–Ser-483, Gly-458–Pro-470, Glu-465–Pro-477) were obtained by PCR and subcloned in-frame with the MalE protein. The murine EpoR mutant −41 was described previously (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). To generate the ΔV-L EpoR mutant lacking residues Val-469 to Leu-475 within the intracellular domain, mutation was introduced into the full-length EpoR by PCR. The PCR product was digested withHindIII/XbaI and subcloned into the same restriction sites of a modified pCDNA3 expression vector (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Stable transfectants of FDCP-1 myeloid cell line expressing the wild type and mutated forms of EpoR were obtained by electroporation, as previously described (8Gobert S. Chrétien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2434-2441Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with expression plasmids coding for full-length EpoR, ΔV-L, or W282R EpoR mutants using LipofectAMINE PlusTMReagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, selected with 20 μg/ml puromycin, and cloned by limiting dilution. EpoR expression was determined using immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts and 125I-Epo binding on whole cells. Cell lines expressing a similar number of 125I-Epo binding sites of either wild type or mutated receptors were selected for the study. Transient transfections of CHO cells were carried out by the same methodology when 80% confluence was reached using 1 μg of plasmid/well (10 cm2), and 24 h post-transfection the cells were harvested and used in experiments as described. LipofectAMINE transfection of CHO cells consistently resulted in transfection efficiencies greater than 60% (data not shown). The human erythroleukemic cell line UT7 was maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 2 units/ml Epo. FDCP-1 myeloid cells expressing EpoR were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 units/ml Epo. The cells were starved of Epo by replacing Epo with 3% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3 1–2 days before use in the experiments. CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/nut mix F-12 (Ham's) medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. Before stimulation, cells were washed and serum-starved 3–4 h or overnight when indicated by incubation in Ham's medium in the presence of 0.4% bovine serum albumin. The cells were stimulated with 10 units/ml Epo or 10 ng/ml PMA. In some experiments PD98059 (30 μm) or LY 294002 (50 μm) were added 30 or 15 min, respectively, before stimulation, and pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml) and PMA (0.6 μg/ml) were added 16 h before stimulation. Cells (1 × 107) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μm Na3VO4 and lysed on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 1% Brij 98, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (lysis buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-EpoR antiserum 1/250 for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the incubation was pursued for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and 2 times with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 0.1% Brij 98, 1 mmNa3VO4. For MalE fusion protein pull-down assays, lysates were incubated with 5 μg of MalE fusion protein prebound to 20 μl of amylose resin beads for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Then, beads were collected and processed as described above for immunoprecipitation. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (3Dusanter-Fourt I. Casadevall N. Lacombe C. Muller O. Billat C. Fischer S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10670-10675Google Scholar, 39Duprez V. Blank U. Chretien S. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33985-33990Google Scholar). Erk and Akt activation were studied using phospho-specific antibodies. Cells lysates were prepared as described above using lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The protein content was normalized by the micro-BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins (10 to 50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed in immunoblot. To detect Gαi its ADP-ribosylation was followed by measuring incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose in the presence of pertussis toxinin vitro as previously described (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). In a previous report we demonstrated that constitutive association between heterotrimeric Gi protein and the EpoR occurred through the C-terminal end of the receptor (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). To characterize more precisely the EpoR domain involved in Gi binding, we first generated recombinant fusion proteins between MalE and various EpoR sequences contained in this region (Fig.1 A). Fusion proteins were incubated with UT7 cell lysates, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Gβ antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Recombinant fusion protein containing the EpoR amino acids 458–483 allowed Gβ binding in vitro, in agreement with previous data obtained in vivo using EpoR mutants (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). A similar binding was detected with the MalE-EpoR fusion peptide 465–477, whereas Gβ did not bind to EpoR peptides 433–459 and 458–470. Western blotting with anti-MalE antibody showed that the amounts of recombinant proteins bound to amylose resin used in the pull-down assays were similar. These results indicate that amino acids 465–477 are sufficient to bind Gβ in vitro. This region does not include tyrosine residues, which fits well with the constitutive binding of Gi to EpoR (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the identified sequence (465–477) in vivo we wished to delete this sequence within the EpoR. To avoid perturbation of receptor structure and particularly of Tyr-464 and Tyr-479 located in the vicinity of Gi binding region, we constructed an EpoR mutant deleting a shorter region encompassing amino acids 469–475 (ΔV-L). The EpoR expressed in FDCP-1 cells was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and Gαi associated with EpoR was detected by in vitro ADP-ribosylation assay (Fig. 1 C). In cells transfected with full-length mouse EpoR, Gαi was coprecipitated with anti-EpoR antibodies. However, Gαi was not precipitated with EpoR when mutants −41 (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar) or ΔV-L were expressed. The absence of Gibinding to the EpoR in cells expressing the ΔV-L mutant is unlikely to be due to a general signaling defect of the mutated receptor since the receptor kept the ability to bind the tyrosine kinase Jak2 (Fig.1 C). These results indicate that the sequence V469PDSEPL475 located in the C-terminal domain of the EpoR is necessary for Gi/EpoR associationin vivo. This region does not bind any known EpoR effector. A number of receptors that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gi-coupled receptors, have been shown to stimulate MAPK activation (17Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Google Scholar, 18Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Google Scholar, 38Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the possibility that Gi may participate in MAPK activation after Epo stimulation. The sensitivity of MAPK activation to the Gi inhibitor, pertussis toxin, was first examined in hematopoietic cell lines expressing an endogenous or exogenous EpoR as well as in normal human erythroid progenitor cells. A weak and inconstant inhibition of Epo-induced MAPK phosphorylation was observed with these cells (data not shown). We previously observed that Epo induced a stronger G protein activation in cell membranes isolated from epithelial CHO cells expressing EpoR than in UT7 hematopoietic cell line (15Guillard C. Chretien S. Jockers R. Fichelson S. Mayeux P. Duprez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2007-2014Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesis that a Gi-dependent Epo-activated MAPK pathway may be more easily detected in these cells. The role of Gi in the activation of Erk1/2 by Epo was investigated in CHO cells stably transfected with the full-length EpoR cDNA (CHO-ER WT). Cells were stimulated with Epo for various times, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with phospho-specific anti-Erk antibodies as shown in Fig. 2. Epo induced a transient Erk1/2 activation. Preincubation of the cells with 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin overnight completely inhibited Epo-induced Erk activation. Total Erk content was unchanged under all conditions as shown by immunoblotting with anti-Erk antibodies recognizing both the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated forms of Erk 1 and 2. Toxin treatment had no effect on cell viability (data not shown). These results establish a role for a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in Epo-induced Erk activation and show that a Gi-dependent pathway is the main pathway used by Epo to activate MAPK in CHO cells. To ascertain the functional significance of the Gi-EpoR interaction on MAPK activation we studied the effect of disrupting it. When stably expressed in CHO cells the EpoR ΔV-L mutant, which is unable to associate with Gi (Fig. 1 C), could not activate Erk after Epo stimulation (Fig.3 A). In contrast, PMA treatment led to MAPK activation, showing that these cells retained the ability to activate Erk. To evaluate if the ΔV-L deletion would perturb early events of EpoR activation, Jak2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig.3 B illustrates that the EpoR ΔV-L mutant had the ability to associate with the Jak2 tyrosine kinase and that both proteins became phosphorylated after Epo stimulation. Indeed, when Jak2 was immunoprecipitated, the phosphorylated forms of Jak2 and EpoR were detected in immune complexes isolated from cells expressing EpoR WT as well as EpoR ΔV-L. Thus, the ΔV-L deletion has no general effect on Epo signal transduction. Tyrosines located in the vicinity of the Val-469–Leu-475 region constitute potential binding sites for components implicated in Epo-dependent MAPK activation such as CrkL (40Arai A. Kanda E. Nosaka Y. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33282-33290Google Scholar) and Grb2 (32Barber D.L. Corless C.N. Xia K. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 55-64Google Scholar) for Tyr-460 and Tyr-464, respectively. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the ΔV-L deletion did not alter the phosphorylation of these residues and their ability to bind their effectors. After Epo activation, phosphorylated EpoR ΔV-L bound GST-CrkL and GST-Grb2 as efficiently as phosphorylated EPOR WT did (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the absence of MAPK activation in EpoR ΔV-L is due to a defect in Gi binding and not to a perturbation of the phosphorylation of proximal tyrosine residues. Altogether, these data show that the EpoR region that couples Gi to EpoR is required for Epo-induced Erk activation in CHO cells and confirm the results obtained with pertussis toxin treatment. Given the sensitivity of Epo action to pertussis toxin, we first examined whether Epo-mediated Erk1/2 activation may be secondary to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Gi. Indeed, in some cells a rise in cAMP has been shown to inhibit the Ras/MAPK pathway at the level of Ras/Raf interaction (41Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Google Scholar). Therefore, a Gi-mediated fall in cAMP level may relieve Raf inhibition by protein kinase A and positively regulate MAPK. Pretreatment of CHO-ER WT cells with the cell-permeable cAMP derivative dibutyryl-cAMP, which mimics the effect of cAMP, failed to prevent Epo-induced MAPK activation (data not shown). This suggests that MAPK activation does not proceed through αi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. βγ subunits derived from PT-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins were shown to mediate Ras-dependent MAPK activation (17Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Google Scholar,18Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Google Scholar, 42Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Google Scholar). MAPK activation through Gi-coupled receptors such as the α2A-adrenergic receptor and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor is sensitive to inhibition by the C-terminal fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1-ct). βARK1-ct interacts with free βγ and acts as a competitive inhibitor of Gβγ-mediated signals but does not affect Gαi-mediated signaling, allowing distinguishing between αi and βγ pathways (38Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar). To determine whether the PT-sensitive phosphorylation of Erk1/2 stimulated by Epo was mediated by Gβγ, we studied the effect of Epo on CHO-ER WT cells transiently transfected with the βARK1-ct peptide. As shown in Fig. 4 Aphosphorylation of endogenous Erk1/2 following Epo stimulation was significantly reduced compared with cells transfected with control plasmid, although the total Erk amount was not modified. We conclude that Epo-induced MAPK activation in CHO-ER cells occurs through the release of βγ subunits of heterotrimeric Giprotein. To determine whether Epo-induced JAK2 tyrosine kinase activation was required for MAPK activation, the EpoR mutant (W282R) defective in JAK2 binding and kinase activation (43Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Google Scholar) was stably expressed in CHO cells. In cells expressing the EpoR W282R mutant, Epo-induced MAPK activation was lost (Fig. 4 C). Thus, JAK2 activation is required for MAPK activation in these cells. The requirement for MEK kinase, an upstream activator of MAPK, was also evaluated using the MEK inhibitor PD98059. As shown in Fig.4 B, Epo-induced MAPK activation was abolished when the cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor before Epo stimulation. Protein kinase C is activated by Epo and may be implicated in MAPK activation by Epo (36Klingmuller U. Wu H. Hsiao J.G. Toker A. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3016-3021Google Scholar) and also by Gi coupled to classical GPCR (44Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Google Scholar). We examined whether protein kinase C might contribute to Epo-induced MAPK activation in CHO-ER WT cells. Down-regulation of protein kinase C induced by prolonged exposure of cells to PMA inhibited MAPK activation in response to PMA but not to Epo (Fig.5 B). Therefore, Epo-stimulated MAPK activation is independent of a PMA-sensitive protein kinase C. The best characterized pathway used by Gi-coupled receptors to activate MAPK requires p21ras activity (45Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1983926998,"The Myc/Max/Mad family of transcription factors plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, and cell differentiation. However, it remains unclear whether different heterodimers, such as Myc/Max and Mad/Max, recognize the same or different target genes in vivo. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Myc target genes are also recognized by Mad1 in differentiated HL60 cells. We also substituted the complete basic region of Myc for the corresponding region of Mad. Wild-type c-Myc was then compared with c-Myc(Mad-BR) in oncogenic transformation, regulation of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, activation of chromosomal gene expression, and direct binding to chromosomal sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that the wild-type c-Myc and c-Myc/MadBR proteins have indistinguishable biological activity and target gene recognition in vivo. These data are consistent with a model in which Myc and Mad regulate a common set of target genes."

Protein and ligand flexibility are important determinants of the interaction and often lead to ligand binding modes that are not anticipated from structures obtained with other ligands. To these “failure(s) of the rigid receptor hypothesis” (1Davis A.M. Teague S.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) is added here an impressive example: induced-fit binding of nucleotides to the Ca2+-ATPase. This finding stems from a systematic mapping of substrate-protein interactions with infrared (IR)1 spectroscopy. New approaches like this are welcome in the field of ligand-protein recognition, since the most informative techniques, NMR and x-ray crystallography, are laborious and problematic for some systems. Methods like fluorescence and luminescence that require less expenditure also provide less molecular information. We expect that this technology gap will be bridged by IR spectroscopy. IR spectroscopy, one of the methods of vibrational spectroscopy, provides direct information on the molecular level, is cost-effective, and can be universally applied from small soluble proteins to large membrane proteins under near-physiological conditions.

This provides a direct observation of ligand binding: no marker compound has to be introduced to report the binding process, as with many other methods. Previous work has mostly focused on individual interactions between a ligand and a protein by monitoring the influence of the protein environment on the vibrational frequency of a particular group of the ligand, the signal of which is identified in a complex vibrational spectrum with the help of isotopically labeled ligands (6Belasco J.G. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K.

Here we employ a different approach to probe the role of single functional groups of a ligand in the interaction with a protein: using IR spectroscopy we monitored the protein conformational change induced by binding of substrate analogues, which are modified at specific functional groups of the substrate. This identifies those functional groups that are important in the interaction with the protein; structure-interaction relationships are obtained that are similar to structure-activity relationships in drug development that relate the chemical structure of compounds to their pharmacological activity. This work studies the ATP binding site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (9Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hasselbach W. Boyer P.D.

The SR Ca2+-ATPase, an intrinsic membrane protein of about 110-kDa molecular mass, catalyzes Ca2+ transport from the cytoplasm of muscle cells into SR for relaxing a flexed muscle. The energy required for this active transport process is provided by hydrolysis of the substrate ATP, which phosphorylates the ATPase at Asp351. The specificity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase for nucleotides is not high and not only ATP, but also some other nucleotides and non-nucleotide substrates enable Ca2+ uptake (13Hasselbach W. Top. Curr.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) of the Ca2+-loaded state E1Ca2 shows three cytoplasmic domains, the nucleotide binding domain (N-domain), the phosphorylation domain (P-domain), and the actuator domain (A-domain). The structure has been solved with and without 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-monophosphate (TNP-AMP), which binds to the N-domain at considerable distance from the phosphorylation site Asp351 with less structural effects than ATP (20MacLennan D.H.

IR spectroscopy has been used to characterize conformational changes of several partial reactions of the Ca2+-ATPase pump cycle, as reviewed in Ref. 2Barth A. Zscherp C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. To detect the small IR absorbance changes generally associated with protein reactions, the reactions have to be triggered directly in the IR cuvette for which we use the photolytical release of nucleotides from photolabile derivatives, i.e. P 3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl nucleotides (caged nucleotides) (27Kaplan J.H. Forbush B. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the conformational change induced by binding of the following ATP analogues: inosine 5′-triphosphate (ITP), 2′-deoxy-ATP, and 3′-deoxy-ATP (Fig.1). They differ from ATP at individual functional groups which allows us to investigate the impact of these groups on the binding-induced conformational change. IR samples were prepared as described previously (28Liu M. Barth A. Biospectroscopy. 2002; 67: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar). Approximate concentrations of the samples based on 1-μl sample volume were: 1.2 mm Ca2+-ATPase, 0.5 mg/ml Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), 150 mmmethylimidazole (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm caged nucleotide. ITP samples were also prepared with 10 mm DTT because of a higher conversion of caged ITP in these samples. In our control samples the nucleotide binding site was already saturated with β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMPPNP) at the beginning of the experiment. The composition of these samples was the same as of that with caged AMPPNP (10 mm) except for the presence of AMPPNP (5 mm). Photolysis of caged AMPPNP in these samples did not lead to further nucleotide binding and conformational changes, they only revealed the effects of caged compound photolysis. We did not use the physiological co-substrate Mg2+ but 10 mm Ca2+ instead. These conditions were chosen to block the E1PCa2 → E2P transition to achieve a maximum level of E1PCa2 in the steady state after nucleotide release while slowing down the phosphorylation reaction (29Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Replacement of Mg2+ at the catalytic site by Ca2+ decreases the rate of phosphorylation by 1 order of magnitude (30Suzuki H. Nakamura S. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8240-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H. J. Biol.

Time-resolved Fourier transfer IR measurements of the Ca2+-ATPase reaction were performed at 1 °C as described previously (28Liu M. Barth A. Biospectroscopy. 2002; 67: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar, 29Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol.

Photolytic release of nucleotides from their respective caged derivatives was triggered by a xenon flash tube or a XeCl excimer laser. Spectra were obtained in the following way: a reference spectrum was recorded with the protein in the E1Ca2 state. After applying a photolysis flash or a sequence of flashes, we started to record time-resolved IR spectra with 65-ms time resolution. The number of photolysis flashes needed for saturating signals was determined as described under “Titration of IR Signals.” Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the reference spectrum from a spectrum obtained after nucleotide release. They reflect ATP binding and ATPase phosphorylation as well as the photolysis reaction. The spectra were normalized to a standard protein concentration before averaging spectra from different samples (amide II absorbance: 0.26) as described (35Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A photolysis spectrum was then subtracted as described in the following paragraph to eliminate the photolysis band. The resulting spectra are named nucleotide binding spectra or E1PCa2 formation spectra. The spectrum obtained with the control samples shows only signals caused by the photolysis of caged AMPPNP. It is named photolysis spectrumand was used to subtract the photolysis bands from the raw difference spectra as described (33Von Germar F. Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1531-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using the same time interval for both spectra. This photolysis spectrum is identical to that of other caged nucleotides above 1300 cm−1, i.e. outside the region of phosphate absorption. For the nucleotide binding spectra time windows after the photolysis flash were evaluated in which the nucleotide-ATPase complex (E1NTPCa2) accumulates. They were between 0.46 and 0.90 s for ATP or between 0.46 and 3.24 s for ATP analogues. 23 experiments from 12 samples were averaged for the ATP binding spectrum (∼3 mm released ATP, one flash), four experiments from four samples for the ITP binding spectrum (∼6.6 mm released ITP, three flashes), eight experiments from four samples for the 2′-deoxy-ATP binding spectrum (∼3 mmreleased 2′-deoxy-ATP, one flash), and three experiments from three samples for the 3′-deoxy-ATP binding spectrum (∼3 mmreleased 3′-deoxy-ATP, one flash). The difference spectra of E1PCa2 formation (E1Ca2 → E1PCa2) in Fig. 4 were obtained by subtracting the reference spectrum (E1Ca2) from the spectrum of the protein in the E1PCa2 state obtained in the time window between 4.5 and 28.1 s. A photolysis spectrum averaged in the same time window was subtracted using the same subtraction factors as for the respective nucleotide binding spectra. The time constants of nucleotide binding and ATPase phosphorylation were obtained by fitting the integrated band intensities of the marker band at 1628 cm−1 for nucleotide binding and two marker bands at 1721 and 1549 cm−1 for phosphorylation (29Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the second (the third for ITP results) and first order exponential decay equations, respectively (Origin 5.0), and averaging the resulting time constants. 23 experiments were averaged for ATP, 8 for 2′-deoxy-ATP and 11 for ITP. To obtain saturating signals, we titrated the amplitude of bands at 1641/1628 cm−1 by repeating an experiment on the same sample consisting of a reference spectrum, a photolysis flash, and a spectrum of 300 scans in a time interval when the first phosphoenzyme E1PCa2 had formed. The number of flashes needed for saturating signals was used in further experiments. Absorption spectra of 500 mm ATP, 2′- and 3′-deoxy-ATP dissolved in H2O were measured using two BaF2 windows (5-μm path length) with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector at 20 °C at different pH values. The population of the C2′-endo and C3′-endo puckering modes of the three nucleotides were obtained by calculating the ratio of the areas of bands fitted to the spectrum near 830 cm−1 for C2′-endo puckering and near 814 cm−1 for C3′-endo puckering (36Wartell R.M. Harrell J.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2664-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Taillandier E. Ridoux J.P. Liquier J. Leupin W. Denny W.A. Wang Y. Thomas G.A. Peticolas W.L.

For that we used the difference in amplitude of the band pair at 1628 and 1641 cm−1 in the amide I region of the IR spectrum, which is sensitive to conformational changes. This difference is termed maximum signal amplitude (MSA). Fig.2 shows the result of titrations with ATP, ITP, 2′-deoxy-ATP, and 3′-deoxy-ATP applying a total of eight flashes, which released ∼9.4 mm nucleotide. According to Fig. 2, the binding-induced amplitude difference MSA reached saturating values with the first flash for ATP, 2′- and 3′-deoxy-ATP, and with the third flash for ITP. From the photolysis efficiency of 30% we then calculated the saturating nucleotide concentration assuming 1 μl of sample volume: 3 mm (one flash) for ATP and 2′- and 3′-deoxy-ATP and 6.6 mm (three flashes) for ITP. For these titration experiments, spectra where evaluated in a time slot where the first phosphoenzyme E1PCa2 accumulates. Strictly speaking, they have therefore determined the nucleotide concentration necessary for saturating E1PCa2, not for saturating E1NTPCa2. However, the reactions of nucleotide binding and of phosphorylation are well separated in time, which ensures that E1NTPCa2 also saturates in the time slot evaluated for the nucleotide binding spectra: time constants for nucleotide binding (t n) and phosphorylation (t p) and the time slot of spectra recording for the nucleotide binding spectra (t s) were: for ATP, t n ≈ 0.11 s,t p = 2.0 s, t s = 0.46–0.90 s; for 2′-deoxy-ATP, t n ≈ 0.25 s, tp = 6.7 s, t s = 0.46–3.24 s; for 3′-deoxy-ATP, t n ≈ 0.49 s,t p > 100 s, t s = 0.46–3.24 s; and for ITP, t n ≈ 0.23 s, t p = 8.66 s,t s = 0.46–3.24 s (see “Methods”). The starting time of 0.46 s for spectra averaging might seem to be early for ITP and 2′- and 3′-deoxy-ATP, since it is close to the time constant for nucleotide binding. However, increasing the starting time to 1.5 s for 3′-deoxy-ATP and 0.8 s for ITP and 2′-deoxy-ATP did not change the maximum signal amplitude MSA by more than 3%. Therefore we kept the time slot for averaging consistent for the three ATP analogues and as large as possible for an optimum signal to noise ratio. Fig.3 A shows IR absorbance changes induced by nucleotide binding to the Ca2+-ATPase. The spectra reflect the difference in absorbance between the initial nucleotide-free state E1Ca2 and the nucleotide-ATPase complex E1NTPCa2. Negative bands are characteristic of E1Ca2 and positive bands of E1NTPCa2. Groups or structures not involved in the conformational change do not show up in the difference spectra. The difference spectra reflect conformational changes of the protein backbone in the amide I (1700–1610 cm−1) and amide II (1580–1500 cm−1) region of the spectra. In addition, environmental and structural changes of side chains and nucleotide contribute in the whole mid-IR region shown. We will focus here on the binding-induced absorbance changes in the amide I region. The spectrum of ATP binding is in close agreement with the AMPPNP binding spectrum as noted before (33Von Germar F. Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1531-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The positive signal near 1653 cm−1 is characteristic of an α-helical structure, the signals near 1693, 1641, and 1628 cm−1 of β-sheets. Turn structures likely contribute to the signals near 1665 cm−1. The spectrum indicates that α-helices, β-sheets, and turns are affected by ATP binding in line with previous findings (33Von Germar F. Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1531-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The contour of all nucleotide binding spectra is similar; the main difference is the amplitude of the signals indicating various extents of conformational change. For further evaluation we used the MSA (difference between the absorbance change at 1628 cm−1 and that at 1641 cm−1). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the largest binding-induced signals were obtained with ATP and AMPPNP (28Liu M. Barth A. Biospectroscopy. 2002; 67: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar) (MSA ≈ 3 × 10−3), medium size signals (MSA ≈ 2 × 10−3) with ADP (28Liu M. Barth A. Biospectroscopy. 2002; 67: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar), and 2′-deoxy-ATP, and the smallest signals (MSA ≈ 1 × 10−3) with ITP and 3′-deoxy-ATP. The different amplitudes of the nucleotide binding spectra cannot be explained by incomplete binding to the ATPase, since we have verified that saturating signals have been obtained (see above). MSA values shown in Fig. 3 for nucleotide binding spectra differ slightly from MSA values shown in Fig. 2, for which a time slot was evaluated in which E1PCa2, not E1NTPCa2, accumulated, because of conformational changes accompanying the phosphorylation reaction. Phosphorylation leads to the appearance of two bands at 1721 and 1549 cm−1, which serve here as marker bands for the first phosphorylated intermediate E1PCa2 (29Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ATP, 2′-deoxy-ATP, and ITP, but not 3′-deoxy-ATP, phosphorylate the ATPase at a rate that is sufficiently high to observe accumulation of the E1PCa2 state. Fig.4 shows spectra of E1PCa2formation from E1Ca2, i.e. the absorbance of E1PCa2 minus the absorbance of E1Ca2 (see “Methods”). As found for nucleotide binding, the shape of the E1PCa2 formation spectra is similar for the analogues but the amplitude is different. In contrast, the same amplitude is observed for the band at 1721 cm−1, which has been tentatively assigned to the C=O group of Asp351 formed upon phosphorylation (34Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This local probe of the phosphorylation reaction shows that E1PCa2 accumulates to the same extent with ITP and 2′-deoxy-ATP as with ATP. The smaller signals obtained with the analogues can therefore not be explained by incomplete phosphorylation. Instead they are due to a smaller extent of conformational change showing that the conformation of E1PCa2 depends on the nucleotide used for phosphorylation of the ATPase. The rate of phosphorylation was measured using the marker bands at 1721 and 1549 cm−1 (29Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the two bands is shown in Fig.5. Phosphorylation of the ATPase by 2′-deoxy-ATP or ITP is slower (0.15 ± 0.01 s−1 and 0.12 ± 0.01 s−1, respectively) than by ATP (0.51 ± 0.03 s−1). Slower phosphorylation of the ATPase with ITP and 2′-deoxy-ATP compared with ATP has been observed (39de Meis L. de Mello M.-C.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3691-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Coan C. Amaral J.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but without specifying the rate for ATP. Previous findings revealed a low phosphoenzyme concentration for both 2′- and 3′-deoxy-ATP (40Coan C. Amaral J.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we found only for 3′-deoxy-ATP. This is likely due to the different buffers used, since nucleotide binding (41Hasselbach W. The R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 105-113Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the associated conformational change (28Liu M. Barth A. Biospectroscopy. 2002; 67: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar) depend on the composition of the medium. Our results show that modifications to the amino, 2′-OH, 3′-OH, and γ-phosphate groups of ATP affect the binding-induced conformational change of the ATPase. These groups are therefore important for the interaction between ATP and the ATPase. 3′-OH and the region near the amino group have the most significant influence on the induced-fit movement of the ATPase, since modification to either of these groups reduces the extent of backbone conformational change seen by IR spectroscopy to only one-third of that obtained with ATP. They are therefore important groups of ATP that anchor ATP to the ATPase. The importance of the functional groups of ATP investigated here for several partial steps of the ATPase reactions cycle has been shown before (39de Meis L. de Mello M.-C.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3691-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Coan C. Amaral J.A. Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bodley A.L. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13997-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The new finding here is that modifications of the ATP molecule have a direct effect on the structure of the nucleotide-ATPase complex. This is valid not only for side chain orientation as often found (1Davis A.M. Teague S.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) but also for backbone conformation: with some ATP analogues the binding-induced conformational change of the backbone seen by the IR spectroscopy was found to be only one-third of that for ATP. The effects of modifying ATP on nucleotide binding might have several causes: (i) a direct interaction of the modified group of ATP with the ATPase, (ii) a direct interaction of the “new” group of the ATP analogue, and (iii) an indirect effect on the interactions between protein and ATP via a change in electron density or conformation of ATP.

This result implies DNA bending and looping of promoter DNA as a result of the physical interaction between GAL4-VP16 and an interface of the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB complex. This protein-protein interaction on promoter DNA minimally requires the presence of one GAL4 binding site and the formation of a quaternary complex containing TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIA on the TATA element. Notably, the topology of the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-promoter complex is not altered significantly by the interaction with DNA-bound activators. We also show that the ability of GAL4-VP16 to activate transcription through a single GAL4 binding site varies according to its precise location and orientation relative to the TATA element and that it can approach the efficiency obtained with multiple binding sites. Taken together, our results indicate that the spatial positioning of the DNA-bound activation domain is important for efficient activation, possibly by maximizing its interactions with the transcriptional machinery including the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-promoter quaternary complex.

RNA polymerase II adenovirus-2 major late RNA polymerase II-associated protein TATA box-binding protein transcription factor Most models of transcriptional activation imply a physical interaction of DNA-bound transcriptional activators and the transcription machinery assembled on core promoters (1Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Google Scholar, 2Sauer F. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 176-181Google Scholar, 3Berk A.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 330-335Google Scholar). This contact between the activation domain and components of the transcription machinery has been attributed diverse functions including: (i) the recruitment of key transcription factors (e.g. general transcription factors or co-activators) at the promoter, (ii) the stimulation of enzymatic activities involved in the transcription reaction (e.g. promoter melting, phosphorylation, initiation of RNA chain synthesis), and (iii) the relief of transcriptional blockades induced by various types of repressors including nucleosomes. In support of this view of transcriptional activation, a number of protein-protein interactions between various activation domains and members of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)1 transcription machinery have been characterized in solution and found to be important in mediating transcriptional activation (1Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Google Scholar, 2Sauer F. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 176-181Google Scholar, 3Berk A.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 330-335Google Scholar). However, little is known about the formation of these protein-protein interactions when the interacting partners are bound to promoter DNA.Ultimately, transcriptional activators regulate the activity of the basal RNAPII transcription machinery. The transcription reaction is a multi-step process in which a preinitiation complex containing TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNAPII is first assembled onto promoter DNA (4Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Google Scholar, 5Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Google Scholar). TBP recognizes and binds the TATA element, inducing a bend of about 80° in the DNA helix (6Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Google Scholar, 7Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Google Scholar). TFIIF, a factor composed of two subunits called RAP74 and RAP30, binds tightly to RNAPII (9Flores O. Lu H. Killeen M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Reinberg D.

Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Google Scholar). TFIIE, a factor also composed of two subunits called TFIIEα and TFIIEβ, stabilizes the preinitiation complex (13Robert F. Forget D. Li J. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8517-8520Google Scholar) and is involved in the melting of promoter DNA at the transcription initiation site through an ATP-independent mechanism (14Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J.

Rev. 1999; 63: 457-478Google Scholar for a review). The initiation of chain synthesis proceeds through a cycle of abortive initiation events during which RNAPII synthesizes short 2–10-nucleotide transcripts before escaping the promoter and entering a productive elongation mode (23Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Google Scholar). The activity of elongating RNAPII is modulated through the action of a number of elongation factors (24Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Google Scholar, 25Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Google Scholar).The acidic activator GAL4-VP16 is a chimeric polypeptide composed of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein (amino acids 1–147) and the transcriptional acidic activation domain of the viral protein VP16 (amino acids 412–490) (26Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Google Scholar). When GAL4 DNA-binding sites are located upstream of the TATA box of a promoter, this activator has been shown to stimulate transcription in a synergistic manner both in vivo and in vitro (see Ref. 27Lin Y.S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Google Scholar for example). GAL4-VP16 can act on various steps of the transcription reaction, probably via its many interactions with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. These include interactions with TBP (28Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Google Scholar, 29Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5788-5792Google Scholar). GAL4-VP16 was shown to stimulate three distinct events during the formation of the preinitiation complex: (i) formation of the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA complex (34Klemm R.D. Goodrich J.A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5788-5792Google Scholar); (ii) TFIIB recruitment (35Wang W. Gralla J.D. Carey M.

A number of reports indicate that GAL4-VP16 can also act on open complex formation (37Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Google Scholar), transcript elongation (38Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Google Scholar), and reinitiation (39Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D.

Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Google Scholar).Using site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking, we have analyzed the physical interaction between GAL4-VP16 molecules bound to promoter sites various distances from the TATA element and a complex containing TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIA assembled onto the TATA element. Using templates with either one or five GAL4 DNA-binding sites, we show that DNA-bound GAL4-VP16 does indeed cross-link to many positions in the vicinity of the TATA element where a TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB complex is assembled. Interaction with DNA-bound GAL4-VP16 does not significantly modify the conformation of the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-promoter complex. We also show that a GAL4-VP16 dimer bound to one GAL4 binding site can stimulate transcription with an efficiency approaching that of GAL4-VP16 dimers bound to five sites if the single dimer is properly positioned upstream of the TATA box. Most models of transcriptional activation imply a physical interaction of DNA-bound transcriptional activators and the transcription machinery assembled on core promoters (1Ptashne M. Gann A.

The initiation of chain synthesis proceeds through a cycle of abortive initiation events during which RNAPII synthesizes short 2–10-nucleotide transcripts before escaping the promoter and entering a productive elongation mode (23Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Google Scholar). The activity of elongating RNAPII is modulated through the action of a number of elongation factors (24Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Google Scholar, 25Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Google Scholar). The acidic activator GAL4-VP16 is a chimeric polypeptide composed of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein (amino acids 1–147) and the transcriptional acidic activation domain of the viral protein VP16 (amino acids 412–490) (26Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Google Scholar). When GAL4 DNA-binding sites are located upstream of the TATA box of a promoter, this activator has been shown to stimulate transcription in a synergistic manner both in vivo and in vitro (see Ref. 27Lin Y.S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Google Scholar for example). GAL4-VP16 can act on various steps of the transcription reaction, probably via its many interactions with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. These include interactions with TBP (28Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Google Scholar, 29Ingles C.J. Shales M. Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Greenblatt J.

GAL4-VP16 was shown to stimulate three distinct events during the formation of the preinitiation complex: (i) formation of the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA complex (34Klemm R.D. Goodrich J.A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5788-5792Google Scholar); (ii) TFIIB recruitment (35Wang W. Gralla J.D. Carey M.

A number of reports indicate that GAL4-VP16 can also act on open complex formation (37Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Google Scholar), transcript elongation (38Blau J. Xiao H.

Using site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking, we have analyzed the physical interaction between GAL4-VP16 molecules bound to promoter sites various distances from the TATA element and a complex containing TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIA assembled onto the TATA element. Using templates with either one or five GAL4 DNA-binding sites, we show that DNA-bound GAL4-VP16 does indeed cross-link to many positions in the vicinity of the TATA element where a TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB complex is assembled. Interaction with DNA-bound GAL4-VP16 does not significantly modify the conformation of the TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-promoter complex. We also show that a GAL4-VP16 dimer bound to one GAL4 binding site can stimulate transcription with an efficiency approaching that of GAL4-VP16 dimers bound to five sites if the single dimer is properly positioned upstream of the TATA box.

Long-term exposure of these cells to BG is associated with the accumulation of apical glycoproteins in cytoplasmic vesicles. The mechanisms involved therein and the nature of the vesicles have not been elucidated. In these cells, a massive amount of BG metabolites is synthesized. Because sialic acid is mainly distributed apically in epithelial cells, it has been proposed that the BG-induced undersialylation of apical membrane glycoproteins is responsible for their intracellular accumulation due to a defect in anterograde traffic and that sialic acid may constitute an apical targeting signal. In this work, we demonstrate that the intracellular accumulation of membrane glycoproteins does not result mainly from defects in anterograde traffic. By contrast, in BG-treated cells, endocytosed membrane proteins were retained intracellularly for longer periods of time than in control cells and colocalized with accumulated MUC1 and ॆ1 integrin in Rab7/lysobisphosphatidic acid+ vesicles displaying features of late endosomes. The phenotype of BG-treated cells is reminiscent of that observed in lysosomal storage disorders. Sucrose induced a BG-like, lysosomal storage disease-like phenotype without affecting sialylation, indicating that undersialylation is not a requisite for the intracellular accumulation of membrane glycoproteins. Our findings strongly support the notion that the effects observed in BG-treated cells result from the accumulation of BG-derived metabolites and from defects in the endosomal pathway.

The use of sugar analogs has been fundamental for the study of glycan function, mainly in the study of N-glycans, as no specific inhibitors ofO-glycosylation are currently available (2Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Benzyl-N-acetyl-α-d-galactosaminide (BG),1 as well as other GalNAc analogs, was initially reported to inhibitO-glycosylation, presumably as a result of the inhibition of GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr elongation (3Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Google Scholar). More recent studies of cells treated with BG or other GalNAc analogs have shown that their overall effects are likely due to complex modifications of glycan biosynthesis (4DiIulio N.A.

A detailed study of mucus-secreting HT-29 colon cancer cells treated chronically with BG revealed dramatic and pleiotropic effects, including a reduction in cell proliferation, an increase in cell size, and the accumulation of electron-lucid cytoplasmic vesicles containing predominantly undersialylated apical glycoproteins with N- and O-glycans (i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase IV and MUC1) (8Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Google Scholar). In HT-29 glycoproteins, sialic acid is mainly linked in an α2,3-configuration, and α2,3-sialyltransferase activity is profoundly inhibited upon treatment with BG. This is accompanied by a marked decrease in the sialylation of glycoproteins, detected with the α2,3-sialic acid-specific Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL), and an increase in the levels of glycoprotein-associated Gal-GalNAc precursor epitope detected with peanut agglutinin (PNA; Arachis hypogaea) (4DiIulio N.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Google Scholar). In these cells, changes in sialylation are a consequence of the synthesis of BG-derived metabolites, such as benzyl-GalNAc-Gal, that inhibit sialyltransferases, thus leading to the accumulation of the precursor carbohydrate chains of apical glycoproteins (5Huet G. Kim I. de Bolos C. Lo-Guidice J.M. Moreau O. Hemon B. Richet C. Delannoy P. Real F.X. Degand P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1275-1285Google Scholar, 6Delannoy P. Kim I. Emery N. de Bolos C. Verbert A. Degand P. Huet G. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 717-726Google Scholar). Based on these findings, on the apical distribution of sialic acid in epithelial cells (11Ulloa F. Real F.X. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 501-509Google Scholar), and on the proposed role of N- and O-glycans in apical targeting (12Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Google Scholar, 13Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Google Scholar), it was suggested that the altered subcellular distribution of apical glycoproteins and the accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicles in BG-treated cells might result from glycoprotein undersialylation and that sialic acid might play a role in apical targeting (8Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Google Scholar, 9Hennebicq-Reig S. Lesuffleur T.

We have shown that BG also perturbs the processing of lysosomal enzymes such as acid α-glucosidase (AAG) and cathepsin D, indicating broader effects of BG on intracellular traffic (14Ulloa F. Francı́ C. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18785-18793Google Scholar). However, the available evidence did not allow us to unravel several key issues related to the biochemical effects of this drug: 1) no definite causal relationship has been established between the effects on sialylation and the abnormal subcellular distribution of membrane glycoproteins, and 2) there are few data supporting the contribution of an anterograde (Golgi-to-plasma membrane) traffic defectversus endocytic pathway defects leading to the vesicular accumulation of membrane glycoproteins in cells treated with BG for prolonged periods of time. In this regard, the best evidence for the contribution of an anterograde traffic defect comes from the analysis of AAG maturation in BG-treated cells, which showed a blockade in a post-trans-Golgi network compartment (14Ulloa F. Francı́ C. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18785-18793Google Scholar). Our finding that BG treatment results in misprocessing of lysosomal enzymes (14Ulloa F. Francı́ C. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18785-18793Google Scholar) is reminiscent of the effects of sucrose on fibroblasts (15Schmidt J.A. Mach L. Paschke E. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19063-19071Google Scholar) and has led us to propose that BG could induce a reversible lysosomal storage disease-like phenotype in HT-29 cells (14Ulloa F. Francı́ C. Real F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18785-18793Google Scholar). Lysosomal storage diseases are a diverse group of inherited conditions characterized by functional defects in endosomes/lysosomes leading to the accumulation of intracellular vesicles. They are caused by mutations in a wide variety of genes and are associated with the accumulation of cholesterol and/or sphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (16Simons K. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 459-462Google Scholar). A misrouting of lactosylceramide and possibly other lipids appears to be characteristic of storage diseases, although the precise mechanisms involved are unknown (17Chen C.S. Patterson M.C. Wheatley C.L. O'Brien J.F. Pagano R.E. Lancet. 1999; 354: 901-905Google Scholar). The aims of this work have been 1) to analyze the contribution of abnormalities in endocytic traffic to the BG phenotype, 2) to determine whether a causal relationship exists between the undersialylation of membrane glycoproteins induced by BG and their intracellular accumulation, and 3) to provide additional support to the hypothesis that BG induces a lysosomal storage-like phenotype. Our findings indicate that in HT-29 cells, as well as in IMIM-PC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, the 舠BG phenotype舡 (i.e. dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicles containing membrane glycoproteins) 1) is due, to a large extent, to defects in the endocytic pathway; 2) does not depend on a defect in glycoprotein sialylation; 3) is associated with the accumulation of intracellular vesicles with variable phenotype, including vesicles containing late endosomal markers as well as endocytosed membrane proteins, as in storage diseases; and 4) is similar to that induced by prolonged treatment with sucrose, except that the latter does not perturb glycoprotein sialylation. Altogether, these results support the notion that defective sialylation is not required for the abnormal subcellular distribution of membrane glycoproteins induced by BG and that the latter may also take place in lysosomal storage diseases and contribute to their pathogenesis. HT-29 colon cancer cells selected with 10−6m methotrexate (here designated as HT-29 M6 cells) were obtained from Drs. Alain Zweibaum and Thécla Lesuffleur (INSERM, Paris, France).

Digoxigenin-conjugated MAL and PNA, recognizing the oligosaccharide species α2,3-Neu5Ac-R and Galॆ1–3GalNAc-R, respectively, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Biotin-conjugated MAL was obtained from Vector Labs, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Transmission electron microscopy was performed on cells grown on plastic as previously described (18Vilá M.R. Lloreta J. Schussler M.H. Berrozpe G. Welt S. Real F.X. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 395-404Google Scholar). Samples embedded in Epon (Polysciences Inc., Warington, PA) were re-embedded to make sections perpendicular to the bottom of the flask. Ultrathin sections were visualized using a Phillips CM100 electron microscope. For double immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 30 min, and permeabilized with 0.57 Triton X-100 or 0.17 saponin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. In the case of reactions employing antibody 6C4, the permeabilization step was carried out using 0.057 saponin in PBS/BSA. Cells were then sequentially incubated with primary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); antibodies were added for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS. Biotin-conjugated MAL (20 ॖg/ml) was added in lectin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.17 saponin) for 1 h, followed by FITC-streptavidin (5 ॖg/ml).

To detect cholesterol, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and stained with filipin (Sigma) at 125 ॖg/ml in PBS for 30 min. Fluorescence analysis was performed using conventional fluorescence microscopy. Cells were maintained in methionine-free minimal essential medium containing 107 dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min, pulse-labeled for 1 h with 50 ॖCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) in the same medium, and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and 2 mm unlabeled methionine for 24 h. In the case of cells treated with BG, the culture medium was supplemented with the drug at the concentration indicated. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 17 Triton X-100, 62.5 mm EDTA, 2 mmPefabloc, 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were precleared with preimmune rabbit antiserum for 2 h and protein A-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min. Antibodies were added to the precleared supernatants for 3–16 h in the presence of 0.27 SDS. When using mAbs, rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako) was added for 2 h prior to the incubation with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 SDS, 17 deoxycholate, and 17 Nonidet P-40), three times with high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, and 0.17 SDS), and twice with PBS. All immunoprecipitation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and developed by fluorography. Cells were metabolically labeled as described above with 150 ॖCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 1 h and chased for 24 h at 37 °C; the medium was collected, and cells were lysed with RIPA buffer. Proteins from the medium and cell extracts were precipitated in 107 trichloroacetic acid for 1 h on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min; pellets were resuspended in 1 m NaOH; and labeled material was quantified in a scintillation counter. The proportion of secreted material was calculated as total secreted trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cpm/total cell lysate-associated trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cpm. Cells were incubated on ice with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate in PBS, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 15 min to label membrane proteins; subsequently, cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added for 15 min as a blocking reagent. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 prewarmed fetal bovine serum. Cells were placed on ice, and biotin bound to membrane proteins was stripped by incubating the cells twice in cold 60 mm glutathione in PBS for 20 min. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors; lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; and supernatants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Biotinylated proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The proportion of biotinylated proteins was determined by densitometric analysis using GenQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 62.5 mm EDTA, and 17 Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein extracts were fractionated by 67 SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. MAL blotting was carried out with reagents from the digoxigenin glycan differentiation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lectin reactivity of MUC1 molecules immunoprecipitated from IMIM-PC-1 cell lysates was examined as described (8Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell extracts (30 ॖg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Filters were blocked with 57 skim milk for 30 min, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig antibodies. Proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Treatment of HT-29 M6 cells with BG leads to the accumulation of undersialylated apical glycoproteins in cytoplasmic vesicles. The interpretation of these effects has relied upon the assumption that BG induces a blockade in the anterograde traffic, leading to the vesicular accumulation of apical glycoproteins en route to the plasma membrane (8Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the rate of overall anterograde protein traffic, HT-29 M6 cells were cultured on Transwells, and the impermeability of the cell layers was assessed using [14C]mannitol. BG was or was not added to the medium of impermeable cell cultures for 7 days; cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys; apical and basolateral media and labeled cells were collected; and total constitutive protein secretion and cell-associated proteins were quantified. The secreted/cell-associated label ratio was expressed as an index. There was no significant inhibition of total apical or basolateral protein secretion (Fig. 1A). To obtain additional evidence that BG has no significant effect on total protein secretion, we performed similar experiments using IMIM-PC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. This cell line was selected from a panel of lines in which the effects of prolonged BG treatment had been tested. 2F. Ulloa and F. X. Real, unpublished data. Upon treatment with BG, IMIM-PC-1 cells displayed a phenotype that is similar to that of BG-treated HT-29 M6 cells and is characterized by reduced cell proliferation, increased cell volume, reduced α2,3-glycoprotein sialylation, and accumulation of electron-lucid cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 2, A–D). Unlike HT-29 M6 cells, BG-treated IMIM-PC-1 cells displayed the intracellular accumulation of both apical (i.e. MUC1) and basolateral (i.e. ॆ1 integrin) glycoproteins (Fig.2E). As shown for HT-29 M6 cells, BG did not significantly decrease total protein secretion in IMIM-PC-1 cells (Fig.1B). Therefore, the BG-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of membrane glycoproteins is not primarily due to alterations in anterograde transport. To determine whether intracellular glycoprotein accumulation results from altered endocytosis/recycling of plasma membrane glycoproteins, IMIM-PC-1 cells were used because they are flatter and allow a better morphological resolution than HT-29 M6 cells and because they express lower levels of membrane-associated mucins that impair cell-surface biotinylation. IMIM-PC-1 membrane proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C and allowed to internalize at 37 °C for various periods of time. Biotin that remained bound to plasma membrane glycoproteins that had not been endocytosed was dissociated using glutathione, so only the internalized glycoproteins originating from the plasma membrane could bind streptavidin. Endocytosis of biotinylated membrane proteins was analyzed and quantified by Western blotting with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 3A). In addition, the subcellular distribution of biotinylated glycoproteins was examined using FITC-streptavidin by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). In control and BG-treated cells, labeled proteins were distributed mainly at the plasma membrane 10 min after shifting the temperature to 37 °C, and intracellular labeling increased progressively during the first 2 h. Subsequently, a decrease in cytoplasmic labeling was observed only in control cells. In BG-treated cells, intracellular labeling progressively increased during the first 30 min after the temperature shift, and an intracellular accumulation of labeled proteins was demonstrated for up to 24 h. Quantitative analysis showed that endocytosis occurred at a relatively slower rate in BG-treated cells during the first 2 h, whereas intracellular accumulation of biotinylated glycoproteins occurred to a greater extent than in control cells (Fig. 3, A andB). At 24 h, BG-treated cells showed a 5.5-fold higher accumulation of membrane proteins compared with control cells. These results indicate that the phenotype of BG-treated cells involves the intracellular accumulation of endocytosed membrane glycoproteins. To determine whether compartments in which MUC1 and ॆ1 integrin accumulate also contain endocytosed biotinylated membrane proteins, cells were cultured for 8 days in the presence of BG, surface-biotinylated at 4 °C, and incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. As described above, in BG-treated IMIM-PC-1 cells, MUC1 and ॆ1 integrin colocalized and accumulated in cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig.4). A progressive increase in the amount of biotinylated membrane glycoproteins was observed in MUC1- and ॆ1 integrin-containing vesicles starting 30 min after initiation of internalization for up to 24 h (data not shown). At the 4-h time point, numerous vesicles showed double labeling of endocytosed membrane proteins with either MUC1 or ॆ1integrin, whereas others contained exclusively one type of protein marker (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that the cytoplasmic vesicles that accumulate in BG-treated cells indeed receive endocytosed membrane material. MUC1 and ॆ1 integrin have been shown to be recycled to the plasma membrane (28Litvinov S.V. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21364-21371Google Scholar, 29Regen C.M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1347-1359Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the cytoplasmic accumulation of these proteins is secondary to defective recycling. To obtain insight into the nature of the cytoplasmic vesicles, double immunolabeling for MUC1 or ॆ1 integrin and markers corresponding to the Golgi complex (GRASP65 and TGN46) (30Prescott A.R.

The general regulatory factor, Reb1p, as well as the nucleotide sequence of a single Gal4p-binding site, structurally cooperate to exclude nucleosomes from about 480 bp of DNA that spans the UASGAL, the Reb1p-binding site, the TATA-box, and the transcriptional initiation sites.

In repressed promoters of regulated genes, packaging of DNA into nucleosomes usually veils binding sites for transcription factors and/or for the basic transcription machinery (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Google Scholar, 3Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Google Scholar, 4Gregory P.D. Hörz W.

Consequently, activation of most regulated genes requires the removal of one or several nucleosomes before the transcriptional preinitiation complex can be assembled (for example, see Refs. 6Piña B. Barettino D. Truss M. Beato M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 975-990Google Scholar, 7Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Google Scholar, 8Fascher K.D.

Revealingly, in yeast, several promoters can be activated upon experimental nucleosome depletion even in the absence or inactive state of the respective transactivators (10Han M.H. Grunstein M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1137-1145Google Scholar,11Durrin L.K. Mann R.K. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1621-1629Google Scholar). This means that, in principle, basal transcription can ensue in the absence of specific transactivators as long as the basal transcription machinery has access to the core promoter. On the other hand, promoters of constitutive genes (12McLean M. Hubberstey A.V. Bouman D.J. Pece N. Mastrangelo P. Wildeman A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 605-614Google Scholar, 13Angermayr M. Oechsner U. Gregor K. Schroth G.P. Bandlow W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4199-4207Google Scholar) and a number of inducible genes (14Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar, 16Moreira J.M.A. Hörz W. Holmberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3202-3209Google Scholar) have been described that are kept free of nucleosomes permanently, and those nucleosomes flanking the gap, which usually spans the cis-acting sites for regulated transcription activators and/or the basal transcription machinery, occupy quite distinct positions. The molecular or structural bases of permanent nucleosome exclusion are not well understood. Normal B-helical DNA is compatible with packaging into nucleosomal structures. Persistent nucleosome exclusion may be accomplished by one of at least three different strategies: (i) Either preferred binding of two nucleosomes to two adjacent stretches of prebent DNA positions nucleosomes in such a way that their distance is smaller than required for the accommodation of an additional nucleosome (<145 bp in yeast). Such a nucleosome arrangement, called translational positioning of nucleosomes, has been found to be the basis of accessibility of linker DNA to specific transactivators (8Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2523-2528Google Scholar,13Angermayr M. Oechsner U. Gregor K. Schroth G.P. Bandlow W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4199-4207Google Scholar, 17Travers A.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 177-180Google Scholar, 18Straka C. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 361-368Google Scholar). (ii) As an alternative, a particular nucleotide sequence, which deviates from B conformation, may give rise to a structure that is incompatible with packaging into nucleosomes. Several stretches of poly(dA·dT) or poly(dG·dC) homooligomeric sequences have been found to be incompatible with packaging into nucleosomes due to their rigid DNA structure (19Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8419-8423Google Scholar, 20Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4256-4265Google Scholar, 21Tanaka S. Zatchej M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1187-1193Google Scholar, 22Tanaka S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 919-934Google Scholar, 23Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Google Scholar). (iii) As a third possibility, DNA-binding proteins (architectural proteins) may distort the B-helical conformation of the DNA in a way that is incompatible with wrapping around nucleosomes and, thereby, may contribute to the positioning of nucleosomes. The rDNA enhancer-binding protein from yeast (Reb1p),1 which is among the abundant multifunctional “general regulatory factors,” is supposed to play an architectural role and to exclude nucleosomes from the flanks of its binding site on DNA. Reb1p binding to theGAL1–GAL10 intergenic region creates a nucleosome-free gap of about 230 bp (14Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 24Chasman D.I. Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 503-514Google Scholar, 25Lohr D. Hopper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Google Scholar). The majority of genes that are transcribed on demand must deal with nucleosomes that cover the respective promoter regions. Therefore, one role of specific transcriptional activator proteins is to induce the disruption of nucleosomal structures in core promoter regions or to recruit accessory proteins that are able to displace nucleosomes from the core promoter. Nucleosome displacement by regulatory proteins was demonstrated, for instance, for the PHO5 promoter, which is transcriptionally activated by the transactivator, Pho4p. Upon induction by phosphate exhaustion, four out of six positioned nucleosomes are removed during the activation process jointly by the regulatory proteins, Pho4p and Pho2p (8Fascher K.D. Schmitz J. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2523-2528Google Scholar, 26Schmid A. Fascher K.D. Hörz W. Cell. 1992; 71: 853-864Google Scholar). Gal4p, a potent transactivator protein, is able to disrupt nucleosomes in the core promoter regions of galactose-inducible genes, such as the promoters of the GAL1–GAL10 and GAL80 genes (9Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Google Scholar, 14Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gal4p binds to its target sites in the respective UASGAL; these sites, which are permanently free of nucleosomes, remove repressing nucleosomes from core promoter regions, enabling the basal transcription machinery to assemble and to initiate transcription. GCY1 (galactose-induciblecrystallin-like yeast protein) was found to encode a glycerol dehydrogenase involved in osmoregulation and osmotolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (28Costenoble R. Valadi H. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Franzen C.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1483-1495Google Scholar, 29Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2000; 16: 121-137Google Scholar). We have investigated transcriptional regulation of the galactose-inducible gene, GCY1, which is activated by the specific regulator, Gal4p. Expression of GCY1 is induced about 25-fold by growth on galactose as carbon source due to Gal4p binding to a single UASGAL in the upstream control region (30Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 105-114Google Scholar). However,GCY1 is transcribed at a relatively high basal level in the presence of glucose or glycerol as carbon sources. Our previous studies revealed that basal expression of GCY1 is stimulated 3-fold by the abundant general regulatory factor, Reb1p, which binds to the promoter of GCY1 about 100 bp upstream the canonical TATA box (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar, 32Angermayr M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31630-31635Google Scholar). Reb1p is supposed to exert its stimulating effect on transcription mainly by excluding nucleosomes from the flanks of its binding motifs and thereby to facilitate binding of other transcription factors to their target sites (14Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 24Chasman D.I. Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 503-514Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the UASGAL contributes to basal transcription of GCY1 as well even in Gal4p deletion mutants (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar). We have analyzed the chromatin structure of the GCY1 promoter to study the principles of basal expression and constitutive nucleosome exclusion. We have investigated the influence of mutations in theGCY1 promoter, i.e. deletion of the Reb1p-binding site or mutation of the UASGAL, or the influence of the presence or absence of Gal4p on the nucleosomal array in the upstream control region of GCY1. We demonstrate that in wild type, the entire promoter region of GCY1 is constitutively free of nucleosomes and that the nucleosome-free gap spans an unusually long distance of about 480 bp. Mutation of either the Reb1p-binding site or the UASGAL or both cis-acting elements results in nucleosome packaging of the respective region, indicating that Reb1p binding and the UASGAL are jointly responsible for the permanent exclusion of nucleosomes from the GCY1 promoter and exert an additive effect. Vectors pBluescript KS−(Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) or pUC19 were used in ligation reactions. SURE was used as the Escherichia coli host strain (Stratagene). Yeast strain W303-1A (33Crivellone M.D. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Google Scholar) served to introduce genomic mutations into the promoter region of GCY1, generating the yeast strains YMA1, YMA2, YMA3, or YMA4 (see Fig. 1). YM707 gal4-542 (obtained from M. Johnston, Washington University, Medical Center, Department of Genetics, St. Louis, MO) served for analyzing the chromatin structure of the promoter region of GCY1 in a gal4-deficient genetic background. Deletion of the Reb1p-binding site, the point mutation of the UASGAL, as well as the double mutation of bothcis-acting elements in the genomic context of theGCY1 promoter was accomplished by a two-step gene replacement. Construct pKS−-GCYΔR, in which the natural Reb1p-binding site of the GCY1 promoter had been replaced by a HindIII restriction site (30Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 105-114Google Scholar), served to insert a 1170-bpHindIII restriction DNA fragment encoding URA3 to yield the Ura-prototrophic strain YMA1. After a PvuII restriction site had been introduced into the promoter proximal region of GCY1 to generate homologous DNA fragment ends, the respective URA3-containing GCY1 promoter fragment was excised by PvuII and XhoI and inserted into the genome by homologous recombination using the yeast transformation protocol described by Gietz et al. (34Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Google Scholar). Recombinants were verified by PCR and restriction digestion. Constructs pKS−-GCYΔREB1, pKS−-GCY-UASmut, and pKS−-GCYΔREB1/UASmut served to replace the URA3 gene from the promoter region of GCY1and to introduce the respective mutations of cis-acting elements into the promoter of GCY1 in the genomic context. DNA fragments carrying the mutation were excised by PvuII and XhoI (see above) and co-transformed with YEp351 (LEU2). Transformants were initially selected by growth on selective media lacking leucine. URA3-auxotrophic recombinants were identified by replica plating on 5-fluoroorotate-containing media (35Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Google Scholar) and analyzed by PCR using whole yeast cells. Genomic promoter mutations were verified by restriction digests of the amplificate with HindIII (YMA2 = GCYΔREB1) or XbaI (YMA3 = GCY-UASmut) or with HindIII and XbaI (YMA4 = GCYΔREB1/UASmut), respectively. Yeast cells were grown in rich medium containing 3% glucose, 3% galactose, or 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol as carbon sources. YM707 was cultured on 3% galactose, 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol to simulate galactose-induced physiological conditions. Crude nuclei were prepared and digested with increasing concentrations of DNaseI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by Almer and Hörz (36Almer A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2681-2687Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) digests were done as described by Thoma (37Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 197-214Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5% SDS, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 μg of proteinase K (Merck Eurolab) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. After the pellet had been resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA buffer, RNA was digested by RNaseA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 60 min. After extraction once with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform, DNA was ethanol-precipitated. Purified DNA was digested withEcoRV. Gel electrophoresis was at 100 V in 1.0 or 1.5% agarose gels. After Southern transfer onto nylon membranes (Biodyne A transfer membrane, Pall, Dreieich, Germany), DNA was detected by a randomly primed, radiolabeled 780-bpAsnI/EcoRV DNA probe that hybridized to the N-terminal portion of the neighboring divergently transcribedRIO1 gene. DNA marker fragments were excised from a plasmid that contained the entire intergenic region of theGCY1/RIO1 gene pair and coding regions of the genes GCY1 and RIO1. Digestions were performed with EcoRV to generate the distal DNA fragment end and with restriction endonucleases that cleave within the respective regions of interest (EcoRV/AsnI, 780 bp;EcoRV/XhoI, 1060 bp;EcoRV/HindII, 1280 bp;EcoRV/BsmI, 1480 bp;EcoRV/BbrPI, 1600 bp;EcoRV/EcoRV, 2130 bp). Molecular operations such as RNA isolation and Northern blotting were performed according to standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern blots were quantified using the ImageQuant analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Previous molecular analyses of the galactose-inducibleGCY1 promoter (30Magdolen V. Oechsner U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31630-31635Google Scholar) have revealed the presence of threecis-acting elements: an upstream binding motif for Gal4p (positions −369 to −353 with the adenine of the translational start triplet as +1), a canonic Reb1p site (CATTCACCCG, positions −224 to −215), and a consensus TATAAA core promoter sequence (positions −111 to −116) (Fig.1 A). A poly (dA·dT) block, frequently found adjacent to Reb1p-binding sites, is absent. To study the bearing of Reb1p or the UASGAL on the transcriptional activity of the GCY1 promoter, the respectivecis-acting elements were mutated in the genomic context. The mutations of the Reb1p site, ΔREB1, or the Gal4p site, UASmut, or the double mutant, ΔREB1/UASmut, were brought into the correct genomic context by a two-step gene replacement yielding the respective mutant strains, YMA2 ΔREB1, YMA3 UASmut, or YMA4 ΔREB1/UASmut (Fig. 1,B and C). Transcription was measured by Northern blotting, and the signals were quantified. Total RNA was isolated from wild-type cells grown on glucose, glycerol/ethanol, or galactose or from the three promoter mutants, YMA2 ΔREB1, YMA3 UASmut, or YMA4 ΔREB1/UASmut (Fig.2 A). The signals were quantified relative to the maximum activity displayed by the galactose-induced wild type (Fig. 2 B). In addition, all values were normalized to the respective signal of the mRNA of major adenylate kinase, which is expressed constitutively (39Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Zoglowek C. Häcker U. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 187-193Google Scholar) and used as a loading control. It must be considered that a 25–30-fold induction (which has been measured with lacZ reporter constructs (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar)) is outside the linear range of signal evaluation in Northern blots so that basal expression levels are overestimated relative to induced mRNA synthesis. Each of the single mutants, ΔREB1 or UASmut, reduce basal GCY1transcription to about 1/3 of the wild type, whereas the galactose-induced level of mRNA synthesis in strain ΔREB1 is hardly affected at all, suggesting that Reb1p exclusively endorses basal transcription and has a marginal effect on induced transcription. The ΔREB1/UASmut double mutation reduces GCY1transcription to about 10%, showing that the contributions of both elements to transcriptional activation of the GCY1 promoter are about additive (Fig. 2 B). To study chromatin structure and the effect of transcriptional induction by galactose on the nucleosomal array at the GCY1 promoter, nuclear footprints were performed in vivo using DNaseI or micrococcal nuclease digestion of native chromatin. Since expression ofGCY1 is induced by galactose and weakly repressed by glucose, and to analyze the influence of the carbon source on the arrangement of nucleosomes, analyses of the GCY1 promoter were performed after growth of yeast cells on galactose, glucose, or glycerol/ethanol (Fig. 3 A andB). DNaseI- or micrococcal nuclease-treated chromatin from yeast cells after growth on all three carbon sources (glucose, galactose, or glycerol/ethanol) displayed no obvious differences in the nucleosomal organization of the GCY1 promoter and revealed that under any condition, the upstream control region ofGCY1 was free of nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free gap extends over a region of about 480 bp that contains the transcriptional initiation sites, the TATA element, the Reb1p-binding site, and the UASGAL. The protected regions flanking the gap on the 3′-GCY1-coding side as well as over the two distal poly(dA·dT) blocks at the 5′-side are narrow (about 140 bp), indicating that these nucleosomes are positioned. Evidently, in the GCY1 wild-type promoter, the Gal4 protein does not contribute to the nucleosome-free state of the GCY1upstream promoter region since the nucleosomal array is identical after growth on glucose (Fig. 3 A), where the expression level of Gal4p is extremely low, or on glycerol/ethanol, where Gal4p is essentially inactive and complexed with Gal80p, or on galactose (Fig.3 B). To confirm this observation and test directly whether Gal4p has any influence on the array of nucleosomes, we analyzed the chromatin structure of the GCY1 promoter in agal4 background (Fig. 3 B). Indeed, the large nucleosome-free gap was detected likewise in wild type and a strain that lacked functional Gal4p, corroborating that nucleosome exclusion from the regulatory GCY1 upstream region is not caused by binding of Gal4p to DNA. As an alternative possibility, we examined whether destruction of the binding sites for Gal4p or Reb1p influence the array of nucleosomes. Our previous studies on expression of Gcy1/β-galactosidase reporter proteins demonstrated that basal expression of GCY1 is mainly influenced by binding of the general regulatory factor Reb1p to the upstream control region on the one hand and on the other hand by the single UASGAL. Basal expression of the Gcy1/β-galactosidase reporter (absence of galactose) is diminished to one-third after deletion of the Reb1p-binding site and reduced to about the same degree by point mutations in the UASGAL in line with the Northern blots shown in Fig. 2. In the double mutant, which was simultaneously deleted for the Reb1p-binding site and for the 5′-flank of the UASGAL, basal transcription of GCY1 was reduced to 1/10 of wild type (30Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Trommler P. Bandlow W. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 105-114Google Scholar), suggesting that the two sites operate independently of one another and that their effects are about additive. We also showed that the stimulating effect of the UASGAL was not due to Gal4p activity in the absence of galactose as carbon source as it was also observed in a gal4genetic background. To investigate whether Reb1p binding or/and the UASGAL activate transcription of GCY1 via an alteration of the chromatin configuration to yield a nucleosome-free gap, the respective promoter mutations were introduced into the original genomic context by a two-step gene replacement (see above and also see Fig. 1, B and C), and the arrangement of nucleosomes was analyzed. The introduction of these mutations into the genomic situation by homologous recombination was necessary to exclude artifacts that could result from plasmid constructs or ectopic insertion of the respective promoter into the genome by means of integrative plasmids. In vivo, DNaseI or micrococcal nuclease digests were performed with each of the two single GCY1 promoter mutants (YMA2 ΔREB1 and YMA3 UASmut) as well as with the double mutant (YMA4 ΔREB1/UASmut). In each of the single mutants as well as in the double mutant, the chromatin structure was strikingly different from the wild-type situation (Fig.4). When only one of thecis-acting elements was eliminated, we observed that the hypersensitivity decreased, and two bands of slightly sensitive linker DNA signals emerged instead. With micrococcal nuclease, we observed similar patterns as with DNaseI with both single mutants. In the presence of galactose, the chromatin structure of the ΔREB1 single mutant was identical to that of the wild-type promoter. This demonstrates that, once nucleosomes cover the promoter as in the ΔREB1 mutant, Gal4p is able to bind to nucleosomal DNA and to disrupt repressing nucleosomes at the core promoter in vivo on its own, i.e. independently of Reb1p. This property is not required in the wild-type situation of the Reb1p site due to the architectural activity of Reb1p. In the double mutant, the patterns of nucleosomes are similar to each of the single mutants with the exception that the three protected regions are short (about 150 bp) and slightly more distinct as compared with the single mutants, and nucleosomes are separated by narrow linkers. This implies that that three positioned nucleosomes occupy theGCY1 upstream region in the double mutant. The molecular mechanisms allowing basal transcription are poorly understood. Our previous analyses demonstrated that GCY1 is expressed at a relatively high basal level in the absence of galactose as a carbon source. Basal expression in the absence of active Gal4p was found to be in part dependent on the general regulatory factor, Reb1p, which binds to its target site about 100 bp 5′ of the TATA box and about 140 bp 3′ of the UASGAL (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar). The UASGALcontributes to basal transcription of GCY1 as well, an effect that is independent of Gal4p binding. In the present work, we analyzed the chromatin structure of the Gal4p-inducible gene,GCY1. Surprisingly, the complete promoter region ofGCY1, 480 bp in length, is permanently free of nucleosomes independent of growth conditions. DNaseI as well as micrococcal nuclease digestions of native chromatin revealed no obvious differences in the chromatin organization after growth of yeast cells on glucose, galactose, or glycerol/ethanol. The nucleosome-free gap of about 480 bp comprises the UASGAL, the Reb1p recognition site, the TATA box, and the transcriptional initiation sites. Although GCY1 is transcriptionally regulated by Gal4p in the presence of galactose as carbon source, no alterations of the chromatin structure can be detected upon Gal4p activation. These observations have been corroborated by analyses of the chromatin structure of theGCY1 promoter region in a Gal4p-deficient yeast background. In the absence of the specific transactivator Gal4p, the nucleosomal array is identical to that of the GAL4 wild-type yeast strain, suggesting that the Gal4 protein on its own has no bearing on the chromatin organization of the GCY1 upstream region. Investigations on the GAL1–GAL10 intergenic region and theGAL80 promoter demonstrated that the UASGAL sites are constitutively free of nucleosomes as well (15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar, 25Lohr D. Hopper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Google Scholar, 27Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar). However, Gal4p levels are very low, and binding to its target site is not detectable when yeast cells are grown on glucose (15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar), whereas the factor binds to its recognition site on glycerol/ethanol, but with its activation domain blocked by Gal80p, and is active only when bound under conditions of galactose induction (reviewed by Johnston (40Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Google Scholar)). Therefore, nucleosome exclusion cannot be attributed to Gal4p action but must be due either to structural properties of the DNA at the UASGAL per se or to another DNA-binding protein that binds to the same or an overlapping motif and inhibits the assembly of nucleosomes. We have excluded the possibility that the UASGALregion is strongly bent or kinked, and as a consequence, incompatible with packaging into nucleosomes by using permutation analyses (data not shown). However, we cannot decide whether this cis-acting element displays a quite rigid DNA structure that cannot be assembled into chromatin or whether an additional protein binds to an overlapping sequence within the UASGAL apart from Gal4p. No indication in favor of the latter possibility could be detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from glucose-grown cells. In contrast to the GCY1 promoter, the hypersensitive regions within the UASGAL of the GAL1–GAL10 andGAL80 promoters span only about 150–230 bp and do not include the TATA elements or the transcriptional start sites (15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar, 25Lohr D. Hopper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Google Scholar). Gal4p action induces alterations of the chromatin structure in these promoters, i.e. repressing nucleosomes are disrupted in the core promoters (9Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Google Scholar, 15Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar, 25Lohr D. Hopper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Google Scholar). Since at the GCY1 promoter, the TATA box and the initiation sites are not concealed in chromatin, there is no need for Gal4p to remove nucleosomes from the basal promoter ofGCY1. Therefore, the permanent exclusion of nucleosomes from the core promoter of GCY1 provides a plausible explanation for the relatively high basal transcription rate. In addition to Gal4p, the general regulatory factor, Reb1p, has been shown to bind to the upstream control region of GCY1. This abundant DNA-binding protein stimulates basal transcription ofGCY1 about 3-fold (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar). Reb1p is supposed to act mainly by nucleosome exclusion from the flanks of its binding site over a region of about 230 bp (13Angermayr M. Oechsner U. Gregor K. Schroth G.P. Bandlow W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4199-4207Google Scholar). One way of its action may be linked to the recent observation with Reb1p action on the promoter on the profilin gene, where it was found that the binding of Reb1p strongly bends DNA. Therefore, it has been concluded that the DNA deviates from the normal B conformation and assumes a structure that is incompatible with packaging into nucleosomes. 2M. Angermayr and W. Bandlow, unpublished. Whether in addition Reb1p assists recruitment of chromatin remodeling machines or histone deacetylases to the promoter site, however, remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, the effect of Reb1p on expression ofGCY1 is small and restricted to basal transcription of the gene (31Angermayr M. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 682-689Google Scholar). On the other hand, the nucleosome-free gap in the GCY1promoter comprises about 480 bp and thus cannot be attributed to Reb1p binding alone. Our investigations imply that Reb1p binding to the upstream region of the GCY1 gene and the UASGALtogether contribute to the permanent exclusion of nucleosomes. To analyze the importance of the Reb1p recognition site and the UASGAL for the organization of the chromatin in theGCY1 upstream control region, we introduced mutations of the respective cis-acting elements into the original genomic context. Mutation of either the Reb1p target sequence or the UASGAL resulted in a loss of the nucleosome-free gap of 480 bp. Three unpositioned nucleosomes occupy this region in the respective promoter single mutants. The nucleosomal arrays are essentially identical in both single mutants. For the promoter double mutant, in which the Reb1p-binding site and the UASGAL have been destroyed simultaneously, the pattern is quite similar to the one in the single mutants. However, some hypersensitivity is still detectable in the single mutants, whereas in the double mutant, the protected regions are more pronounced, and the linkers between the nucleosomes are more distinct, indicating that the additional nucleosomes that cover the double mutant promoter are positioned. We propose that mutations of either the Reb1p recognition motif or the UASGAL result in packaging into chromatin of the upstream control region but that the nucleosomes are not tightly fixed to a definite position but rather allow to some extent the basal transcription machinery to assemble at the TATA box. In contrast, in the promoter double mutant, the transcriptional initiation complex is largely excluded from its target since the nucleosomes seem to be positioned. Both the Reb1p target site as well as the UASGAL are essential for nucleosome exclusion over a stretch of 480 bp in the GCY1 promoter. Neither of the two elements is sufficient to perform this task on its own. As soon as one of the cis-acting elements is eliminated, basal transcription drops to about 1/3 of the wild-type level. Gal4p does not play a role in nucleosome exclusion from the GCY1promoter since the chromatin structures are identical in the wild type and in a Gal4p-deficient background. This indicates that Gal4p acts mainly by stimulating recruitment of the basal transcription machinery to the GCY1 promoter. However, the Reb1p-site mutation of the GCY1 promoter is loosely covered with nucleosomes in the absence of galactose but displays the same nucleosome-free gap as the wild-type promoter after growth of yeast cells on galactose. This demonstrates that, once the chromatin is closed as in the mutant at the Reb1p site, active Gal4p is required to open the chromatin and to make the promoter accessible, whereas in the wild type, this task is constitutively fulfilled by the architectural activity of Reb1p. This simultaneously explains why Reb1p stimulates basal transcription ofGCY1 but does not affect induction of GCY1 by Gal4p action since Gal4p, in its active state, does not depend on the nucleosome excluding function of Reb1p because it is able to disrupt nucleosomes on its own. In summary, and when the transcription data are compared with the chromatin analyses, the following conclusions can be drawn: (i) In the wild type, the chromatin is constitutively open (independent of growth conditions and independent of the presence of Gal4p). The level ofGCY1 mRNA synthesis exclusively reflects the cellular concentration and activation status of Gal4p. (ii) Analysis of the mutant promoters reveals a particular DNA conformation that is due to the binding of Reb1p and a sequence element comprising the UASGAL. Both cis-acting elements cooperate to exclude nucleosomes from the core promoter and promote assembly of the basal transcription machinery and, thus, allow high rates of basal transcription.

Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy transthyretin wild type European Synchrotron Radiation Facility scanning transmission electron microscopy x-ray absorption near-edge structure Amyloidoses are a group of protein misfolding diseases, which include spongiform encephalopathies, Alzheimer's disease, and Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP),1 all of them characterized by extracellular deposits of an insoluble fibrillar protein. Transthyretin (TTR) is the most abundant protein component of amyloid fibrils in the case of FAP patients. It is a plasma protein, with an extended β-sheet conformation, implicated in the transport of thyroxine and vitamin A. Over 80 TTR variants are described in the literature (1Saraiva M.J.M. Human Mut. 2001; 17: 493-503Google Scholar), most of them are pathogenic and related to amyloidosis. While V30M-TTR is the most frequent amyloidogenic variant, L55P-TTR is the variant associated with the most aggressive form of FAP described in the literature. The molecular mechanisms involved in amyloid fibril formation are not yet well understood. Most of the proposed models refer to the dissociation of the tetrameric protein into an intermediate species that self-assembles leading to the insoluble fibril (2McCutchen S.L. Lai Z.H. Miroy G.J. Kelly J.W. Colon W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13527-13536Google Scholar, 3Cardoso I. Goldsbury C.S. Muller S.A. Olivieri V. Wirtz S. Damas A.M. Aebi U. Saraiva M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 683-695Google Scholar). However, some controversy remains regarding this intermediate structure and in particular regarding its monomeric or dimeric conformational nature. For a better understanding of amyloid assembly, mutant TTR proteins containing disulfide bonds linking two monomers were designed, and their ability to form fibrils was tested. While some mutants did not form amyloid, which is consistent with the idea that the monomeric species are necessary for fibril formation (4Redondo C. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 167-172Google Scholar), others do form fibrils, pointing to a dimeric nature of the intermediate species (5Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbel W.L. Yates T.Q. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9089-9096Google Scholar). Recently, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) clarified this question because it revealed a mass-per-length of the protofilaments of ∼0.47 kDa/Å, which is consistent with the model where the monomer is the building block (3Cardoso I. Goldsbury C.S. Muller S.A. Olivieri V. Wirtz S. Damas A.M. Aebi U. Saraiva M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 683-695Google Scholar). Insights into the mechanism of fibril formation were obtained by x-ray diffraction analysis of FAP amyloid fibrils. It was shown that fibrils exhibit a cross β-sheet structure (6Damas A. Sebastião M.P. Domingues F.S. Costa P.P. Saraiva M.J. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 173-178Google Scholar), and two structural models were proposed: a continuous β-sheet helix (7Blake C. Serpell L. Structure. 1996; 4: 989-998Google Scholar) or an association of units with a structure close to the TTR monomer (8Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschner D. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 163-174Google Scholar). The two models are obviously different, and neither of them refers to the packing interactions between the different subunits. The possible role for the sulfur-containing amino acids in the fibril remains unknown. Based on the fact that Cys-10 is more exposed to the solvent in V30M-TTR, it was considered that amyloid fibrils could result from association of TTR molecules through disulfide bridges (9Terry C. Damas A.M. Oliveira P. Saraiva M.J. Alves I. Costa P. Sakaki Y. Blake C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 735-741Google Scholar). This idea was supported by biochemical analysis of amyloid from homozygous and heterozygous individuals with the V30M-TTR mutation (10Thylen C. Wahlqvist J. Haettner E. Sandgren O. Holmgren G. Lungren E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 743-748Google Scholar). However, it does not explain the formation of fibrils in the case of amyloidogenic C10R-TTR variant. In order to find out the role of sulfur in the aggregation mechanism leading to fibril formation it is important to determine unambiguously its oxidation state when the protein is in a soluble form and when it forms the amyloid fibrils. Sulfur K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy provides the analytical tool needed for that purpose. The chemical shift in the x-ray absorption edge and the energy of maximum absorption depend on the sulfur coordination and environment in the sample. The potential of this technique in the analysis of biological materials is enormous because no chemical pretreatment is needed, and consequently there is no perturbation of the sulfur redox state. In fact, the oxidation state of sulfur in the human blood, plasma, and erythrocytes was examined for the first time in 1998 using this methodology (11Rompel A. Cinco R.M. Latimer M.J. McDermott A.E. Guiles R.D. Quintanilha A. Krauss R.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Klein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6122-6127Google Scholar). Later, preliminary studies concerning the acid/base equilibrium of the thiol group of papain, α-amylase, and human serum albumin have been reported (12Bellacchio E. McFarlane K.L. Rompel A. Robblee J.H. Cinco R.M. Yachandra V.K. J. Synchrotron Rad. 2001; 8: 1056-1058Google Scholar). In this work we use sulfur K-edge spectroscopy to examine the sulfur oxidation state of TTR in the soluble and polymerized forms of the protein in order to determine the possible role of the sulfur in intra and intermolecular interactions, namely through the presence or absence of disulfide bridges. Additionally, x-ray diffraction was used to confirm the fibrillar structures of the samples under study and to improve our knowledge about their molecular structure. All TTR mutants were produced in an Escherichia coli expression system, and the periplasmic space contents were obtained by osmotic shock. The supernatant was passed through DEAE-Sephadex, and the TTR-containing peaks were dialyzed overnight against water and then freeze-dried. Further purification was achieved by preparative gel electrophoresis. Finally, TTR solutions were dialyzed against water for 24 h. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method. In vitro amyloid fibrils, except for the L55P-TTR, were formed by acidification. The proteins (2 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.05 m sodium acetate/0.1 m KCl, pH 3.6, for 48 h at room temperature. Then, the fibrils were sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, and the pellets were resuspended in MilliQ water and incubated at 37 °C. Fibril formation was achieved for all the TTR mutants except in the case of C10S-TTR, for which no significant amount of fibrillar material was produced using these conditions. The amyloidogenic properties of the purified L55P-TTR (concentration 6 mg/ml in water, pH ∼7.0) were tested with the thioflavine-T binding assay, and immediately after the purification procedure thioflavine did not bind TTR. Then part of the protein sample was immediately stored at −20 °C. This sample, designated by L55P-TTR protein solution, was restored to room temperature immediately before the spectroscopy experiment. The other part of the protein sample was incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks. Then the sample had amyloidogenic behavior as revealed by the thioflavine-T assay and was designated by L55P-TTR fibril solution. Solutions of 100 μg of amyloid fibrils were prepared as described above. To each solution was added ThT, final concentration 30 μm, in 50 mm glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 9.0, in an assay volume of 1 ml. Excitation spectra were recorded by spectrofluorimetry (FP-770; JASCO) at 25 °C. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The excitation spectra (400–500 nm) were taken with emission collected at 482.0 nm. Sulfur K-edge spectra were recorded at room temperature using synchrotron radiation, at ESRF, beamline ID21: a double Si (111) crystal monochromator allows to achieve an energy resolution of 10−4. The sample fluorescence is collected either by a silicon photodiode or by a high purity germanium fluorescence detector. The reference compounds cysteine, cystine, methionine, methionine sulfoxide, and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid were of reagent grade, purchased from Sigma and used as received. They were in the form of powder, and a small amount was dispersed in a very thin layer. Also, solutions of the reference compounds were prepared, and their spectra measured. No differences between the spectra of the compounds in the powder form and in solution were observed. The protein samples (5–10 μl) were introduced in a special cell for liquids. The soluble proteins were used at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. The fibril solutions were left to sediment for a few hours, and a fraction of the pellet was used to record the spectra. In order to ensure that there was no radiation damage, the complete procedure adopted for protein spectroscopy was the following: a fast spectrum in the region from 2.470 keV to 2.485 keV was recorded with a step size of 0.0005 keV, then two full spectra in the region from 2.450 keV to 2.530 keV were obtained and compared with the initial spectrum to confirm that they were all similar. In the two full spectra, a step size of 0.00017 keV was taken near the edge region (2.470–2.485 keV), and the time of radiation exposure was chosen to have between 5000 ct/s and 10000 ct/s at the maximum of the spectrum. The integration time was always between 4 and 10 s per point. The background was removed from the spectra by subtracting the medium value of the pre-edge horizontal region. Normalization was achieved by dividing the spectra by the medium value of the far post-edge flat region. The proportion of the different forms of sulfur in the samples was estimated by simulation of the protein spectra using a linear combination of the spectra of the reference samples. The sum of the squares of the residuals between the original and the simulations was calculated in the region from 2.470 keV to 2.485 keV and divided by the number of experimental points measured in that region. The obtained value was designated by relative error. The percentages of the reference compounds found to give the minimum relative error were judged to be the best fit of the data. Glass capillary tubes of 0.5-mm diameter were treated with a siliconizing reagent. A fibril solution of L55P-TTR (6 mg/ml) was drawn up into the siliconized glass capillary tubes that were then sealed at the top, placed into a 2-T magnet, and allowed to dry at room temperature. As soon as a thin disk was formed, the capillary tubes were sealed with wax in order to retain some hydration of the sample. The x-ray diffraction patterns were only collected for the samples showing birefringence under cross-polarized light. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at ESRF, beam line ID13, using a 0.975 Å wavelength beam and a beam size of 5 μm. Patterns were recorded on a MAR research imaging plate during exposure times of 10–60 s. The background was recorded and subtracted to the diffraction pattern for elimination of the air scattering effects, using the software package FIT2D (13.Hammersley, A. P. (1998) ESRF Internal Report, ESRF98HA01T, FIT2D V9.129 Reference Manual V3.1.Google Scholar). The sample to detector distance was calibrated with silver behenate. All the samples were examined by x-ray diffraction, and the data always revealed a cross-β pattern, characteristic of the amyloid material. Data from L55P-TTR is shown in Fig. 1, with a sharp 4.85 Å reflection on the meridian and a diffuse equatorial 10.3 Å reflection. The spacing and relative intensities of the observed meridional and equatorial reflections are listed in Table I.Table ISpacing of equatorial and meridional reflectionsMeridionalEquatorialRelative intensityd(obs) Åd(obs) Å12.5s10.3w6.56m4.85m4.65s4.15w Open table in a new tab The meridional reflections, 4.85 and 4.15 Å, may be indexed as the 6th and 7th order of a pseudo-period of 29.1 Å. In previous FAP fiber x-ray diffraction studies was calculated a 29-Å minimum-repeating distance and based on that it was proposed that the monomer was the building block of amyloid fibrils (8Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschner D. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 163-174Google Scholar). Later, it was confirmed by STEM that transthyretin fibrillogenesis entails the assembly of monomers (3Cardoso I. Goldsbury C.S. Muller S.A. Olivieri V. Wirtz S. Damas A.M. Aebi U. Saraiva M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 683-695Google Scholar). However, the 4.85 and 4.65 Å reflections may also represent sampling of a 4.75 Å reflection, corresponding to the backbone separation of the neighboring main chains. The 4.15 Å reflection could be the second order of an 8.3 Å reflection, also observed in the poly-l-glutamine peptide and Sup35 peptide (14Perutz M.F. Finch J.T. Berriman J. Lesk A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5591-5595Google Scholar). Recently EPR measurements of spin-labeled TTR mutants suggest a distance of ∼8 Å between subunits interfaces in the fibrils (15Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbel W.L. Yates T.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 734-739Google Scholar) that could originate that reflection. The three observed meridional reflections indexed as Bragg reflections, fit a repeating unit of 116.3 Å ± 0.1, close to the 115.5 Å already proposed (7Blake C. Serpell L. Structure. 1996; 4: 989-998Google Scholar). This 4× higher period (4 × 29 = 116 Å), can be due to a twist in the β-strands along the fibril axis, leading to the 116 Å repeat. The K-edge spectra of cysteine, cystine, methionine, methionine sulfoxide, and anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid are shown in Fig. 2. The energies of maximum absorption for these compounds are 2.4730, 2.4723, 2.4731, 2.4759, and 2.4809 keV, respectively. The scans were run with a step size of 0.00017 keV near the edge region, and the measured values are in agreement with those found in the literature (11Rompel A. Cinco R.M. Latimer M.J. McDermott A.E. Guiles R.D. Quintanilha A. Krauss R.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Klein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6122-6127Google Scholar, 16Sarret G. Connan J. Kasrai M. Eybert-Bérard L. Bancroft G.M. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1999; 6: 670-672Google Scholar). The shapes of the spectra are clearly different except for cysteine and methionine that look very similar. Moreover, as described in previous studies (16Sarret G. Connan J. Kasrai M. Eybert-Bérard L. Bancroft G.M. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1999; 6: 670-672Google Scholar), it can be observed that the higher the energy of maximum absorption the greater is the peak area. The sulfur K-edge spectra of the WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and C10S-TTR samples are shown in Fig. 3. Some conclusions arise immediately from the observation of the spectra. There are no S–S bonds present in the samples as neither spectra shows the cystine characteristic peak. The three energies of maximum absorption observed are 2.473 keV, 2.476 keV, and 2.481 keV indicating the presence of cysteine and/or methionine, methionine sulfoxide, and sulfonated cysteine. Although the shapes of the spectrum of TTR variants are roughly similar, there are pronounced differences between the non-polymerized and the polymerized forms: in the fibrillar samples there is a large amount of oxidized sulfur (stronger peak at 2.4759 keV from the S-sulfoxide and stronger peak at 2.4809 keV from the S-sulfonated). Since more detailed interpretations demand a quantitative analysis, the experimental protein spectra were simulated by linear combination of the spectra from the reference samples. The simulated spectra are shown in Fig. 4, and the results of the fits and corresponding relative errors are presented in Table II.Table IIThe percentage of the different forms of sulfur used to simulate the sample spectraSampleRelative erroraSum of the squares of the residuals between the original and the simulations in the region from 2.470 to 2.485 keV divided by the number of experimental points measured.Reduced SSulfoxideSulfonateCys/MetCys/CysSMet/MetS%%%ratio%/%%/%Soluble proteinsV30M-TTR0.002086591 /273 /2792 /8L55P-TTR0.0024815141 /172 /2890 /10WT-TTR0.0033844121 /176 /2490 /10C10S-TTR0.005397120 /199 /1FibrilsV30M-TTR0.00775119311 /27 /9372 /28L55P-TTR0.00654616381 /124 /7668 /32WT-TTR0.00485816261 /152 /4868 /32a Sum of the squares of the residuals between the original and the simulations in the region from 2.470 to 2.485 keV divided by the number of experimental points measured. Open table in a new tab TTR is a homotetramer with 127 amino acids per monomer. Cys-10 and Met-13 are the only sulfur-containing amino acids in the wild-type protein and L55P-TTR. V30M-TTR contains one cysteine and two methionines and variant C10S-TTR contains only one methionine. In the non-polymerized protein samples there is a higher fraction of cysteines oxidized to the sulfonated form (24–28%) then methionines oxidized to the sulfoxide form (10% or less), which is consistent with Cys-10 being more exposed to the solvent then Met-13 as revealed by the x-ray crystallographic structures of these variants (9Terry C. Damas A.M. Oliveira P. Saraiva M.J. Alves I. Costa P. Sakaki Y. Blake C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 735-741Google Scholar, 17Blake C.C. Geisow M.J. Oatley S.J. Rerat B. Rerat C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 339-356Google Scholar, 18Sebastião M.P. Saraiva M.J.M. Damas A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24715-24722Google Scholar). According to the crystal structure of V30M-TTR variant, the extra methionine, Met-30, is buried in the molecule and not exposed to the solvent. Therefore in this case, the methionine sulfoxide probably results only from the partial oxidation of Met-13 as it will be the case for the wild type and the other variant proteins. The presence of the S-sulfonated in C10S-TTR variant is residual (2%) and most improbable since no cysteines are present in the protein. The corresponding peak, which is very small, should arise from the multiple scattering effects at the high energy end of the spectra (11Rompel A. Cinco R.M. Latimer M.J. McDermott A.E. Guiles R.D. Quintanilha A. Krauss R.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Klein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6122-6127Google Scholar). The data concerning the cysteine residue show that there is a slight increase in the S-sulfonated content from the wild-type protein (24%) to V30M-TTR (27%) to L55P-TTR (28%). In fact, it was already reported that sulfur K-edge spectroscopy detects changes of ∼5% in the thiol-to-disulfide ratio (11Rompel A. Cinco R.M. Latimer M.J. McDermott A.E. Guiles R.D. Quintanilha A. Krauss R.M. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. Klein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6122-6127Google Scholar). In our experiments, we were able to obtain a higher accuracy in the thiol-to-sulfonate ratio, ∼2%, because the energy peaks were not so close to each other. However, the observed differences are near the sensitivity of the experimental method. To further understand the accuracy of the simulated spectra and their relative errors the experimental spectrum of the soluble L55P-TTR was compared with the spectra simulated with the parameters that best fit the results of the four TTR mutants in the soluble form. These spectra and corresponding errors are presented in Fig.5. When the L55P-TTR spectrum was simulated with the parameters obtained for the best fit of WT-TTR (84% reduced sulfur, 4% sulfoxide, and 12% sulfonate), V30M-TTR (86% reduced sulfur, 5% sulfoxide, and 9% sulfonate) and C10S-TTR (97% reduced sulfur, 1% sulfoxide, and 2% sulfonate), the relative errors (0.0083, 0.019, and 0.059, respectively) were over three times the error associated with the spectrum that represents the best fit for L55P-TTR, which is 0.0024. The results suggest that L55P-TTR, the most aggressive variant described in the literature until now, is the variant with the higher content of sulfonated sulfur (28%). Analysis of the fibrillar material reveals that the percentage of sulfur from the methionine residues that are in the sulfoxide form (V30M-TTR: 28%, L55P-TTR and WT-TTR: 32%) are approximately 3–4× higher then the corresponding value in the soluble proteins (V30M-TTR: 8%, L55P-TTR and WT-TTR: 10%). The cysteines are even more oxidized: in V30M-TTR variant 93% are in the sulfonated form, in L55P-TTR 76% and in WT-TTR protein 48% of the cysteines are oxidized. It is worth mentioning that L55P-TTR variant was not polymerized by acidification. This indicates that cysteine and methionine oxidation is not an artifact resulting from partial denaturation due to acidification but results from structural alterations during or upon polymerization. In order to improve our understanding about the role of sulfur oxidation in the self-assembly of TTR protein, the susceptibility to amyloid formation of reduced WT-TTR was monitored using the thioflavine-T binding assay. A soluble WT-TTR sample (100 μg) was reduced with dithiothreitol (10 mm), and the procedure to amyloid fibril formation by acidification was followed. The reducing agent was removed from the fiber solution just before the thioflavine-T binding assay in order to avoid possible quenching of the spectra. The results show that the reduced protein solution had strong susceptibility to fibril formation (Fig. 6). Although many aspects of amyloid diseases are known, a molecular model describing the interactions between amyloidogenic units at high resolution, e.g. revealing the contacts between different atoms that are responsible for a highly stable structure, as it is the case of the amyloid fibrils, does not exist. This is a priority for defining how to design a drug that either (i) directly binds to a contact region and destroys the interaction or (ii) rather occupies the binding site of one amyloidogenic unit, avoiding its contact with a nearby unit inhibiting amyloid formation. In this work we conclude that in TTR amyloid fibrils, Cys-10, the only cysteine residue present in the TTR protein, does not form disulfide bridges with other molecules and that sulfur-containing amino acids, namely Cys-10 and Met-13, are significantly oxidized upon polymerization. The oxidation of these amino acids may occur before fiber formation or in the mature fiber. In fact, there are two possibilities: oxidation of both amino acids leads to a more polar region capable of forming hydrogen bonds with other molecules and this leads to amyloid fibers; or aggregation leads to conformational changes in the protein that expose Cys-10 and Met-13 to the solvent allowing their subsequent oxidation. However, oxidation of both amino acids is not required for fibril formation as revealed by the strong susceptibly of reduced protein samples to form amyloid. Sulfur oxidation might result as a consequence of structural alterations during protein aggregation exposing the cysteines and methionines to the solvent. Although cysteine-free TTR mutants are capable of amyloid fibril formation (19Mccutchen S.L. Kelly J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 415-421Google Scholar), showing that disulfide linkages are not required for fibrillogenisis, there are a number of studies relating the amyloidogenic behavior of TTR with the oxidation state of sulfur from their cysteine residues. This relation is not clear yet, since some results point to an increased amyloidogenicity of sulfonated transthyretin (20Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Miyazaki A. Shimizu A. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1999; 6: 183-186Google Scholar), while others indicate that the stability of the tetramer is increased by binding of sulfite to Cys-10 (21Atland K. Winter P. Neurogenetics. 1999; 2: 183-188Google Scholar). Nevertheless, S-sulfonated transthyretin has been detected in serum and it was reported that it is significantly more abundant in diseased individuals (22Théberge R. Connors L. Skinner M. Skare J. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 452-459Google Scholar, 23Kishikawa M. Nakanishi T. Shimizu A. Yoshino M. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 47: 492-494Google Scholar). The data show that a significant fraction of the thiol group of cysteines present in the soluble TTR samples is in the sulfonate form. A quantitative study of the sulfinic and sulfonic acid content was carried out in different proteins leading to the conclusion that a significant number of cysteines is irreversibly oxidized. In fact, one in four cysteines was estimated as being reactive to oxidants (24Hamann M. Zhang T. Hendrich S. Thomas J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 146-156Google Scholar). Examination of the protein models available in the Protein Data Bank (25Berman H. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T. Weissig H. Shindyalov I. Bourne P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) shows that only 2.5% of the structures contain oxidized cysteines. However, in a significant amount of the protein structures the cysteines are buried and not exposed to the solvent. Furthermore, in some models the cysteic acid was represented by three water molecules around the sulfur, and therefore its oxidation state is not immediately obvious. In the x-ray crystallographic structures of TTR proteins, the oxidation of Cys-10 has not been detected. This might be explained by the fact that in those structures the N-terminal is disordered and Cys-10 is in most cases the first residue to be observed. In fact large temperature factors were assigned to the sulfur atom of that residue. In human serum, sulfated TTR as well as cysteinylated TTR were detected using mass spectroscopy (22Théberge R. Connors L. Skinner M. Skare J. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 452-459Google Scholar). Further insight to the structure of amyloid fibrils can be obtained from the crystallographic structure of the TTR variants and the results here reported. Met-13 is not buried in the molecule but still partially protected by Lys-15, Glu-54, His-56, Arg-104, and Thr-106. Cys-10 is at the external surface of the molecule and also somehow protected, although not as much as Met-13. It is flanked by the main chain of Leu-12 and Met-13, the side chain of Arg-104, and by the main chain between His-56 and Thr-60 as shown in Fig.7. The crystal structure of G53S/E54D/L55S-TTR, a constructed variant that polymerizes spontaneously at physiological conditions, revealed a structural change of the edge strand D exposing Met-13 (26Eneqvist T. Andersson K. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1207-1218Google Scholar). Also in the highly amyloidogenic L55P-TTR variant, a movement of strand D leading to a long loop between strands C and E was observed (18Sebastião M.P. Saraiva M.J.M. Damas A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24715-24722Google Scholar). This loop contains the His-56–Thr-60 region that mediates the access of the solvent to Cys-10 and to Met-13. The effect of the His-56–Thr-60 region over the accessibility of Met-13 to the solvent was determined for the x-ray crystallographic structures of WT- (PDB ID: 1F41) and L55P-TTR (PDB ID: 5TTR), using Turbo-Frodo (27Cambillau C. Rossel A. Turbo Frodo, Version OpenGL. 1. Universite Aaix-Marseille II, Marseille, France1997Google Scholar). The accessible surface of Met-13 in the WT-TTR is 26 Å2, half of the accessible surface of Met-13 in the L55P-TTR, which is 52 Å2. The reported values are the averaged results for the accessible surfaces of all Met-13 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The accessible surface of Cys-10 was not calculated since the N-terminal in these TTR crystal structures is disordered. Since in the fibrils we observe a substantial increase in the number of Cys-10 and Met-13 amino acids in the oxidized form, we propose that this occurs due to a movement of the protein main chain in the edge region His-56–Thr-60, as it happens in the case of L55P-TTR. In β2-microglobulin, another β-sandwich protein, it was reported that a restructuring of a β bulge that separates two short β strands leads to a protein with a longer strand located at the edge of the molecule and increased amyloidogenic properties (28Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips S.E.V. Radford S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9771-9776Google Scholar, 29Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Google Scholar). Besides this rearrangement of the edge strand, the authors reported a rotation of His-51 increasing the hydrogen bonding potential of that strand and therefore allowing the formation of intermolecular interactions. In the case of TTR, also His-56, located at the edge β-strand that we believe is modified for fibril assembly, has a different conformation in WT- and L55P-TTR (Fig. 7). Furthermore, a contact between this amino acid and a glutamic acid of a nearby molecule was reported as an abnormal interaction that might be important for amyloid formation (18Sebastião M.P. Saraiva M.J.M. Damas A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24715-24722Google Scholar). Recently hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with NMR analysis was used to identify the stable core of β2-microglobulin amyloid fibrils and suggests a loss of structure at the edge of the native β-sheet during self-assembly of the protein (30McParland V.J. Kalverda A.P. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 326-331Google Scholar). In a different study, it was revealed that six of the seven strands present in this β-sandwich protein are protected from H/D exchange in the fiber structure (31Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Google Scholar). According to the CATH-Protein Structure Classification (32Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Google Scholar), TTR and β2-microglobulin belong to the main β-class of proteins, both have a sandwich architecture and an immunoglobulin-like topology. Therefore, a high level of structure similarity exists between the two proteins, and it is most probable that, as in the case of TTR, the two β-sheet cores are maintained in the fibrils. An assembly mechanism, where two edge strands are moved away and the penultimate strands A and B are exposed was recently proposed for TTR (15Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbel W.L. Yates T.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 734-739Google Scholar). This would certainly explain oxidation of cysteine (near strand A) and methionine (on strand A). The x-ray diffraction patterns of TTR amyloid fibrils revealed the classic β-structure with the hydrogen bonds within the β-sheets parallel to the fiber axis. The presence of a broad reflection at 10 Å indicates that the fiber is composed of two β sheets (14Perutz M.F. Finch J.T. Berriman J. Lesk A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5591-5595Google Scholar) as previously proposed. Along the fiber axis, the 29 Å repeating unit may correspond to a monomeric species, although only the 6th and higher order reflections are detected. The lower order reflections were not seen and are not usually detected (7Blake C. Serpell L. Structure. 1996; 4: 989-998Google Scholar, 8Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschner D. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 163-174Google Scholar), which may indicate that the fundamental spacing of 29 Å includes an ordered region with the β-chains perpendicular to the fibril axis, the core of the native protein, and a disordered domain (8Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschner D. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 163-174Google Scholar) that may be due to the structural alterations in the edge strands. We conclude that in TTR amyloid fibrils the repeating units are composed of two β-sheets, resembling the TTR monomer, and that a structural alteration of the protein D-strand and the DE-loop lead to a disordered region that exposes Cys-10 and Met-13 to the solvent. We believe that the newly exposed surface is responsible for promoting protein aggregation. Furthermore, Cys-10 does not form disulfide bridges, and therefore such bridges are not responsible for the highly packed structure present in the fibrils. The thioflavine-T binding assays also show that the reduced protein is susceptible to amyloid formation by acidification. Therefore oxidation, at the native protein state, does not seem to promote amyloid fibril formation. Future studies involve the use of compounds that specifically bind the sulfur-containing amino acids in order to test their role in protein aggregation. We thank P. Moreira for excellent technical assistance."

Following illumination, CRALBP knockout mice exhibit over a 10-fold delay in rhodopsin regeneration, 11-cis-retinal synthesis, and dark adaptation relative to WT animals (1Saari J.C. Nawrot M. Kennedy B.N. Hurley J.B. Garwin G.G. Huang J. Crabb J.W. Neuron. 2001; 29: 739-748Google Scholar). In vitroCRALBP can also serve as a substrate carrier (2Saari J.C. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar, 3Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar), stimulating the enzymatic oxidation of 11-cis-retinol by RPE 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5) and retarding its esterification by lecithin:retinol acyl transferase. In addition, CRALBP is required for in vitro hydrolysis of endogenous RPE 11-cis-reinyl ester (4Stecher H. Gelb M.H. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8577-8585Google Scholar) and is a component of an RPE visual cycle protein complex where it may serve other physiological roles (3Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar). CRALBP is expressed in RPE, retinal Müller cells, ciliary epithelium, iris, cornea, pineal gland, and oligodendrocytes of the optic nerve and brain. The function of the protein in tissues other than RPE is not known, however, CRALBP has also been implicated as being important in an alternate visual cycle for cone visual pigment regeneration possibly involving Müller cells (1Saari J.C. Nawrot M. Kennedy B.N. Hurley J.B. Garwin G.G. Huang J. Crabb J.W. Neuron. 2001; 29: 739-748Google Scholar, 5Mata N.L. Radu R.A. Clemmons R.S. Travis G.H. Neuron. 2002; 36: 69-80Google Scholar). Mutations in the human CRALBP gene causing retinal pathology are addressed in the accompanying report (6Golovleva I. Bhattacharya S. Wu Z. Shaw N. Yang Y. Andrabi K. West K.A. Burstedt M.S. Forsman K. Holmgren G. Sandgren O. Noy N. Qin J. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12397-12402Google Scholar). As part of ongoing efforts to define functional domains in this key visual cycle protein, we are characterizing CRALBP-ligand interactions and the structure of the retinoid binding pocket. Ligand interactions in this water-soluble, 316-residue protein are noncovalent and localized to C-terminal residues 120–313 (7Chen Y. Johnson C. West K. Goldflam S. Bean M.F. Huddleston M.J.

Previous analyses of human recombinant CRALBP (rCRALBP) and site-directed mutants support residues Gln-210 and Lys-221 as components of the retinoid binding pocket (8Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y.

Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Google Scholar). Preliminary NMR studies have suggested that rCRALBP undergoes limited structural changes upon photoisomerization of bound 11-cis-retinal and that Met and Trp residues may be associated with these ligand-dependent conformational changes (9Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Google Scholar, 10Luck L.A. Barrows S.A. Venters R.A. Kapron J. Roth K.A. Paradis S.A. Crabb J.W. Marshak D. Techniques in Protein Chemistry VIII. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 439-448Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, four of the seven methionines in rCRALBP and both tryptophans are located in the C-terminal retinoid binding domain. To identify Met and Trp in the ligand binding cavity, we describe here the preparation, retinoid binding, and structural properties of rCRALBP mutants W165F, W244F, M158A, M208A, M222A, and M225A. Human rCRALBP was produced in bacteria as described elsewhere (9Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Google Scholar, 11Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 91-104Google Scholar). 11-cis-Retinal was obtained from NEI, National Institutes of Health, and 9-cis-retinal was purchased from Sigma. Six human rCRALBP mutants carrying a single substitution (M158A, M208A, M222A, M225A, W165F, and W244F) were created as described for the Altered-Sites mutagenesis kit (Promega). Briefly, WT human CRALBP cDNA in the pET19b vector (9Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Google Scholar) was denatured and co-annealed with a mutagenic primer and a primer that removes an ScaI restriction site from the vector. Second-strand synthesis was then completed by the addition of ligase, polymerase, and dNTPs. The mutagenesis reaction was cleaved withScaI prior to transformation into the mismatch repair-deficient Escherichia coli strain ES1301. Plasmid DNA from the overnight ES1301 culture was digested with ScaI and transformed into DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA from DH5α resistant toScaI digestion was evaluated for the presence of the desired mutation by sequence analysis using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and the model 373A DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis with the underlined nucleotides indicating altered sites: ScaI selection primer, 5′-AATGACTTGGTTGAGTATTCACCAGTCACAGAA-3′; M158A, 5′-GCCGAGTGGTCGCGCTCTTCAACATTG-3′; W165F, 5′-GGTCATGCTCTTTAATATTGAGAACTTCCAAAGTCAAG-3′; M208A, 5′-AAGGGCTTTACCGCGCAGCAGGCTGCTAGCCTCCGGACTTC-3′; M222A, 5′-GATCTCAGGAAGGCGGTCGACATGC-3′; M225A, 5′-AGGAAGATGGTGGACGCGCTCCAGGATTCCTT-3′; W244F, 5′-ATCCACCAGCCATTCTACTTCACCACGA-3′. The sequence of each mutated cDNA was determined by automated DNA sequence analysis for both strands prior to transformation into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysS for the expression of the rCRALBP mutants. To minimize work in the dark, apo-rCRALBP was purified under ambient room light prior to the addition of retinoid using a slightly modified procedure. Bacterial cell pellets (∼3 g) containing rCRALBP were suspended in 9 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 300 mmNaCl), incubated with DNase (2 units/per ml) at room temperature for 30–40 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 22,000 × gfor 1 h. The soluble cell lysate was incubated with 1 ml of agarose nickel affinity support (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen) for 1 h, then the resin was washed with 2 liters of lysis buffer followed by 1 liter of lysis buffer containing 40 mmimidazole. rCRALBP was eluted with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole; 1-ml fractions were collected, and the first 6–8 fractions were pooled, yielding 4–7 mg of purified rCRALBP. Alternatively, microgram amounts of apo-protein were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid silica spin columns as previously described (8Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y. Hulmes J.D. West K.A. Kapron J.T. Ruuska S.E. Noy N. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20712-20720Google Scholar). Following retinoid labeling, holo-rCRALBP was protected from light to prevent ligand photoisomerization. Phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 420H/130/920 automated analysis system (12Crabb J.W. West K.A. Dodson W.S. Hulmes J.D. Coligan J.E. Ploegh H.L. Smith J.A. Speicher D.W. Current Protocols in Protein Science, Unit 11.9, Supplement 7. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.9.1-11.9.42Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli on acrylamide gels using a Mini-Protein II system (Bio-Rad). Protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar); for measuring rCRALBP, the Bio-Rad assay was calibrated with rCRALBP previous quantified by amino acid analysis. The masses of intact mutant rCRALBP (∼5.0 ॖg of each) were determined by MALDI-TOF MS using a PE Biosystems Voyager DE Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with WT human rCRALBP and bovine serum albumin as external and internal calibration standards, respectively (14Hirohata S. Wang W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12182-12189Google Scholar). Mutant rCRALBP were digested with trypsin or endoproteinase AspN and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS with delayed extraction in reflector mode and with synthetic peptides as internal calibration standards (15West K.A.

Hollyfield J.G. Organisciak D.T. Crabb J.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 293-303Google Scholar). For all MALDI-TOF MS, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix (∼5 mg/ml in acetonitrile/water/37 trifluoroacetic acid, 5:4:1), and each spectrum was accumulated for at least 250 laser shots. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed using the PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole electrospray instrument fitted with a nanospray interface (Protana). Tryptic digests were eluted from ZipTips (Millipore) in 757 acetonitrile, 0.027 trifluoroacetic acid, and 2–5 ॖl sample volumes were infused at ∼50 nl/min through gold-coated glass capillaries (4-ॖm inner diameter, New Objectives, Inc.) (15West K.A. Yan L. Miyagi M. Crabb J.S. Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L. Crabb J.W. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 479-491Google Scholar). Precursor ions were selected by their m/z value in Q1, and the resulting fragments were analyzed in Q3. The spectra was acquired in positive ion mode using a step size of 0.2 Da and 0.4-ms dwell time. Purified WT or mutant apo-rCRALBP was labeled in the dark with either 11-cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal by incremental addition of retinoid with mixing between additions to a total of about 1.2-fold molar excess retinoid over rCRALBP (11Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 91-104Google Scholar). After ∼45 min of incubation, excess retinoid was removed by Sephadex G-25 spin chromatography (centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min). Bleaching was by exposure to ambient light for 20 min at 4 °C. Retinoid binding measurements by UV-visible spectrophotometry were performed with a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The ratios of the extinction coefficients for holo-rCRALBP with bound 11-cis-retinal (ε280/ε425 = 3.2) or 9-cis-retinal (ε280/ε400 = 2.2) were used to estimate rCRALBP retinoid binding stoichiometry from observed A280/A425 orA280/A400 absorbance spectral ratios, respectively (8Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y. Hulmes J.D. West K.A. Kapron J.T. Ruuska S.E. Noy N. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20712-20720Google Scholar, 9Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to measure rCRALBP affinity for retinoid ligand. The WT and mutant apo-proteins were excited at 280 nm, and tryptophan fluorescence emission was monitored at 340 nm (using a SPEX Industries Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer). Titrations with 11-cis- or 9-cis-retinal monitored the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the apo-protein (0.5 ॖmrCRALBP), and equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated from the titration data as described previously (8Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y. Hulmes J.D. West K.A. Kapron J.T. Ruuska S.E. Noy N. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20712-20720Google Scholar, 17Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Google Scholar). Human recombinant 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (rRDH5) was expressed in Hi-5 insect cells using a baculovirus vector kindly provided by Dr. K. Palczewski (3Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Jin Z. Yan L. Miyagi M. West K. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A14Google Scholar, 18Jang G.F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Google Scholar) and purified to apparent homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography. RDH5 oxidation activity was measured at pH 7.5 using tritium-labeled 11-cis-retinol as the rCRALBP ligand according to Saari et al. (19Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Garwin G.G. Buzzylko J. Wheeler T. Palczewski K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 128-132Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled 11-cis-retinol was prepared by reducing 11-cis-retinal with triated sodium borohydrate (NaB(3H)4) (20Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots using enzyme assays performed with purified rRDH5 and purified WT and mutant holo-rCRALBP as the sole source of retinoid substrate. Control assays with free retinoid as substrate were performed in the absence of any carrier protein. 15N uniformly labeled WT rCRALBP was prepared by biosynthetic incorporation in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysS grown in defined minimal media containing 1 g/liter 15N ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source plus M9 salts, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 ॖmCaCl2, 1 ॖm FeCl3, 50 ॖm ZnSO4, 10 ॖg/ml biotin, 10 ॖg/ml folic acid, 0.1 ॖg/ml riboflavin, 5 ॖg/ml thiamine, and 207 glucose in D2O (10Luck L.A.

[15N]Methionine-labeled rCRALBP was prepared by biosynthetic incorporation in the same E. colistrain grown in a modified M9 minimal media. Bacterial cells were first grown in LB media to mid log phase (A600 ∼ 0.5) then centrifuged, resuspended, and grown in defined minimal media containing 2× M9 salts plus 17 casamino acid, 2 mmMgSO4, 100 ॖm CaCl2, 0.047 glucose, 17 glycerol, 1 g/liter vitamin B1, 10 mg/liter tryptophan, and 213 mg/liter [15N]methionine. For protein expression, when cultures reached mid log phase in minimal media, isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and the growth temperature was shifted from 37 °C to 25 °C. About 3 g of wet bacterial cell pellet was used for purification of 15N-labeled apo-rCRALBP by nickel affinity chromatography under ambient light conditions. Following labeling with 11-cis-retinal and removal of excess retinoid by Sephadex G-25 spin chromatography, the holo-protein was concentrated to about 0.3 mm by Centricon centrifugation in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol-EDTA. The holo-rCRALBP preparations were adjusted to 87 D2O (v/v) and transferred to 250-ॖl microcell NMR tubes (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA). All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C with a Varian INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe (21Qin J. Vinogradova O. Gronenborn A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 377-389Google Scholar). Sensitivity enhanced two-dimensional1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments were recorded using water-flip-back for water suppression. Data was processed on a Sun UltraSPARC workstation using NMR Pipe and Pipp software (22Delaglio F. Gresiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar, 23Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, holo-protein preparations were maintained in the dark or under dim red illumination to prevent retinoid photoisomerization. To probe the structure of the CRALBP retinoid binding pocket, Met residues Met-158, Met-208, Met-222, and Met-225 were substituted with Ala, Trp residues Trp-165 and Trp-244 were substituted with Phe, and the mutant and WT recombinant proteins were produced in bacteria and purified. Mutants W165F, M208A, M222A, and M225A were present in the soluble cell lysate in amounts comparable to WT rCRALBP. Mutants W244F and M158A were less soluble, and amounts were reduced ∼50 and ∼707, respectively, relative to the WT protein (Fig. 2A). rCRALBP mutant M158A was recovered in insufficient yield for further characterization. All the other mutants and WT rCRALBP were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2B) and characterized by amino acid analysis (Table I) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Supplemental Table SI). These analyses show that the amino acid compositions and intact molecular weights of the mutants are in excellent agreement with the theoretically expected values. About 707 of each mutant protein sequence was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass mapping (not shown), including the peptides containing the substitutions (Supplemental Table SI). The M222A and M225A rCRALBP mutations were verified by electrospray MS/MS sequence analysis (Supplemental Fig. S1).Table IAmino acid compositions of human rCRALBP mutantsAmino acidWTM208AM222AM225AW165FW244Fresidues/moleculeAsx(D+N)2928.239.228.540.529.5Glx(E+Q)5749.259.051.057.444.8Ser(S)1716.418.420.918.517.9Gly(G)2124.426.932.827.022.8His(H)1715.616.812.817.116.9Arg(R)2019.622.521.423.820.8Thr(T)1515.615.615.015.718.2Ala(A)2327.526.928.825.524.2Pro(P)1314.713.314.513.312.6Tyr(Y)109.79.17.88.68.5Val(V)2019.517.915.717.817.9Met(M)76.15.67.66.58.7Ile(I)1411.710.428.210.310.1Leu(L)3033.430.533.131.732.1Phe(F)2423.622.422.123.524.2Lys(K)1615.014.515.014.610.4Amount analyzed (ॖg)2.02.01.21.74.3Average compositional error (7)912131212Compositions were determined by phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid analysis of the purified wild type and mutant proteins; Cys and Trp were not determined (12Crabb J.W.

Purified WT and mutant apo-rCRALBPs were incubated with either 11-cis-retinal or 9-cis-retinal, excess retinoid was removed, and UV-visible spectra were recorded for each holo-protein. Human WT rCRALBP exhibits characteristic absorption maxima (8Crabb J.W. Nie Z. Chen Y. Hulmes J.D. West K.A. Kapron J.T. Ruuska S.E. Noy N. Saari J.C. J. Biol.

Upon bleaching the ligand absorbance maxima shift to ∼380 nm due to the formation of unbound all-trans-retinal. Complexed with 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore absorbance maxima closely resemble that of the WT protein (Fig. 3) for rCRALBP mutants M208A (λmax = 425.5 ± 0.3 nm, n = 4 separate preparations), W165F (λmax = 424.3 ± 0.2 nm, n = 4), and W244F (λmax = 424.3 ± 0.2 nm,n = 4). Binding stoichiometries of 0.9–1.0 mol of 11-cis-retinal were determined for these mutants (Fig. 3). Complexed with 9-cis-retinal, the ligand absorbance maxima for these mutants are similar (within ∼7 nm) to that of WT rCRALBP (M208A λmax = 400.5 ± 0.6 nm,n = 4; W165F λmax = 393.3 ± 0.7 nm, n = 4; and W244F λmax = 404.5 ± 0.8 nm, n = 4), but binding stoichiometries are estimated to be ∼407 lower than for the WT protein (Fig. 3). Relative to WT rCRALBP, chromophore maxima are significantly shifted (∼16–28 nm) toward the UV for mutants M222A and M225A complexed with either 11-cis-retinal (M222A λmax = 396.3 ± 0.9 nm, n = 4; M225A λmax = 408.4 ± 0.4 nm, n = 5) or 9-cis-retinal (M222A λmax = 378.3 ± 0.4 nm, n = 4; M225A λmax = 373.3 ± 1.1 nm, n = 4). Appropriate extinction coefficients for holo-rCRALBP at these wavelengths are unavailable, and ligand binding stoichiometries for M222A and M225A remain to be determined. Upon bleaching the expected shift in ligand absorbance to ∼380 nm could be verified for all the mutants with both the 9-cis and 11-cis ligands except for M222A and M225A with 9-cis-retinal. Fluorescence titration results confirmed that M222A and M225A bind 9-cis-retinal. Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of complexes of mutant rCRALBPs with 11-cis- or 9-cis-retinal were determined by fluorescence titration of the apo-proteins, monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon ligand binding (TableII). Except for mutant W165F, where ligand affinities were weak and undetectable as measured, the apparentKd values for mutant M208A, M222A, M225A, and W244F and WT rCRALBP were in the nanomolar range for 11-cis- and 9-cis-retinal, consistent with previous analyses and within experimental error for the methodology (8Crabb J.W.

However, relative to WT rCRALBP, the determined Kd values for the mutants complexed with 11-cis-retinal were 2.0- to 2.6-fold higher and, when complexed with 9-cis-retinal, between 1.3- and 2.7-fold higher. The measurements demonstrate that all the mutants exhibit weaker affinity for both these ligands than the WT protein.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants of rCRALBP with retinoidsrCRALBP preparation11-cis-Retinal9-cis-RetinalApparent KdKdmutant/Kd WTApparentKdKdMutant/Kd WTnmnmWild type21.5 ± 2.6 (n = 11)51.3 ± 6.5 (n = 12)M208A43.4 ± 7.8 (n = 6)2.0 ± 0.472.9 ± 10.5 (n = 6)1.4 ± 0.3M222A54.0 ± 9.6 (n = 7)2.5 ± 0.573.5 ± 11.7 (n = 6)1.4 ± 0.3M225A55.4 ± 5.8 (n = 6)2.6 ± 0.4136.8 ± 10.7 (n = 6)2.7 ± 0.4W165FToo weakToo weakW244F43.4 ± 6.1 (n = 6)2.0 ± 0.465.9 ± 5.1 (n = 6)1.3 ± 0.2Mean Kd values ± S.E. are shown forn titrations.

Kinetic parameters of recombinant 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (rRDH5)-catalyzed oxidation of 11-cis-retinol were compared using free retinoid or rCRALBP-bound retinoid as substrate (TableIII). When rRDH5 was assayed with WT rCRALBP, about 3-fold lower Km values and ∼207 higher Vmax values were obtained relative to assays with free retinoid as substrate. Mean Kmvalues determined for the rRDH5-catalyzed oxidation of 11-cis-retinol bound to rCRALBP mutants W165F, M208A, M222A, M225A, and W244F were similar to that for WT rCRALBP, but 8–247 greater, suggesting lower rRDH5 affinity for mutant-bound substrate (Table III). Average Vmax values determined for the enzyme reaction with the mutants were 10–297 slower than for the WT protein, and mutants M222A, M225A, and W244F yieldedVmax values slower than the reaction with free retinoid. Statistically, the determined Km for M225A and the Vmax values for M222A, M225A, and W244F are significantly different than the values for WT rCRALBP (Student'st test assuming equal variance, p values = 0.001–0.04, single-sided).Table IIIKinetic parameters of mutant rCRALBP substrate carrier function for rRDH5rCRALBP preparationKmVmaxॖmnmol/mg/minWild type2.5 ± 0.3143 ± 10M208A2.7 ± 0.4123 ± 22M222A2.9 ± 0.3108 ± 22M225A3.1 ± 0.3104 ± 15W165F2.8 ± 0.4128 ± 17W244F2.9 ± 0.5101 ± 13Free 11-cis-retinol7.5 ± 0.3117 ± 3Enzymatic oxidation of rCRALBP-bound 11-cis-retinol was measured with purified rRDH5 as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Mean Km and Vmaxvalues ± S.D. are shown for n = 4 determinations.

To further explore CRALBP-ligand interactions, HSQC NMR analyses were performed with mutants M208A, M222A, and M225A labeled with [15N]Met and with mutant W165F and WT rCRALBP uniformly labeled with15N. The biosynthetic incorporation of [15N]Met was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry prior to NMR analysis as illustrated in Supplemental Fig. S2. Monoisotopic peak intensities for Met-containing peptides were compared with and without isotopic labeling; increased intensities of the15N-containing isotopic peak after biosynthetic incorporation was used to demonstrate significant labeling with [15N]Met. Significant 15N incorporation during uniform labeling of W165F and WT rCRALBP was also achieved, evidenced by a substantial increase (∼1.9 kDa) in the molecular mass of the intact proteins (not shown). Assignment of rCRALBP residues Met-208, Met-222, and Met225 in HSQC NMR spectra was achieved by comparing mutant and WT spectra using the [15N]Met labeled proteins. Fig.4A shows the HSQC spectrum of [15N]Met labeled WT rCRALBP, which reveals seven major signals predicted to correspond to the seven Met in rCRALBP. Each of the mutant spectra (Fig. 4, B–D) lack one signal that corresponds to the altered Met residue. Superpositioning of the spectra allowed definitive assignment of the Met-208, Met-222 and Met-225 amide NH signals and tentative, random assignment of the other four Met in HSQC spectra of WT rCRALBP (Fig. 4A). Assignment of rCRALBP residues Trp-165 and Trp-244 was based on characteristic Trp side-chain NH signals in the downfield chemical shift region. Only o"

In septic patients, the extrinsic coagulation cascade is activated. When septic patients are febrile, mortality is decreased. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of elevated temperatures on TF expression by endothelial cells during a sepsis-like challenge. Human endothelial vein cells (HUVECs) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) for 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h. At the 0-h time point, some HUVECs were heat shocked at 43 °C for 2 h and then recovered at 37 °C for 0, 2, 4, or 6 h. Heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked LPS-stimulated HUVECs were analyzed for TF-specific mRNA expression by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), surface TF expression by flow cytometry, and TF activity by a two-stage clotting assay. Heat shocked LPS-stimulated HUVECs expressed significantly reduced TF-specific mRNA, TF surface protein levels, and TF surface activity when compared with non-heat-shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs (p < 0.0125, p < 0.0125, andp< 0.0001, respectively; repeated measures analysis of variance, ANOVA).

Fever is a physiological response that benefits the host during experimental infections and is correlated with improved patient survival (10Bryant R.E. Hood A.F. Hood C.E. Koenig M.G. Arch. Intern. Med. 1971; 127: 120-128Google Scholar, 11Mackowiak P.A. Browne R.H. Southern Jr., P.M. Smith J.W. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1980; 280: 73-80Google Scholar). Fever is characterized by the generation of acute phase proteins, activation of the immune response, and cytokine-mediated core temperature rise (12Mackowiak P.A. Arch. Intern. Med. 1998; 158: 1870-1881Google Scholar). The effects of elevated core temperature were modeled in rodents given a lethal dose of LPS (14Chu E.K. Ribeiro S.P. Slutsky A.S. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 25: 1727-1732Google Scholar). Heat-stressed rodents challenged with endotoxin express heat shock proteins, which positively correlate with survival (13Yang R.C. Wang C.I. Chen H.W.

The data suggest that heat stress and/or heat shock protein induction are important in survival during sepsis. Little is understood, however, about the molecular mechanism(s) that may explain protection. Heat shock inhibits cytokine- and endotoxin-mediated NF-κB nuclear translocation and I-κB degradation in cultured cells (15Wong H.R. Ryan M. Wispe J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 257-263Google Scholar, 16Curry H.A. Clemens R.A. Shah S. Bradbury C.M. Botero A. Goswami P. Gius D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23061-23067Google Scholar) andin vivo (17Pritts T.A. Wang Q. Sun X. Moon M.R. Fischer D.R. Fischer J.E. Wong H.R. Hasselgren P.O. Arch. Surg. 2000; 135: 860-866Google Scholar). Thus, the heat shock response may protect the host during infection by modulation of proinflammatory genes during sepsis. TF expression in response to LPS and cytokines is also partially regulated by NF-κB. We hypothesized, therefore, that heat shock modulates tissue factor expression by endothelial cells during LPS challenge. In this study we show that heat shock significantly reduces expression of TF-specific mRNA, surface protein, and activity by LPS-stimulated endothelial cells. HUVECs were isolated as described previously (18Balla G. Vercellotti G. Eaton J.W. Jacob H.S. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1990; 103: 174-179Google Scholar, 19Platt J.L. Vercellotti G.M. Lindman B.J. Oegema Jr., T.R. Bach F.H. Dalmasso A.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1363-1368Google Scholar). HUVECs, which were provided by Dr. Gregory Vercellotti (Dept. of Medicine, University of Minnesota), were grown in modified Eagle's media 199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 4.7 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 25 μg/ml ampicillin (Invitrogen), 5 units/ml heparin sulfate (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml ENDOGRO™ (VecTechnologies, Rensselaer, NY) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HUVECs from passages 1 to 4 were used in all experiments. To induce heat shock, HUVEC-containing flasks were immersed in a water bath equilibrated in a 43, 41.5, or 40 °C incubator. Some HUVEC cultures were stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS serotype 55:B5 (Sigma) or IL-1β (R & D Systems, St. Paul, MN). Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC monolayers by the guanidium-phenol extraction method with TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (20Chomczynski P.S.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Cell suspension/TRIzol was stored at −20 °C until RNA purification. The total amount of RNA isolated from each sample was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Purified RNA was stored at −20 or −80 °C until analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), GAPDH short product (GAPDHs), heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), and TF-purified polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into linearized plasmids that contained T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoters (PCR-Script™; Amp Cloning Kit, Stratagene). The primers used to generate PCR products were as follows: GAPDH (5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′, PCR product length 307 bp); GAPDHs (5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′, PCR product length 222 bp); TF (5′-GACAATTTTGGAGTGGGAACCC-3′, 5′-CACTTTTGTTCCCACCTG-3′, PCR product length 310 bp); HSP72 (5′-CTCCAGCATCCGACAAGAAGC-3′, 5′-ACGGTGTTGTGGGGGTTCAG-3′, PCR product length 234 bp). Authenticity and orientation were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Using a combination of primers specific for each gene product and phage promoter flanking region, PCR products were generated containing T7 or T3 promoters. The flanking region primers were as follows: T7F, 5′-GGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAG-3′; and T3R, 5′-TCCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGA-3′. Amplified PCR product size and purity were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. [α-32P]UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA target gene probes were transcribed with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). Transcription products were purified by 5% acrylamide and 8m urea gel electrophoresis (45 min at constant 200 V) and exposed to radiographic film. Full-length, radioactively labeled RNA probes were excised and eluted from acrylamide by overnight incubation in elution buffer from Ambion RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37 °C. To determine target probe specific activity, a liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac 1214 Rackbeta) was used to obtain counts per minute from aliquots of the transcription reaction mixture and target probe eluent. Probes were stored at −20 °C until use. Probe sizes were as follows: GAPDH (unprotected 393 bp, protected 307 bp); GAPDHs (unprotected 308 bp, protected 222 bp); TF (unprotected 396 bp, protected 310 bp); and HSP72 (unprotected 280 bp, protected 234 bp). RPA was performed using the Ambion RPA II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was mixed with 32P-labeled antisense TF or HSP72 and GAPDH or GAPDHs probes. The RNA/probe mixture was hybridized overnight at 42 to 45 °C and then incubated with 1:50 RNase solution (T1/A) for 30 min at 37 °C. Protected RNA products were precipitated and then separated by electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (60 min at 200 V). Gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) for 20–24 h. To quantify mRNA, the phosphorimage of an exposed gel was scanned with a Storm System 840 scanner; ImageQuaNT™ analysis software (version 4.2a) was used to circumscribe the “protected” mRNA fragment and analyze the density of each pixel within each “box.” After correction for background, relative abundance of TF- and HSP72-specific mRNAs was quantified as the ratio to GAPDH or GAPDHs (internal controls) within each sample. HUVECs were analyzed for surface TF expression by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Trypsin/EDTA solution was used to disrupt cell monolayers. Preliminary experiments were preformed to assess the effect of trypsin on the detection of surface TF. Two monolayer disruption protocols were compared. The first used EDTA to disrupt HUVEC monolayers, and the second protocol used a trypsin/EDTA combination. The trypsin/EDTA protocol produced no detectable differences in TF surface expression compared with EDTA treatment when assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Because TF was unaffected and the protocol disrupted HUVEC monolayers more efficiently, the trypsin/EDTA protocol was used for the flow cytometry experiments. HUVEC monolayers were washed with PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 min. The supernatant wash was decanted, and HUVEC monolayers were dispersed by incubation with 0.5 mmEDTA/0.017% trypsin for 1 min. Dispersed HUVECs were washed with cold PBS containing 10% (v/v) FBS, centrifuged at 400 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and counted in a hemocytometer after resuspension in 250 μl of PBS containing 2% (v/v) FBS. HUVECs (5 × 105) were incubated with 8 μg/ml anti-TF or IgG isotype control antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 25× the incubation volume with PBS containing 2% FBS, and incubated with an anti-isotype secondary antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at 4 °C. To assess nonspecific binding, some HUVECs were washed and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 2% FBS and incubated with the secondary antibody only. To assess HUVEC viability, propidium iodine (1 μg/ml final concentration) was added to each cell suspension prior to flow cytometry. HUVEC monolayers were washed with PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 min. Supernatants were removed, and the monolayers were disrupted by incubation with 0.5 mm EDTA/0.017% trypsin for 1 min. To inhibit trypsin activity, HUVEC suspensions were washed with cold Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% (v/v) FBS. HUVECs (6 × 105) were pelleted, washed with buffer, and then incubated with 15 nmfactor VIIa (Clinical Enzyme Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates. Factor X (Clinical Enzyme Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and S-2222 (DiaPharma Group Inc, West Chester, OH) were added to each cell suspension at final concentrations of 300 μm and 1.4 μg/ml, respectively. Cleavage of S-2222 by factor Xa was detected by a change in absorbance at λ = 405 nm (Bio-Rad microplate reader model 3550). Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) was applied in which HUVECs were “subjects,” and the within-subject fixed effects were heat shock (present or absent), time (treated as categories), and ionomycin (present or absent). The one exception is the analysis supporting Fig. 3 I, which included the between-subject factors heat shock and temperature. Allpost hoc tests used the Bonferroni correction to maintain an alpha (type I error rate) of 0.05. Confluent HUVEC monolayers were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml LPS for various times. At each time point, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed for TF-, HSP72-, and GAPDH-specific mRNA expression by an RPA. Fig.1 A is a representative phosphorimage from a time course experiment. The right panel shows ribonuclease digestion of the unbound RNA target probe. In the left panel, TF-specific mRNA expression by HUVECs appeared to maximize at 2 h of LPS-stimulation and return to near baseline levels at 6 h. The increase in the TF-specific message was significant at 1, 2, and 4 h when compared with non-stimulated HUVECs and maximized at 2 h (Fig. 1 B). To determine the LPS dose that would maximally stimulate TF-specific mRNA expression, confluent HUVEC monolayers were incubated for 2 h with each LPS concentration. LPS-stimulated HUVECs did not express detectable quantities of HSP72-specific mRNA at any time or concentration tested (data not shown). LPS concentrations from 0.01 to 10 μg/ml induced TF-specific mRNA expression, which was maximal at 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 1, C andD). HUVEC cultures were heat shocked at 43 °C over time. At the times indicated, total RNA was isolated and analyzed for expression of HSP72-, TF-, and GAPDH-specific mRNA. HUVEC cells expressed HSP72-specific mRNA, which appeared to peak at 2 h (Fig. 2 A). Heat-shocked HUVECs did not express detectable quantities of TF-specific mRNA (data not shown). Based upon the optimization experiments, a standard protocol was used unless noted (Fig. 2 B). LPS (0.1 μg/ml) was added, and HUVEC cultures were heat shocked at 43 °C for 2 h and then re-equilibrated at 37 °C for up to 4 h (Fig.2 B). To determine the effect of heat shock on TF mRNA expression, LPS was incubated with HUVEC monolayers in the presence or absence of heat shock. LPS induced TF-specific mRNA in heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked HUVECs (Fig. 2 C). Heat-shocked HUVECs express HSP72-specific mRNA (Fig. 2 C, right panel). At 2 h, heat shock significantly reduced expression of TF-specific mRNA by LPS-stimulated HUVECs when compared with non-heat shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs (Fig.2 D). After 2 h of incubation with LPS, cells were allowed to re-equilibrate at 37 °C. The reduction in the expression of TF-specific mRNA caused by heat shock was not apparent (Fig.2 D). To determine whether the surface iTF expression of heat shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs paralleled the decrease in TF-specific mRNA expression, monolayers were stimulated with LPS or IL-1β and heat shocked. Monolayers were dispersed and analyzed by flow cytometry for iTF expression. Non-heat shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs were also analyzed for comparison. After 4 h of LPS stimulation, 31.7% of HUVECs were surface iTF-positive in a representative histogram (Fig.3 A, shaded area). After heat shock, only 22.2% of LPS-stimulated HUVECs were surface iTF positive (Fig. 3 B, shaded area) (reactions with isotype control antibodies are shown as unshaded histograms). Virtually no iTF was detected on HUVECs that were unstimulated (Fig.3 C) and heat shocked (2 h), followed by recovery for 2 h at 37 °C (Fig. 3 D), or stimulated with LPS for 4 h and incubated with secondary antibody only (Fig. 3 E). Surface expression of iTF by HUVECs stimulated with LPS (Fig.3 F) or IL-1β (Fig. 3 G) was significantly reduced by heat shock at all time points. Because reduced HUVEC viability caused by heat shock could explain the reduction of surface iTF, monolayers were assessed by propidium iodine dye exclusion. Heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked LPS-stimulated HUVECs maintained similar viability over time (Fig. 3 H). To determine whether a temperature between 37 and 43 °C depressed TF expression, LPS-stimulated HUVECs were heat shocked at 40 and 41.5 °C. At temperatures between 37 and 43 °C, smaller reductions in iTF surface expression were detected (Fig. 3 I). To determine whether the reduction in iTF surface expression by heat shock was functional, TF/factor VIIa activity was estimated as factor Xa generation by a serum-free, two-stage clotting assay. LPS-stimulated HUVECs were either maintained at 37 °C or heat shocked for 2 h and then allowed to recover for 2 h at 37 °C. Other cultures were heat shocked without LPS. Equal numbers of HUVECs were analyzed for TF activity. Factor Xa generation was largely inhibited by heat shock (Fig. 4 A). To show that the generation of factor Xa required iTF, anti-TF antibodies or isotype controls were added to the LPS-stimulated HUVECs before the addition of factor X and S-2222 (Fig. 4 B). Inhibition by anti-TF antibodies confirmed that factor Xa generation was TF-dependent. To determine whether the heat shock-induced reduction in surface activity might be due to the encryption of TF, ionomycin was added to LPS-stimulated heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked HUVECs. TF surface activity decreased significantly in heat-shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs independent of the treatment with ionomycin (Fig. 4 C). Although total TF activity increased, ionomycin did not substantially affect the ratio of TF surface activity in heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked LPS-stimulated HUVECs. In this study, we hypothesized that LPS-stimulated endothelial cells modulate TF when heat shocked. During LPS stimulation at 37 °C, TF-specific mRNA expression maximized in HUVECs at 2 h and returned to near baseline by 6 h (Fig. 1, A andB). For the first time, we showed that heat shock significantly reduced TF-specific mRNA expression during 2 h of LPS stimulation when compared with non-heat-shocked, LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether TF surface protein levels paralleled the decrease TF mRNA, we performed flow cytometry experiments. The largest number of surface iTF (+) HUVECs were detected at 4 h of LPS-stimulation (Fig.3 F). Heat shock significantly reduces surface iTF (+) HUVECs after stimulation with LPS for 2, 4, 6, or 8 h (Fig.3 F). Regulation of the expression of TF by heat shock may be under the control of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB regulates cytokine- and LPS-mediated TF expression (21Pendurthi U.R. Williams J.T. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3406-3413Google Scholar, 22Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M.

Heat shock attenuates NF-κB nuclear translocation and the induction of NF-κB-dependent nitric oxide synthase in murine epithelial cells (15Wong H.R. Ryan M. Wispe J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 257-263Google Scholar). Future studies will determine whether NF-κB nuclear translocation is reduced in heat shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs. 2D. L. Basi, K. F. Ross, J. S. Hodges, and M. C. Herzberg, manuscript in preparation. Heat shock regulation of TF expression was not specific to LPS. Flow cytometry experiments were repeated using IL-1β to stimulate TF expression. In response to IL-1β, heat shock significantly reduced surface iTF (+) HUVECs at all times (Fig. 3 G). Although the magnitude of the heat shock inhibition of iTF expression was temperature dependent (Fig. 3 I), the extent of reduction appeared to be independent of the strength of the procoagulant signal. Interleukin-1β or LPS stimulation induced similar surface iTF expression, with peak expression appearing to occur at 4 h. At 4 h, however, IL-1β induced expression on more HUVECs (≅ 60%) compared with LPS (≅ 36%) (Fig. 3, F and G). Heat shock also caused a greater reduction in the iTF (+) HUVEC population when IL-1β was used as the stimulating agent. In contrast, heat shock of LPS- and IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs reduced iTF (+) to 19.5 and 18% of the population, respectively. Heat shock appeared to down-regulate TF expression to this minimum level despite differences in stimulus potency, which may be an important control of coagulation if the anti-coagulant effect of heat shock occurs in vivo. TF surface expression was reduced on heat-shocked LPS- or IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs, but it was expressed. Therefore, we assessed surface TF procoagulant activity by a two-stage clotting assay. Heat shock significantly reduced surface TF activity by LPS-stimulated HUVECs (Fig. 4, A and C). Because TF-specific antibodies inhibited the two-stage clotting assay (Fig. 4 B), the procoagulant activity expressed on HUVECs was produced by TF. The reduction in TF surface activity was proportional to decreases in TF protein and TF-specific mRNA expression (Fig.5), which strongly suggests that heat shock mediated the modulation of transcription without detectable post-translational modification. Encrypted TF is the non-functional proportion of the total quantity of surface TF (23Bach R. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6995-6999Google Scholar, 24Maynard J.R. Heckman C.A. Pitlick F.A. Nemerson Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 814-824Google Scholar). Heat shock may have altered the proportion of encrypted TF and, therefore, could account for the decreased TF activity. To assess the total functional TF activity, we added ionomycin to HUVECs prior to incubation with factor VIIa. Ionomycin treatment increased surface TF activity, suggesting that a fraction of the TF was encrypted. Heat-shocked, LPS-stimulated HUVECs treated with ionomycin, however, showed significantly reduced surface TF activity (Fig. 4 C). Sixty-one percent of TF activity was encrypted on LPS-stimulated HUVECS compared with 83% on heat shocked cells. The data suggest that heat shock reduced the absolute quantity and functional activity of surface TF. We considered several other explanations for the results. The reduction in TF expression may have reflected the loss of LPS or IL-1β activity due to heat denaturation during heat shock. Therefore, LPS and IL-1β were pre-heated at 43 °C for 2 h and then added to HUVEC cultures. The surface iTF (+) HUVEC population was virtually identical when stimulated with pre-heated LPS or IL-1β (data not shown), indicating that heat denaturation or degradation did not alter activity. Perhaps heat shock itself contributed to cell injury or death and thus reduced TF expression. To test this possibility, cell viability was compared in heat stressed and unstressed LPS-stimulated HUVECs. Although HSP72-specific mRNA was up-regulated by heat shock and served as a positive control, viability was unaffected by heat shock when assessed by propidium iodine exclusion staining (Figs.2 C and 3 H). To rule out cellular injury as a cause of reduced TF expression, cellular respiration and gross morphological changes were compared in heat-stressed and -unstressed LPS-stimulated HUVECs. Cellular respiration and morphologic changes were evaluated by AlamarBlue™ reduction and light microscopy, respectively. Heat shock did not produce detectable changes in HUVEC respiration or morphology (data not shown). Heat shock modulates the expression of certain genes without apparent effect on other cell functions. For example, heat shock reduced the expression of TNF-α mRNA and protein by LPS-stimulated macrophages, which retained the ability to ingest antibody-coated erythrocytes like non-heat-shocked macrophages (25Snyder Y.M. Guthrie L. Evans G.F. Zuckerman S.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 51: 181-187Google Scholar). Collectively, these experiments suggest that heat shock can modulate TF gene expression without an effect on specific cell functions, injury, or death. Reduction of TF expression by heat shock in LPS-stimulated HUVECs was therefore not due to cellular injury or death. Based on our study, we hypothesize that fever may protect septic hosts because of the reduced activation of extrinsic coagulation. Attenuated expression of TF would be expected to decrease development of DIC and improve the clinical prognosis. Fever may also play a role in other disease processes such as atherosclerosis. Viral and bacterial infections have been suggested as being implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (26Gabrielli M. Santarelli L. Gasbarrini A. Circulation. 2002; 106: e32Google Scholar, 27Rugonfalvi-Kiss S. Endresz V. Madsen H.O. Burian K. Duba J. Prohaszka Z. Karadi I. Romics L. Gonczol E. Fust G. Garred P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1071-1076Google Scholar, 28Shi Y. Tokunaga O. Pathol. Int. 2002; 52: 31-39Google Scholar). For example, specific pathogen-free chickens infected with Marek's disease virus and fed cholesterol-supplemented diets develop arterial fatty-fibro lesions similar to atheromas (29Minick C.R. Fabricant C.G. Fabricant J. Litrenta M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1979; 96: 673-706Google Scholar). In humans, the presence of cytomegalovirus antibodies is an independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis (30Nieto F.J. Adam E. Sorlie P. Farzadegan H. Melnick J.L. Comstock G.W. Szklo M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 922-927Google Scholar). Chlamydia antigens are detected in ∼80% of coronary atherectomy sites compared with 4% in non-diseased vessels (31Muhlestein J.B. Hammond E.H. Carlquist J.F. Radicke E. Thomson M.J. Karagounis L.A. Woods M.L. Anderson J.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996; 27: 1555-1561Google Scholar). In view of our data, it is noteworthy that the host responds to chlamydia and cytomegalovirus infections with antibody production, but clinical symptoms such as fever are usually absent. We hypothesize that the absence of fever generation during acute chronic vascular infections may increase the risk of thrombosis, contributing to the development of atheromas and acute coronary events such as myocardial ischemia or infarction.
