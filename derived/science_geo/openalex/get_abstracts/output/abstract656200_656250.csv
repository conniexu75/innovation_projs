Once inside host cells, not only does the virus hijack the cells' translational machinery to make viral proteins, but the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) also shuts down translation of host messenger RNA. Thoms et al. determined a 2.6-angstrom resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of a reconstituted complex of Nsp1 bound to the human 40 S ribosomal subunit and showed that Nsp1 blocks the messenger RNA entry tunnel. A structural inventory of native Nsp1-ribosome complexes from human cells confirms this mechanism. Cellular studies show that the translational shutdown almost completely inhibits the innate immune response. The binding pocket on the ribosome may be a target for drugs to treat COVID-19.

https://openalex.org/W3022783334,"De novo assembly of a human genome using nanopore long-read sequences has been reported, but it used more than 150,000 CPU hours and weeks of wall-clock time. To enable rapid human genome assembly, we present Shasta, a de novo long-read assembler, and polishing algorithms named MarginPolish and HELEN. Using a single PromethION nanopore sequencer and our toolkit, we assembled 11 highly contiguous human genomes de novo in 9 d. We achieved roughly 63× coverage, 42-kb read N50 values and 6.5× coverage in reads >100 kb using three flow cells per sample. Shasta produced a complete haploid human genome assembly in under 6 h on a single commercial compute node. MarginPolish and HELEN polished haploid assemblies to more than 99.9% identity (Phred quality score QV = 30) with nanopore reads alone. Addition of proximity-ligation sequencing enabled near chromosome-level scaffolds for all 11 genomes. We compare our assembly performance to existing methods for diploid, haploid and trio-binned human samples and report superior accuracy and speed."

Without coordinated relaxation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) among the most closely connected countries, it is difficult to envisage maintaining control of infectious viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ruktanonchai et al. used mobility data from smartphones to estimate movements between administrative units across Europe before and after the implementation of NPIs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Modeling disease dynamics under alternative scenarios of countries releasing NPIs, in particular stay-at-home orders, showed that if countries do not coordinate their NPIs when they relax lockdown, resurgence of disease occurs sooner. Coordination of on-off NPIs would significantly increase their effectiveness at reducing transmission across Europe. Science , this issue p. 1465"

In striatal spiny projection neurons, the most vulnerable cell type in HD, we observe a release of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) (a potent mitochondrial-derived innate immunogen) and a concomitant upregulation of innate immune signaling in spiny projection neurons. Further, we observe that the released mtRNAs can directly bind to the innate immune sensor protein kinase R (PKR).

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research GroupA novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington’s disease chromosomes.Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6411) Google Scholar). Depending on the neuropathological severity, HD is classified along five grades (0–4), with grade 0 displaying no neuropathological abnormalities, grade 1 displaying 50% loss of striatal neurons, and grade 4 displaying 95% loss of striatal neurons. In addition to neuronal loss, striatal astroglia numbers are greatly increased in grades 2–4 (Vonsattel et al., 1985Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. Neuropathological classification of Huntington’s disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). Although it is still not fully understood how trinucleotide CAG repeat expansions in the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT) lead to the death of striatal neurons, mHTT has been linked to both toxic gain-of-function, as well as loss-of-function, effects in diverse cellular processes that include synaptic neurotransmission, neurotrophin signaling, mitochondrial function, DNA damage repair, axonal and vesicular transport, calcium signaling, and gene transcription (Zuccato et al., 2010Zuccato C. Valenza M. Cattaneo E. Molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutical targets in Huntington’s disease.Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 905-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In support of gene transcription dysregulation as having an important role in HD pathobiology, mutant Huntingtin protein is most toxic when localized in the nucleus (Benn et al., 2005Benn C.L. Landles C. Li H. Strand A.D. Woodman B. Sathasivam K. Li S.H. Ghazi-Noori S. Hockly E. Faruque S.M. et al.Contribution of nuclear and extranuclear polyQ to neurological phenotypes in mouse models of Huntington’s disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3065-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; Saudou et al., 1998Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Huntingtin acts in the nucleus to induce apoptosis but death does not correlate with the formation of intranuclear inclusions.Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar) and the degree of transcriptional dysregulation in HD correlates with brain area vulnerability in human HD samples (Hodges et al., 2006Hodges A. Strand A.D. Aragaki A.K. Kuhn A. Sengstag T. Hughes G. Elliston L.A. Hartog C. Goldstein D.R. Thu D. et al.Regional and cellular gene expression changes in human Huntington’s disease brain.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Because of this, and moreover that gene expression profiling reports not only on transcriptional dysregulation itself but also generally on cellular responses to mHTT, many studies have used gene expression profiling of HD and HD model tissue to study transcriptional changes induced by mHTT. However, to date, these studies have been limited by anatomical cellular intermixing, and thus, they have not detected striatal cell type-specific changes to gene expression, but such data could yield critically lacking insights into the basis of mHTT toxicity. For example, there is differential vulnerability among HD-affected neurons, with Drd2-expressing striatopallidal “indirect pathway” spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) displaying higher vulnerability in HD patients (Reiner et al., 1988Reiner A. Albin R.L. Anderson K.D. D’Amato C.J. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Differential loss of striatal projection neurons in Huntington disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 5733-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). It is possible that other, less vulnerable cell types possess protective intrinsic factors or adaptive responses that iSPNs lack or that iSPNs possess unique vulnerability factors or neurotoxic responses, knowledge of which may point to new HD therapeutic targets. Across many neurodegenerative diseases, not just HD, the basis of enhanced or selective neuronal vulnerability is not well understood. Thus, cell type-specific transcriptional studies across HD and HD models may provide a paradigm for future studies in other disease models. To gain cell type-specific resolution in gene expression profiling (experimental approach overview: Figure 1), we applied the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methodology (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D. Heiman M. Schmidt E.F. Stevens T.R. Ma G. Bupp S. Shrestha P. Shah R.D. Doughty M.L. et al.Application of a translational profiling approach for the comparative analysis of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 749-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) to the study of both a commonly used HD transgenic model (R6/2; human HTT exon 1 with 160 CAG repeats) as well as a series of Htt gene knockin CAG-expansion mouse “allelic series” models containing full-length mouse Htt (with a humanized HTT exon 1) with 20, 50, 111, 170, or 175 CAG repeats. Cell type-specific changes in both types of models were additionally interrogated by unbiased striatal single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). We further report here a snRNA-seq characterization of caudate/putamen (striatal) cell types of grade 2–4 human HD post mortem samples in order to compare mouse model data to that obtained from affected striatal neurons in human HD. Comparison of gene expression changes across mouse and human cell types studied revealed a previously unrecognized complexity of cell type-specific gene expression changes in response to mHTT, as well as a conservation of many of these gene expression changes between HD and HD mouse models for neurons (but less so for some glial cell types). Several genes close to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been implicated as age-of-onset modifiers by a recent human genetic study (Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) ConsortiumCAG repeat not polyglutamine length determines timing of Huntington’s disease onset.Cell. 2019; 178: 887-900.e14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were altered in several caudate/putamen cell types in HD. Further, across the models and species, we observed a release of mitochondrial RNAs (mtRNAs) in SPNs, which resulted in an activation of neuronal innate immune signaling. We further found that released mtRNAs were bound to the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor protein kinase R (Eif2ak2; hereafter referred as PKR). Finally, we show that chemical inhibition (absent mHTT) of mitochondrial function alone is sufficient to induce PKR expression in human neurons. From these data, we highlight the importance of considering cell type-specific transcriptional dysregulation in HD pathogenesis and propose a model whereby mHTT leads to mitochondrial dysregulation and release of mtRNAs that then trigger an innate antiviral immune signal, leading to enhanced neuronal vulnerability in HD. In order to profile striatal SPNs, which are the most affected cell type in HD (Vonsattel et al., 1985Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. Neuropathological classification of Huntington’s disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985; 44: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar), and corticostriatal projection neurons (CStrPNs), which provide the majority of the excitatory glutamatergic input into the striatum and also have been implicated in HD (Cepeda et al., 2007Cepeda C. Wu N. André V.M. Cummings D.M. Levine M.S. The corticostriatal pathway in Huntington’s disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; 81: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar; Figure 2A), we first used the TRAP methodology that allows for rapid, one-step affinity purification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The TRAP methodology provides high-resolution molecular phenotyping at the cell type population level and additionally reports mRNAs that are bound by cytosolic ribosomes, thus providing data on mature mRNAs. We first studied the response of the targeted cell types to transgenic overexpression of a mutant exon 1 fragment of human HTT with a high CAG repeat expansion (160 CAG), utilizing the well-described and widely used R6/2 HD model (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Exon 1 of the HD gene with an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to cause a progressive neurological phenotype in transgenic mice.Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar; Figure 1). For these exon 1 mHTT studies, Drd2-expressing striatopallidal iSPNs and Drd1a-expressing striatonigral “direct pathway” spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) were targeted using previously described TRAP lines (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), and CStrPNs were targeted by injection into the striatum of a retrograde viral vector encoding the TRAP transgene in order to transduce, by projection, cortical neurons that project to the striatum (STAR Methods; Figure S1). 9-week-old mice were used to represent an early/mid-phenotypic time point in this R6/2 model (Mangiarini et al., 1996Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Exon 1 of the HD gene with an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to cause a progressive neurological phenotype in transgenic mice.Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). At this time point, over 5,000 protein-coding genes were dysregulated in both dSPNs and iSPNs, and more than 1,000 genes were dysregulated in CStrPNs, in response to exon 1 mHTT overexpression (Figure 2B; Table S1). Comparison of the gene expression changes across cell types revealed that approximately half of dSPN- and iSPN-dysregulated genes were shared, and approximately half of the genes dysregulated in CStrPNs were also dysregulated in either or both types of SPNs (Figure 2C). As expected from previous studies (Langfelder et al., 2016Langfelder P. Cantle J.P. Chatzopoulou D. Wang N. Gao F. Al-Ramahi I. Lu X.H. Ramos E.M. El-Zein K.

Genet. 2000; 9: 1259-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), many SPN marker genes were downregulated in both dSPNs and iSPNs (Figure 2D), but unexpectedly, several of these SPN marker genes were also downregulated in CStrPNs (Figure 2D). Pdyn and substance P/Tac1, markers of striatal striosomes (Bolam et al., 1988Bolam J.P. Izzo P.N. Graybiel A.M.

Ragsdale Jr., C.W. Histochemically distinct compartments in the striatum of human, monkeys, and cat demonstrated by acetylthiocholinesterase staining.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 5723-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) that may display earlier vulnerability in HD than the rest of the striatum (Hedreen and Folstein, 1995Hedreen J.C. Folstein S.E. Early loss of neostriatal striosome neurons in Huntington’s disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and consistent with reports in HD mouse models of striosome-biased effects (Menalled et al., 2002Menalled L.B. Sison J.D. Wu Y. Olivieri M. Li X.J. Li H. Zeitlin S. Chesselet M.F. Early motor dysfunction and striosomal distribution of huntingtin microaggregates in Huntington’s disease knock-in mice.J.

Dis. 2009; 33: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At the gene pathway level, many pathways were altered in each cell type in the R6/2 model (Figure 2E; but see also Table S1). Among the most significant pathways commonly altered in dSPNs and iSPNs, many terms related to the regulation of synaptic transmission and function were downregulated, and the DNA mismatch repair pathway (including Msh2 and Mlh3) was upregulated. Upregulation of the DNA mismatch repair pathway (members of which can contribute to somatic instability of the mHTT CAG repeat; Dragileva et al., 2009Dragileva E. Hendricks A. Teed A. Gillis T.

Msh2 deficiency prevents in vivo somatic instability of the CAG repeat in Huntington disease transgenic mice.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) may further contribute to the instability of the mHTT CAG trinucleotide repeat that has been demonstrated in this model (Gonitel et al., 2008Gonitel R. Moffitt H. Sathasivam K. Woodman B. Detloff P.J. Faull R.L. Bates G.P. DNA instability in postmitotic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Among the most significant cell type-specific pathways, the neurotrophin signaling pathway was upregulated in iSPNs, and several terms related to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway were downregulated in iSPNs. Many studies have implicated mHTT in the dysregulation of both of these pathways (Zuccato et al., 2010Zuccato C. Valenza M. Cattaneo E. Molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutical targets in Huntington’s disease.Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 905-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), but our studies point to iSPNs specifically as having differential responses in these pathways at this model time point. For example, although the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor Ntrk2 was downregulated in both dSPNs and iSPNs, only iSPNs showed upregulation of Bdnf itself, which may reflect a homeostatic response in iSPNs at this time point. Furthermore, downregulation of OXPHOS pathway genes would be expected to lead to neurotoxic effects in iSPNs based on the known striatal neurotoxic effect of OXPHOS inhibition (Wüllner et al., 1994Wüllner U. Young A.B. Penney J.B. Beal M.F. 3-nitropropionic acid toxicity in the striatum.J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1772-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Many gene pathways were also altered in CStrPNs in the R6/2 model, but most notable in overlap with dSPN and iSPN changes were many downregulated pathways related to synaptic function as well as the circadian entrainment pathway (Figure 2E; Table S1). This downregulation of circadian genes in CStrPNs, dSPNs, and iSPNs may contribute to many cellular abnormalities, including perturbed redox homeostasis; indeed, disruption of circadian clock transcriptional activators has been shown to enhance the striatal neurotoxicity of the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid in vivo (Musiek et al., 2013Musiek E.S. Lim M.M. Yang G. Bauer A.Q. Qi L. Lee Y. Roh J.H. Ortiz-Gonzalez X. Dearborn J.T. Culver J.P. et al.Circadian clock proteins regulate neuronal redox homeostasis and neurodegeneration.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 5389-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder et al., 2016Langfelder P. Cantle J.P. Chatzopoulou D. Wang N. Gao F. Al-Ramahi I. Lu X.H. Ramos E.M. El-Zein K. Zhao Y. et al.Integrated genomics and proteomics define huntingtin CAG length-dependent networks in mice.Nat.

A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2005; 4: Article17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar) was next used to identify modules of genes that were co-expressed across the dSPN and iSPN R6/2 model TRAP data. This analysis revealed several modules of genes with distinct transcriptional responses in either the presence of mHTT or by SPN cell type (Figures S2A and S2B). Inspection of hub genes (those having expression values that were highly correlated with that module’s eigengene values; Langfelder et al., 2013Langfelder P. Mischel P.S. Horvath S. When is hub gene selection better than standard meta-analysis?.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e61505Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar; Figure S2C) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (Figure S2D) of these modules’ genes revealed that synaptic and circadian entrainment pathway genes were among those that were most highly enriched in the “dark green,” “green,” and “black” modules (associated with the presence of mHTT) and that OXPHOS and synaptic pathway genes were among those that were most highly enriched in the “salmon” and black modules (associated with cell type). WGCNA analysis of the CStrPN R6/2 model TRAP data revealed that synaptic and circadian entrainment pathway genes were among those that were most highly enriched in the modules associated with the presence of mHTT in this cell type as well (Figures S2E–S2H). Taken together, our analyses suggest that a combination of non-cell type-specific (e.g., synaptic and circadian clock gene dysregulation, seen in all three cell types profiled; DNA mismatch repair gene upregulation and BDNF receptor Ntrk2 downregulation, seen in both dSPNs and iSPNs) and cell type-specific (OXPHOS pathway downregulation, seen in iSPNs) responses may lead to the enhanced vulnerability of iSPNs in response to mHTT. If transcriptional changes, such as synaptic, circadian, and OXPHOS gene downregulation, are indeed leading to SPNs vulnerability in HD, knowledge of their upstream, “master regulators” may point to new therapeutic targets. In order to identify potential regulators of the TRAP-identified gene expression changes, we performed a chromatin enrichment analysis (ChEA) (Lachmann et al., 2010Lachmann A. Xu H. Krishnan J. Berger S.I. Mazloom A.R. Ma’ayan A. ChEA: transcription factor regulation inferred from integrating genome-wide ChIP-X experiments.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) of the SPN and CStrPN dysregulated gene sets in the R6/2 model. Predicted regulators of dSPN and iSPN upregulated genes included Crem, Creb1, and Kdm5b, and Vdr and Foxo3 were also among the predicted regulators of dSPN-only upregulated genes and Wt1 was among the predicted regulators of iSPN-only upregulated genes (Figure S3A; Table S1). Wt1 and retinoic acid receptor beta (Rarb) (whose own expression was downregulated in both dSPNs and iSPNs; Figure 2D) were among the top predicted regulators of the downregulated genes in both SPN cell types (Figure S3A; Table S1), as were components or regulators of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex Suz12, Mtf2, and Ezh2. All of these factors were also the top-predicted regulators of genes downregulated in CStrPNs (Figure S3A; Table S1). Comparison of published striatal Rarb protein chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (Niewiadomska-Cimicka et al., 2017Niewiadomska-Cimicka A. Krzyżosiak A. Ye T. Podleśny-Drabiniok A. Dembélé D. Dollé P. Krężel W.

Neurobiol. 2017; 54: 3859-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) confirmed that the Rarb protein directly targets a large number of genes dysregulated in both dSPNs and iSPNs by mHTT in the R6/2 model (Figure S3B). In order to expand these data obtained in the transgenic mHTT exon 1 R6/2 model to full-length Htt models of HD, we examined an early time point of disease progression in a series of models possessing alleles of mHTT with a range of knockin CAG expansions. For this purpose, we conducted TRAP studies in human HTT exon 1 knockin HdhQ20, HdhQ50, HdhQ111, and HdhQ170 Htt lines (Wheeler et al., 1999Wheeler V.C. Auerbach W. White J.K. Srinidhi J. Auerbach A.

In rodent forebrain, oligodendrocytes arise from the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in temporally distinct waves from the ganglionic eminences (GE) and the cortical ventricular zone (VZ) (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N.

Humans additionally develop an enlarged cortical germinal zone called the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) (Smart et al., 2002Smart I.H. Dehay C. Giroud P. Berland M. Kennedy H.

Here, we investigate the trajectory of human cortical OPC production. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with functional studies, we identify a type of gliogenic intermediate progenitor cell (IPC) (EGFR+ Pre-OPC) with diminutive mitotic somal translocation (MST) behavior. We also find that oRG cells provide an extra source of OPC production in the human cortex. Furthermore, we observe high levels of OPC proliferation and describe a repulsive behavior between OPC daughter cells mediated by the OPC-enriched gene PCDH15. The latter serves to avoid local OPC accumulation and facilitate OPC proliferation. These findings highlight an oligodendrocyte lineage in the human brain with enhanced precursor proliferation and a mechanism for cell dispersion, deepening our understanding of human oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion. In order to study the diversity and developmental trajectories of human OPCs, we first consulted a single-cell transcriptomic atlas generated from 48 individuals in the late first and second trimester of gestation (Figures 1A and 1B ) that comprise neural progenitor cells (NPCs), IPCs, neurons, macroglia, microglia, and endothelial cells (Nowakowski et al., 2017Nowakowski T.J.

Velmeshev D. et al.Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex.Science. 2017; 358: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, we found that only 40 of the 4,261 unbiased captured cells were OPCs that expressed PDGFRA (Figure 1B), possibly due to low abundance and high fragility. While fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of labeled transgenic mouse OPCs (e.g., PDGFRA-H2B-GFP) has been used for scRNA-seq (Marques et al., 2016Marques S. Zeisel A. Codeluppi S. van Bruggen D. Mendanha Falcão A. Xiao L. Li H. Häring M. Hochgerner H.

Cell. 2018; 46: 504-517.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we purified human embryonic OPCs by immunopanning (Dugas and Emery, 2013Dugas J.C. Emery B.

Protoc. 2013; 2013: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; Barres, 2014Barres B.A. Designing and troubleshooting immunopanning protocols for purifying neural cells.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2014; 2014: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Cortical cells were dissociated from nine brain samples at GW20–GW24, and cells expressing PDGFRA were collected using PDGFRA-antibody-coated Petri dishes. Immunostaining showed that most purified cells were PDGFRA+NKX2-2+ and scRNA-seq confirmed PDGFRA mRNA expression (Figure 1C). When we combined these PDGFRA-immunopanned cells with our previous 4,261 unbiased captured cells and clustered them by principal-component analysis (PCA) and Louvain-Jaccard clustering, a total of 980 high-quality cells were characterized as OPCs (Figure 1D). Differential gene expression analysis showed that these cells expressed conventional OPC genes OLIG1, OLIG2, PDGFRA, NKX2-2, SOX10, S100B, and APOD (Figure 1E). Conversely, they did not express the neuronal lineage genes EOMES, PPP1R17, NEUROD2, or NEUROD6, and separated from clusters of IPCs, excitatory neurons (EN), and interneurons (INs) (Figure 1F). The OPCs clustered into four groups (clusters 14, 2, 20, and 11). Metadata annotation showed that cortical OPCs acquired by unbiased-capture were comparable to OPCs enriched by PDGFRA immunopanning, and major groups were composed of cells from multiple individuals (Figure 2A), indicating minimal technical and/or batch artifacts. Cluster 20 included the largest number of PDGFRA-immunopanned cells (Figure 2A), and cluster 2 was similar, suggesting these two clusters might reflect OPCs at different maturation states. In contrast, cluster 11 expressed cell-cycling genes MKI67, ASPM, TOP2A, and CDK1, suggesting that these OPCs were actively dividing (Figure 2B). Metadata analysis showed that cluster 14 was mainly composed of cells micro-dissected from the cortical germinal zone (Cortex-VZ/SVZ) (Figure 2A). Cluster 14 expressed low levels of NPC genes, including GFAP, VIM, NES, HES1, NOTCH2, and EGFR, as well as oligodendrocyte lineage genes OLIG1, OLIG2, and PDGFRA; the later stage OPC genes NKX2-2, SOX10, and APOD were not expressed (Figure 2B). Similarity analysis indicated that cluster 14 was closely related to both NPCs and OPCs (Figure 2C), suggesting a transitional “Pre-OPC” stage from multi-potent NPCs to lineage committed OPCs. This was supported by a trajectory reconstruction based upon our scRNA-seq dataset using monocle (Trapnell et al., 2014Trapnell C. Cacchiarelli D. Grimsby J. Pokharel P. Li S. Morse M. Lennon N.J. Livak K.J. Mikkelsen T.S. Rinn J.L. The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat.

Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) (Figures 2D and 2E). According to the pseudo-lineage tree, VIM-expressing NPCs could generate Pre-OPCs or EOMES-expressing IPCs that further differentiate into NEUROD6-expressing neurons. Feature plots showed NPC genes like VIM and GFAP were downregulated upon lineage commitment, while OPC genes like PDGFRA and APOD were upregulated. Together, our scRNA-seq analysis suggested a local intermediate progenitor source of Pre-OPCs supporting OPC generation in the developing human cortex. While prior scRNA-seq analysis has indicated that mouse oligodendrocytes progress through various stages of differentiation (Marques et al., 2016Marques S. Zeisel A. Codeluppi S. van Bruggen D. Mendanha Falcão A. Xiao L. Li H. Häring M. Hochgerner H. Romanov R.A. et al.Oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the mouse juvenile and adult central nervous system.Science. 2016; 352: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and Marques et al., 2018Marques S. van Bruggen D.

Cell. 2018; 46: 504-517.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the progenitor types that generate OPCs prior to lineage commitment remain unclear. We first used immunohistochemistry to characterize OPCs in fixed human cortical sections and found that PDGFRA+OLIG2+ OPCs were present in low numbers across all cortical laminae and were distributed radially from the VZ to the cortical plate (CP) during middle to late stages of neurogenesis (GW16 and GW18). The number of OPCs increased dramatically after GW20 and continued to increase at GW24, the latest age we studied (Figures S1A and S1B). We next evaluated cluster 14 Pre-OPCs by co-staining OPC and NPC markers in GW20–24 tissue. While most PDGFRA+OLIG2+ OPCs did not express NPC markers, >10% of OPCs expressing low levels of PDGFRA and OLIG2 co-expressed NPC markers NES, GFAP, VIM, and EGFR, confirming an NPC signature (Figure 3A). EGFR+PDGFRA+ cells also expressed OPC markers OLIG1 and NG2 and had bipolar morphology typical of OPCs (Figure 3A). Distribution analysis showed that most EGFR+PDGFRA+OLIG2+ cells were located in the OSVZ, though some were also present in the inner subventricular zone (ISVZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) (Figure S1C). Considering their NPC and OPC marker co-expression, immature bipolar morphology, and germinal zone location, we reasoned that these cells represent a transitional stage from NPCs to OPCs, consistent with our scRNA-seq data (Figure 2). In normal development, EGFR signaling regulates oligodendrogenesis and myelination in both juvenile and adult mice (Aguirre et al., 2007Aguirre A. Dupree J.L. Mangin J.M. Gallo V. A functional role for EGFR signaling in myelination and remyelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Differential gene analysis based on scRNA-seq showed that EGFR was enriched in cluster 14 and expressed in a subpopulation of NPCs (Figures 2B and 2E). At the onset of gliogenesis (GW20–24), we found a large population of EGFR+OLIG2+ cells in cortical germinal zones. These cells were present at low abundance at GW16–18 but increased dramatically between GW20 and 24 (Figure S1D), coinciding with OPC generation (Figure S1B). They were highly proliferative, with 50% expressing KI67, and were mainly located in the OSVZ (Figure S1D). We did not observe KI67 expression in cluster 14 in our scRNA-seq data (Figure 2B) because the abundance of cell-cycling genes drove the proliferative EGFR+OLIG2+ cells into cluster 11, which included both proliferative Pre-OPCs (EGFR+) and dividing OPCs (EGFR–). Unlike oRGs that exhibit a long radial process, EGFR-expressing cells were found randomly oriented in the germinal zone, being vertical, oblique, or even horizontal to the ventricular surface. Most EGFR+OLIG2+ cells did not express pS6 (Figure 3B), an oRG marker and a canonical readout of activated mTOR signaling (Nowakowski et al., 2017Nowakowski T.J. Bhaduri A. Pollen A.A. Alvarado B. Mostajo-Radji M.A. Di Lullo E. Haeussler M. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Liu S.J. Velmeshev D. et al.Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex.Science. 2017; 358: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Conversely, most TNC+SOX2+ oRGs in the OSVZ did not express EGFR (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). These results suggest that EGFR labels a population of progenitor cells in the OSVZ distinct from oRGs. Moreover, EGFR+OLIG2+ cells were EOMES– and PPP1R17–, suggesting a lineage separation between oligodendrocytes and neurons (Figure 3B). Together these findings indicate that EGFR expression marks a pre-OPC in the human OSVZ. We next tested whether the EGFR-expressing progenitors of human OSVZ could generate OPCs. Cells were dissociated from micro-dissected OSVZ at GW20–24. OPCs were depleted by two sequential rounds of PDGFRA and O4 immunopanning to ensure that any OPCs detected arose from precursor cells and not by OPC self-renewal (Figure 3C). Cells were further purified through positive selection by EGFR immunopanning. Such EGFR-expressing non-OPC cells were cultured in EGF-containing medium for 2 days and then in PDGF-containing medium for 5 days. Preps were fixed at 2 days in vitro (DIV2) or 7 days in vitro (DIV7). At DIV2, 90%–96% of the cells were EGFR+ and 23% were OLIG2+, but none were NG2+, PDGFRA+, or NKX2-2+, consistent with OPC depletion (Figure 3C). In contrast, by DIV7, the percentage of EGFR+ cells was 40%–48%, while the percentage of OLIG2+, PDGFRA+, NG2+, and NKX2-2+ cells had increased to 35%, 35%, 36%, and 28%, respectively (Figure 3C). Reduction of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells accompanied the generation of OPCs, providing evidence that EGFR+ progenitors in the human OSVZ have the ability to produce OPCs. We reasoned that if the EGFR-expressing cells were progenitors of OPCs, then manipulation of the EGFR signaling pathway might affect EGFR-expressing cell proliferation and ultimately change OPC production. To test this possibility, we cultured human brain slices at GW20–24 and treated adjacent slices with EGF, or with the EGFR inhibitors, Iressa, AG1478, or PD153035. Slices were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 12 hr before fixation at DIV7. In comparison with DMSO-treated control slices, EGF treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the numbers of both OLIG2+KI67+ and NKX2-2+BrdU+ cells; conversely, both populations were reduced significantly by EGFR inhibitor treatment (Figure 3D). This result combined with the differentiation assay supports the concept of local generation of OPCs from EGFR-expressing progenitors in late second trimester human cortex. Neurogenic oRGs are a subtype of radial glia found in the primate OSVZ that are rare in rodents and are thought to contribute to gray matter expansion (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H.

OSVZ progenitors of human and ferret neocortex are epithelial-like and expand by integrin signaling.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying white matter expansion remain unknown, and whether oRGs are involved in human gliogenesis has not been fully demonstrated. The findings above show that, while VZ contains few PDGFRA+OLIG2+ cells, both PDGFRA+OLIG2+KI67+ OPCs and EGFR+OLIG2+KI67+ Pre-OPCs are mainly located in the OSVZ (Figures S1B and S1D). Through differential gene expression analysis of scRNA-seq data of human OPCs, we found that the Pre-OPC cluster also expressed the oRG genes PTPRZ1, TNC, MOXD1, HOPX, and FAM107A (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B), suggesting that oRGs might generate Pre-OPCs. Immunohistochemistry of fixed cortical sections between GW20 and GW24 showed that fewer than 2% of PDGFRA+OLIG2+ cells co-expressed the oRG markers, HOPX, PTPRZ1, TNC, and pS6 (Figure S2A). These cells were far less numerous than contemporaneous EGFR+PDGFRA+OLIG2+ cells. We already showed that most EGFR+OLIG2+ cells did not express the active mTOR readout and oRG marker pS6, and most TNC+Sox2+ oRGs also did not express EGFR (Figure 3B), but we found that about 10% of the PTPRZ1+SOX2+ oRGs in the OSVZ expressed EGFR, and nearly 20% of EGFR+OLIG2+ progenitors were co-labeled with the oRG marker HOPX (Figures S1E and S2B). This indicated that the expression time windows of different oRG markers might be slightly different from one another, and that some oRG progeny still retain oRG marker expression, enabling lineage tracing and trajectory reconstruction. Distribution analysis of cortical staining at GW22 revealed that the HOPX+EGFR+OLIG2+ cells were mainly located in the OSVZ (Figure S1E), suggesting that oRGs might be precursors of EGFR-expressing intermediate progenitors that produce OPCs. This concept is supported by our lineage trajectory reconstruction in which HOPX+TNC+ oRGs give rise to VIM+EGFR+ progenitors that further branch into EOMES+ neurogenic IPCs or OLIG2+ Pre-OPCs (Figures 2D and 2E). To directly test whether HOPX-expressing oRGs could generate OPCs, we micro-dissected OSVZ at GW20–24. Two sequential rounds of negative selection of (PDGFRA+O4) and EGFR immunopanning were performed in order to deplete both OPCs and Pre-OPCs in the cell suspension (Figure S2C). oRGs were further enriched through positive selection by LIFR immunopanning (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Nicholas C.R. Shuga J. Liu S.J. Oldham M.C. Diaz A. et al.Molecular identity of human outer radial glia during cortical development.Cell. 2015; 163: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and expanded in LIF-containing medium for 2 days followed by EGF- and PDGF-containing medium for another 8 days. As shown (Figure S2C), at DIV2 around 90% of the cells expressed SOX2, and of these >90% co-expressed GFAP+HOPX+, indicating oRG identity (Figure S2C). In contrast, at DIV10, the percentage of SOX2+ cells decreased to 82%, and the percentage of GFAP+HOPX+ co-expression decreased to 50%. Meanwhile, the percentage of EGFR+ cells increased to 44%, and the percentage of PDGFRA+OLIG2+ cells increased to 17% (Figure S2C). These findings suggested LIFR-antibody-enriched oRGs are able to produce OPCs. The observation that nearly all the PDGFRA+OLIG2+ OPCs generated at DIV10 also expressed EGFR indicates that oRGs generate OPCs through EGFR-expressing Pre-OPCs, consistent with the lineage reconstruction based on scRNA-seq analysis (Figures 2D and 2E). This differentiation assay combined with scRNA-seq and immunohistochemistry data indicate that a population of late second trimester oRGs act as neural progenitors for oligodendrogenesis. Our results suggest that besides originating from ventricular radial glia (vRG) present in both rodent and primate brain, the large abundance of oRGs in the developing human brain provides an extra source of OPC production not found in rodents, that could enhance oligodendrocyte generation and boost myelination to match demands arising from increased neurogenesis in the human brain. We next studied the proliferative behavior of Pre-OPCs compared to oRGs and OPCs by time-lapse imaging. Due to the diversity of progenitors in the germinal zones at late second trimester and the lack of genetic tools to specifically label OPCs, EGFR-expressing IPCs, or oRGs, we dissociated cortical cells from OSVZ at GW20–24 and performed immunopanning to selectively enrich specific progenitor populations through sequential positive selection with PDGFRA, EGFR, and LIFR antibodies (Figure 4A). We labeled the enriched progenitor types with CMV-GFP adenovirus, transplanted the virus-labeled progenitors back into OSVZ of adjacent slices, and cultured the brain slices without growth factors (Figure 4B). To validate the identity of enriched cells, we performed 10X scRNA-seq of the immunopanned cells prior to virus infection and transplantation (Figure S3A). Most LIFR-panned cells expressed LIFR, and the major clusters showed enrichment for GFAP, PAX6, HOPX, and PTPRZ1, indicating oRG identity; the remaining non-oRG clusters were astrocytes, LIFR-expressing microglia, or newborn neurons (Figure S3A and S3B). Similarly, most EGFR-panned cells expressed EGFR and were enriched for NES, SOX2, and VIM, consistent with immunostaining in fixed brain slices and indicating progenitor identity (Figures S3A and S3B). Most PDGFRA-panned cells expressed PDGFRA, and the major clusters were also enriched for OLIG1, OLIG2, NKX2-2, and SOX10, reflecting OPC identity (Figures S3A and S3B). Video frames were captured every 35 min for 72 hr (DIV3–6) and GFP-labeled progenitors were observed to migrate on cultured brain slices and divide. Interestingly, most LIFR-panned cells acquired a long radial fiber after transplantation, characteristic of radial glia (Figure S3C). The remaining non-radial cells might represent off-target cells or progeny generated by oRGs during the 3 days required for cell recovery and virus expression. Both EGFR- and PDGFRA-panned cells exhibited bipolar morphology but did not show any orientation preference (Figure S3C). Radial cells enriched by LIFR-panning exhibited MST (Figure 4C; Video S1), a “jump-and-divide” behavior of oRGs (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Parker P.R. Kriegstein A.R.

https://openalex.org/W3043725759,"<h2>Summary</h2> Spatial maps in the brain are most accurate when they are linked to external sensory cues. Here, we show that the compass in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain is linked to the direction of the wind. Shifting the wind rightward rotates the compass as if the fly were turning leftward, and vice versa. We describe the mechanisms of several computations that integrate wind information into the compass. First, an intensity-invariant representation of wind direction is computed by comparing left-right mechanosensory signals. Then, signals are reformatted to reduce the coding biases inherent in peripheral mechanics, and wind cues are brought into the same circular coordinate system that represents visual cues and self-motion signals. Because the compass incorporates both mechanosensory and visual cues, it should enable navigation under conditions where no single cue is consistently reliable. These results show how local sensory signals can be transformed into a global, multimodal, abstract representation of space."

https://openalex.org/W3043183799,"Piloerection (goosebumps) requires concerted actions of the hair follicle, the arrector pili muscle (APM), and the sympathetic nerve, providing a model to study interactions across epithelium, mesenchyme, and nerves. Here, we show that APMs and sympathetic nerves form a dual-component niche to modulate hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activity. Sympathetic nerves form synapse-like structures with HFSCs and regulate HFSCs through norepinephrine, whereas APMs maintain sympathetic innervation to HFSCs. Without norepinephrine signaling, HFSCs enter deep quiescence by down-regulating the cell cycle and metabolism while up-regulating quiescence regulators Foxp1 and Fgf18. During development, HFSC progeny secretes Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to direct the formation of this APM-sympathetic nerve niche, which in turn controls hair follicle regeneration in adults. Our results reveal a reciprocal interdependence between a regenerative tissue and its niche at different stages and demonstrate sympathetic nerves can modulate stem cells through synapse-like connections and neurotransmitters to couple tissue production with demands."
https://openalex.org/W3043042851,"Disrupting memories that associate environmental cues with drug experiences holds promise for treating addiction, yet accessing the distributed neural network that stores such memories is challenging. Here, we show that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) orchestrates the acquisition and maintenance of opiate-associated memories via projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). PVT→CeA activity associates morphine reward to the environment, whereas transient inhibition of the PVT→NAc pathway during retrieval causes enduring protection against opiate-primed relapse. Using brain-wide activity mapping, we revealed distributed network activities that are altered in non-relapsing mice, which enabled us to find that activating the downstream NAc→lateral hypothalamus (LH) pathway also prevents relapse. These findings establish the PVT as a key node in the opiate-associated memory network and demonstrate the potential of targeting the PVT→NAc→LH pathway for treating opioid addiction."
https://openalex.org/W3043143951,"Chronic constipation (CC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Its pathogenesis, however, remains largely unclear. The purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the role of contractility and microbiota in the etiology of CC. To this end, we studied spontaneous and evoked contractile activity of descending colon segments from patients that have undergone surgery for refractory forms of CC. The juxta-mucosal microbiota of these colon samples were characterized with culture-based and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. In patients with CC the spontaneous colonic motility remained unchanged compared to the control group without dysfunction of intestinal motility. Moreover, contractions induced by potassium chloride and carbachol were increased in both circular and longitudinal colonic muscle strips, thus indicating preservation of contractile apparatus and increased sensitivity to cholinergic nerve stimulation in the constipated intestine. In the test group, the gut microbiota composition was assessed as being typically human, with four dominant bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, as well as usual representation of the most prevalent gut bacterial genera. Yet, significant inter-individual differences were revealed. The phylogenetic diversity of gut microbiota was not affected by age, sex, or colonic anatomy (dolichocolon, megacolon). The abundance of butyrate-producing genera Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium was low, whereas conventional probiotic genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria were not decreased in the gut microbiomes of the constipated patients. As evidenced by our study, specific microbial biomarkers for constipation state are absent. The results point to a probable role played by the overall gut microbiota at the functional level. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive characterization of CC pathogenesis, finding lack of disruption of motor activity of colonic smooth muscle cells and insufficiency of particular members of gut microbiota usually implicated in CC."
https://openalex.org/W3042329961,"To develop and validate a machine-learning algorithm to improve prediction of incident OUD diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries with ≥1 opioid prescriptions.This prognostic study included 361,527 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, without cancer, filling ≥1 opioid prescriptions from 2011-2016. We randomly divided beneficiaries into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 269 potential predictors including socio-demographics, health status, patterns of opioid use, and provider-level and regional-level factors in 3-month periods, starting from three months before initiating opioids until development of OUD, loss of follow-up or end of 2016. The primary outcome was a recorded OUD diagnosis or initiating methadone or buprenorphine for OUD as proxy of incident OUD. We applied elastic net, random forests, gradient boosting machine, and deep neural network to predict OUD in the subsequent three months. We assessed prediction performance using C-statistics and other metrics (e.g., number needed to evaluate to identify an individual with OUD [NNE]). Beneficiaries were stratified into subgroups by risk-score decile.The training (n = 120,474), testing (n = 120,556), and validation (n = 120,497) samples had similar characteristics (age ≥65 years = 81.1%; female = 61.3%; white = 83.5%; with disability eligibility = 25.5%; 1.5% had incident OUD). In the validation sample, the four approaches had similar prediction performances (C-statistic ranged from 0.874 to 0.882); elastic net required the fewest predictors (n = 48). Using the elastic net algorithm, individuals in the top decile of risk (15.8% [n = 19,047] of validation cohort) had a positive predictive value of 0.96%, negative predictive value of 99.7%, and NNE of 104. Nearly 70% of individuals with incident OUD were in the top two deciles (n = 37,078), having highest incident OUD (36 to 301 per 10,000 beneficiaries). Individuals in the bottom eight deciles (n = 83,419) had minimal incident OUD (3 to 28 per 10,000).Machine-learning algorithms improve risk prediction and risk stratification of incident OUD in Medicare beneficiaries."
https://openalex.org/W3043081018,"Introduction Reliable Health Management and Information System (HMIS) data can be used with minimal cost to identify areas for improvement and to measure impact of healthcare delivery. However, variable HMIS data quality in low- and middle-income countries limits its value in monitoring, evaluation and research. We aimed to review the quality of Rwandan HMIS data for maternal and newborn health (MNH) based on consistency of HMIS reports with facility source documents. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 76 health facilities (HFs) in four Rwandan districts. For 14 MNH data elements, we compared HMIS data to facility register data recounted by study staff for a three-month period in 2017. A HF was excluded from a specific comparison if the service was not offered, source documents were unavailable or at least one HMIS report was missing for the study period. World Health Organization guidelines on HMIS data verification were used: a verification factor (VF) was defined as the ratio of register over HMIS data. A VF 1.10 indicated over- and under-reporting in HMIS, respectively. Results High proportions of HFs achieved acceptable VFs for data on the number of deliveries (98.7%;75/76), antenatal care (ANC1) new registrants (95.7%;66/69), live births (94.7%;72/76), and newborns who received first postnatal care within 24 hours (81.5%;53/65). This was slightly lower for the number of women who received iron/folic acid (78.3%;47/60) and tested for syphilis in ANC1 (67.6%;45/68) and was the lowest for the number of women with ANC1 standard visit (25.0%;17/68) and fourth standard visit (ANC4) (17.4%;12/69). The majority of HFs over-reported on ANC4 (76.8%;53/69) and ANC1 (64.7%;44/68) standard visits. Conclusion There was variable HMIS data quality by data element, with some indicators with high quality and also consistency in reporting trends across districts. Over-reporting was observed for ANC-related data requiring more complex calculations, i.e., knowledge of gestational age, scheduling to determine ANC standard visits, as well as quality indicators in ANC. Ongoing data quality assessments and training to address gaps could help improve HMIS data quality."
https://openalex.org/W3043642586,"This study establishes a model of prefabricated building project risk management system based on the Modified Teaching-Learning-Based-Optimization (MTLBO) algorithm and a prediction model of deep learning multilayer feedforward neural network (Backpropagation, BP neural network) to improve the requirements of risk management during the construction of large prefabricated building projects. First, we introduced the BP neural network algorithm based on deep learning. Second, the traditional Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm was modified by using information entropy, and the modified algorithm was simulated and tested in five test functions. Then, based on the BP neural network and MTLBO algorithm, we established the MTLBO-BP neural network prediction model and tested its performance. Finally, based on the MTLBO-BP neural network prediction model, MATLAB software was used to establish an intelligent model of the risk management system during the construction of prefabricated building projects, and the example verification was performed. In addition, the MTLBO algorithm was verified by test function simulation and established that global searchability is stronger than the TLBO algorithm. Of note, it is not easy to fall into a local optimum. The test results of the MTLBO-BP neural network prediction model revealed that the prediction model converges faster and exerts a better prediction effect. The example verification of the intelligent model of the risk management system during the construction of prefabricated building projects established in this study revealed that the algorithm proposed is more accurate in the reliability and cost prediction of the risk management of prefabricated building projects. Moreover, the algorithm proposed provides theoretical support for intelligent management and decision-making of prefabricated building projects. Overall, this study validates that this algorithm is essential for construction project management, decision-making, and quality assurance."
https://openalex.org/W3045036531,"Previously, selenoprotein T (SelT) expression was shown to be induced in nervous, endocrine, and metabolic tissues during ontogenetic and regenerative processes. However, whether SelT plays a critical role in renal diseases remains unclear. Here, we explored the role of SelT in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Results revealed that SelT was highly expressed in renal tubules, but its expression was significantly reduced in cisplatin-induced AKI. Importantly, knocking down of SelT expression in kidney cells in vitro resulted in cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, as indicated by the elevation of cleaved-PARP and Bax expression, Caspase-3 activity, and number of TUNEL-positive cells. Moreover, SelT silencing-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, accompanied by a decrease in intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity and increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Notably, the protein and mRNA levels of Nox4 were increased in response to SelT downregulation. Furthermore, suppression of Nox4 expression by GKT137831 partially alleviated SelT knockdown-induced ROS generation and cell apoptosis in cisplatin-treated kidney cells. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that SelT protects against cisplatin-induced AKI by suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3043532150,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects around 33 million people worldwide, which makes it the most prominent form of dementia. The main focus of AD research has been on the central nervous system (CNS) for long, but in recent years, the gut gained more attention. The intestinal tract is innervated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), built of numerous different types of neurons showing great similarity to neurons of the CNS. It already has been demonstrated that the amyloid precursor protein, which plays a major role in AD pathology, is also expressed in these cells. We analyzed gut tissue of AD model mice (5xFAD) and the respective wild-type littermates at different pathological stages: pre-pathological, early pathological and late pathological. Our results show significant difference in function of the intestine of 5xFAD mice as compared to wild-type mice. Using a pathway array detecting 84 AD-related gene products, we found ApoA1 expression significantly altered in colon tissue of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, we unveil ApoA1's beneficial impact on cell viability and calcium homeostasis of cultured enteric neurons of 5xFAD animals. With this study, we demonstrate that the intestine is altered in AD-like pathology and that ApoA1 might be one key player within the gut."
https://openalex.org/W3042897651,"Patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have difficulty controlling their alcohol cravings and thus exhibit increased use and early relapse. Although patients tend to respond more strongly to alcohol-related images than to non-alcohol-related images, few researchers have examined the factors that modulate cravings. Here, we examined whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to behavioural cues in individuals with AUD and in healthy controls (HCs). The participants included 24 patients with AUD and 15 HCs. We presented visual cues consisting of four beverage-related images (juice, drinking juice, sake, and drinking sake), and the cue reactivity of AUD participants was contrasted with that of HC participants. Multiple comparisons revealed that the AUD group had lower BOLD responses than the HC group in the left precuneus (p = 0.036) and the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p = 0.044) to images of drinking juice and higher BOLD responses than the HC group in the left PCC (p = 0.044) to images of drinking sake. Furthermore, compared to the HCs, the AUD patients had decreased BOLD responses associated with cue reactivity to drinking juice in the left precuneus during the periods from 15 to 18 s (p = 0.004, df = 37) and 18 to 21 s (p = 0.002, df = 37). Our findings suggest that HCs and AUD patients differ in their responses not to images of alcoholic beverages but to images related to alcohol-drinking behaviour. Thus, these patients appear to have different patterns of brain activity. This information may aid clinicians in developing treatments for patients with AUD."
https://openalex.org/W3043457847,"We recently found that adolescent cocaine exposure (ACE) resulted in an enhancement of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) of adult mice. Here, we aim to further investigate the role of GABAergic transmission, especially parvalbumin (PV) interneurons within PrL in the development of ACE-induced anxiety-like behavior, and to assess whether and how electro-acupuncture (EA) therapeutically manage the ACE-induced abnormal behaviors in adulthood. ACE mice exhibited the enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in their adulthood, accompanied by increased GABAergic transmission and PV interneurons in PrL. Chemogenetic blocking PV interneurons in PrL alleviated ACE-enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Importantly, 37-day EA treatments (mixture of 2 Hz/100 Hz, 1 mA, 30 minutes once a day) at the acupoints of Yintang (GV29) and Baihui (GV20) also alleviated ACE-induced anxiety-like behaviors, and rescued ACE-impaired GABAergic neurotransmitter system and PV interneurons in PrL. In parallel, EA treatments further suppressed the activities of pyramidal neurons in PrL, suggesting that EA treatments seem to perform it beneficial effects on the ACE-induced abnormal emotional behaviors by calming down the whole PrL. Collectively, these findings revealed that hyper-function of GABAergic transmission, especially mediating by PV interneurons in PrL may be key etiology underlying ACE-induced anxiety-like behaviors. At least by normalizing the function of GABAergic and PV interneurons, EA may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for managing adolescent substance use-related emotional disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3042738805,"Abstract Localized prostate cancer develops very slowly in most men, with the androgen receptor (AR) and MYC transcription factors amongst the most well-characterized drivers of prostate tumorigenesis. Canonically, MYC up-regulation in luminal prostate cancer cells functions to oppose the terminally differentiating effects of AR. However, the effects of MYC up-regulation are pleiotropic and inconsistent with a poorly proliferative phenotype. Here we show that increased MYC expression and activity are associated with the down-regulation of MEIS1 , a HOX-family transcription factor. Using RNA-seq to profile a series of human prostate cancer specimens laser capture microdissected on the basis of MYC immunohistochemistry, MYC activity, and MEIS1 expression were inversely correlated. Knockdown of MYC expression in prostate cancer cells increased the expression of MEIS1 and increased the occupancy of MYC at the MEIS1 locus. Finally, we show in laser capture microdissected human prostate cancer samples and the prostate TCGA cohort that MEIS1 expression is inversely proportional to AR activity as well as HOXB13 , a known interacting protein of both AR and MEIS1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevated MYC in a subset of primary prostate cancers functions in a negative role in regulating MEIS1 expression, and that this down-regulation may contribute to MYC-driven development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W3043658784,"In recent years, carbon dioxide emissions have been potentiated by several anthropogenic processes that culminate in climate change, which in turn directly threatens biodiversity and the resilience of natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests are among the most impacted biological realms. The Belém endemism center, which is one of the several endemism centers in Amazon, is located in the most affected area within the so-called “Deforestation Arc.” Moreover, this region harbors a high concentration of Amazonian endangered bird species, of which 56% of them are considered to be under the threat of extinction. In this work, we sought to evaluate the current and future impacts of both climate change and deforestation on the distribution of endemic birds in the Belém Area of Endemism (BEA). Thus, we generated species distribution models for the 16 endemic bird species considering the current and two future gas emission scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic). We also evaluated climate change impacts on these birds in three different dispersal contexts. Our results indicate that BAE, the endemic taxa will lose an average of 73% of suitable areas by 2050. At least six of these birds species will have less than 10% or no future suitable habitat in all emission scenarios. One of the main mechanisms used to mitigate the impacts of climate change on these species in the near future is to assess the current system of protected areas. It is necessary to ensure that these areas will continue being effective in conserving these species even under climate change. The “Gurupi Mosaic” and the “Rio-Capim” watershed are areas of great importance because they are considered climate refuges according to our study. Thus, conservation efforts should be directed to the maintenance and preservation of these two large remnants of vegetation in addition to creating ecological corridors between them."

A significant decrease in renal cGMP levels and cGK activity was observed in 0-copy mice and A71915- and Rp-treated 2-copy and 4-copy mice compared with controls. An increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 occurred in 0-copy and A71915-treated 2-copy and 4-copy mice, while Rp treatment caused minimal changes than controls. Pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6) and pro-fibrotic (TGF-β1) cytokines were significantly increased in plasma and kidneys of 0-copy and A71915-treated 2-copy mice, but to lesser extent in 4-copy mice. Progressive renal pathologies, including fibrosis, mesangial matrix expansion, and tubular hypertrophy were observed in 0-copy and A71915-treated 2-copy and 4-copy mice, but minimally occurred in Rp-treated mice compared with controls. These results indicate that Npr1 has pivotal roles in inhibiting renal fibrosis and hypertrophy and exerts protective effects involving cGMP/cGK axis by repressing CDK blockers p21Cip1 and p27Kip1."
https://openalex.org/W3019934562,"Cellular communication network factor 6 (CCN6) mutations are linked with Progressive Pseudo Rheumatoid Dysplasia (PPRD) a debilitating musculoskeletal disorder. The function of CCN6 and the mechanism of PPRD pathogenesis remain unclear. Accordingly, we focused on the functional characterization of CCN6 and CCN6 mutants. Using size exclusion chromatography and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis we demonstrated that CCN6 is present as a component of the mitochondrial respiratory complex in human chondrocyte lines. By means of siRNA-mediated transfection and electron microscopy we showed that moderate reduction in CCN6 expression decreases the RER- mitochondria inter-membrane distance. Parallel native PAGE, immunoblotting and Complex I activity assays furthermore revealed increase in both mitochondrial distribution of CCN6 and mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly/activity in CCN6 depleted cells. CCN6 mutants resembling those linked with PPRD, which were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology displayed low level of expression of mutant CCN6 protein and inhibited respiratory complex assembly/activity. Electron microscopy and MTT assay of the mutants revealed abnormal mitochondria and poor cell viability. Taken together, our results indicate that CCN6 regulates mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly/activity as part of the mitochondrial respiratory complex by controlling the proximity of RER with the mitochondria, and CCN6 mutations disrupt mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly/activity resulting in mitochondrial defects and poor cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W3042290646,"Dysregulation of histone demethylase Jumonji-C domain-containing protein 5 (JMJD5) has been identified as a great effect on tumorigenesis. Silibinin is a commonly used anti-hepatotoxic drug and exhibits anticancer effect in various cancers. However, the antitumor mechanism between silibinin and JMJD5 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. In this study, the clinical significance of JMJD5 on OSCC patients was assessed through tissue microarray. Furthermore, mice bearing patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs) and tongue cancer cell lines were treated with silibinin and evaluated for tumor growth and JMJD5 expression. High expression of JMJD5 in oral cancer was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.0241), cervical node metastasis (P = 0.0001) and clinical stage (P = 0.0002), was associated with worse survival rate compared with that of the total cohort (P = 0.0002). Collectively the data indicate that JMJD5 expression may be suitable for detection of unfavorable prognosis in OSCC patients, based in part on its apparent role as a marker of metastasis. In addition, silibinin inhibits cancer growth in vitro and in PDTX models. Furthermore, metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) could regulate the expression for JMJD5 and had a positive correlation with JMJD5. Moreover, silibinin could downregulate JMJD5 and MTA1 in oral cancer. Present study thus identifies that JMJD5 might be an essential prognostic indicator and therapeutic target against OSCC progression. In addition, silibinin is a potential candidate among novel chemotherapeutic agents or adjuvants for modulating JMJD5 in OSCC, through a mechanism likely involving MTA1/JMJD5 axis."

In the verification phase, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were verified in independent samples using DIA method. Four proteins including filamin A (FLNA), sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF and pentraxin domain containing 1 (SVEP1), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) were differentially expressed both in discovery and verification phase. To select the best combination of proteins for discriminating two groups, three-fold cross validation (CV) with repetition of one hundred times was performed. The multi-marker model with three biomarkers (SVEP1, LCAT, TGM2) had a high discriminatory power to distinguish between the two groups (the area under the receiver operating characteristic, AUROC = 0.946, p <0.001). Our results indicate that the expression of FLNA, SVEP1, LCAT, and TGM2 in mid-trimester amniotic fluid was increased in SLE patients with APO (Group 2). A large-scale prospective study is warranted to verify this finding."

Cilium growth is a highly regulated process that is assumed to be important for flow generation. Recently, Kif19a, a kinesin residing at the cilia tip, was identified to be essential for ciliary length control through its microtubule depolymerization function. However, there is a lack of information on the nature of proteins and the integrated signaling mechanism regulating growth of motile cilia. Here, we report that adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), a highly abundant AC isoform in airway epithelial cells, inhibits degradation of Kif19a by inhibiting autophagy, a cellular recycling mechanism for damaged proteins and organelles. Using epithelium-specific knockout mice of AC6, we demonstrated that AC6 knockout airway epithelial cells have longer cilia compared with the WT cells because of decreased Kif19a protein levels in the cilia. We demonstrated in vitro that AC6 inhibits AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), an important modulator of cellular energy-conserving mechanisms, and uncouples its binding with ciliary kinesin Kif19a. In the absence of AC6, activation of AMPK mobilizes Kif19a into autophagosomes for degradation in airway epithelial cells. Lower Kif19a levels upon pharmacological activation of AMPK in airway epithelial cells correlated with elongated cilia and vice versa. In all, the AC6–AMPK pathway, which is tunable to cellular cues, could potentially serve as one of the crucial ciliary growth checkpoints and could be channeled to develop therapeutic interventions for cilia-associated disorders.

A play on cilia beatingJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 42PreviewMotile cilia, hairlike structures present on the cell surface, have a well-appreciated role in human physiology, including sweeping mucus, dirt and debris out of the respiratory tract. However, we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms governing cilia growth, maintenance and function. In this issue, Arora et al. reveal new details about the control of cilia growth. They identify a previously unrecognized connection between adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), a cilia signaling mediator, and the autophagy-mediated regulation of motile cilia length via kinesin Kif19a, a regulator of cilia length. Full-Text PDF Open Access Motile cilia are numerously present moving structures that are crucial for flow generation in the airway epithelium, brain ventricle, oviducts, and middle ear. Defects in formation, maintenance, and function of motile cilia can result in ciliopathies that usually manifest as multisystem problems (1Fliegauf M. Benzing T. Omran H.

Ciliary length adjustment is an important parameter for control of cilia-generated fluid flow; however, the mechanisms that optimize this process remain less defined. It is argued that cilia length is crucial to precisely define cilia and mucus contact (∼10%) that affects ciliary forward and backward strokes (3Matsui H. Randell S.H. Peretti S.W. Davis C.W.

Stress caused by smoking, pathogen infection, and air-borne toxins depress mucociliary clearance, a process of airway cleansing that has been associated with altered cilia length (4Leopold P.L.

A kinesin 8 motor protein, Kif19a, was reported to be a key determinant of optimal ciliary length through its microtubule-depolymerizing activity at the ciliary tips (6Niwa S. Nakajima K. Miki H.

Consistently, loss of Kif19a leads to elongated cilia, improper cilia-generated flow, and ciliopathies in Kif19a−/− mice. Cilia are not merely microtubular structures but form highly specialized signaling compartments enriched with cellular messengers including cAMP and Ca2+ (7Moore B.S. Stepanchick A.N. Tewson P.H.

Adenylate cyclases 5 and 6 (AC5/6) are the major suppliers of cAMP in nonmotile cilia (7Moore B.S. Stepanchick A.N. Tewson P.H. Hartle C.M. Zhang J. Quinn A.M. Hughes T.E. Mirshahi T.

Primary cilium length is known to be sensitive to intracellular cAMP dependent upon AC5/6 activity (9Besschetnova T.Y. Kolpakova-Hart E. Guan Y. Zhou J. Olsen B.R. Shah J.V.

In the context of motile cilia, the role of cAMP is known to be as an important regulator of ciliary beating and organization of compartmental signaling (10Salathe M.

Whether ACs and cAMP regulate motile cilia growth and development has not been explored before. Also, the dynamic and reversible nature of motile cilia length remain unrecognized. More recently, the role of autophagy has been redefined to selectively clear primary cilia-associated proteins in autophagosomes fused with lysosomes that control ciliogenesis and ciliary growth (12Murrow L. Debnath J. Autophagy as a stress-response and quality-control mechanism: implications for cell injury and human disease.Annu. Rev.

This prompted our interest in investigating whether Kif19a is an autophagy substrate that may become relevant to motile cilia growth. Autophagy can become triggered by activation of AMPK, a heterotrimeric complex of a catalytic (α) and regulatory (β and γ) subunits, because it stimulates mechanisms to conserve energy and resources (14Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: ancient energy gauge provides clues to modern understanding of metabolism.Cell Metab. 2005; 1 (16054041): 15-2510.1016/j.cmet.2004.12.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar, 15Mihaylova M.M.

Active AMPK (Thr(P)172–AMPK) stimulates autophagy indirectly via negative regulation of mTORC1 kinase complex and can directly activate it through directly binding, phosphorylating, and activating autophagy-initiating kinase Ulk1 (16Kim J. Kundu M. Viollet B. Guan K.L. AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy through direct phosphorylation of Ulk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13 (21258367): 132-14110.1038/ncb2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A also negatively regulates autophagy by impeding AMPK–Thr172 activation through phosphorylation at Ser173 and hampering ULK1 activation (17Stephan J.S. Yeh Y.Y. Ramachandran V. Deminoff S.J. Herman P.K. The Tor and PKA signaling pathways independently target the Atg1/Atg13 protein kinase complex to control autophagy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we identified that AC6 activity inhibits AMPK activity and controls Kif19a protein levels via regulation of autophagy to alter motile cilia length and function, which can be mimicked by pharmacologically targeting of the AMPK pathway. Our study identified an important signaling pathway that can be directly targeted to alter motile cilia length of potential relevance to cilia-associated disorders. Based on RNA-sequencing data in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PHBECs) and mouse trachea, AC6 emerged as the predominant AC isoform (Fig. 1A). Using a sonic hedgehog cre (Shh cre) driver, we generated epithelial knockout of AC6 and confirmed reduced AC protein expression using AC5/6 antibody in isolated Adcy6f/f Shh Cre/+ (Adcy6Δ/Δ) mice tracheal epithelial cells (Fig. 1B). Considering a known role of cAMP in mucociliary clearance, we tested cilia-generated flow in Adcy6Δ/Δ mice and observed a 2.4-fold lower particle movement in Adcy6Δ/Δ compared with Adcy6Δ/Δ mice trachea (Fig. 1, C and D, and Movie S1). Based on this observation, we considered the possibility of cilia-associated defects in Adcy6Δ/Δ mice. Immunostaining data revealed apical enrichment of AC6 in the large airways (trachea) and localization not along the cilia but rather with the ciliary basal body marker γ-tubulin (Fig. 1, E and F). Based on our experimental determination, we hypothesized that defective ciliary movement in Adcy6Δ/Δ tracheal epithelial cells could be in part due to longer cilia compared with the control mice (30% longer; 3.9 ± 0.7 in Adcy6f/f versus 5.1 ± 0.7 in Adcy6Δ/Δ) (Fig. 1, G and H). We were able to recapitulate these findings using PHBECs. We measured the length of ciliary tuft and isolated cilia and observed an ∼50% increase in the cilia length upon lentiviral knockdown of AC6 expression using two separate shRNAs (Fig. 1, I and J). Based on these findings, we can conclude a prominent mucociliary clearance defect and elongated cilia upon loss of AC6 in the airway epithelium. Niwa et al. (6Niwa S. Nakajima K. Miki H. Minato Y. Wang D. Hirokawa N. KIF19A is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin for ciliary length control.Dev.

We observed that Kif19a was enriched at the ciliary tips and colocalized with ciliary tip marker EB1 but also expressed along the length of the cilium (Fig. 2A). We observed that lentiviral knockdown of Kif19a significantly increased ciliary length by >2-fold in PHBECs and mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) grown on the Transwells (Fig. 2, B–D). Therefore, we were able to confirm that Kif19a is a direct negative regulator of ciliary length as demonstrated previously (6Niwa S. Nakajima K. Miki H. Minato Y. Wang D. Hirokawa N. KIF19A is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin for ciliary length control.Dev.

Based on our earlier observation of longer cilia in Adcy6Δ/Δ tracheal cells, we proceeded to investigate whether Kif19a is a possible target of AC6 in controlling ciliary length. Interestingly, Kif19a protein levels were dramatically reduced in Adcy6Δ/Δ trachea compared with the control, which was not at the level of transcripts (Fig. 2, E and F and Fig. S1A). Consistent with the observations above, transient overexpression of AC6 increased His-S-Kif19a (isoform 2, ∼70 kDa) levels by 2-fold that did not concur with the possibility of reduced proteosomal degradation (Fig. 2, G and H, and Fig. S1B). Until this point, we can conclude that down-regulation of AC6 expression phenocopies loss of Kif19a.Figure 2AC6 KO mice airway cilia are deficient in ciliary kinesin Kif19a.

Given the recently established role of autophagy in ciliogenesis (10Salathe M. Regulation of mammalian ciliary beating.Annu. Rev.

Indeed, up-regulated AMPK signaling, for example, increased P-AMPK-α–Thr172 and down-regulation of P-mTOR were observed in Adcy6Δ/Δ isolated MTECs relative to the control (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, autophagy was up-regulated in Adcy6Δ/Δ tracheal cells as indicated by increased lipidation of LC3 (LC3-II), an autophagy marker (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, we tested the possibility that AMPK-mediated autophagy might regulate Kif19a expression in Adcy6Δ/Δ epithelial cells. First, we identified an interaction between Kif19a and the endogenous and overexpressed P-AMPK-α subunit (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. S2). Second, coexpression of recombinant AC6 compromised an interaction of Kif19a with AMPK-α (Fig. 3, C and D). Also, lowered P-AMPK-α and in the presence of AC6 overexpression suggested that AC6 impedes AMPK activation as corroborated by our findings in Fig. 3 (A and B). Importantly, we concluded that Kif19a preferentially interacts with the P-AMPK or active AMPK as Kif19a interaction with total AMPK followed an interaction pattern of P-AMPK (Fig. 3, C and D). Next, we investigated how modulation of AMPK activity may affect Kif19a protein levels. Treatment of cells with the inhibitor of AMPK activity, compound C enhanced while AMPK activator-AICAR decreased, Kif19a protein expression without altering the total levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a direct AMPK target (Fig. 3, E and I). To investigate whether Kif19a is cleared in the autophagosomes because of an increased autophagy in AC6 KO tracheal cells, we tested Kif19a protein levels in cells treated with pharmacological activators (Torin1) and inhibitors (chloroquine (CQ)) of autophagy and in cells deficient for autophagy (generated upon knockdown of ATG5 expression) (Fig. 3, E–I). The incubation of cells with Torin1 decreased Kif19a protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, and Kif19a protein expression was increased in cells treated with both CQ and ATG5 sh (Fig. 3, E–I). To test whether AMPK drives Kif19a recruitment into autophagosomes, we performed in vitro colocalization study between Kif19a and LC3 in MTECs. An extensive accumulation of Kif19a was observed in LC3-positive autophagosomes in Adcy6Δ/Δ MTECs that was marginal in Adcy6f/f MTECs (Fig. 3, J and K). Inhibition of AMPK activity stalled Kif19a localization into autophagosomes in Adcy6f/f and Adcy6Δ/Δ MTECs, whereas AMPK activation enhanced this process in Adcy6f/f MTECs (Fig. 3, J and K). In summary, AC6 down-regulates AMPK activation and prevents P-AMPK-Kif19a protein interaction, and AMPK activation drives Kif19a recruitment into autophagosomes for clearance. Next, we investigated how the above described mechanism might translate into ciliary length regulation. Ciliary length negatively correlated with the endogenous Kif19a expression (determined using immunofluorescence) in MTEC cilia (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of AMPK reversed longer cilia in Adcy6Δ/Δ MTECs that correlated with increased Kif19a expression (Fig. 4B). Treatment of tracheal cells with AICAR significantly increased the length of Adcy6f/f cilia correlating with decreased Kif19a expression (Fig. 4B). This effect of AICAR was blunted in Adcy6Δ/Δ cilia, suggesting that the activation of AMPK pathway in Adcy6Δ/Δ tracheal cells may already be saturated, and also, no apparent change in Kif19a expression was observed under these conditions (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that loss of Kif19a expression coincides with abnormal elongation of Adcy6Δ/Δ cilia. Also, the AC6 and AMPK pathways cooperatively act to regulate motile cilia length. The abnormally long cilia measured in Adcy6Δ/Δ ex vivo trachea correlated with poor cilia-generated flow (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Adcy6Δ/Δ tracheal samples with Comp. C (4 h) improved cilia-elicited bead velocity that correlated with shorter cilia length. Treatment of Adcy6f/f tracheal samples with AICAR (4 h) impaired cilia-generated flow correlating with longer cilia (Fig. 4C). Hence, there is a clear negative correlation between longer cilia height and impaired cilia-generated flow. Overall, these findings imply that the abnormal cilia-generated flow in Adcy6Δ/Δ airways can be at least explained by longer than normal cilia in these mice. Overall, we present a previously unidentified mechanism of dynamic regulation of motile cilia length (Fig. 4D). Previous study showed that there is a dose dependence of Kif19a to cilia length (6Niwa S. Nakajima K. Miki H. Minato Y. Wang D. Hirokawa N. KIF19A is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin for ciliary length control.Dev.

Because Kif19a is a plus-end-directed motor, plus-end being the growing distal end of cilia, Niwa et al. (6Niwa S. Nakajima K. Miki H. Minato Y. Wang D. Hirokawa N. KIF19A is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin for ciliary length control.Dev.

Based on the marked ciliary phenotype in Kif19a−/− mice as reported earlier, it is very unlikely that there is a redundancy to the role of Kif19a, and it seems to be conserved. This makes Kif19a a key determinant of the optimal length of motile cilia in mammals. It is suggested that Kif19a depolymerizes microtubules in a length-dependent manner that is important for the dynamic aspect of ciliary growth (18Varga V. Helenius J. Tanaka K. Hyman A.A. Tanaka T.U. Howard J. Yeast kinesin-8 depolymerizes microtubules in a length-dependent manner.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 (16906145): 957-96210.1038/ncb1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Autophagosomes carry highly selective protein cargos for degradation that becomes crucial to the homeostatic balance of the cell. Several of these cargos are recruited based on their interaction with the specific components of the autophagic machinery, and in this manner, autophagy can be a selective pathway. LC3-II, a specific autophagy marker, serves as the membrane receptor to select and recruit cargoes for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy has recently been shown to function in the growth of primary cilia (13Pampliega O. Orhon I. Patel B. Sridhar S. Díaz-Carretero A. Beau I. Codogno P. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cuervo A.M. Functional interaction between autophagy and ciliogenesis.Nature. 2013; 502 (24089209): 194-20010.1038/nature12639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). LC3 has been demonstrated to interact with a group of centriolar satellite proteins, including PCM1, CEP131, and OFD1 (19Tang Z. Lin M.G. Stowe T.R. Chen S. Zhu M. Stearns T. Franco B. Zhong Q. Autophagy promotes primary ciliogenesis by removing OFD1 from centriolar satellites.Nature. 2013; 502 (24089205): 254-25710.1038/nature12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). OFD1 is removed from centriolar satellites upon serum starvation at the initiation of ciliogenesis via autophagy. The relationship between ciliogenesis and autophagy could be more complex because autophagy also appears to limit ciliogenesis by eliminating Ift20, an essential component of ciliary transport (13Pampliega O. Orhon I. Patel B. Sridhar S. Díaz-Carretero A. Beau I. Codogno P. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cuervo A.M. Functional interaction between autophagy and ciliogenesis.Nature. 2013; 502 (24089209): 194-20010.1038/nature12639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These distinct roles of autophagy in ciliogenesis could be related to the type of ciliogenesis, i.e. basal versus induced (e.g. by starvation) (13Pampliega O. Orhon I. Patel B. Sridhar S. Díaz-Carretero A. Beau I. Codogno P. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cuervo A.M. Functional interaction between autophagy and ciliogenesis.Nature. 2013; 502 (24089209): 194-20010.1038/nature12639Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC6 regulates autophagy during autophagosome–lysosome fusion to mediate autophagy-mediated cilia disassembly via degradation of ciliary protein IFT88 (20Lam H.C. Cloonan S.M. Bhashyam A.R. Haspel J.A. Singh A. Sathirapongsasuti J.F. Cervo M. Yao H. Chung A.L. Mizumura K. An C.H. Shan B. Franks J.M. Haley K.J.

In this study, HDAC6 was shown to be a critical regulator of autophagy-mediated cilia shortening caused by cigarette smoke exposure and as a potential therapeutic target for COPD (20Lam H.C. Cloonan S.M. Bhashyam A.R. Haspel J.A. Singh A. Sathirapongsasuti J.F. Cervo M. Yao H. Chung A.L. Mizumura K. An C.H. Shan B. Franks J.M. Haley K.J.

Although testing the interaction of Kif19a with the core autophagy proteins is pending, we identified that Kif19a interacts with AMPK, an important upstream regulator of autophagy, suggesting it to be a selective pathway involving autophagy. Inhibition of AMPK perturbed Kif19a-LC3 localization; however, LC3-labeled autophagosomes were distributed in close proximity to Kif19a protein clusters. This suggests that autophagosomes closely guard and calibrate Kif19a levels to render ciliary length alteration very sensitive to cellular changes. The fact that longer cilia in Adcy6Δ/Δ airways beat slower could suggest that this is an energy-conserving mechanism employed by cells and made into effect by up-regulated AMPK–autophagy pathway. Our findings identified key molecular factors that cooperatively regulate Kif19a levels to mediate ciliary length control in mammals. This study provides an important piece of evidence to support inherent plasticity in motile cilia that may be crucial during key developmental events and in adult mammalian function. Adcy6 f/wt mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory following cryorecovery and were interbred to obtain Adcy6f/f mice. Adcy6f/f mice were then crossed with Shh GFP cre mice (B6.Cg-Shhtm1(EGFP/cre)Cjt/J, The Jackson Laboratory); following a series of intercrosses, Adcy6Δ/Δ mice (Adcy6f/f Shhtm1(EGFP/cre)/wt mice) were obtained. The male mice were used as Shh GFP cre donors. As a control to Adcy6Δ/Δ mice, littermate Adcy6f/f mice were used. Typically, 6–12-week-old male mice were used for the study. All the mice were maintained in a barrier facility at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and were fed normal chow. All procedures were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and were approved by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Antibodies in this study included AC5/6 (Santa Cruz), Kif19a (Proteintech), acetyl-tubulin (Sigma), γ-tubulin (Sigma), LC3 (Sigma), β-actin (Sigma), AMPK and mTOR sampler kit (Cell Signaling Technologies), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technologies), S-protein HRP (EMD Millipore), IFT88 (EMD Millipore), and ubiquitin (CST). AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), inhibitor compound C (Dorsomorphin), and Torin1 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Autophagy inhibitor chloroquine was obtained from MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA, USA). HEK 293 and 16 HBE14o− cells were obtained from ATCC. HEK 293 and 16 HBE14o− cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 and minimal essential medium, respectively, containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Kif19a cDNA isoform 2 was obtained from GE Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA) with a molecular mass coming close to 70 kDa (the molecular mass of the native form of Kif19a is 111 kDa) and inserted into pTriEx vector backbone. pTriEx Kif19a cDNA was transfected by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were studied after 48 h. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were obtained as differentiated on Transwells from two sources: the Cystic Fibrosis Center of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). Ready-to-transduce GIPZ lentiviral shRNA particles (mouse and human scrambled AC6 and Kif19a shRNA) were obtained from GE Dharmacon. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with the 5 × 105 transduction units viral particles for 48 h on the filters (added to the basolateral side) followed by 48 h of recovery and then again treated with 2.5 × 105 transduction units viral particles for 48 h before the experiment. At least two shRNAs were used for AC6 and Kif19a in human cells. For murine cells AC6 and Kif19a shRNAs were used singly or in a combination of two. A 50–60% knockdown efficiency was obtained using these shRNAs. PHBECs were generated from three donors from the two sources combined. Transduction controls comprised of either nonsilencing lentiviral particles or GAPDH shRNA. Protocol for isolation of tracheal cells was designed with slight modifications from a previously established method (21You Y. Richer E.J. Huang T. Brody S.L. Growth and differentiation of mouse tracheal epithelial cells: selection of a proliferative population.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Briefly, the trachea were collected in ice-cold Ham's F-12/pen–strep/1× fungizone, and connective, muscular, and vascular tissues were removed manually using forceps. The tracheal tube was opened longitudinally and washed twice in Ham's F-12. Tracheal tissue was incubated in Ham's F-12 with 0.15% Pronase at 4°C and kept upright. Glass-bottomed dishes (Maktek) or plastic culture plates were coated with 50 µg/ml type I rat tail collagen in 0.02 n acetic acid for 18 h at room temperature. The next day, the tissue was transferred into 10 ml of Falcon containing 10 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FBS, 1% pen–strep and pipetted up and down several times. Supernatant was collected and spun at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of Ham's F-12/pen–strep containing crude pancreatic DNase I 500 µg/ml, 0.1% BSA and incubated on ice for 5 min. Next, 10 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium is added and spun at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The pellet is resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM medium and kept for 3–4 h in 5% CO2 at 37°C to remove fibroblasts. Nonadherent cells were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in mouse tracheal epithelial cell culture medium ((Ham's F-12, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 5% FBS, 1 × fungizone (Stock 1000 ×), insulin (10 µg/ml), transferrin (5 µg/ml), mEGF (25 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (30 µg/ml), cholera toxin (0.1 µg/ml), and retinoic acid (0.5 nm)); the cells were counted and plated in 2D culture or on the costar Transwells. Cilia-generated flow measurement in the whole trachea was performed as described previously (22Francis R. Lo C. Ex vivo method for high resolution imaging of cilia motility in rodent airway epithelia.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 78 (23963287): 5034310.3791/50343Google Scholar). Briefly, whole trachea were excised from mice and bathed in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 10% FBS. Thin tracheal rings were cut under a M165FC stereomicroscope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted in 1-mm-spaced slice anchors (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA). The samples were placed under BX61WI fixed-stage motorized upright microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). FITC-conjugated beads (0.5 μm) were added to the samples. Bead flow was measured at 32 frames/s. Quantitation of bead velocity was performed as described earlier (22Francis R. Lo C. Ex vivo method for high resolution imaging of cilia motility in rodent airway epithelia.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 78 (23963287): 5034310.3791/50343Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transiently expressing His-S-Kif19a ± FLAG-AC6 were lysed in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 containing protease-inhibitor mixture (1 μm aprotonin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To immunoprecipitate His-S-Kif19a, S-protein–agarose was added to the whole cell lysate and mixed overnight at 4 °C. Proteins immobilized on beads were eluted using 5× sample buffer and subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting. Whole lung cells and MTECs were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (CST) containing protease inhibitors. Endogenous Kif19a was immunoprecipitated from whole-lung lysate using anti-Kif19a antibody cross-linked to protein A–agarose (0.5 µg of antibody per 10 µl of protein A–conjugated resin by using disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linker). Proteins immobilized on beads were eluted using a low-pH, glycine-based elution buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and subjected to SDS–PAGE and Western blotting. PHBECs and MTECs were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C. The cells were then washed and permeabilized using PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 25 °C. After a brief wash, the cells were blocked with 2% BSA–PBS–Tween-20 for 1 h at 25 °C. The cilia were stained with acetyl-tubulin antibody (1:1000). Alexa Fluor–conjugated antibodies were used for detection. The images were taken using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200). In the immunofluorescence controls, no antibody was added to the samples. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). Sybr green-based real-time PCR was performed using prevalidated primers for selected murine genes. At least three independent experiments were performed for quantitative measurement. Error bars represent S.E. Student's t test was used for a pair-wise comparison with two-tailed analysis, and one-way ANOVA was applied for multiple comparisons. The P value was adjusted using Bonferroni's correction. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. All the data are included in the article.

https://openalex.org/W2409666915,"In many practical situations, we are interested in the effect of covariates on correlated multiple responses. In this paper, we focus on estimation and variable selection in multi-response multiple regression models. Correlation among the response variables must be modeled for valid inference.We used an extension of the generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology to simultaneously analyze binary, count, and continuous outcomes with nonlinear functions. Variable selection plays an important role in modeling correlated responses because of the large number of model parameters that must be estimated. We propose a penalized-likelihood approach based on the extended GEEs for simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection.We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of our method, considering different sample sizes and numbers of response variables. The results showed that our method works well compared to treating the responses as uncorrelated. We recommend using an unstructured correlation model with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the tuning parameters. We demonstrated our method using data from a concrete slump test."
https://openalex.org/W3042343134,"The transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channel linked to human cardiac diseases. The human mutation K914R within TRPM4’s S4-S5 linker was identified in patients with atrioventricular block. During UV-flash-mediated Ca2+ transients, TRPM4K914R generated a threefold augmented membrane current concomitant with 2 to 3-fold slowed down activation and deactivation kinetics resulting in excessive membrane currents during human cardiac action potentials. Mutagenesis of K914 paired with molecular modeling suggested the importance of the nanoscopic interface between the S4-S5 linker, the MHR4-, and TRP-domain as a major determinant for TRPM4’s behavior. Rational mutagenesis of an interacting amino acid (R1062Q) in the TRP domain was able to offset K914R`s gain-of-function by zipping and unzipping of this nanoscopic interface. In conclusion, repulsion and attraction between the amino acids at positions 914 and 1062 alters the flexibility of the nanoscopic interface suggesting a zipping and unzipping mechanism that modulates TRPM4’s functions. Pharmacological modulation of this intramolecular mechanism might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of TRPM4-mediated cardiac diseases."

Here, we fabricated a series of poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate)/polylactic acid/collagen (PHBV/PLA/Col) membranes and cultured them with VSC4.1 motor neurons. The material characteristics and in vitro biological characteristics were evaluated. In the subcutaneous implantation test, PHBV/PLA/COl scaffolds supported the cellular infiltration, microvasculature formation, and decreased CD86-positive macrophage aggregation. Following contusion spinal cord injury at T10 in Sprague-Dawley rats, durotomy was performed with allograft dura mater or PHBV/PLA or PHBV/PLA/Col membranes. At 3 days post-injury, Western blot assay showed decreased the expression of the NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and CD86 expression but increased the expression of CD206. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that duraplasty with PHBV/PLA/Col membranes reduced the infiltration of CD86-positive macrophages in the lesion site, decreased the glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, and increased the expression of NF-200. Moreover, duraplasty with PHBV/PLA/Col membranes improved locomotor functional recovery at 8 weeks post-injury. Thus, duraplasty with PHBV/PLA/Col membranes decreased the glial scar formation and promoted axon growth by inhibiting inflammasome activation and modulating macrophage polarization in acute spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W4246802703,"South American fire ant decapitating flies in the genus Pseudacteon (Diptera: Phoridae) are potential biocontrol agents of the invasive fire ants Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri in the United States and other regions of the world due to their high host specificity and the direct and indirect damage to their host ants. Despite their importance and the fact that several flies have already been released in the US, little is known about the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships of Pseudacteon flies parasitizing South American fire ants in the Solenopsis saevissima species-group. A species delimitation analysis was conducted using a distance-based method (ABGD) and two tree-based methods (GMYC and mPTP) using COI sequences of 103 specimens belonging to 20 of the 22 Pseudacteon species known from southern South America. Additionally, phylogenetic relationships between the already described and new candidate species were inferred using mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (wingless) sequences. The species delimitation analysis suggests that species richness in these flies has been previously underestimated, due to the existence of putative cryptic species within nominal Pseudacteon obtusus, P. pradei, P. tricuspis, P. cultellatus, and P. nudicornis. Geographic distribution and host fire ant species seem to support cryptic lineages, though additional morphological data are needed to corroborate these results. All phylogenetic analyses reveal that South American fire ant decapitating flies are grouped into two main clades, with Pseudacteon convexicauda sister and well differentiated relative to these clades. Neither host nor geographic association appeared to be related to the differentiation of these two main clades within South American fire ant decapitating flies. This work provides information that will allow testing whether the putative cryptic phorid fly species show differences in their effectiveness as biocontrol agents against the highly invasive imported fire ants."

In a VLC, users are not only the extractors of knowledge results but also the source of the platform knowledge base. The continuous knowledge sharing and communication of VLC users promote the sustainable development of the community. Studying the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC for the sustainable development of the community is of great importance. This study introduces the perceptual normativeness, perceptual enjoyment, perceptual interactivity, and perceptual value variables on the basis of the extended expectation confirmation model of the information system continuance model. After checking and correcting the prediction questionnaire twice, we adopted the ""Questionnaire Star"" network system to distribute the questionnaire and conducted offline questionnaire surveys of borrowers of Shandong University Library, University of Jinan Library, and Shandong Library. A theoretical model of the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC is constructed using the structural equation model. The survey data were empirically analyzed to explore the influencing factors and mechanism of the continuous use behavior of users in the VLC. Interaction perception, value perception, and perceptual normativeness exerted a significant positive impact on user-perceived usefulness and expectation confirmation, whereas perceptual enjoyment had little effect on perceived usefulness. This study also summarized the relationship between users' continuous use behavior, continuous willingness and perceived usefulness, expectation confirmation, satisfaction, self-efficacy, and contributing factors in the VLC on the basis of the data results.

The cell-free extract of L. amylolyticus L6 was found to exhibit glycosyltransferase activity to synthesize α-galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) with melibiose as substrate. The coding genes of α-galactosidase were identified in the genome of L. amylolyticus L6. The α-galactosidase (AglB) was placed into GH36 family by amino acid sequence alignments with other α-galactosidases from lactobacilli. The optimal reaction conditions of pH and temperature for AglB were pH 6.0 and 37°C, respectively. Besides, potassium ion was found to improve the activity of AglB while divalent mercury ion, copper ion and zinc ion displayed different degrees of inhibition effect. Under the optimum reaction condition, AglB could catalyze the synthesis of GOS with degree of polymerization (DP) ≥5 by using 300 mM melibiose concentration as substrate. The maximum yield of GOS with (DP) ≥3 could reach 31.56% (w/w). Transgalactosyl properties made AglB a potential candidate for application in the production of GOS."
https://openalex.org/W3043468372,"Background Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a serious public health concern in low- and middle-income countries. Little is known about treatment outcomes of child inpatients in Intensive Therapeutic and Feeding Units. This study aimed to assess treatment outcomes of SAM and identify factors associated with mortality among children treated at Saint Joseph Nutritional Center, South Kivu, Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods A retrospective hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on medical records of 633 severely malnourished children followed as inpatients at Saint Joseph Nutritional Center from July 2017 to December 2018. Data were entered, thoroughly cleaned and analyzed in SPSS version 25. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression model were fitted to identify factors associated with mortality. Results Among 633 patients admitted with SAM, 13.1% were lost to follow-up and 9.2% died while in hospital. Children with late referral to the health facility (> 14 days) after the onset of main external malnutrition signs had 2.03 times higher odds of death than those referred less than 14 days [AOR = 2.03 at 95%CI (1.12, 3.68)]. The odds of death was 1.91 times higher for children with MUAC < 115 mm than for those with MUAC ≥ 115 mm [AOR = 1.91 at 95% CI (1.05, 3.50)]. Children infected with HIV were 3.90 times more likely to die compared to their counterparts [AOR = 3.90 at 95% CI (2.80, 9.41)]. Conclusion Particular emphasis should be placed on partnering with communities to improve information on malnutrition signs and on critical importance of early referral to the health system. While HIV incidence in DRC is still low (0.21%), its impact on mortality among severely malnourished children is increased due to the limited access to HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3043817280,"Background Little evidence from developing countries on dietary transition demonstrates the effects of comprehensive childhood obesity interventions on dietary diversity and food variety among younger children. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of comprehensive childhood obesity interventions on dietary diversity among younger children. Methods A total of 4846 children aged 7–13 years were included based on a multicenter randomized controlled trial for childhood obesity interventions in 38 primary schools. Nutrition education intervention (NE), physical activity intervention (PA) and comprehensive intervention including both NE and PA (CNP) were carried out separately for 2 semesters. Dietary Diversity Score (DDS9 and DDS28 for 9 and 28 food groupings, respectively), Food Variety Score (FVS, the number of food items) and the proportions of different foods consumed were calculated according to the food intake records collected with the 24-h dietary recall method. Results The intervention effects per day of comprehensive intervention group were 0 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0, 0.1; p = 0.382) on DDS9, 0.1 (95% CI: -0.1, 0.2; p = 0.374) on DDS28 and 0.1 (95% CI: -0.1, 0.3; p = 0.186) on FVS of overall diet, which was 0.1 (95% CI: 0, 0.1; p < 0.001) on DDS9, 0 (95% CI: 0, 0.1; p = 0.168) on DDS28 and 0.1 (95% CI: 0, 0.1; p = 0.067) on FVS of dietary scores of breakfast only. Additionally, CNP group had greater increases in cereals, meat and fruits, and more decreases in eggs, fish and dried legumes consumption proportions as compared with the control group. Decreasing side effect on dietary diversity and food variety were found for PA intervention, but not for NE intervention only. Conclusions Though the comprehensive obesity intervention didn’t improve the overall dietary diversity per day, the positive intervention effects were observed on breakfast foods and some foods’ consumption."

They can be suspected to play important roles in cell/tissue grafting for various neural diseases. The clinical applications of such trophic factors to the central nervous system (CNS), however, have caused problematic side effects on account of the distinctive bioactive properties. In the course of developing synthetic compounds reflecting beneficial properties of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), we conducted screening candidates that stimulate to trigger the intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF receptor and lead to the subsequent intracellular signaling in neurons. A small synthetic molecule SUN13837 was characterized by mimicking the beneficial properties of bFGF, which have been known as its specific activities when applied to CNS. What is more remarkable is that SUN13837 is eliminated the bioactivity to induce cell proliferation of non-neuronal somatic cells. On the bases of studies of pharmacology, behavior, physiology and histology, the present study reports that SUN13837 is characterized as a promising synthetic compound for treatment of devastating damages onto the rat spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W3043050435,"Silicon (Si) has numerous health properties. It is an element of the extracellular matrix; it is involved in collagen synthesis, bone mineralization, and immune system modulation; and it reduces metal accumulation in Alzheimer’s disease and the risk of atherosclerosis. Given its poor intestinal absorption, Si is ingested in the form of orthosilicic acid (OSA) to promote its bioavailability. The aim of this work was to compare different commercial dietary supplements containing stabilized OSA to ascertain their bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and safety in a model of human intestinal epithelium. Biocompatibility with the glycocalyx was also investigated. Supplements containing collagen, maltodextrins, and choline as OSA stabilizers were analyzed. Bioaccessibility was explored by means of an in vitro digestive process. Bioavailability was investigated using a Caco2 cell line alone, or co-culturing with a HT29-MTX cell line. The safety of the compounds tested (in terms of intestinal epithelium integrity) was judged on the grounds of MTS assay, transepithelial electrical resistance, and apparent permeability. The three formulations were also tested in a Caco2 cell model of intestinal glycocalyx Si retention. The choline-formulated OSA formulation outperformed the maltodextrin-stabilized supplement, with a Si bioavailability about 14 times higher (P < .05). The choline-formulated OSA formulation increased cell permeability, with consequent intestinal epithelium disruption. The supplements’ absorption and bioavailability (and harmfulness) differed considerably, depending on the OSA stabilizer involved. Of the three formulations tested, the collagen-formulated OSA represents the best Si dietary supplement."

Children with average CDR ≥ 0.6 on SD-OCT were classified as having large CDR. The ratios of vertical disc diameter (VDD), horizontal disc diameter (HDD), and maximum peripapillary atrophy (PPA) width (PPW) were measured to quantify morphologic changes of optic discs and SD-OCT parameters, such as peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and macular ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness were measured.Of the 82 eyes (82 patients) analyzed, 42 eyes had large CDR and 40 eyes were normal controls. The mean age and refractive error at initial examination were not different between groups (P = 0.33, P = 0.76, respectively). The changes in HDD/VDD and PPW/VDD ratios during follow-up showed no significant difference among the groups (P = 0.45, P = 0.62, respectively). No statistical significance was found in changes in RNFL and GCIPL thickness between the two groups (P = 0.74, P = 0.79, respectively).Children with enlarged CDR showed changes in optic disc morphology and RNFL/GCIPL thickness similar to normal children during myopic shift."
https://openalex.org/W3042564923,"The purpose of this study is to explore Protestant religious leaders' attitudes towards abortion and their strategies for pastoral care in Georgia, USA. Religious leaders may play an important role in providing sexual and reproductive health pastoral care given a long history of supporting healing and health promotion.We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders on their attitudes toward abortion and how they provide pastoral care for abortion. The study was conducted in a county with relatively higher rates of abortion, lower access to sexual and reproductive health services, higher religiosity, and greater denominational diversity compared to other counties in the state. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by thematic analysis.Religious leaders' attitudes towards abortion fell on a spectrum from ""pro-life"" to ""pro-choice"". However, most participants expressed attitudes in the middle of this spectrum and described more nuanced, complex, and sometimes contradictory views. Differences in abortion attitudes stemmed from varying beliefs on when life begins and circumstances in which abortion may be morally acceptable. Religious leaders described their pastoral care on abortion as ""journeying with"" congregants by advising them to make well-informed decisions irrespective of the religious leader's own attitudes. However, many religious leaders described a lack of preparation and training to have these conversations. Leaders emphasized not condoning abortion, yet being willing to emotionally support women because spiritual leaders are compelled to love and provide pastoral care. Paradoxically, all leaders emphasized the importance of empathy and compassion for people who have unplanned pregnancies, yet only leaders whose attitudes were ""pro-choice"" or in the middle of the spectrum expressed an obligation to confront stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards people who experience abortion. Additionally, many leaders offer misinformation about abortion when offering pastoral care.These findings contribute to limited empirical evidence on pastoral care for abortion. We found religious leaders hold diverse attitudes and beliefs about abortion, rooted in Christian scripture and doctrine that inform advice and recommendations to congregants. While religious leaders may have formal training on pastoral care in general or theological education on the ethical issues related to abortion, they struggle to integrate their knowledge and training across these two areas. Still, leaders could be potentially important resources for empathy, compassion, and affirmation of agency in abortion decision-making, particularly in the Southern United States."
https://openalex.org/W3042899831,"Whether marine fish will grow differently in future high pCO2 environments remains surprisingly uncertain. Long-term and whole-life cycle effects are particularly unknown, because such experiments are logistically challenging, space demanding, exclude long-lived species, and require controlled, restricted feeding regimes—otherwise increased consumption could mask potential growth effects. Here, we report on repeated, long-term, food-controlled experiments to rear large populations (>4,000 individuals total) of the experimental model and ecologically important forage fish Menidia menidia (Atlantic silverside) under contrasting temperature (17°, 24°, and 28°C) and pCO2 conditions (450 vs. ~2,200 μatm) from fertilization to ~ a third of this annual species’ life span. Quantile analyses of trait distributions showed mostly negative effects of high pCO2 on long-term growth. At 17°C and 28°C, but not at 24°C, high pCO2 fish were significantly shorter [17°C: -5 to -9%; 28°C: -3%] and weighed less [17°C: -6 to -18%; 28°C: -8%] compared to ambient pCO2 fish. Reductions in fish weight were smaller than in length, which is why high pCO2 fish at 17°C consistently exhibited a higher Fulton’s k (weight/length ratio). Notably, it took more than 100 days of rearing for statistically significant length differences to emerge between treatment populations, showing that cumulative, long-term CO2 effects could exist elsewhere but are easily missed by short experiments. Long-term rearing had another benefit: it allowed sexing the surviving fish, thereby enabling rare sex-specific analyses of trait distributions under contrasting CO2 environments. We found that female silversides grew faster than males, but there was no interaction between CO2 and sex, indicating that males and females were similarly affected by high pCO2. Because Atlantic silversides are known to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, we also analyzed sex ratios, revealing no evidence for CO2-dependent sex determination in this species."
https://openalex.org/W3043208009,"Azole resistant fungal infections remain a health problem for the immune compromised. Current therapies are limited due to rises in new resistance mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to identify new drug targets for drug discovery and novel therapeutics. Arv1 (are1 are2 required for viability 1) function is highly conserved between multiple pathogenic fungal species. Candida albicans (C. albicans) cells lacking CaArv1 are azole hypersusceptible and lack virulence. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) Scarv1 cells are also azole hypersusceptible, a phenotype reversed by expression of CaArv1, indicating conservation in the molecular mechanism for azole susceptibility. To define the relationship between Arv1 function and azole susceptibility, we undertook a structure/function analysis of ScArv1. We identified several conserved amino acids within the ScArv1 homology domain (ScAhd) required for maintaining normal azole susceptibility. Erg11 lanosterol 14-α-demethylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in sterol biosynthesis and is the direct target of azole antifungals, so we used our ScArv1 mutants in order to explore the relationship between ScArv1 and ScErg11. Specific ScArv1 mutants ectopically expressed from a low copy plasmid were unable to restore normal azole susceptibility to Scarv1 cells and had reduced Erg11 protein levels. Erg11 protein stability depended on its ability to form a heterodimeric complex with Arv1. Complex formation was required for maintaining normal azole susceptibility. Scarv1 cells expressing orthologous CaArv1 mutants also had reduced CaErg11 levels, were unable to form a CaArv1-CaErg11 complex, and were azole hypersusceptible. Scarv1 cells expressing CaArv1 mutants unable to interact with CaErg11 could not sustain proper levels of the azole resistant CaErg11Y132F F145L protein. Caarv1/Caarv1 cells expressing CaArv1 mutants unable to interact with CaErg11 were found to lack virulence using a disseminated candidiasis mouse model. Expressing CaErg11Y132F F145L did not reverse the lack of virulence. We hypothesize that the role of Arv1 in Erg11-dependent azole resistance is to stabilize Erg11 protein level. Arv1 inhibition may represent an avenue for treating azole resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3043232782,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of tocotrienol form of vitamin E (TCT) on platelet function in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). A double blind, randomized, single center phase II clinical trial was conducted comparing placebo (PBO) and 400 and 800 mg TCT daily for a year in 150 patients with a sentinel ischemic stroke or TIA event in the prior 6 months. Platelet function was measured at baseline and then, at 3 month intervals for a year, using light transmission aggregometry. The incidence of aspirin resistance in aspirin-treated patients or platelet inhibition in patients on clopidogrel alone was compared between the three treatment groups. Results showed that in patients taking aspirin and clopidogrel, the incidence of aspirin resistance was significantly decreased from 40% in PBO-treated patients to 9% in the 400 mg TCT group and 25% in the TCT 800 mg group (P = .03). In conclusion, patients on aspirin and clopidogrel had a higher incidence of aspirin resistance than all patients treated with aspirin alone and TCT decreased the frequency of aspirin resistance in this group."
https://openalex.org/W3042479870,"During infection, viruses enter susceptible host cells in order to replicate their components for production of new virions. In the process of infection, the gene expression of infected cells undergoes changes because of the production of viral components and due to the host response from detection of viral products. In the advent of RNA sequencing, the discovery of new genes and their functions in the host response generates new avenues for interventions in the host-pathogen interaction. We have identified a novel gene, Heatr9, as a virus and cytokine inducible viral responsive gene. We confirm Heatr9's expression in vitro and in vivo during virus infection and correlate it with viral burden. Heatr9 is induced by influenza virus and RSV. Heatr9 knockdown during viral infection was shown to affect chemokine expression. Our studies identify Heatr9 as a novel inflammatory and virus infection induced gene that can regulate the induction of specific cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W3043073952,"Defining genetic diversity of viral infections directly from patient specimens is the ultimate goal of surveillance. Simple tools that can provide full-length sequence information on blood borne viral hepatitis viruses: hepatitis C, hepatitis B and hepatitis D viruses (HCV, HBV and HDV) remain elusive. Here, an unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing approach (mNGS) was used for molecular characterization of HCV infections (n = 99) from Israel which yielded full-length HCV sequences in 89% of samples, with 7 partial sequences sufficient for classification. HCV genotypes were primarily 1b (68%) and 1a (19%), with minor representation of genotypes 2c (1%) and 3a (8%). HBV/HDV coinfections were characterized by suppressed HBV viral loads, resulting in sparse mNGS coverage. A probe-based enrichment approach (xGen) aiming to increase HBV and HDV coverage was validated on a panel of diverse genotypes, geography and titers. The method extended HBV genome coverage a median 61% (range 8–84%) and provided orders of magnitude boosts in reads and sequence depth for both viruses. When HBV-xGen was applied to Israeli samples, coverage was improved by 28–73% in 4 samples and identified HBV genotype A1, A2, D1 specimens and a dual B/D infection. Abundant HDV reads in mNGS libraries yielded 18/26 (69%) full genomes and 8 partial sequences, with HDV-xGen only providing minimal extension (3–11%) of what were all genotype 1 genomes. Advanced molecular approaches coupled to virus-specific capture probes promise to enhance surveillance of viral infections and aid in monitoring the spread of local subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W3043082453,"Introduction House Officer (HO) Preparatory Courses in Malaysia are designed to prepare medical graduates to work as a HO. The courses are designed to address the issues related to lack of confidence and readiness to work, which could lead to stress and HO dropping out of work. The modules focus on how to prepare medical graduates into the real-life working scenario. Hence, we determined the effectiveness of a HO Preparatory Course on the level of confidence and readiness to work among medical graduates. Methodology A quasi-experimental study was conducted at three time-points (pre-intervention, post-intervention and one-month after working as a HO) on the level of confidence and readiness of medical graduates. The intervention was the Medicorp module, which included information and training needed for the HO such as common clinical cases in the wards, case referrals, experience sharing and hands on clinical training. We recruited eligible participants undergoing the course between April–November 2018. The adapted IMU Student Competency Survey was used to measure the confidence and readiness levels, which were scored from a Likert scale of 1–5. The higher score indicated higher levels of confidence or readiness. Results A total of 239 participants were recruited at baseline (90% response rate). They were mostly female (77.8%), Malays (79.1%), single (90.0%), graduated overseas (73.6%), in 2018 (65.3%). The mean (SE) confidence scores significantly increased from 2.18 (1.00) pre-course to 3.50 (0.75) immediately after course and 3.79 (0.92) after one-month of work (p <0.001, η2 = 0.710). The mean (SE) readiness scores at pre-course, immediately and one-month post work were 2.36 (1.03), 3.46(0.78) and 3.70(0.90), respectively (p< 0.001, η2 = 0.612). Conclusion The HO Preparatory Course module was effective in increasing levels of confidence and readiness for medical graduates, most of whom are overseas graduates; namely Egypt, Russia and Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W3042303970,"Health Care Workers (HCW) may have an occupational risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and TB disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the 2-step strategy: tuberculin skin test (TST) followed by confirmation with Interferon (IFN)-γ- release assays (IGRAs) in HCW. A secondary objective was to determine the factors related to conversions and reversions. HCW at risk of occupational exposure who attended the Occupational Department of the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol were included during the study period (2013–2016). All professionals testing negative for LTBI were included in a cohort study. These workers were followed up with the administration of a TST and an IGRA quantification at least one year after inclusion in the study. Workers with positive TST, regardless of the results of the IGRA tests, were followed-up with an IGRA. 255 workers were enrolled in the study and 108 workers from the same cohort were followed up. During the follow-up period, seven workers presented TST test conversion. One of these conversions was also confirmed by an IGRA test. There were 2 conversions of cases only testing positive with the IGRA. There have been only 2 reversions of cases testing negative with the IGRA. In this study, not all TST conversions were confirmed when using the IGRA test, which highlights the importance of the 2-step strategy. We have detected a low number of conversions and reversions. Our conclusions should be confirmed in studies with a longer follow-up time."
https://openalex.org/W3043263101,"Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have a higher burden of premature cardio-metabolic abnormalities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity resulting into a 3-fold increase in mortality, and up to 20% reduction in life expectancy compared to the general population. Although over 30% of Ugandans have some form of mental illness, there are no national or hospital-based screening guidelines for cardio-metabolic abnormalities among these patients a general trend in most low-income countries. The screening rates for cardio-metabolic abnormalities in most low-income countries are at only 0.6%. The objective of this study was to describe the cardio-metabolic abnormalities among patients with SMI at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Through a cross-sectional study, we recruited 304 patients with SMI and evaluated them for cardio-metabolic abnormalities using the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for dyslipidemias, World Health Organisation criteria for diabetes mellitus, obesity, and the Joint national committee criteria for hypertension. We then determined the proportion of participants who met the criteria for each of the individual cardio-metabolic abnormalities. Of the 304 participants, 44.41% were male and 55.59% female with a mean age of 38.56±13.66 years. Almost half (46.38%) of the participants were either overweight or obese, 33.22% had abdominal obesity, 40.46% were hypertensive, 34.11% had low high-density lipoproteins, 37.42% had hypertriglyceridemia and 34.77% had hypercholesterolemia. Based on fasting blood sugar, 11.18% and 9.87% had pre-diabetes and diabetes respectively. There is a high level of cardio-metabolic abnormalities among patients with psychiatric disorders and thus metabolic screening for these abnormalities should be done routinely during psychiatric reviews. There is a need for national guidelines for screening of metabolic abnormalities among patients with SMI so that these abnormalities can be detected early enough at stages where they can be either reversed or delayed to progress to cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3044376213,"HMGB2, a DNA-binding protein, highly expresses during embryogenesis and plays an important role in development of some organs and tissues. However, it remains to be further investigated weather HMGB2 influences muscle development. In this work, we identified HMGB2 as an essential factor in myogenesis. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, body weights of systemic hmgb2 homozygous knockout (hmgb2-/- ) mice especially males were reduced. Diameter and cross-section area of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle fibers as well as expression of Myogenin and MyHC were all decreased in hmgb2-/- mice. CTX injury model revealed that HMGB2 was required for satellite cell proliferation and muscle regeneration. Moreover, HMGB2 interacted with S6K1 and regulated the kinase activity of S6K1 during cell proliferation. Knockdown and inactivation of S6K1 in C2C12 cells both resulted in impaired proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, expression of cyclin D1 and Myf5 were both decreased when HMGB2 or S6K1 were knocked down and kinase activity of S6K1 was inhibited. These results indicate that HMGB2 is required for skeletal muscle development and regeneration, and HMGB2 maintains proliferation of myoblasts through regulating kinase activity of S6K1."
https://openalex.org/W3042556364,"Cardiac sympathetic innervation is critically involved in the regulation of circulatory dynamics. However, the molecular mechanism for the innervation patterning has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that nardilysin (NRDC, Nrdc), an enhancer of ectodomain shedding, regulates cardiac sympathetic innervation. Nardilysin-deficient (Nrdc-/- ) mice show hypoplastic hearts, hypotension, bradycardia, and abnormal sympathetic innervation patterning. While the innervation of left ventricle (LV) of wild-type mice is denser in the subepicardium than in the subendocardium, Nrdc-/- LV lacks such a polarity and is uniformly and more abundantly innervated. At the molecular level, the full-length form of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR , Ngfr) is increased in Nrdc-/- LV due to the reduced ectodomain shedding of p75NTR . Importantly, the reduction of p75NTR rescued the abnormal innervation phenotype of Nrdc-/- mice. Moreover, sympathetic neuron-specific, but not cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Nrdc recapitulated the abnormal innervation patterning of Nrdc-/- mice. In conclusion, neuronal nardilysin critically regulates cardiac sympathetic innervation and circulatory dynamics via modulation of p75NTR ."
https://openalex.org/W3042797526,"Nationwide disease surveillance at a high spatial resolution is desired for many infectious diseases, including Visceral Leishmaniasis. Statistical and mathematical models using data collected from surveillance activities often use a spatial resolution and scale either constrained by data availability or chosen arbitrarily. Sensitivity of model results to the choice of spatial resolution and scale is not, however, frequently evaluated. This study aims to determine if the choice of spatial resolution and scale are likely to impact statistical and mathematical analyses. Visceral Leishmaniasis in Brazil is used as a case study. Probabilistic characteristics of disease incidence, representing a likely outcome in a model, are compared across spatial resolutions and scales. Best fitting distributions were fit to annual incidence from 2004 to 2014 by municipality and by state. Best fits were defined as the distribution family and parameterization minimizing the sum of absolute error, evaluated through a simulated annealing algorithm. Gamma and Poisson distributions provided best fits for incidence, both among individual states and nationwide. Comparisons of distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence shows that incidence by state and by municipality do not follow distributions that provide equivalent information. Few states with Gamma distributed incidence follow a distribution closely resembling that for national incidence. These results demonstrate empirically how choice of spatial resolution and scale can impact mathematical and statistical models."
https://openalex.org/W3043335315,"Diagnosis of pertussis is challenging especially in infants. Most low and middle-income countries (LMIC) lack resources for laboratory confirmation, relying largely on clinical diagnosis alone for both case management and surveillance. This necessitates robust clinical case definitions.This study assesses the accuracy of clinical case definitions with and without lymphocytosis in diagnosing pertussis in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in a LMIC setting.Children hospitalized with severe LRTI in a South African hospital were prospectively enrolled and evaluated for pertussis using PCR on respiratory samples. Clinical signs and differential white cell counts were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of pertussis clinical diagnosis using WHO and Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) criteria; and with addition of lymphocytosis were assessed with PCR as the reference standard.458 children <10 years were enrolled. Bordetella pertussis infection was confirmed in 32 (7.0%). For WHO criteria, sensitivity was 78.1% (95% CI 60.7-89.2%) and specificity 15.5% (95% CI 12.4-19.3%); for GPI sensitivity was 34.4% (95% CI 20.1-52.1) and specificity 64.8% (95% CI 60.1-69.2%). Area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating character (ROC) analysis was 0.58 (95% CI 0.46-0.70 for WHO criteria, and 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.88) for GPI with highest likelihood ratios of 5.33 and 4.42 respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was highest between five and seven days of symptoms for both criteria. Lymphocytosis had sensitivity of 31.3% (95% CI 17.5-49.3%) and specificity of 70.7% (95% CI 66.1-74.8%) and showed a marginal impact on improving clinical criteria.Clinical criteria lack accuracy for diagnosis and surveillance of pertussis. Non-outbreak settings should consider shorter durations in clinical criteria. New recommendations still fall short of what is required for a viable clinical screening test which means the need to improve access to laboratory diagnostic support remains crucial."
https://openalex.org/W3043425237,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a chronic decline in cognitive function and is pathologically typified by cerebral deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The production of Aβ is mediated by sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases, and has been implicated as the essential determinant of AD pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that the level of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] in the membrane may potentially modulate Aβ production. Given that PI(4,5)P2 is produced by type 1 phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks), we sought to determine whether the level of PIP5K type Iα (PIP5K1A) can affect production of Aβ by modulating the lipid composition of the membrane. Using a HEK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses yellow fluorescent protein-tagged APP (APP-YFP), we demonstrated that overexpression of PIP5K1A results in significant enhancement of non-amyloidogenic APP processing and a concomitant suppression of the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to a marked decrease in secreted Aβ. Consistently, cells overexpressing PIP5K1A exhibited a significant redistribution of APP-YFP from endosomal compartments to the cell surface. Our findings suggest that PIP5K1A may play a critical role in governing Aβ production by modulating membrane distribution of APP, and as such, the pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target for AD."
https://openalex.org/W3043470780,"Access to toilets and latrines represents both a development indicator and a significant factor in child mortality and physical development. The lack of latrines in rural India therefore constitutes a major global health challenge. Given the urban-rural gap in latrine ownership across India, I investigated how family ties to major cities, which extend beyond the local community affected by neighbors' defecation practices, shaped latrine ownership in rural India. Using the national Rural Economic & Demographic Survey 2006 (n = 7,949), I analyzed the geographies of family ties, types of exchange and rural latrine ownership. Receiving family visits from major cities increased the likelihood of having a latrine (33% higher odds). The relationship between family visitors from major cities and rural latrine ownership was stronger for wealthier households (.031 increase in average marginal effect of urban visitors for a .5 standard deviation increase in household assets at the mean). Material support from family also increased the likelihood of latrine ownership (7.8% higher odds for each additional $200USD) suggesting that family members not living in major cities may still contribute necessary resources. The importance of personalized connections beyond the village, particularly to major cities, suggests that linking geographically disparate sanitation interventions may produce synergies."
