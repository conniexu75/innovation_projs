https://openalex.org/W4293155765,"Carbon emissions are primarily the result of human activity in urban areas. Inadequate sanitary facilities, contaminated drinking water, nonrenewable energy, and high traffic congestion have all impacted the natural ecosystem. Using data from 1975 to 2019, the study assessed the impact of the aforementioned variables on Pakistan’s carbon emissions in light of this crucial fact. The ARDL cointegration method was used to estimate the short- and long-run parameter estimates. Urban sanitation challenges and energy consumption increase carbon emissions, which affects the natural environment by raising a country’s carbon intensity. Economic expansion confirmed the inverted U-shaped relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth to verify the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the long run. In contrast, the monotonically rising function of carbon emissions provides evidence of the nation’s economic development in the short run. Access to clean drinking water improves population health and encourages the purchase of eco-friendly products. The government must improve sanitation services and use renewable energy sources to enhance air quality."

New drugs are required for ancillary support of existing malaria control efforts. Plasmodium falciparum requires host glucose for survival and proliferation. On this basis, P. falciparum hexose transporter 1 (PfHT1) protein involved in hexose permeation is considered a potential drug target. In this study, we tested the antimalarial activity of some compounds against PfHT1 using computational techniques. We performed high throughput virtual screening of 21,352 small-molecule compounds against PfHT1. The stability of the lead compound complexes was evaluated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 nanoseconds. We also investigated the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and physiological characteristics of the compounds in accordance with Lipinksi rules for drug-likeness to bind and inhibit PfHT1. Molecular docking and free binding energy analyses were carried out using Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born and Surface Area (MMGBSA) solvation to determine the selectivity of the hit compounds for PfHT1 over the human glucose transporter (hGLUT1) orthologue. Five important PfHT1 inhibitors were identified: Hyperoside (CID5281643); avicularin (CID5490064); sylibin (CID5213); harpagoside (CID5481542) and quercetagetin (CID5281680). The compounds formed intermolecular interaction with the binding pocket of the PfHT1 target via conserved amino acid residues (Val314, Gly183, Thr49, Asn52, Gly183, Ser315, Ser317, and Asn48). The MMGBSA analysis of the complexes yielded high free binding energies. Four (CID5281643, CID5490064, CID5213, and CID5481542) of the identified compounds were found to be stable within the PfHT1 binding pocket throughout the 100 nanoseconds simulation run time. The four compounds demonstrated higher affinity for PfHT1 than the human major glucose transporter (hGLUT1). This investigation demonstrates the inhibition potential of sylibin, hyperoside, harpagoside, and avicularin against PfHT1 receptor. Robust preclinical investigations are required to validate the chemotherapeutic properties of the identified compounds."
https://openalex.org/W4293155624,"Clostridioides ( Clostridium ) difficile infection (CDI) is an evolving global healthcare problem, and owing to the diverse and dynamic molecular epidemiology of C . difficile , new strains continue to emerge. In Brazil, only two cases of CDI due to the so called hypervirulent PCR ribotype (RT) 027 belonging to clade 2 have ever been reported, whereas incidence of CDI due to another “hypervirulent” RT078 (clade 5) has not yet been reported. In contrast, novel clade 2 strains have been identified in different hospitals. To better understand the epidemiology of CDIs in Brazil, this study aimed to genotypically and phenotypically characterize three novel Brazilian clade 2 strains (RT883, 884, and 885) isolated from patients with confirmed CDI. In addition, to better understand the circulating RTs, a two-year sampling was conducted in patients from the same hospital and in several domestic and wild animal species. The three strains examined showed lower production of A/B toxins than the control RT027, although two of these strains harbored a truncated tcdC gene. All strains showed swimming motility similar to that of RT027, while RT883 showed higher spore production than the reference strain. In the in vivo hamster model, the lethality of all strains was found to be similar to that of RT027. Both cgMLST and cgMLSA analyses revealed a high genetic similarity among the three-novel clade 2 isolates. In the two-year survey in animals and humans, RT883, 884, and 885 were not detected; however, three new RTs (RT988, RT989, and RT990) were isolated, two of which were genetically related to the three previously reported clade 2 strains. RT106 and RT126 were most frequently detected in humans (47.9%) and animals (57.9%), respectively. Furthermore, RT027 and RT078 were not detected in humans. The results of this study suggest that these novel clade 2 strains have virulence potential and that new strains from clade 2 continue to emerge in our setting, indicating the need for long-term local surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4293866607,"Macrophages (MФ) are an essential immune cell for defense and repair that travel to different tissues and adapt based on local stimuli. A critical factor that may govern their polarization is the crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetics. However, simultaneous measurements of metabolites, epigenetics, and proteins (phenotype) have been a major technical challenge. To address this, we have developed a novel triomics approach using mass spectrometry to comprehensively analyze metabolites, proteins, and histone modifications in a single sample. To demonstrate this technique, we investigated the metabolic-epigenetic-phenotype axis following polarization of human blood-derived monocytes into either 'proinflammatory M1-' or 'anti-inflammatory M2-' MФs. We report here a complex relationship between arginine, tryptophan, glucose, and the citric acid cycle metabolism, protein and histone post-translational modifications, and human macrophage polarization that was previously not described. Surprisingly, M1-MФs had globally reduced histone acetylation levels but high levels of acetylated amino acids. This suggests acetyl-CoA was diverted, in part, toward acetylated amino acids. Consistent with this, stable isotope tracing of glucose revealed reduced usage of acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation in M1-MФs. Furthermore, isotope tracing also revealed MФs uncoupled glycolysis from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as evidenced by poor isotope enrichment of succinate. M2-MФs had high levels of kynurenine and serotonin, which are reported to have immune-suppressive effects. Kynurenine is upstream of de novo NAD+ metabolism that is a necessary cofactor for Sirtuin-type histone deacetylases. Taken together, we demonstrate a complex interplay between metabolism and epigenetics that may ultimately influence cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4292939115,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is a key component of embryonic development and is a driving force in several cancers. Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family of enzymes, catalyzes the attachment of palmitate to the N-terminal cysteine of Shh, a posttranslation modification critical for Shh signaling. The activity of Hhat has been assayed in cells and in vitro, and cryo-EM structures of Hhat have been reported, yet several unanswered questions remain regarding the enzyme's reaction mechanism, substrate specificity, and the impact of the latter on Shh signaling. Here, we present an in vitro acylation assay with purified Hhat that directly monitors attachment of a fluorescently tagged fatty acyl chain to Shh. Our kinetic analyses revealed that the reaction catalyzed by Hhat proceeds through a random sequential mechanism. We also determined that Hhat can utilize multiple fatty acyl-CoA substrates for fatty acid transfer to Shh, with comparable affinities and turnover rates for myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, and oleoyl-CoA. Furthermore, we investigated the functional consequence of differential fatty acylation of Shh in a luciferase-based Shh reporter system. We found that the potency of the signaling response in cells was higher for Shh acylated with saturated fatty acids compared to monounsaturated fatty acids. These findings demonstrate that Hhat can attach fatty acids other than palmitate to Shh and suggest that heterogeneous fatty acylation has the potential to impact Shh signaling in the developing embryo and/or cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4293155470,"Multiple immunoinformatic tools have been developed to predict T-cell epitopes from protein amino acid sequences for different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles. These prediction tools output hundreds of potential peptide candidates which require further processing; however, these tools are either not graphical or not friendly for non-programming users. We present Epitope-Evaluator, a web tool developed in the Shiny/R framework to interactively analyze predicted T-cell epitopes. Epitope-Evaluator contains six tools providing the distribution of epitopes across a selected set of MHC alleles, the promiscuity and conservation of epitopes, and their density and location within antigens. Epitope-Evaluator requires as input the fasta file of protein sequences and the output prediction file coming out from any predictor. By choosing different cutoffs and parameters, users can produce several interactive plots and tables that can be downloaded as JPG and text files, respectively. Using Epitope-Evaluator, we found the HLA-B*40, HLA-B*27:05 and HLA-B*07:02 recognized fewer epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome than other MHC Class I alleles. We also identified shared epitopes between Delta, Omicron, and Wuhan Spike variants as well as variant-specific epitopes. In summary, Epitope-Evaluator removes the programming barrier and provides intuitive tools, allowing a straightforward interpretation and graphical representations that facilitate the selection of candidate epitopes for experimental evaluation.

https://openalex.org/W4293155638,"There are various risk factors for death in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. The effects of symptoms on death have been investigated, but symptoms were considered individually, rather than in combination, as predictors. We examined the effects of symptom combinations on in-hospital mortality.Data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency were analyzed. A cohort of 5,153 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in South Korea was followed from hospitalization to death or discharge. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify symptom combinations, and the hazard ratios (HRs) of death were estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model.Three sets of symptom factors were isolated for symptom combination. Factor 1 symptoms were cold-like symptoms, factor 2 were neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, and factor 3 were more severe symptoms such as dyspnea and altered state of consciousness. Factor 1 (HR 1.14, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.01-1.30) and factor 3 (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.31) were associated with a higher risk for death, and factor 2 with a lower risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.71-0.96).The effect on in-hospital mortality differed according to symptom combination. The results are evidence of the effects of symptoms on COVID-19 mortality and may contribute to lowering the COVID-19 mortality rate. Further study is needed to identify the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of symptom combinations on mortality."

https://openalex.org/W4293051400,"Recent studies identified a missense mutation in the gene coding for G protein–coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) that segregates with type 2 diabetes (T2D). To better understand how GRK6 might be involved in T2D, we used pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown in the mouse β-cell line, MIN6, to determine whether GRK6 regulates insulin dynamics. We show inhibition of GRK5 and GRK6 increased insulin secretion but reduced insulin processing while GRK6 knockdown revealed these same processing defects with reduced levels of cellular insulin. GRK6 knockdown cells also had attenuated insulin secretion but enhanced proinsulin secretion consistent with decreased processing. In support of these findings, we demonstrate GRK6 rescue experiments in knockdown cells restored insulin secretion after glucose treatment. The altered insulin profile appears to be caused by changes in the proprotein convertases, the enzymes responsible for proinsulin to insulin conversion, as GRK6 knockdown resulted in significantly reduced convertase expression and activity. To identify how the GRK6-P384S mutation found in T2D patients might affect insulin processing, we performed biochemical and cell biological assays to study the properties of the mutant. We found that while GRK6-P384S was more active than WT GRK6, it displayed a cytosolic distribution in cells compared to the normal plasma membrane localization of GRK6. Additionally, GRK6 overexpression in MIN6 cells enhanced proinsulin processing, while GRK6-P384S expression had little effect. Taken together, our data show that GRK6 regulates insulin processing and secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and provide a foundation for understanding the contribution of GRK6 to T2D.

Over 400 million people currently have diabetes, and by 2040, this number is expected to rise to near 700 million (1International Diabetes FederationIDF Diabetes Atlas.10th edn. Brussels, Belgium2021Google Scholar). Of these cases, approximately 90% are type 2 diabetes (T2D), where developed insulin resistance and increased insulin demand prevents glucose mobilization and provokes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction culminating in insufficient insulin quantities and hyperglycemia (2Marín-Peñalver J.J.

The most effective treatment for T2D is lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, but for people with genetic predispositions, chronic illness, or poor compliance, this is ineffective and requires pharmacological intervention (1International Diabetes FederationIDF Diabetes Atlas.10th edn. Brussels, Belgium2021Google Scholar). Current therapies aim to improve insulin resistance (metformin), enhance pancreatic insulin output (meglitinides, sulfonylureas, GLP-1 analogs), or prevent reabsorption of glucose into the blood through the kidneys (SGLT2 inhibitors). These therapies, however, lose their efficacy over time, have dangerous side effects, and utilize discoveries made decades ago regarding β-cell physiology (2Marín-Peñalver J.J. Martín-Timón I.

Therefore, it is critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of T2D, especially in the pancreatic β-cell, to unveil new avenues for therapeutic intervention to combat the alarming increase in metabolic disease globally.Insulin processing and secretion in the β-cell is dependent upon a complex array of interconnected regulatory networks that coordinate the proper spatial and temporal release of insulin including insulin granule biogenesis, trafficking, and exocytosis (6Hou J.C. Min L. Pessin J.E. Insulin granule biogenesis, trafficking and exocytosis.Vitam. Horm. 2009; 80: 473-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The prototypical signal for insulin production and insulin release is the metabolism of glucose leading to membrane depolarization, calcium influx, and vesicle release (7Henquin J.C. Nenquin M. Stiernet P. Ahren B.

Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) resident on β-cells also play a pivotal role in the regulation of insulin production and secretion (10Husted A.S. Trauelsen M. Rudenko O. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. GPCR-mediated signaling of metabolites.Cell Metab. 2017; 25: 777-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Riddy D.M. Delerive P. Summers R.J.

GPCRs are a versatile class of cell surface receptors that transmit extracellular stimuli, including peptide hormones and nutrient metabolites, into an intracellular response and are the target of more than 30% of FDA approved drugs (13Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Seven-transmembrane receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 14Sriram K. Insel P.A. G protein-coupled receptors as targets for approved drugs: How many targets and how many drugs?.Mol. Pharmacol. 2018; 93: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Upon agonist binding, these receptors undergo conformational changes that promote heterotrimeric G protein activation initiating various downstream signaling cascades (15Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Heterotrimeric G protein activation by G-protein-coupled receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Termination of signaling occurs primarily through the phosphorylation of agonist-activated receptors by GPCR kinases (GRKs). This phosphorylation promotes the recruitment of the adapter protein, β-arrestin, which inhibits G protein coupling and enhances receptor internalization and β-arrestin–mediated signaling (16Moore C.A. Milano S.K. Benovic J.L. Regulation of receptor trafficking by GRKs and arrestins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Therefore, GRK-mediated phosphorylation of GPCRs functions as a switch to blunt G protein activation and enhance β-arrestin–mediated processes, highlighting their role as important regulators of GPCR function.There are seven mammalian GRKs classified based on sequence homology and functional features into the GRK1/7, GRK2/3, and GRK4-6 subfamilies. GRK2, 3, 5, and 6 are ubiquitously expressed and serve critical functions in various tissues (17Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors and neuronal functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Specifically in the pancreatic β-cell, these kinases control the extent of GPCR signaling that occurs following activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the gastrin inhibitory peptide receptor (GIPR), Gs-coupled receptors that stimulate insulin secretion (18Arcones A.C.

Role of G protein-coupled receptor kinases in glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor signaling.Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of agonist occupied M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3AChR) in mouse islets and MIN6 cells recruits β-arrestin2 and enhances second phase insulin secretion (21Kong K.C. Butcher A.J. McWilliams P. Jones D. Wess J. Hamdan F.F. et al.M3-muscarinic receptor promotes insulin release via receptor phosphorylation/arrestin-dependent activation of protein kinase D1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 21181-21186Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, numerous GPCRs resident on β-cells modulate insulin processing and secretion including the free fatty acid receptors (FFA1-4), glucagon receptor (GCGR), somatostatin receptors (SSTR2 and SSTR5), and several orphan receptors including GPR119 and GPR91 (10Husted A.S.

Rhodes C.J. Grimsby J.S. The dynamic plasticity of insulin production in β-cells.Mol. Metab. 2017; 6: 958-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly little is known about how β-cell GRKs regulate G protein– and β-arrestin–dependent mechanisms of insulin secretion through their ability to regulate GPCRs.In addition to GPCR regulation, emerging evidence suggests potential novel roles for GRKs in islets. For example, Chinese Han T2D patients with a GRK5 polymorphism have an attenuated response to repaglinide, a drug that stimulates insulin secretion by targeting the sulfonylurea receptor (25Shang Z. Han F. Zhou X. Bao Z. Zhu J. Wang T. et al.A variant of GRK5 is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of repaglinide in Chinese Han patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Drug Dev. Res. 2018; 79: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It was also reported that β-arrestin1 KO mice exhibit reduced efficacy when treated with tolbutamide and glibenclamide, drugs that also target the sulfonylurea receptor (26Barella L.F. Rossi M. Zhu L. Cui Y. Mei F.C. Cheng X. et al.β-Cell-intrinsic β-arrestin 1 signaling enhances sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, MIN6 cells with β-arrestin2 knockdown and mice with β-arrestin2 KO in β-cells have impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from inactivation of calmodulin kinase II (CAMKII) (27Zhu L. Almaça J. Dadi P.K. Hong H. Sakamoto W. Rossi M. et al.β-arrestin-2 is an essential regulator of pancreatic β-cell function under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.Nat. Commun. 2017; 814295Google Scholar). This is similar to that seen in mice with pancreatic deletion of GRK2, where glucose intolerance and diminished insulin secretion is observed (28Snyder J. Lackey A.I. Brown G.S. Diaz M. Yuzhen T. Sato P.Y. GRK2 contributes to glucose mediated calcium responses and insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells.Sci. Rep. 2021; 1111129Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Since β-arrestin function is often preceded by GPCR phosphorylation by GRKs, these non-GPCR pathways suggest alternative modes to β-arrestin activation. Together, these findings support the idea that GRK regulation in β-cells may be more complex than just agonist dependent phosphorylation of GPCRs. Thus, identifying mechanisms of GRK action in β-cells should improve our understanding of β-cell pathophysiology contributing to disease.Recently, Steyaert et al. identified a heterozygous missense mutation within the gene coding for GRK6 in two members of a family resulting in a proline to serine change at residue 384 (P384S) (29Steyaert W. Varney M.J. Benovic J.L. Creemers J. Speeckaert M.M. Coucke P.J. et al.Hypergastrinemia, a clue leading to the identification of a novel form of diabetes mellitus type 2.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2022; 532: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The patients presented with hyperproinsulinemia, hyperprogastrinemia, and developed early onset T2D. While genome wide association studies also support a role for GRK6 in T2D (https://t2d.hugeamp.org/. Accessed April 29, 2022), limited data exist defining the mechanism by which GRK6 contributes to β-cell function. To delineate the role of GRK6 in pancreatic β-cells, we performed GSIS assays in MIN6 cells devoid of GRK6 activity. Our results provide important insight on insulin processing that should aid in the advent of new strategies to treat T2D.ResultsGRK5/6 inhibition enhances insulin secretion but reduces insulin production in MIN6 cellsBased on the identification of a GRK6 mutation in two patients that have early onset T2D, we wanted to determine whether GRK6 has a role in insulin processing and secretion. To investigate this, we utilized MIN6 cells, a pancreatic β-cell line isolated from a mouse insulinoma that has been used extensively to study β-cell function (30Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K.

In these cells, we initially performed GSIS assays in the absence or presence of a 4-aminoquinazoline derivative called compound 19, a GRK inhibitor that was developed as a potential therapeutic to target GRK6 in multiple myeloma (31Uehling D.E. Joseph B. Chung K.C. Zhang A.X. Ler S.

The values at GRK5 and GRK6 for 19 are consistent with data previously generated at Eurofins (13 and 3.5 nM, respectively)). Compound 19 has a low nanomolar potency against GRK5 and GRK6 (IC50 values of 5.2 and 2.4 nM, respectively) but does not inhibit GRK2 or GRK3 (IC50 > 10 μM) (31Uehling D.E. Joseph B. Chung K.C.

We next did a time course of insulin secretion in MIN6 cells in 2 mM glucose with or without compound 19. In cells treated with compound 19, insulin secretion was increased significantly by 10 min compared to control treated cells (Fig. 1B). We also performed a dose response with compound 19 and found that increasing concentrations elicited more secretion with 0.1 to 1 μM having the most robust effect (Fig. 1C). Thus, these data support a role for GRK5 and/or GRK6 in insulin secretion.To compare insulin and proinsulin secretion, we performed GSIS assays at higher glucose concentrations since proinsulin secretion is generally shifted to the right in its glucose dose response compared to insulin (32Røder M.E. Porte Jr., D. Schwartz R.S. Kahn S.E. Disproportionately elevated proinsulin levels reflect the degree of impaired B cell secretory capacity in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We again observed the increase in insulin secretion with compound 19 treatment, although this effect was lost at 18 mM glucose (Fig. 2A). This is not surprising since high glucose concentrations can lead to impaired insulin secretion (33Leahy J.L. Cooper H.E. Deal D.A. Weir G.C. Chronic hyperglycemia is associated with impaired glucose influence on insulin secretion. A study in normal rats using chronic in vivo glucose infusions.J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 34Leahy J.L. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Beta-cell dysfunction induced by chronic hyperglycemia. Current ideas on mechanism of impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion.Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). While we expected to see a comparable increase in proinsulin secretion since the relative insulin to proinsulin composition from granule to granule is maintained (35Michael J. Carroll R. Swift H.H. Steiner D.F. Studies on the molecular organization of rat insulin secretory granules.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16531-16535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we did not observe a significant increase after compound 19 treatment (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the internal components comprising the secretory granule were being compromised since the relative level of proinsulin being secreted did not match that of insulin. We investigated this by examining the proinsulin/insulin (P/I) ratio by Western blot using antibodies that can detect both proinsulin (10 kDa) and insulin (6 kDa). This enabled us to examine the intracellular P/I ratio in MIN6 cells with or without compound 19 treatment. Interestingly, we identified a striking difference in the P/I ratio in MIN6 cells that shifted strongly in favor of proinsulin in the presence of compound 19 (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the cellular level of insulin was reduced dramatically in inhibitor-treated cells compared to control cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that GRK5 and/or GRK6 enhance insulin synthesis but have a negative impact on insulin secretion. This provides an interesting conundrum to better understand the role of these kinases on insulin dynamics.Figure 2GRK5/6 inhibition causes a shift in the proinsulin/insulin ratio. MIN6 cells were incubated in KRBH buffer with low glucose (0.01 mM) for 30 min to equilibrate insulin levels. The cells were then washed and incubated in KRBH buffer containing 0.01 to 18 mM glucose in the presence or absence of 1 μM compound 19 for 1 hour. The amount of secreted insulin (A) or proinsulin (B) was determined by ELISA as described in Experimental procedures. Statistical significance was determined using t tests. C, cells incubated for 1 h with glucose (0.01–10 mM) in the presence or absence of 1 μM compound 19 were washed with PBS, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-insulin mouse mAb that detects proinsulin and insulin. D, the intracellular levels of insulin were determined using ImageJ analysis of Western blots using an anti-insulin rabbit mAb and an insulin protein standard and were normalized to tubulin levels; statistical significance was determined using t tests.

Joseph B. Chung K.C. Zhang A.X. Ler S. Prakesch M.A. et al.Design, synthesis, and characterization of 4-aminoquinazolines as potent inhibitors of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) for the treatment of multiple myeloma.J. Med.

The values at GRK5 and GRK6 for 19 are consistent with data previously generated at Eurofins (13 and 3.5 nM, respectively)). To assess the specific role of GRK6, we used shRNA knockdown of GRK6 in MIN6 cells. We utilized five different lentiviral shRNA sequences, each targeting a different region of the GRK6 gene to generate stable cell lines. All five lines had reduced GRK6 expression (from ∼50% to 90%) compared to control shRNA treated cells while there was no appreciable effect on GRK5 expression (Fig. 3A).Figure 3GRK6 knockdown attenuates insulin processing and increases proinsulin secretion. A, MIN6 cells were infected with five different GRK6 shRNA lentiviral constructs targeting different regions of the gene for 48 h and clones established as described in Experimental procedures. The cells were then lysed and assayed by Western blot using GRK4-6 (top image) and GRK6 specific (middle image) antibodies to determine the extent of GRK6 knockdown. Nt-shRNA = nontargeting-shRNA.

There was a prominent shift in the P/I ratio favoring proinsulin in the two knockdown cell lines compared to control cells (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the cellular levels of insulin were severely attenuated at all glucose concentrations in both shRNA-2 and shRNA-5 cells compared to control cells (Fig. 3C). Specifically, insulin levels at 10 mM glucose were decreased by 62% and 85% in shRNA-2 and shRNA-5 cells, respectively. Next, we investigated how insulin secretion was affected by GRK6 knockdown. In shRNA-2 cells, insulin secretion was attenuated only at the lowest glucose concentration (Fig. 3D) while shRNA-5 cells had a significant reduction at the lowest and highest glucose concentrations (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, proinsulin secretion was significantly increased in shRNA-5 cells at higher glucose concentrations compared to control cells (Fig. 3F). The reduced insulin secretion and increased proinsulin secretion we see in these knockdown cells mirrors the intracellular changes we see in the proteins. These data support a role for GRK6 in insulin synthesis that ultimately contributes to secretion. Furthermore, the increased insulin secretion seen with compound 19 treatment (Fig. 1) might be due to inhibition of GRK5 or possibly other targets since this is not observed in the MIN6 cells with specific GRK6 knockdown.Effect of GRK6 knockdown on expression and activity of the prohormone converting enzymes PC1, PC2, and CPE in MIN6 cellsMetabolic hormones, including insulin, GLP-1, and glucagon, are made from the sequential cleavage of their respective prohormones by different combinations of the prohormone-converting enzymes and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (36Steiner D.F. The prohormone convertases and precursor processing in protein biosynthesis.Enzymes. 2002; 22: 163-198Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Insulin is produced in secretory vesicles by sequential cleavage of proinsulin by prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), and CPE (6Hou J.C. Min L. Pessin J.E.

Applying dynamic needle tip positioning (DNTP) that guides the catheter to position inside the vessel sufficiently may aid in successful cannulation.This prospective study enrolled patients aged over 70 years, who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia with arterial cannulation. The patients were randomly assigned to the DNTP (group D, n = 76) or the conventional short-axis view(group C, n = 75) group. The arterial depth, diameter, and arterial conditions(calcification, segmental stenosis, and tortuosity) were evaluated using ultrasound, before puncture. We recorded the first attempt success, cannulation time, the number of attempts, and cannulation-related complications.A total of 151 patients were enrolled in this study. The first attempt success rate in group D was significantly higher than that in group C (89% versus 72%; P = 0.0168). The median cannulation time per last attempt in group D versus group C was 25 versus 30 sec(P = 0.0001), and the overall cannulation time was 25 versus 35 sec(P = 0.0001), respectively. Arterial cannulation per last attempt and overall cannulation time were shorter in group D. The number of attempts was higher in group C (P = 0.0038). The occurrence rate of hematoma was significantly lower in group D (16% versus 47%, relative risk = 3.0, P = 0.0001).The DNTP method may improve the first attempt success rate of arterial cannulation and reduce complications in elderly patients over 70 years of age."

Several NNV strains are currently co-circulating in the Mediterranean Basin with a high prevalence of the RGNNV genotype and the RGNNV/SJNNV reassortant strain and a more limited diffusion of the SJNNV genotype and the SJNNV/RGNNV reassortant. In the present study, a one-step multiplex RT-PCR (mRT-PCR) assay was developed as an easy, cost-effective and rapid diagnostic technique to detect RGNNV and the reassortant RGNNV/SJNNV strain and to distinguish them from SJNNV and the reassortant SJNNV/RGNNV strain in a single RT-PCR reaction. A unique amplification profile was obtained for each genotype/reassortant enabling their rapid identification from cell culture lysates or directly from brain tissues of suspected fish. The method's detection limit varied between 102.3 and 103.4 TCID50 ml-1 depending on viral strains. No cross-reacitivty with viruses and bacteria frequently associated with gilthead seabream, European seabass and marine environment was observed. The mRT-PCR was shown to be an accurate, rapid and affordable method to support traditional diagnostic techniques in the diagnosis of VNN, being able to reduce considerably the time to identify the viral genotype or the involvement of reassortant strains."

The intervention package included a new training curriculum, enhanced staffing, revised management and supervisory structures, and more intensive monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). The goal was to strengthen OT and their impact on both primary healthcare and HIV-specific services. We conducted a process evaluation of this intervention package during its second year and examined implementation successes and challenges. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation at 20 purposively selected facilities in Bojanala and City of Tshwane districts, including surveys with 222 community health workers (CHWs) and outreach team leaders (OTLs); key informant interviews and online surveys with 28 policy and program stakeholders; 70 in-depth interviews with health facility staff; 20 focus group discussions with 194 CHWs; 20 structured health facility assessments; directly-observed time-motion studies; and review of program documents. Results Most participants highlighted the hiring and training of CHWs and OTLs as a key implementation success because this had partially alleviated staffing shortages and helped clarify CHWs’ and OTLs’ responsibilities and supervisory structures. The new monitoring tools were welcomed for their potential to improve data collection and program tracking. However, participants highlighted many program challenges: short-lived gains in CHWs’ knowledge and skills due to lack of ongoing training and mentoring; insufficient integration of OT into health facility management structures; persistent shortages of equipment, supplies, transportation, and workspace for CHWs; and insufficient remuneration for staff. Conclusion Strengthening and expanding CHW programs, such as OT, requires intensive support and continuous investments. To sustain improvements in training, supervision, and job satisfaction, CHWs must be equipped with needed resources, provided with ongoing supportive supervision, and strengthened by optimized program management, monitoring and processes."

Different types of drugs with various delivery systems and pathways were developed, but no one showed prominent results against cancer. Meanwhile, nanoparticles have shown good results against cancer. Therefore, in the given study, citrate mediated synthesized gold nanoparticles (CtGNPs) with immobilized survivin antibodies (SvGNPs) were bioconjugated to the substantially potent drug abiraterone (AbSvGNPs) to develop as a combinatorial therapeutic against prostate cancer. The AbSvGNPs are made up of CtGNPs, survivin antibodies, and abiraterone. The selected drug abiraterone (Abira) possesses exceptionally good activity against prostate cancer, but cancer cells develop resistance against this drug and it also poses several severe side effects. Meanwhile, survivin antibodies were used to deliver AbSvGNPs specifically into cancer cells by considering survivin, an anti-apoptotic overexpressed protein in cancer cells, as a marker. The survivin antibodies have also been used to inhibit cancer cells as an immunotherapeutic agent. Similarly, CtGNPs were discovered to inhibit cancer cell proliferation via several transduction pathways. The given bioconjugated nanoparticles (AbSvGNPs) were found to be substantially effective against prostate cancer with an IC50 of 11.8 and 7.3 μM against DU145 and PC-3 cells, respectively. However, it was found safe against NRK and showed less than 25% cytotoxicity up to 20μM concentration. The as-synthesized nanoparticles CtGNPs, SvGNPs, and AbSvGNPs were characterized by several physical techniques to confirm their synthesis, whereas the immobilization of survivin antibodies and bioconjugation of Abira was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy, DLS, TEM, FTIR, and zeta-potential. The anticancer potential of AbSvGNPs was determined by MTT, DAPI, ROS, MITO, TUNEL ASSAY, and caspase-3 activity against DU145 and PC3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W4293155673,"Introduction Literature is lacking on the safety of storing contaminated PPE in paper bags for reuse, potentially increasing exposure to frontline healthcare workers (HCW) and patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of paper bags as a barrier for fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by storing face masks, respirators, and face shields. Methods This quasi-experimental study evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the interior and exterior surfaces of paper bags containing PPE that had aerosolized exposures in clinical and simulated settings. Between May and October 2020, 30 unique PPE items were collected from COVID-19 units at two urban hospitals. Exposed PPE, worn by either an infected patient or HCW during a SARS-CoV-2 aerosolizing event, were placed into an unused paper bag. Samples were tested at 30-minute and 12-hour intervals. Results A total of 177 swabs were processed from 30 PPE samples. We found a 6.8% positivity rate among all samples across both collection sites. Highest positivity rates were associated with ventilator disconnection and exposure to respiratory droplets from coughing. Positivity rates differed between hospital units. Total positivity rates were similar between 30-minute (6.7%) and 12-hour (6.9%) sample testing time intervals. Control samples exposed to inactivated SARS-CoV-2 droplets had higher total viral counts than samples exposed to nebulized aerosols. Conclusions Data suggests paper bags are not a significant fomite risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, controls demonstrated a risk with droplet exposure. Data can inform guidelines for storing and re-using PPE in situations of limited supplies during future pandemics."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gross lesions and practices related to sub-optimal welfare in pigs presented for slaughter while analyzing the relationship between occurrence of these lesions and meat quality. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a medium scale, non-integrated pig abattoir supplying to the Nairobi market, with a capacity to slaughter approximately 40 pigs a day. Data on welfare-associated lesions and handling practices were obtained from 529 pig carcasses and traders respectively. 387 pork samples were collected, and their quality evaluated by measuring their pH, meat color and drip loss. These three parameters were used to classify pork into four recognized categories namely: Red, Firm, Non-exudative (RFN), Pale Soft Exudative (PSE), Dark Firm Dry (DFD) and Red Soft Exudative (RSE). Almost all pigs were inefficiently stunned as evidenced by the presence of consciousness post-stunning. The majority of pigs (82.97%) having one or more welfare-associated gross lesions. Other animal welfare malpractices observed were high loading density and inadequate rest periods between transport and slaughter. A quarter of the pork samples were of sub-optimal quality including: RSE (11.36%), PSE (2.58%) and DFD (2.58%). Multinomial logistic regression revealed that pork originating from pigs transported at a high loading density had increased odds of being classified as DFD (OR 13.41, 95% CI 2.59–69.46). The findings indicate the need to educate stakeholders in the pork value chains on improved pig handling before and during slaughter to enhance pig welfare pre-slaughter and pork quality post-slaughter. Animal welfare legislation enforcement and implementation was observed to be insufficient. There is a need to educate key stakeholders on its importance of being put into practice both from economic and welfare perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4293677567,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO), oxidative stress (OS), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the lungs of rat pups raised in hyperoxia, an established model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, the relationship between OS, MPO, and ER stress has not been examined in hyperoxia rat pups. We treated Sprague-Dawley rat pups with tunicamycin or hyperoxia to determine this relationship. ER stress was detected using immunofluorescence, transcriptomic, proteomic, and electron microscopic analyses. Immunofluorescence observed increased ER stress in the lungs of hyperoxic rat BPD and human BPD. Proteomic and morphometric studies showed that tunicamycin directly increased ER stress of rat lungs and decreased lung complexity with a BPD phenotype. Previously, we showed that hyperoxia initiates a cycle of destruction that we hypothesized starts from increasing OS through MPO accumulation and then increases ER stress to cause BPD. To inhibit ER stress, we used tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a molecular chaperone. To break the cycle of destruction and reduce OS and MPO, we used N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC). The fact that TUDCA improved lung complexity in tunicamycin- and hyperoxia-treated rat pups supports the idea that ER stress plays a causal role in BPD. Additional support comes from data showing TUDCA decreased lung myeloid cells and MPO levels in the lungs of tunicamycin- and hyperoxia-treated rat pups. These data link OS and MPO to ER stress in the mechanisms mediating BPD. KYC’s inhibition of ER stress in the tunicamycin-treated rat pup’s lung provides additional support for the idea that MPO-induced ER stress plays a causal role in the BPD phenotype. ER stress appears to expand our proposed cycle of destruction . Our results suggest ER stress evolves from OS and MPO to increase neonatal lung injury and impair growth and development. The encouraging effect of TUDCA indicates that this compound has the potential for treating BPD."

Mentored clinical practice in musculoskeletal physiotherapy resulted in clinically significant improvements in both physiotherapist performance and patient outcomes. The objectives of this study were to explore mentor and mentee perceptions of a mentored clinical practice programme, in order to identify key factors in the process to improve patient outcomes.Employing a case study design of a mentoring programme that led to improved patient outcomes, mentored clinical practice was explored from multiple perspectives using a grounded theory strategy of enquiry to derive a theory of mentored clinical practice grounded in the views of the participants. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of mentors and mentees were employed along with qualitative observations of mentored clinical practice. Data analysis and collection were concurrent, with analysis an iterative process deriving inductive analytical categories from the data through constant comparison.Highly informative themes of how the complex interaction between mentor, mentee, patient and environment worked successfully were identified from the data. The mentors' knowledge, additional perspectives, critical analysis and facilitatory style were enabling factors, as were mentees' motivation, openness to criticism and commitment to reflect on practice. Themes around potential threats to the mentees' development were also identified. Overloading or contradictory feedback and lack of relationship with mentees were barriers that mentors could bring; fear, defensiveness, routine working, people-pleasing and lack of experience were potential mentee barriers. A model emerges from the data demonstrating how these themes interact, providing guidance to mentors and mentees to optimise the effectiveness of mentored clinical practice.This study provides a sound basis for future mentored clinical practice, producing a model from key themes from a case study where impact on clinician performance and patient outcomes are established."
https://openalex.org/W4293150380,"Conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) is a remarkably successful paradigm for solving the satisfiability problem of propositional logic. Instead of a simple depth-first backtracking approach, this kind of solver learns the reason behind occurring conflicts in the form of additional clauses. However, despite the enormous success of CDCL solvers, there is still only a limited understanding of what influences the performance of these solvers in what way. Considering different measures, this paper demonstrates, quite surprisingly, that clause learning (without being able to get rid of some clauses) can not only help the solver but can oftentimes deteriorate the solution process dramatically. By conducting extensive empirical analysis, we furthermore find that the runtime distributions of CDCL solvers are multimodal. This multimodality can be seen as a reason for the deterioration phenomenon described above. Simultaneously, it also gives an indication of why clause learning in combination with clause deletion is virtually the de facto standard of SAT solving, in spite of this phenomenon. As a final contribution, we show that Weibull mixture distributions can accurately describe the multimodal distributions. Thus, adding new clauses to a base instance has an inherent effect of making runtimes long-tailed. This insight provides an explanation as to why the technique of forgetting clauses is useful in CDCL solvers apart from the optimization of unit propagation speed."

In the present study, we studied the mediation role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU; a personality measure of self-uncertainty) in the effect of SES on religiousness and its dimensions (i.e., believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging), in two different samples (students sample, N = 868, and community sample, N = 250), after controlling the effects of factors like age, sex, handedness, and self-reported risk-taking. The results showed that IU mediated the effects of lower family income and lower caste status (in students' sample only) on religiousness and its dimensions; higher caste status had a direct effect on religiousness (and its dimensions), and; among the sub-factors of IU, only prospective IU affected religiousness. Thus, along with showing that IU is a mediator of the effects of lower family income and lower caste status on religiousness, the present study supports the contention that religiousness is a latent variable that varied factors can independently initiate. Moreover, the present study suggests a nuanced model of the relationship between the hierarchical caste system and religiousness."

PitNET patients were recruited to the study before PitNET removal surgery. For each patient, two samples for DNA extraction were acquired: venous blood and PitNET tissue. Exome sequencing was performed using Illumina NexSeq 500 sequencer and data analyzed using two separate workflows and variant calling algorithms: GATK and Strelka2. A combination of two data analysis pipelines discovered 144 PitNET specific somatic variants (mean = 9.6, range 0-19 per PitNET) of which all were SNVs. Also, we detected previously known GNAS PitNET mutation and identified somatic variants in 11 genes, which have contained somatic variants in previous WES and WGS studies of PitNETs. Noteworthy, this is the third study detecting somatic variants in gene RYR1 in the exomes of PitNETs. In conclusion, we have identified two novel PitNET candidate genes (AC002519.6 and AHNAK) with recurrent somatic variants in our PitNET cohort and found 13 genes overlapping from previous PitNET studies that contain somatic variants.

Cases were defined as children having rotavirus isolated in stool specimens presented with dehydrating diarrhea. Controls were children infected with rotavirus have no dehydration. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify the factors associated with dehydrating diarrhea.Among the rotavirus-infected children, 1,784 (34%) in Dhaka and 160 (6%) in Matlab had diarrhea with some or severe dehydration. The female children and age group 24-59 months age was found to be at higher risk of dehydration compared to 6-11 months age. In the multivariable logistic regression model, maternal illiteracy, vomiting, the onset of diarrhea less than 24 hours prior to presenting to the hospital, monsoon months, stunting, and wasting were significantly associated with dehydrating rotavirus diarrhea among children aged 0-59 months in Dhaka. In Matlab, monthly income, duration less than 24 hours prior to attending the hospital, and wasting had an independent significant association with dehydrating rotavirus diarrhea episodes.Considering factors diversity, educating parents and proper counselling by health care personnel during diarrhea, could lessen the severity of dehydration and the number of hospital visits later on by eliminating the modifiable risk factors among the children, which needs further studies."

Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analyses were carried out on entire tubes as well as sectioned ones. Results show that arenaceous tubes are built following a rigorous architectural framework, based on selection and methodical arrangement of the agglutinated grains, and show surprising analogies with the test microstructure previously observed in agglutinated foraminifera. The grain distribution detected in both model species bioconstructions was analysed using a fractal numerical model (Hausdorff fractal dimension). Collected data show that in both organisms the grains were distributed according to a fractal model, indicating that the evolutionary process may have led to finding the same optimal constructive strategy across organisms with an independent evolutionary history, notwithstanding different geometrical scales. Furthermore, in sectioned tubes we observed microplastic fragments agglutinated within the arenaceous wall and in the inter-tube area. This unexpected finding shows that marine animals can be affected by microplastic pollution not only in soft tissues, but also engineered hard structures, and suggests the problem is more pervasive than estimated so far."

This research protocol has been designed to conduct a systematic review of the existing evidence on the association between non-acute TI and HRV in adults. Four electronic bibliographic databases (Web of Science, CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus) will be searched. The studies on non-acute (>7 days post injury) TI and HRV in adults will be included, followed by title-abstract screening by two reviewers independently. The quality and risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed using Axis and a six-item Risk of Bias Assessment tool for of Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS) respectively. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will assess the quality of evidence. The extracted data will be synthesized using narrative syntheses and a Forest plot with or without meta-analysis- whichever permitted by the pooled data. This will be the first systematic review to examine the relationship between generalized TI and HRV in adults.

https://openalex.org/W4293155645,"Graph embedding approaches have been attracting increasing attention in recent years mainly due to their universal applicability. They convert network data into a vector space in which the graph structural information and properties are maximumly preserved. Most existing approaches, however, ignore the rich information about interactions between nodes, i.e., edge attribute or edge type. Moreover, the learned embeddings suffer from a lack of explainability, and cannot be used to study the effects of typed structures in edge-attributed networks. In this paper, we introduce a framework to embed edge type information in graphlets and generate a Typed-Edge Graphlets Degree Vector (TyE-GDV). Additionally, we extend two combinatorial approaches, i.e., the colored graphlets and heterogeneous graphlets approaches to edge-attributed networks. Through applying the proposed method to a case study of chronic pain patients, we find that not only the network structure of a patient could indicate his/her perceived pain grade, but also certain social ties, such as those with friends, colleagues, and healthcare professionals, are more crucial in understanding the impact of chronic pain. Further, we demonstrate that in a node classification task, the edge-type encoded graphlets approaches outperform the traditional graphlet degree vector approach by a significant margin, and that TyE-GDV could achieve a competitive performance of the combinatorial approaches while being far more efficient in space requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4293155761,"Peer review, commonly used in grant funding decisions, relies on scientists' ability to evaluate research proposals' quality. Such judgments are sometimes beyond reviewers' discriminatory power and could lead to a reliance on subjective biases, including preferences for lower risk, incremental projects. However, peer reviewers' risk tolerance has not been well studied. We conducted a cross-sectional experiment of peer reviewers' evaluations of mock primary reviewers' comments in which the level and sources of risks and weaknesses were manipulated. Here we show that proposal risks more strongly predicted reviewers' scores than proposal strengths based on mock proposal evaluations. Risk tolerance was not predictive of scores but reviewer scoring leniency was predictive of overall and criteria scores. The evaluation of risks dominates reviewers' evaluation of research proposals and is a source of inter-reviewer variability. These results suggest that reviewer scoring variability may be attributed to the interpretation of proposal risks, and could benefit from intervention to improve the reliability of reviews. Additionally, the valuation of risk drives proposal evaluations and may reduce the chances that risky, but highly impactful science, is supported."
https://openalex.org/W4293765321,"The apical junctional complex (AJC) consists of adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions and regulates epithelial integrity and remodeling. However, it is unclear how AJC organization is regulated based on environmental cues. We found here using cultured EpH4 mouse mammary epithelial cells that fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a culture medium showed an activity to promote AJC organization and that FBS showed an activity to promote tight junction formation even in the absence of AJ proteins, such as E-cadherin, αE-catenin, and afadin. Furthermore, we purified the individual factor responsible for these functions from FBS and identified this molecule as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In validation experiments, purified LPA elicited the same activity as FBS. In addition, we found that the AJC organization-promoting activity of LPA was mediated through the LPA receptor 1/5 via diacylglycerol-novel PKC and Rho-ROCK pathway activation in a mutually independent, but complementary, manner. We demonstrated that the Rho-ROCK pathway activation-mediated AJC organization was independent of myosin II-induced actomyosin contraction, although this signaling pathway was previously shown to induce myosin II activation. These findings are in contrast to the literature, as previous results suggested an AJC organization-disrupting activity of LPA. The present results indicate that LPA in serum has an AJC organization-promoting activity in a manner dependent on or independent of AJ proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4293865805,"Alix is a ubiquitously expressed scaffold protein that participates in numerous cellular processes related to the remodeling/repair of membranes and the actin cytoskeleton. Alix exists in monomeric and dimeric/multimeric configurations, but how dimer formation occurs and what role the dimer has in Alix-mediated processes are still largely elusive. Here, we reveal a mechanism for Alix homodimerization mediated by disulfide bonds under physiological conditions and demonstrate that the Alix dimer is enriched in exosomes and F-actin cytoskeleton subcellular fractions. Proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from Alix-/- primary cells underlined the indispensable role of Alix in loading syntenin into exosomes, thereby regulating the cellular levels of this protein. Using a set of deletion mutants, we define the function of Alix Bro1 domain, which is solely required for its exosomal localization, and that of the V domain, which is needed for recruiting syntenin into exosomes. We reveal an essential role for Cys814 within the disordered proline-rich domain for Alix dimerization. By mutating this residue, we show that Alix remains exclusively monomeric and, in this configuration, is effective in loading syntenin into exosomes. In contrast, loss of dimerization affects the ability of Alix to associate with F-actin, thereby compromising Alix-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling. We propose that dimeric and monomeric forms of Alix selectively execute two of the protein's main functions: exosomal cargo loading and cytoskeleton remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W4293149977,"Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), an important agricultural and nuisance pest, is highly invasive with peculiar hiding behavior in human-made structures for overwintering. To evaluate the contamination risk of overwintering H . halys in non-agricultural export goods, we conducted a two-year field survey in Republic of Korea to locate overwintering H . halys in two major ports of export, Ulsan and Pyeongtaek ports, and monitored both active and overwintering H . halys population levels with varying distances from the ports ranging from 1 km to 48 km. First, we deployed wooden shelters in the two ports to catch dispersing H . halys for overwintering and conducted visual inspections for human-made structures in the ports to locate overwintering H . halys . In addition, we sampled dead trees to find overwintering H . halys in wooded areas. Second, we monitored active H . halys populations using pheromone traps with varying distances from the ports. From the survey of overwintering populations, no H . halys was collected from wooden shelters deployed in the two ports. However, we found four adults overwintering in human-made structures in Pyeongtaek port in the first year of survey. One dead adult was also found from a dead tree located in a wooded area adjacent to Pyeongtaek port in the second year. For active populations, results of pheromone trapping indicated that H . halys populations were present during autumn dispersal period not only in agricultural areas, but also in wooded areas adjacent to the two ports. This study reports for the first time that overwintering H . halys were found from the inside the port of export in its native areas with a low density. The results were discussed for evaluating contamination risk of overwintering H . halys in export goods shipping from the Republic of Korea."
https://openalex.org/W4293150269,"The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate a novel plate designed specifically for the canine ilium using finite element methods. The cranial portion of the plate had an elliptical shape and contained nine screw holes. The caudal portion of the plate was triangular with three screw holes. Four and three screws were used at the cranial (screw 1 to 4) and caudal (screw 5 to 7) segment of the plate. Finite element models of the plate and canine pelvis were created. A load of 300 N was applied on the femur-hip joint contact area. Values of Von Mises Stress on the plate, screws and the maximum and minimum main stresses in the bone were used to capture the mechanical factors in this study.The novel implant had a plate stress of 51.9 megapascals (MPa) with higher stress in the dorsal part of the plate. Screws 2 and 4 showed similar stress values of 17.3 MPa. Screws 1 and 3 were the most loaded (51.9 MPa and 75 MPa, respectively). Screws 5, 6, and 7 showed similar dissipation and stress values (21.55 MPa). There was traction force in the dorsal region of the pubis and compression in the ventral part, with dissipation and values of 15.4 MPa and 23.9 MPa, respectively, acquiring balance between them.The novel plate is potentially applicable and specifically suitable for iliac fractures in dogs. The screws distribution modeled proved itself strategical since the simulated stresses were evenly distributed throughout the implant construct."
https://openalex.org/W4293155365,"To study the effects of different regeneration methods on the growth and bacterial community diversity of Populus × euramericana cv. '74/76' (poplar 107), we investigated the growth of poplar 107 trees under three regeneration methods in 2017 and 2020, and sequenced the 16S rDNA V5-V7 regions in stem endophytic, root endophytic, and rhizosphere soil bacteria present in samples from the three regeneration methods using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. The growth analysis showed that stump grafting regeneration (ST) and stump sprouting regeneration (SP) presented similar tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH), which were significantly lower by planted seedling regeneration (CK). The high-throughput sequencing results showed that the rhizosphere soil bacteria appeared to be significantly more diverse and rich than the root and stem endophytic bacteria. Cluster analysis showed that the similarity of bacterial community structure among the rhizosphere soil, root, and stem was small. Thus, the three sample types showed significant differences in bacteria. While comparing the two years, 2020 was significantly more diverse and rich than 2017. With the increase in stand age, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased and the abundance of Acidobacteria decreased. Among the three regeneration methods, ST significantly increased the diversity of stem endophytic bacteria. Chthoniobacter was enriched in SP, which promoted the decomposition of organic matter, and more plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were accumulated in the rhizosphere of SP and ST. The composition of the bacterial community was similar in the three regeneration methods, but the community composition was different. Regeneration and transformation of poplar plantations can be better carried out by stump grafting and stump sprouting."
https://openalex.org/W4293155416,"Research of the marine environment is still a huge challenge for humanity. Each survey campaign is a complex project, where research vessels and relevant survey equipment is used. One of the problems that limit the success of working at sea are failures of survey equipment. The aim of this paper was to identify the most common survey equipment failures during marine research, find their causes and analyze identified risks. The authors employ risk assessment methodology in maritime research at sea and present its practical utility and contribution in social and organizational development. For this purpose we based the analysis on the review of relevant project documentation (Daily Progress Reports, Observation Cards) and the questionnaire addressed to specialists who carry out their survey work on board research vessels and also people involved in the implementation of offshore projects. The research reveals that 76.3% respondents participated in a project which had to be stopped due to a failure of the survey equipment that required return to the port which highlights that the problem which was analyzed is of particular importance. The questionnaire form was designed to obtain as much information as possible on the types of failures with examples and also their causes according to three groups: human factors, technical factors and forces of nature. Twelve risks were identified and analyzed. The authors also stress the relationship between the quality of research project management and its implementation in the context of the failure rate of measuring equipment."
https://openalex.org/W4293155457,"Background The resistance to insecticides among malaria vectors poses a global challenge in the efforts towards malaria elimination. This calls for an addition of larval control methods such as biolarviciding. However, the implementation of biolarviciding in Tanzania has been very low. Therefore, this study explored factors affecting the implementation of biolarviciding in the councils of Southern Tanzania. Methods A mixed method descriptive qualitative, cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from 32 community leaders through key informant interviews and 12 Vectors Control Coordinators through in-depth interviews and questionnaire interviews and document review of implementation reports in 12 councils. Data were analysed using ATLAS.ti version 8, where content analysis was performed and SPSS for the quantitative data. Results The study found low implementation of biolarviciding intervention in 9 out of 12 (75%) surveyed councils. All Vector Control Coordinators reported a shortage of at least one type of resources: funds, trained personnel, transport, supply of biolarvicide, and equipment; low community involvement (50%) and low level of community participation 83.3% (10/12). Conclusion This study highlights resource inadequacy and low community participation as main barriers to the implementation of biolarviciding. Availing adequate resources and strengthening community participation through involvement in all stages of implementation is crucial for successful and sustainable implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4293155462,"Background As a country’s future leaders and pioneers, University students must live with healthy habits. In order to achieve a healthy lifestyle, Physical activity and Quality of Life can serve as suitable indices to study. The purpose of the study was to clarify how physical activity (PA), Body mass index (BMI) and gender relate to the quality of life (QOL) of students of Medical Sciences University by using a structural equation model. Methods The research was a cross-sectional study. The number of participants was 225 students of the University. The participants answered three questionnaires, including Demographic, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short form), and Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-12), BMI was calculated by anthropometric measures, as well. The Structural equation model (SEM) method was employed. The Fitness of the proposed pattern was measured using the following indexes: chi-square/degree of freedom ratio (CMIN/DF), Normed Fit Index (NFI), comparative fit index (CFI), the goodness of fit index (GFI), and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR). In the analysis the significant level was considered as P &lt; 0.05. Results PA (r = -0.726, P&lt;0.001) and QOL (r = -0.405, P&lt;0.001) have significantly inverse relationship with BMI, whereas the QOL and PA were proven to be positively related (r = 0.357, P&lt;0.001). Moreover, the results signify gender as a moderator in the relationship between PA and QOL (Δχ 2 (10) = 19.903, P = 0.030) and also the mediatory role of BMI among students. BMI affects the QOL in men (P &lt; 0.001, β = -0.307) more in compare to women women (P = 0.324, β = -0.158). Conclusion Study findings supported the research hypothesis. Gender exhibited moderating role in the relationship between PA and QOL, considering the mediating role of BMI."
https://openalex.org/W4293155502,"Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected countries around the world since 2020, and an increasing number of people are being infected. The purpose of this research was to use big data and artificial intelligence technology to find key factors associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The results can be used as a reference for disease prevention in practice. Methods This study obtained data from the ""Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Open Data Hub"", covering a total of 291,780 questionnaire results from 28 countries (April 1~August 31, 2020). Data included basic characteristics, lifestyle habits, disease history, and symptoms of each subject. Four types of machine learning classification models were used, including logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, to build prediction modules. The performance of each module is presented as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Then, this study further processed important factors selected by each module to obtain an overall ranking of determinants. Results This study found that the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the prediction modules established by the four machine learning methods were all &gt;0.95, and the RF had the highest performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve is 0.988). Top ten factors associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 infection were identified in order of importance: whether the family had been tested, having no symptoms, loss of smell, loss of taste, a history of epilepsy, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cystic fibrosis, sleeping alone, country, and the number of times leaving home in a day. Conclusions This study used big data from 28 countries and artificial intelligence methods to determine the predictors of the coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The findings provide important insights for the coronavirus disease 2019 infection prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4293155517,"The uncertainties of four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), also called as residual motion artefacts (RMA), induced from irregular respiratory patterns can degrade the quality of overall radiotherapy. This study aims to quantify and reduce those uncertainties. A comparative study on quantitative indicators for RMA was performed, and based on this, we proposed a new 4DCT sorting method that is applicable without disrupting the current clinical workflow. In addition to the default phase sorting strategy, both additional amplitude information from external surrogates and the quantitative metric for RMA, investigated in this study, were introduced. The comparison of quantitative indicators and the performance of the proposed sorting method were evaluated via 10 cases of breath-hold (BH) CT and 30 cases of 4DCT. It was confirmed that N-RMSD (normalised root-mean-square-deviation) was best matched to the visual standards of our institute’s regime, manual sorting method, and could accurately represent RMA. The performance of the proposed method to reduce 4DCT uncertainties was improved by about 18.8% in the averaged value of N-RMSD compared to the default phase sorting method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates RMA indicators using both BHCT and 4DCT with visual-criteria-based manual sorting and proposes an improved 4DCT sorting strategy based on them."
https://openalex.org/W4293155537,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most dangerous tick-borne viral pathogens for humans. It can cause severe tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), multiple neurological complications, and death. The European subtype (TBEV-Eu), Siberian subtype (TBEV-Sib), and Far-Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE) are three main TBEV subtypes, causing varying clinical manifestations. Though TBEV-FE is the most virulent TBEV subtype, the degree of variation in the amino acid sequence of TBEV polyprotein is not high, leaving an issue without proper explanation. We performed phylogenic analysis on 243 TBEV strains and then took Senzhang strain as a query strain and representative strains of three major TBEV subtypes as reference strains to perform the comparative genomic analysis, including synteny analysis, SNP analysis, InDel analysis, and multiple sequence alignment of their envelope (E) proteins. The results demonstrated that insertions or deletions of large fragments occurred at the 3’ end but not at the 5’ end or in the CDS region of TBEV Senzhang strain. In addition, SNP sites are mainly located in the CDS region, with few SNP sites in the non-coding region. Our data highlighted the insertions or deletions of large fragments at the 3’ end and SNP sites in the CDS region as genomic properties of the TBEV Senzhang strain compared to representative strains with the main subtypes. These features are probably related to the virulence of the TBEV Senzhang strain and could be considered in future vaccine development and drug target screening for TBEV."
https://openalex.org/W4293155543,"Pistil abortions of flower buds occur frequently in many apricot cultivars, especially in long branches. However, the molecular mechanism underlying pistil abortion in apricots remains unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanism of pistil abortions between long branches and spur twigs, paraffin sections and high-throughput sequencing technology were employed to analyze the expression patterns of genes associated with pistil abortions during later flower bud development stage in 'Shajinhong' apricot. The result of stage III (separation of bud scales) was the critical stage of pistil abortion in apricots. A total of 163 differentially expressed genes were identified as candidate genes related to pistil abortion in long branches. These genes are implicated in programmed cell death, hormone signaling, cell wall degeneration, and the carbohydrate metabolism pathway. The results showed that the up-regulation of gene expression of Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase and β-glucosidase in flower buds might be the direct cause of cell wall breakdown and pistil necrosis in long branches. We hypothesize that there is a molecular relationship between pistil abortion before blooming and cellulose degradation, and then carbohydrate transport in the case of carbon deficiency in long branches. Our work provides new insights into cellulose degradation in abortion pistils and valuable information on flower development in apricots, and also provides a useful reference for cultivation regulation in apricot or other fruit crops."
https://openalex.org/W4293155545,"In the Columbia River Basin (CRB), USA, anthropogenic factors ranging from dam construction to land use changes have modified riverine flow and temperature regimes and degraded salmon habitat. These factors are directly implicated in native salmon and steelhead ( Oncorhynchus species) population declines and also indirectly cause mortality by altering outcomes of ecological interactions. For example, attenuated flows and warmer water temperatures drive increased parasite densities and in turn, overwhelm salmonid resistance thresholds, resulting in high disease and mortality. Outcomes of interactions between the freshwater myxozoan parasite, Ceratonova shasta , and its salmonid hosts (e.g., coho O . kisutch and Chinook salmon O . tshawytscha ) are well-described, but less is known about effects on chum salmon O . keta , which have a comparatively brief freshwater residency. The goal of this study was to describe the distribution of C . shasta relative to chum salmon habitat in the CRB and assess its potential to cause mortality in juvenile chum salmon (listed as threatened in the CRB under the U.S. Endangered Species Act). We measured C . shasta densities in water samples collected from chum salmon habitat throughout the lower CRB during the period of juvenile chum salmon outmigration, 2018–2020. In 2019, we exposed caged chum salmon fry from two hatchery stocks at three C . shasta -positive sites to assess infection prevalence and survival. Results demonstrated: (1) C . shasta was detected in spawning streams from which chum salmon have been extirpated but was not detected in contemporary spawning habitat while juvenile chum salmon were present, (2) spatiotemporal overlap occurs between C . shasta and juvenile chum salmon in the Columbia River mainstem, and (3) low densities of C . shasta caused lethal infection in chum salmon fry from both hatchery stocks. Collectively, our results suggest C . shasta may limit recovery of chum salmon now and in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293155562,"Radiotherapy as an anti-tumor treatment can stimulate the immune system. However, irradiated tumor cells express CD47 to escape the anti-tumor immune response. Anti- CD47 Immunotherapy is a possible way to tackle this problem. This study evaluated the effect of single high dose radiotherapy combined with an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (αCD47 mAb) in CT26 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. We assessed the tumors volume and survival in mice 60 days after tumor implantation. Also, immune cell changes were analyzed by flow cytometry in tumors, lymph nodes, and spleen. Combination therapy enhanced the anti-tumor response in treated mice by increasing CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages and decreasing M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Also, our results showed that combination therapy increased survival time in mice compared to other groups. Furthermore, tumor volumes remarkably decreased in mice that received a single high dose RT plus αCD47 mAb. In conclusion, we showed that combining RT and αCD47 mAb improved the immune cell population in TME, regressed tumor growth, and increased survival in tumor-bearing mice."
https://openalex.org/W4293155590,"Background While Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have poorer cancer survival than other Australians, absolute measures of survival disparities are lacking. This study quantified crude probabilities of deaths from cancer and other causes and estimated the number of avoidable deaths for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders if these survival disparities were removed. Methods Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate reported measures for a population-based cohort of 709,239 Australians (12,830 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples), 2005–2016. Results Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the 5-year crude probability of cancer death was 0.44, while it was 0.07 for other causes of death. These probabilities were 0.07 and 0.03 higher than among other Australians, respectively. Magnitude of these disparities varied by cancer type and ranged for cancer deaths from &lt;0.05 for pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers to 0.20 for cervical and head and neck cancers. Values for disparity in other causes of death were generally lower. Among an average cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples diagnosed per year over the most recent five-year diagnosis period (2012–2016, n = 1,269), approximately 133 deaths within 5 years of diagnosis were potentially avoidable if they had the same overall survival as other Australians, with 94 of these deaths due to cancer. The total number of avoided deaths over the entire study period (2005–2016) was 1,348, with 947 of these deaths due to cancer. Conclusions Study findings suggest the need to reduce the prevalence of risk factors prevalence, increase screening participation, and improve early detection, diagnosis and treatment rates to achieve more equitable outcomes for a range of cancer types. Reported measures provide unique insights into the impact of a cancer diagnosis among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from a different perspective to standard relative survival measures."
https://openalex.org/W4293155597,"Background Blood borne viral infections such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Viral hepatitis during pregnancy is closely related to high risks of maternal and neonatal complications. In Ethiopia, only a little information is available on co-infection of HCV or HIV among Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) positive pregnant mothers. Thus, the study aimed to determine HIV or HCV co-infection and associated risk factors among HBsAg positive delivering mothers. Method A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in five governmental hospitals in Addis Ababa among 265 HBsAg positive delivering mothers in the year 2019 and 2020. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Structured questionnaires and laboratory test results were used to collect the data. SPSS version 20 software was used to enter and analyze the data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HIV or HCV co-infections. Results Of the HBsAg positive delivering mothers, 9 (3.4%) and 3 (1.1%) were co-infected with HIV and HCV, respectively. None of them were with triplex infection. All of the socio-demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with both HIV and HCV co-infections. Mothers who had a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were 9.3 times more likely to have HBV-HIV co-infection (AOR = 9.3; 95% CI: 1.84–47.1). Mothers who had multiple sexual partners were 5.96 times more likely to have HIV co-infection (AOR = 5.96; 95% CI: 1.074–33.104). The odds of having HBV-HIV co-infection were 5.5 times higher among mothers who had a history of sharing shavers, razors, and earrings (AOR = 5.5;95% CI: 1.014–29.69). HCV co-infection was not significantly associated with any of the potential risk factors. Conclusion This dual infection rate of HBsAg positive delivering mother with HIV or HCV indicates that a substantial number of infants born in Ethiopia are at high risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV, HIV, and HCV. Thus, all pregnant mothers need to be screened for HBV, HCV, and HIV during antenatal care, and also need implementation of prevention mechanisms of MTCT of these viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W4293155601,"Background The routine vaccination card is an important health record for children, but recent findings suggest that vaccination card retention in Cameroon is low, varying from 29%-53%. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with children’s routine vaccination card retention in Cameroon. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Yaoundé in November 2021, targeting children aged 0–59 months. Participants were selected using a 2-stage systematic cluster sampling in which households were selected by a restricted sampling technique. Data were collected by interviewing the children’s parents/guardians, and a vaccination card was said to be retained if it was presented to the interviewer by the interviewees. Data were analysed using multiple logistics regression with R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18). Findings A total of 529 households were assessed with 361 children aged 0–59 months enrolled: 51% girls and 49% boys. Children aged 0–11 months represented 24.4% of all participants, and children aged 12–59 months were 74.6%. Vaccination card retention was 24% (87), and positive predictors of card retention included: girl child (adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.34, p-value = 0.0269), the respondent being one of the biological parents of the child: mother (adjusted Odds Ratio = 5.97, p-value = 0.0034) or father(adjusted Odds Ratio = 4.69, p-value = 0.0067), and living in a richer household (adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.56, p-value = 0.038). On the other hand, negative predictors of card retention were: child aged 12–23 months (adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.44, p-value = 0.0209) or aged 24-59months (adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.13, p-value = 0.0000), and having an employed mother (adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.34, p-value = 0.0066). Conclusion Vaccination card retention in children aged 0–59 months in Yaoundé is low when compared with findings reported by studies from other locations in Cameroon. Besides, the poor and older children have lower odds of keeping routine vaccination cards. There is a need to design interventions to improve vaccination card retention, which considers household wealth and the age of the child."
https://openalex.org/W4293155612,"We demonstrate contributions of top-down and bottom-up influences in perception as explored by priming and counts of perceived reversals and mixed percepts, as probed by an ambiguously slanted structure-from-motion (SFM) test-cylinder. We included three different disambiguated primes: a SFM cylinder, a still image of a cylinder, and an imagined cylinder. In Experiment 1 where the prime and test sequentially occupied the same location, we also administered questionnaires with the Big-5 trait openness and vividness of visual imagery to probe possible relations to top-down driven priming. Since influences of gaze or position in the prime conditions in Experiment 1 could not be ruled out completely, Experiment 2 was conducted where the test cylinder appeared at a randomly chosen position after the prime. In Experiment 2 we also measured the number of perceptual reversals and mixed percepts during prolonged viewing of our ambiguous SFM-cylinder, and administered questionnaires to measure all Big-5 traits, autism, spatial and object imagery, and rational or experiential cognitive styles, associated with bottom-up and top-down processes. The results revealed contributions of position-invariant and cue-invariant priming. In addition, residual contributions of low-level priming was found when the prime and test were both defined by SFM, and were presented at the same location, and the correlation between the SFM priming and the other two priming conditions were weaker than between the pictorial and imagery priming. As previously found with ambiguous binocular rivalry stimuli, we found positive correlations between mixed percepts and the Big-5 dimension openness to experience, and between reversals, mixed percepts and neuroticism. Surprisingly, no correlations between the scores from the vividness of imagery questionnaires and influence from any of the primes were obtained. An intriguing finding was the significant differences between the positive correlation from the experiential cognitive style scores, and the negative correlation between rational style and the cue invariant priming. Among other results, negative correlations between agreeableness and all priming conditions were obtained. These results not only support the notion of multiple processes involved in the perception of ambiguous SFM, but also link these processes in perception to specific personality traits."
https://openalex.org/W4293155617,"Functional integration between two hemispheres is crucial for perceptual binding to occur when visual stimuli are presented in the midline of the visual field. Mima and colleagues (2001) showed using EEG that midline object recognition was associated with task-related decrease in alpha band power (alpha desynchronisation) and a transient increase in interhemispheric coherence. Our objective in the current study was to replicate the results of Mima et al. and to further evaluate interhemispheric effective connectivity during midline object recognition in source space. We recruited 11 healthy adult volunteers and recorded EEG from 64 channels while they performed a midline object recognition task. Task-related power and coherence were estimated in sensor and source spaces. Further, effective connectivity was evaluated using Granger causality. While we were able to replicate the alpha desynchronisation associated with midline object recognition, we could not replicate the coherence results of Mima et al. The data-driven approach that we employed in our study localised the source of alpha desynchronisation over the left occipito-temporal region. In the alpha band, we further observed significant increase in imaginary part of coherency between bilateral occipito-temporal regions during object recognition. Finally, Granger causality analysis between the left and right occipito-temporal regions provided an insight that even though there is bidirectional interaction, the left occipito-temporal region may be crucial for integrating the information necessary for object recognition. The significance of the current study lies in using high-density EEG and applying more appropriate and robust measures of connectivity as well as statistical analysis to validate and enhance our current knowledge on the neural basis of midline object recognition."

This study compared performance during a complete lactation of 36 multiparous dairy cows divided into three equal-sized groups with high (HRFI), intermediate (IRFI) or low RFI (LRFI). Residual feed intake was determined by two different equations. Residual feed intake according to the NorFor system was calculated as (RFI NorFor ) = (NE intake )–(NE maintenance + NE gestation + NE milk —NE mobilisation + NE deposition ). Residual feed intake according to the USA National Research Council (NRC) (RFI NRC ) was calculated as: RFI = DMI − predicted DMI where predicted s DMI = [(0.372× ECM)+(0.0968×BW 0.75 )]×(1−e −0.192×(DIM/7+3.67) ). Cows in the HRFI NorFor group showed higher daily CH 4 production, CH 4 /ECM and CH 4 yield (g/kg DMI) than IRFI NorFor and LRFI NorFor cows. Cows characterized by high efficiency (LRFI NorFor ) according to the NorFor system had lower body weight. Dry matter intake and apparent dry matter digestibility were not affected by efficiency group but milk yield was lower in the low efficiency, HRFI NorFor, group. Cows characterized by high efficiency according to the NRC system (LRFI NRC ) had lower dry matter intake while yield of CH 4 was higher. Daily CH 4 production and CH 4 g/kg ECM did not differ between RFI NRC groups. Dairy cows characterized by high efficiency (both LRFI NorFor and LRFI NRC cows) over a complete lactation mobilized more of their body reserves in early lactation as well as during the complete lactation. The results also indicated great phenotypic variation in RFI between different stages the lactation."
https://openalex.org/W4293155683,"The existence of multiple perspectives and representations of different stakeholders poses critical challenges to conservation initiatives worldwide. Thus, to foster more just and sustainable agendas in protected areas (PAs), this diversity of perspectives must be better understood, acknowledged, and tackled. In this article, we aimed to initiate this understanding for the Makay region in Madagascar, a poorly-known region where a ‘New Protected Area’ has been gazetted. In combining mental models and social representation theory, we explored different stakeholders’ perspectives about the Makay social-ecological system, and how differences in stakeholders’ viewpoints could challenge the success of an inclusive, just, and sustainable conservation program. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 respondents having different expertise on the Makay. During interviews, respondents were guided towards the elicitation of their individual cognitive map (ICM) of the Makay social-ecological system. ICMs were then analyzed in combining quantitative and qualitative. Respondents described the Makay through a total of 162 components, including 51 components that constituted the central zone of the Makay’s representation. In particular, respondents pointed to insecurity issues caused by zebu thieves, as well as to environmental challenges relative to anthropogenic fires and hunting. On the contrary, they considered mining activities and timber harvesting as more peripheral problems. Through a multivariate clustering analysis, we discriminated two clusters of respondents with contrasting visions about the Makay, ecocentric vs. social-ecological, which was largely influenced by respondents’ background. In comparing the two clusters’ representations, we found that they had dissimilar diagnoses about key socio-environmental challenges in the Makay and how to address them. This ambiguity in respondents’ viewpoints stresses the need to increase research efforts in the Makay region to fill current knowledge gaps about this poorly known social-ecological system, and to foster social learning between stakeholders concerned by the Makay new PA."
https://openalex.org/W4293155689,"In vitro studies have been popularly used to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms for many decades. However, the traditional two-dimension (2D) cell culture which grows cells on a flat surface does not fully recapitulate the pathological phenotypes. Alternatively, the three-dimension (3D) cell culture provides cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction that better mimics tissue-like structure. Thus, it has gained increasing attention recently. Yet, the expenses, time-consuming, and complications of cellular and biomolecular analysis are still major limitations of 3D culture. Herein, we describe a cost-effective and simplified workflow of the 3D neuronal cell-laden agarose-laminin preparation and the isolation of cells, RNAs, and proteins from the scaffold. To study the effects of the amyloidogenic condition in neurons, we utilized a neuron-like cell line, SH-SY5Y, and induced the amyloidogenic condition by using an amyloid forty-two inducer (Aftin-4). The effectiveness of RNAs, proteins and cells isolation from 3D scaffold enables us to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying amyloidogenic cascade in neuronal cells. The results show that SH-SY5Y cultured in agarose-laminin scaffold differentiated to a mature TUJ1-expressing neuron cell on day 7. Furthermore, the gene expression profile from the Aftin-4-induced amyloidogenic condition revealed the expression of relevant gene-encoding proteins in the amyloidogenic pathway, including APP , BACE1 , PS1 , and PS2 . This platform could induce the amyloid-beta 42 secretion and entrap secreted proteins in the scaffold. The induction of amyloidogenic conditions in a 3D culture facilitates the interaction between secreted amyloid-beta and neurons, which makes it resembles the pathological environment in Alzheimer’s brain. Together, this workflow is applicable for studying the cellular and molecular analysis of amyloid-induced neuronal toxicity, such as those occurred in Alzheimer’s disease progression. Importantly, our method is cost-effective, reproducible, and easy to manipulate."
https://openalex.org/W4293155713,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). DM is associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), due to poor glycemic control. However, few studies have focused on the risk of developing ESRD among DM patients with and without AF. This study evaluated ESRD risk among DM patients with and without AF in Taiwan. Data were retrieved from one million patients randomly sampled from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, including 6,105 DM patients with AF propensity score-matched with 6,105 DM patients without AF. Both groups were followed until death, any dialysis treatment, or December 31, 2013, whichever occurred first. AF was diagnosed by a qualified physician according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), using the diagnostic code 427.31. Patients aged <20 years or diagnosed with ESRD before the index date were excluded. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to calculate the relative ESRD risk. Among DM patients, those with AF have more comorbidities than those without AF. We also found a 1.18-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.46) increase in ESRD risk among patients with AF compared with those without AF. In addition, DM patients with hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores also have significantly increased ESRD risks than those without these complications. A 1.39-fold (95% CI: 1.04-1.86) increase in risk was observed for patients with AF among the non-CKD group. Our findings suggest that patients with DM should be closely monitored for irregular or rapid heart rates."
https://openalex.org/W4293513854,"A common cause of vehicle crashes on urban expressways lies in the unsafe behaviors of drivers. This study focused on analyzing the influence of various unsafe behaviors on crash duration. Based on actual video image of vehicle crashes, 14 unsafe behaviors were identified for the analysis of crashes on urban expressways. Using the correspondence analysis method, the correlation among unsafe behaviors and collision types was obtained. Nonparametric survival analysis was then presented to obtain the survival rate curves of sideswipe crashes and rear-end crashes. Finally, parametric survival analysis method can get the influence of unsafe behaviors on crash duration. The survival rate of any time was quantified through the reasoning of key unsafe behaviors for different types of crashes. The results show that there were striking differences in the duration among different types of crashes. The unsafe behaviors had a significant impact on duration for different types of crashes. This study focused on the duration under the influence of unsafe behaviors before the crash, and the results provide valuable information to prevent crashes, which can improve traffic safety."
