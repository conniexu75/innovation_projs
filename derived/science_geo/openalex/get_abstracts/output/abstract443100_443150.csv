https://openalex.org/W1987944461,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a nuclear transcription factor, is also present in mitochondria and regulates cellular respiration in a transcriptional-independent manner. The mechanism of STAT3 import into mitochondria remains obscure. In this report we show that mitochondrial-localized STAT3 resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In vitro import studies show that the gene associated with retinoid interferon induced cell mortality 19 (GRIM-19), a complex I subunit that acts as a chaperone to recruit STAT3 into mitochondria. In addition, GRIM-19 enhances the integration of STAT3 into complex I. A S727A mutation in STAT3 reduces its import and assembly even in the presence of GRIM-19. Together, our studies unveil a novel chaperone function for GRIM-19 in the recruitment of STAT3 into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2021000498,"The mechanisms underlying Tau-related synaptic and cognitive deficits and the interrelationships between Tau species, their clearance pathways, and synaptic impairments remain poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we examined these interrelationships in aged non-mutant genomic human Tau mice, with established Tau pathology and neuron loss. We also examined how these interrelationships changed with an intervention by feeding mice either a control diet or one containing the brain permeable beta-amyloid and Tau aggregate binding molecule curcumin. Transgene-dependent elevations in soluble and insoluble phospho-Tau monomer and soluble Tau dimers accompanied deficits in behavior, hippocampal excitatory synaptic markers, and molecular chaperones (heat shock proteins (HSPs)) involved in Tau degradation and microtubule stability. In human Tau mice but not control mice, HSP70, HSP70/HSP72, and HSP90 were reduced in membrane-enriched fractions but not in cytosolic fractions. The synaptic proteins PSD95 and NR2B were reduced in dendritic fields and redistributed into perikarya, corresponding to changes observed by immunoblot. Curcumin selectively suppressed levels of soluble Tau dimers, but not of insoluble and monomeric phospho-Tau, while correcting behavioral, synaptic, and HSP deficits. Treatment increased PSD95 co-immunoprecipitating with NR2B and, independent of transgene, increased HSPs implicated in Tau clearance. It elevated HSP90 and HSC70 without increasing HSP mRNAs; that is, without induction of the heat shock response. Instead curcumin differentially impacted HSP90 client kinases, reducing Fyn without reducing Akt. In summary, curcumin reduced soluble Tau and elevated HSPs involved in Tau clearance, showing that even after tangles have formed, Tau-dependent behavioral and synaptic deficits can be corrected."
https://openalex.org/W2064771994,"Maintaining cell cohesiveness within tissues requires that intercellular adhesions develop sufficient strength to support traction forces applied by myosin motors and by neighboring cells. Cadherins are transmembrane receptors that mediate intercellular adhesion. The cadherin cytoplasmic domain recruits several partners, including catenins and vinculin, at sites of cell-cell adhesion. Our study used force measurements to address the role of αE-catenin and vinculin in the regulation of the strength of E-cadherin-based adhesion. αE-catenin-deficient cells display only weak aggregation and fail to strengthen intercellular adhesion over time, a process rescued by the expression of αE-catenin or chimeric E-cadherin·αE-catenins, including a chimera lacking the αE-catenin dimerization domain. Interestingly, an αE-catenin mutant lacking the modulation and actin-binding domains restores cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts but cannot strengthen intercellular adhesion. The expression of αE-catenin mutated in its vinculin-binding site is defective in its ability to rescue cadherin-based adhesion strength in cells lacking αE-catenin. Vinculin depletion or the overexpression of the αE-catenin modulation domain strongly decreases E-cadherin-mediated adhesion strength. This supports the notion that both molecules are required for intercellular contact maturation. Furthermore, stretching of cell doublets increases vinculin recruitment and α18 anti-αE-catenin conformational epitope immunostaining at cell-cell contacts. Taken together, our results indicate that αE-catenin and vinculin cooperatively support intercellular adhesion strengthening, probably via a mechanoresponsive link between the E-cadherin·β-catenin complexes and the underlying actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2051207198,"Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2 can lead to elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in multiple cancers. Here we report that cellular 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutation is dependent on the activity of a retained wild-type IDH1 allele. In contrast, expression of mitochondrial IDH2 mutations led to robust 2HG production in a manner independent of wild-type mitochondrial IDH function. Among the recurrent IDH2 mutations at Arg-172 and Arg-140, IDH2 Arg-172 mutations consistently led to greater 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, and the degree of 2HG accumulation correlated with the ability of these mutations to block cellular differentiation. Cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations, although structurally analogous to mutations at mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, were only able to elevate intracellular 2HG to comparable levels when an equivalent level of wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. Consistent with 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 being limited by substrate production from wild-type IDH1, we observed 2HG levels to increase in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation when mitochondrial IDH flux was diverted to the cytosol. Finally, expression of an IDH1 construct engineered to localize to the mitochondria rather than the cytosol resulted in greater 2HG accumulation. These data demonstrate that allelic and subcellular compartment differences can regulate the potential for IDH mutations to produce 2HG in cells. The consequences of 2HG elevation are dose-dependent, and the non-equivalent 2HG accumulation resulting from IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may underlie their differential prognosis and prevalence in various cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1987245647,"Although amino acids are dietary nutrients that evoke the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from intestinal L cells, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which amino acids regulate GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L cells remains unknown. Here, we show that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A), is involved in amino acid-induced GLP-1 secretion from the intestinal L cell line GLUTag. Application of l-ornithine caused an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in GLUTag cells. Application of a GPRC6A receptor antagonist, a phospholipase C inhibitor, or an IP(3) receptor antagonist significantly suppressed the l-ornithine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase. We found that the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) stimulated by l-ornithine correlated with GLP-1 secretion and that l-ornithine stimulation increased exocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous GPRC6A by a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the l-ornithine-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase and GLP-1 secretion. Taken together, these findings suggest that the GPRC6A receptor functions as an amino acid sensor in GLUTag cells that promotes GLP-1 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1979923792,"Host macrophages can be preprogrammed into opposing primed or tolerant states depending upon the nature and quantities of external stimulants. The paradigm of priming and tolerance has significant implications in the pathogenesis and resolution of both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the responsible mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that super low dose bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as low as 5 pg/ml, primes the expression of proinflammatory mediators in macrophages upon a second high dose LPS challenge (100 ng/ml), although 5 pg/ml LPS itself does not trigger noticeable macrophage activation. Mice primed with super low dose LPS (0.5 μg/kg body weight) in vivo experience significantly elevated mortality following a second hit of high dose LPS as compared with saline-primed control mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that LPS primes macrophages by removing transcriptional suppressive RelB through interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 and Tollip (Toll-interacting protein)-dependent mechanisms. This is in sharp contrast to the well documented RelB stabilization and induction by high dose LPS, potentially through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Super low dose and high dose LPS cause opposing modulation of interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1 and PI3K pathways and lead to opposing regulation of RelB. The pathway switching induced by super low versus high dose LPS underscores the importance of competing intracellular circuitry during the establishment of macrophage priming and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2132164216,"MicroRNA cluster miR-17-92 has been implicated in cardiovascular development and function, yet its precise mechanisms of action in these contexts are uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-17-92 in morphogenesis and function of cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. To do so, a mouse model of conditional overexpression of miR-17-92 in cardiac and smooth muscle tissues was generated. Extensive cardiac functional studies identified a dose-dependent induction of dilated, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia inducibility in transgenic animals, which correlated with premature mortality (98.3±42.5 d, P<0.0001). Expression analyses revealed the abundance of Pten transcript, a known miR-17-92 target, to be inversely correlated with miR-17-92 expression levels and heart size. In addition, we demonstrated through 3′-UTR luciferase assays and expression analyses that Connexin43 (Cx43) is a novel direct target of miR-19a/b and its expression is suppressed in transgenic hearts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that dysregulated expression of miR-17-92 during cardiovascular morphogenesis results in a lethal cardiomyopathy, possibly in part through direct repression of Pten and Cx43. This study highlights the importance of miR-17-92 in both normal and pathological functions of the heart, and provides a model that may serve as a useful platform to test novel antiarrhythmic therapeutics.—Danielson, L.

https://openalex.org/W2170476922,"Dysfunctional tau accumulation is a major contributing factor in tauopathies, and the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) seems to play an important role in this accumulation. Several reports suggest that Hsp70 proteins can cause tau degradation to be accelerated or slowed, but how these opposing activities are controlled is unclear. Here we demonstrate that highly homologous variants in the Hsp70 family can have opposing effects on tau clearance kinetics. When overexpressed in a tetracycline (Tet)-based protein chase model, constitutive heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) and inducible Hsp72 slowed or accelerated tau clearance, respectively. Tau synergized with Hsc70, but not Hsp72, to promote microtubule assembly at nearly twice the rate of either Hsp70 homologue in reconstituted, ATP-regenerating Xenopus extracts supplemented with rhodamine-labeled tubulin and human recombinant Hsp72 and Hsc70. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with human recombinant protein revealed that Hsp72 had greater affinity for tau than Hsc70 (I/I0 ratio difference of 0.3), but Hsc70 was 30 times more abundant than Hsp72 in human and mouse brain tissue. This indicates that the predominant Hsp70 variant in the brain is Hsc70, suggesting that the brain environment primarily supports slower tau clearance. Despite its capacity to clear tau, Hsp72 was not induced in the Alzheimer's disease brain, suggesting a mechanism for age-associated onset of the disease. Through the use of chimeras that blended the domains of Hsp72 and Hsc70, we determined that the reason for these differences between Hsc70 and Hsp72 with regard to tau clearance kinetics lies within their C-terminal domains, which are essential for their interactions with substrates and cochaperones. Hsp72 but not Hsc70 in the presence of tau was able to recruit the cochaperone ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which is known to facilitate the ubiquitination of tau, describing a possible mechanism of how the C-termini of these homologous Hsp70 variants can differentially regulate tau triage. Thus, efforts to promote Hsp72 expression and inhibit Hsc70 could be therapeutically relevant for tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2026640914,"Paracrine signaling between pancreatic islet β-cells and α-cells has been proposed to play a role in regulating glucagon responses to elevated glucose and hypoglycemia. To examine this possibility in human islets, we used a metabolomic approach to trace the responses of amino acids and other potential neurotransmitters to stimulation with [U-(13)C]glucose in both normal individuals and type 2 diabetics. Islets from type 2 diabetics uniformly showed decreased glucose stimulation of insulin secretion and respiratory rate but demonstrated two different patterns of glucagon responses to glucose: one group responded normally to suppression of glucagon by glucose, but the second group was non-responsive. The non-responsive group showed evidence of suppressed islet GABA levels and of GABA shunt activity. In further studies with normal human islets, we found that γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a potent inhibitory neurotransmitter, is generated in β-cells by an extension of the GABA shunt during glucose stimulation and interacts with α-cell GHB receptors, thus mediating the suppressive effect of glucose on glucagon release. We also identified glycine, acting via α-cell glycine receptors, as the predominant amino acid stimulator of glucagon release. The results suggest that glycine and GHB provide a counterbalancing receptor-based mechanism for controlling α-cell secretory responses to metabolic fuels."
https://openalex.org/W2035252238,"Type IV P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) and CDC50 family proteins form a putative phospholipid flippase complex that mediates the translocation of aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from the outer to inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, at least eight members of P4-ATPases were identified, but only a single CDC50 family protein, CDC50A, was expressed. We demonstrated that CDC50A associated with and recruited P4-ATPase ATP8A1 to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of CDC50A induced extensive cell spreading and greatly enhanced cell migration. Depletion of either CDC50A or ATP8A1 caused a severe defect in the formation of membrane ruffles, thereby inhibiting cell migration. Analyses of phospholipid translocation at the plasma membrane revealed that the depletion of CDC50A inhibited the inward translocation of both PS and PE, whereas the depletion of ATP8A1 inhibited the translocation of PE but not that of PS, suggesting that the inward translocation of cell-surface PE is involved in cell migration. This hypothesis was further examined by using a PE-binding peptide and a mutant cell line with defective PE synthesis; either cell-surface immobilization of PE by the PE-binding peptide or reduction in the cell-surface content of PE inhibited the formation of membrane ruffles, causing a severe defect in cell migration. These results indicate that the phospholipid flippase complex of ATP8A1 and CDC50A plays a major role in cell migration and suggest that the flippase-mediated translocation of PE at the plasma membrane is involved in the formation of membrane ruffles to promote cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2131270640,"The Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2, are important regulators of cell shape, migration, and proliferation through effects on the actin cytoskeleton. However, it is not known whether ROCK2 plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To determine whether the loss of ROCK2 could prevent cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte-specific ROCK2-null (c-ROCK2–/–) were generated using conditional ROCK2flox/flox mice and α-myosin heavy-chain promoter-driven Cre recombinase transgenic mice. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by Ang II infusion (400 ng/kg/min, 28 d) or transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Under basal conditions, hemodynamic parameters, cardiac anatomy, and function of c-ROCK2–/– mice were comparable to wild-type (WT) mice. However, following Ang II infusion or TAC, c-ROCK2–/– mice exhibited a substantially smaller increase in heart-to-body weight ratio, left ventricular mass, myocyte cross-sectional area, hypertrophy-related fetal gene expression, intraventricular fibrosis, cardiac apoptosis, and oxidative stress compared to control mice. Deletion of ROCK2 in cardiomyocytes leads to increased expression of four-and-a-half LIM-only protein-2 (FHL2) and FHL2-mediated inhibition of serum response factor (SRF) and extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK). Knockdown of FHL2 expression in ROCK2-deficient cardiomyocytes or placing ROCK2-hap-loinsufficient (ROCK2+/–) mice on FHL2+/–-haploinsufficient background restored the hypertrophic response to Ang II. These results indicate that cardiomyocyte ROCK2 is essential for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and that up-regulation of FHL2 may contribute to the antihypertrophic phenotype that is observed in cardiac-specific ROCK2-deficient mice.—Okamoto, R., Li, Y., Noma, K., Hiroi, Y., Liu, P.-Y., Taniguchi, M., Ito, M., Liao, J.

https://openalex.org/W1966746210,"The role of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-20 (IL-20) has not yet been studied in cancer biology. Here, we demonstrated up-regulation of both IL-20 and IL-20R1 in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. The expressions of IL-20 and IL-20R1 were observed in bladder cancer 5637 and T-24 cells. We found that IL-20 significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 via binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 in bladder cancer cells and stimulated the activation of ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, and JAK-STAT signaling. Among the pathways examined, only ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited IL-20-induced migration and invasion. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 suppressed migration, invasion, ERK1/2 activation, and NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by IL-20. Unexpectedly, the cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1) was induced by IL-20 treatment without altering cell cycle progression. Blockade of p21(WAF1) function by siRNA reversed migration, invasion, activation of ERK signaling, MMP-9 expression, and activation of NF-κB in IL-20-treated cells. In addition, IL-20 induced the activation of IκB kinase, the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, which was regulated by ERK1/2. IL-20 stimulated the recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 promoter region. Finally, the IL-20-induced migration and invasion of cells was confirmed by IL-20 gene transfection and by addition of anti-IL-20 antibody. This is the first report that p21(WAF1) is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via increased binding activity of NF-κB, which resulted in the induction of migration in IL-20/IL-20R1 dyad-induced bladder cancer cells. These unexpected results might provide a critical new target for the treatment of bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2076700858,"Integrins are adhesive, signaling, and mechanotransduction proteins. Talin (Tln) activates integrins and links it to the actin cytoskeleton. Vertebrates contain two talin genes, tln1 and tln2. How Tln1 and Tln2 function in cardiac myocytes (CMs) is unknown. Tln1 and Tln2 expression were evaluated in the normal embryonic and adult mouse heart as well as in control and failing human adult myocardium. Tln1 function was then tested in the basal and mechanically stressed myocardium after cardiomyocyte-specific excision of the Tln1 gene. During embryogenesis, both Tln forms are highly expressed in CMs, but in the mature heart Tln2 becomes the main Tln isoform, localizing to the costameres. Tln1 expression is minimal in the adult CM. With pharmacological and mechanical stress causing hypertrophy, Tln1 is up-regulated in CMs and is specifically detected at costameres, suggesting its importance in the compensatory response to CM stress. In human failing heart, CM Tln1 also increases compared with control samples from normal functioning myocardium. To directly test Tln1 function in CMs, we generated CM-specific Tln1 knock-out mice (Tln1cKO). Tln1cKO mice showed normal basal cardiac structure and function but when subjected to pressure overload showed blunted hypertrophy, less fibrosis, and improved cardiac function versus controls. Acute responses of ERK1/2, p38, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 after mechanical stress were strongly blunted in Tln1cKO mice. Given these results, we conclude that Tln1 and Tln2 have distinct functions in the myocardium. Our data show that reduction of CM Tln1 expression can lead to improved cardiac remodeling following pressure overload."
https://openalex.org/W1987549117,"The underlying mechanisms of itch are poorly understood. We have investigated a model involving the chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) that is up-regulated in common skin diseases. Intradermal injection of LTB4 (0.1 nmol/site) into female CD1 mice induced significant scratching movements (used as an itch index) compared with vehicle-injected (0.1% bovine serum albumin-saline) mice. Intraperitoneal transient receptor potential (TRP) channel antagonist treatment significantly inhibited itch as follows: TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist SB366791 (0.5 mg/kg, by 97%) and the TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) antagonists TCS 5861528 (10 mg/kg; 82%) and HC-030031 (100 mg/kg; 76%). Leukotriene B4 receptor 2 antagonism by LY255283 (5 mg/kg i.p.; 62%) reduced itch. Neither TRPV1-knockout (TRPV1-KO) nor TRPA1-knockout (TRPA1-KO mice exhibited LTB4-induced itch compared with their wild-type counterparts. The reactive oxygen species scavengers N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 204 mg/kg i.p.; 86%) or superoxide dismutase (SOD; 10 mg/kg i.p.; 83%) also inhibited itch. LTB4-induced superoxide release was attenuated by TCS 5861528 (56%) and HC-030031 (66%), NAC (58%), SOD (50%), and LY255283 (59%) but not by the leukotriene B4 receptor 1 antagonist U-75302 (9 nmol/site) or SB366791. Itch, superoxide, and myeloperoxidase generation were inhibited by the leukocyte migration inhibitor fucoidan (10 mg/kg i.v.) by 80, 61, and 34%, respectively. Myeloperoxidase activity was also reduced by SB366791 (35%) and SOD (28%). TRPV1-KO mice showed impaired myeloperoxidase release, whereas TRPA1-KO mice exhibited diminished production of superoxide. This result provides novel evidence that TRPA1 and TRPV1 contribute to itch via distinct mechanisms.—Fernandes, E. S., Vong, C. T., Quek, S., Cheong, J., Awal, S., Gentry, C., Aubdool, A.

https://openalex.org/W1974425484,"Transport along the endolysosomal system requires multiple fusion events at early and late endosomes. Deletion of several endosomal fusion factors, including the Vac1 tether and the Class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex-specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8, results in a class D vps phenotype. As these mutants have an apparently similar defect in endosomal transport, we asked whether CORVET and Vac1 could still act in distinct tethering reactions. Our data reveal that CORVET mutants can be rescued by Vac1 overexpression in the endocytic pathway but not in CPY or Cps1 sorting to the vacuole. Moreover, when we compared the ultrastructure, CORVET mutants were most similar to deletions of the Rab Vps21 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vps9 and different from vac1 deletion, indicating separate functions. Likewise, CORVET still localized to endosomes even in the absence of Vac1, whereas Vac1 localization became diffuse in CORVET mutants. Importantly, CORVET localization requires the Rab5 homologs Vps21 and Ypt52, whereas Vac1 localization is strictly Vps21-dependent. In this context, we also uncover that Muk1 can compensate for loss of Vps9 in CORVET localization, indicating that two Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factors operate in the endocytic pathway. Overall, our study reveals a unique role of CORVET in the sorting of biosynthetic cargo to the vacuole/lysosome."
https://openalex.org/W2124839856,"The NSD (nuclear receptor SET domain-containing) family members, consisting of NSD1, NSD2 (MMSET/WHSC1), and NSD3 (WHSC1L1), are SET domain-containing methyltransferases and aberrant expression of each member has been implicated in multiple diseases. They have specific mono- and dimethylase activities for H3K36, whereas play nonredundant roles during development. Aside from the well characterized catalytic SET domain, NSD proteins have multiple potential chromatin-binding motifs that are clinically relevant, including the fifth plant homeodomain (PHD5) and the adjacent Cys-His-rich domain (C5HCH) located at the C terminus. Herein, we report the crystal structures of the PHD5-C5HCH module of NSD3, in the free state and in complex with H3(1-7) (H3 residues 1-7), H3(1-15) (H3 residues 1-15), and H3(1-15)K9me3 (H3 residues 1-15 with trimethylation on K9) peptides. These structures reveal that the PHD5 and C5HCH domains fold into a novel integrated PHD-PHD-like structural module with H3 peptide bound only on the surface of PHD5 and provide the molecular basis for the recognition of unmodified H3K4 and trimethylated H3K9 by NSD3 PHD5. Structural studies and binding assays show that differences exist in histone binding specificity of the PHD5 domain between three members of the NSD family. For NSD2, the PHD5-C5HCH:H3 N terminus interaction is largely conserved, although with a stronger preference for unmethylated H3K9 (H3K9me0) than trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3), and NSD1 PHD5-C5HCH does not bind to H3 peptides. Our results shed light on how NSD proteins that mediate H3K36 methylation are localized to specific genomic sites and provide implications for the mechanism of functional diversity of NSD proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2006326317,"Scaffolding proteins often bring kinases together with their substrates to facilitate cell signaling. This arrangement is critical for the phosphorylation and regulation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, a key target of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. The protein kinase A anchoring protein AKAP79/150 organizes a multiprotein complex to position protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the immediate proximity of TRPV1 channels to enhance phosphorylation efficiency. This arrangement suggests that regulators upstream of the kinases must also be present in the signalosome. Here, we show that AKAP79/150 facilitates a complex containing TPRV1 and adenylyl cyclase (AC). The anchoring of AC to this complex generates local pools of cAMP, shifting the concentration of forskolin required to attenuate capsaicin-dependent TRPV1 desensitization by ∼100-fold. Anchoring of AC to the complex also sensitizes the channel to activation by β-adrenergic receptor agonists. Significant AC activity is found associated with TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglia. The dissociation of AC from an AKAP150-TRPV1 complex in dorsal root ganglia neurons abolishes sensitization of TRPV1 induced by forskolin and prostaglandin E(2). Thus, the direct anchoring of both PKA and AC to TRPV1 by AKAP79/150 facilitates the response to inflammatory mediators and may be critical in the pathogenesis of thermal hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2042549477,"Subcomplexes of mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI; EC 1.6.5.3) are shown to turn over in vivo, and we propose a role in an ancestral assembly pathway. By progressively labeling Arabidopsis cell cultures with 15N and isolating mitochondria, we have identified CI subcomplexes through differences in 15N incorporation into their protein subunits. The 200-kDa subcomplex, containing the ancestral γ-carbonic anhydrase (γ-CA), γ-carbonic anhydrase-like, and 20.9-kDa subunits, had a significantly higher turnover rate than intact CI or CI+CIII2. In vitro import of precursors for these CI subunits demonstrated rapid generation of subcomplexes and revealed that their specific abundance varied when different ancestral subunits were imported. Time course studies of precursor import showed the further assembly of these subcomplexes into CI and CI+CIII2, indicating that the subcomplexes are productive intermediates of assembly. The strong transient incorporation of new subunits into the 200-kDa subcomplex in a γ-CA mutant is consistent with this subcomplex being a key initiator of CI assembly in plants. This evidence alongside the pattern of coincident occurrence of genes encoding these particular proteins broadly in eukaryotes, except for opisthokonts, provides a framework for the evolutionary conservation of these accessory subunits and evidence of their function in ancestral CI assembly.Background: Plant complex I contains γ-CA subunits whose role is unclear.Results: 15N labeling and import show CI assembly via a rapidly turning over γ-CA subcomplex.Conclusion: γ-CAs form an ancient pathway for CI assembly.Significance: The assembly pathway of complex I in plants is different from that in animals and more closely represents the ancestral enzyme. Subcomplexes of mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI; EC 1.6.5.3) are shown to turn over in vivo, and we propose a role in an ancestral assembly pathway. By progressively labeling Arabidopsis cell cultures with 15N and isolating mitochondria, we have identified CI subcomplexes through differences in 15N incorporation into their protein subunits. The 200-kDa subcomplex, containing the ancestral γ-carbonic anhydrase (γ-CA), γ-carbonic anhydrase-like, and 20.9-kDa subunits, had a significantly higher turnover rate than intact CI or CI+CIII2. In vitro import of precursors for these CI subunits demonstrated rapid generation of subcomplexes and revealed that their specific abundance varied when different ancestral subunits were imported. Time course studies of precursor import showed the further assembly of these subcomplexes into CI and CI+CIII2, indicating that the subcomplexes are productive intermediates of assembly. The strong transient incorporation of new subunits into the 200-kDa subcomplex in a γ-CA mutant is consistent with this subcomplex being a key initiator of CI assembly in plants. This evidence alongside the pattern of coincident occurrence of genes encoding these particular proteins broadly in eukaryotes, except for opisthokonts, provides a framework for the evolutionary conservation of these accessory subunits and evidence of their function in ancestral CI assembly. Background: Plant complex I contains γ-CA subunits whose role is unclear. Results: 15N labeling and import show CI assembly via a rapidly turning over γ-CA subcomplex. Conclusion: γ-CAs form an ancient pathway for CI assembly. Significance: The assembly pathway of complex I in plants is different from that in animals and more closely represents the ancestral enzyme.

EC 1.6.5.3) is the largest (∼1000 kDa) protein complex of the oxidative phosphorylation assembly and is also the major entry point of electrons from the oxidation of NADH into the respiratory chain. CI contains 14 core subunits that represent the minimal active form and that are conserved from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms. In the mitochondria of eukaryotes, CI contains an additional 31–38 accessory subunits, a number of which differ among organisms (1.Walker J.E. Skehel J.M. Buchanan S.K.

Single-particle electron microscope imaging analysis of isolated CI from Arabidopsis and Polytomella identified a specific matrix-exposed domain formed by γ-carbonic anhydrase (γ-CA) subunits that are attached to the membrane arm of mitochondrial CI by the integral membrane protein CA2 (5.Sunderhaus S.

In Arabidopsis, this protein domain contains at least three different γ-CA proteins, CA1 (At1g19580), CA2 (At1g47260), and CA3 (At5g66510), having conserved active site regions, and two less well conserved γ-CA-like proteins, CAL1 (At5g66510) and CAL2 (At3g48680), which contain alterations to the primary structure of typical γ-CAs (6.Perales M.

Although at first these subunits were thought to be specific to CI from photosynthetic organisms (10.Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Mitochondrial complex I from Arabidopsis and rice.

Broader phylogenetic studies have also found homology between other CI accessory subunits once thought to be species-or lineage-specific (4.Cardol P.

Given the divergence of CI composition among eukaryotes, both the assembly pathway and the biological importance of accessory subunits in assembly intermediates could be considerably different among major taxonomic groups of eukaryotes. In CI mutants of Neurospora crassa, analysis of CI assembly using radiolabeling pulse-chase has revealed that the matrix and membrane arms assemble independently via separate pathways (13.KÜffner R.

Based on a combination of radiolabeling pulse-chase experiments, in vitro mitochondrial import and monitoring of tagged CI subunits in assembly-disturbed systems, several CI assembly models have been proposed for human cells (14.Mimaki M.

Biol. 2005; 350: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which might be a consequence of functional redundancy in activities between these proteins. However, suspension cell culture lines derived from the mutant ca2 showed reduced growth rates and lower CI abundance (11.Perales M. Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Colaneri A. Zabaleta E. Braun H.P. Disruption of a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial γ carbonic anhydrase reduces complex I and supercomplex I + III2 levels and alters mitochondrial physiology in Arabidopsis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which indicates that γ-CA subunits could be important for CI assembly or structural stability in plants. However, reports of studies to date have not been able to distinguish between productive and non-productive intermediates, an essential distinction in building a rigorous CI assembly model. Specifically, we needed to determine if subcomplexes were present in vivo or if they were formed in vitro due to detergent solubilization or electrophoresis; if they were incorporated into the small/early assembly intermediates; and if they were productive intermediates that go on to form CI or were simply non-productive subcomplexes that accumulated in mitochondria. We have combined a progressive 15N labeling strategy in vivo (24.Li L. Nelson C.J. Solheim C. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Determining degradation and synthesis rates of Arabidopsis proteins using the kinetics of progressive 15N labeling of two-dimensional gel-separated protein spots.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 1110.1074/mcp.M111.010025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with BN polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and in vitro [35S]Met import and assembly assays to address these issues. This approach has allowed analysis of the incorporation rate of subunits into subcomplexes, mature CI, and supercomplexes of plant mitochondria to investigate their role in assembly and to provide key evidence for the existence of a productive CI subcomplex in vivo in plants. The subunits of the identified assembly subcomplex, lost in animal lineages, are widely conserved in other eukaryotic lineages, providing evidence for their role as ancestral accessory subunits. Arabidopsis cell suspension was cultured in growth medium (1× Murashige and Skoog medium without vitamin, 3% sucrose (w/v), 0.5 mg/liter naphthalene acetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, pH 5.8) at 22 °C under continuous light conditions with a light intensity of 90 μmol m−2 s−1 and with orbital shaking at 120 rpm. Cultures were maintained in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks by the inoculation of 20–25 ml of 7-day-old cells into 100 ml of new medium. The same growth medium without nitrogen (i.e. no ammonium nitrate or potassium nitrate) was used to wash the 7-day-old cell culture three times before it was transferred to 15N growth medium. Ammonium-15N nitrate-15N (1.69 g/liter) and potassium nitrate-15N (1.92 g/liter) (98% 15N; Sigma) were added to growth medium without nitrogen to make the 15N growth medium. Cells labeled for 24, 120, and 168 h with 15N were collected onto filter paper using vacuum filtration. Three biological replicates for each time point were performed. Fresh cells (20–25 g) for each single time point replicate were dispersed in digestion solution (0.4% (w/v) Onozuka cellulase RS, 0.05% (w/v) Kyowa pectolyase Y-23, 0.4 m mannitol, 0.7 g/liter MES, pH 5.7) and gently shaken in the dark for 3 h at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the protoplast pellet resuspended in digestion solution without enzymes by swirling and repeated rounds of centrifugation. Washed protoplasts were then resuspended in extraction buffer (0.4 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA (w/v), pH 7.5) and homogenized 5–9 times with a Dounce 0.12-mm homogenizer. Extraction buffer containing broken protoplasts was then centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was recovered, and then this supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of mannitol wash buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5) using a paint brush, and the suspension was pipetted onto two 35-ml Percoll step gradients comprising 40, 25, and 18% (w/v) Percoll in mannitol wash buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min and decelerated with slow braking. Mitochondria, which form a yellow band at the 40 and 25% interface, were collected and diluted in sucrose wash buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES, pH 7.5). Diluted mitochondria were centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 15 min and decelerated with slow braking. Pellet was collected and diluted again in wash buffer. Washed mitochondria were diluted in 0.5–1 ml of sucrose wash buffer. Isolated mitochondria were quantified with the Bradford assay and were then used for import assays or made into 1-mg protein aliquots and run on BN gels or stored at −80 °C for further experiments. Wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) or ca2 mutant seeds (∼30 μg) (11.Perales M. Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Colaneri A. Zabaleta E. Braun H.P. Disruption of a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial γ carbonic anhydrase reduces complex I and supercomplex I + III2 levels and alters mitochondrial physiology in Arabidopsis.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 2 min, and then the seeds were placed in a sterilization solution (5% (v/v) bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 15 min with periodical shaking. Seeds were then washed in sterile water 5 times before being dispensed into a 250-ml plastic vessel containing 80 ml of growth medium (half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium without vitamins, half-strength Gamborg B5 vitamin solution, 5 mm MES, 2.5% (w/v) sucrose, pH 5.8). Arabidopsis seedlings were grown under a 16/8-h light/dark period with light intensity of 100–125 μmol m−2 s−1 at 22 °C for 2 weeks. Ten vessels of wild type or ca2 mutant seedlings were collected for mitochondrial preparations. Seedlings (50–100 g) were homogenized with mortar and pestle, and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (25.Lee C.P. Eubel H. O'Toole N. Millar A.H. Heterogeneity of the mitochondrial proteome for photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic Arabidopsis metabolism.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1297-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The protein content of freshly isolated mitochondria was quantified with a Bradford assay protocol before being used for import experiments. Mitochondrial aliquots were washed with 2 ml of sucrose wash buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm TES, pH 7.5) and then centrifuged at 14,300 × g for 10 min. Pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of digitonin solubilization buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mg/ml digitonin). Samples were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min after incubation for 20 min on ice to remove insoluble material and were subsequently supplemented with 5 μl of Serva Blue G250 (5% (w/v) Coomassie Blue in 750 mm aminocaproic acid). Coomassie Blue-treated protein samples were directly loaded onto BN gels. Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously (26.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Blue native electrophoresis for isolation of membrane protein complexes in enzymatically active form.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). Gradient gels (4.5–16% (w/v) acrylamide) were used for the first BN dimension. Second dimension Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels, composed of a 4% stacking gel and a 12% separation gel, were used for separation of protein complex subunits. Electrophoresis parameters and Coomassie staining of BN and BN/SDS-PAGE were carried out as described previously (27.Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. New insights into the respiratory chain of plant mitochondria. Supercomplexes and a unique composition of complex II.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Protein spots in CI+CIII2, CI, and CI subcomplex lanes from BN gels were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin using previously described methods (28.Taylor N.L. Heazlewood J.L. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Differential impact of environmental stresses on the pea mitochondrial proteome.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1122-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) but using only a quarter of the trypsin concentration in order to decrease the effect of trypsin autolysis peaks on MS data interpretation. Peptides were analyzed with an UltraFlex III MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). In-gel digested peptides were reconstituted with 5 μl of a solution containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in double-distilled H2O. Two μl of each sample was spotted onto a MTP 384 MALDI target plate and mixed with 2 μl of spotting matrix (90% acetonitrile, 10% saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in TA90 (90% acetonitrile, 0.01% TFA)). Dried spots were overlaid with 10 μl of cold washing buffer (10 mm NH4H2PO4, 0.1% TFA) and allowed to stand for 10 s before removal by pipette. Spots were analyzed at 50–85% laser intensity with up to 1200 shots for MS analysis per spot. Ions between 700 and 4000 m/z were selected for MS/MS experiments using 3% additional laser power. Masses corresponding to trypsin autolysis products were excluded from analysis. A maximum of 15 molecular ions were analyzed by MS/MS from each gel spot. Tandem mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Biotools (Bruker Daltonics) and an in-house Arabidopsis database comprising ATH1.pep (release 9) from the Arabidopsis Information Resource and the Arabidopsis mitochondrial and plastid protein sets (33,621 sequences; 13,487,170 residues), using the Mascot search engine version 2.3.02 and utilizing error tolerances of ±1.2 Da for MS and ±0.6 Da for MS/MS; “Max Missed Cleavages” set to 1; variable modifications of oxidation (Met) and carbamidomethyl (Cys). Only protein matches with more than two peptides and with ion scores greater than 40 were used for analysis (p < 0.05). For all spots, the 0 and 24 h time points were used for both MS and MS/MS analyses for protein IDs, whereas only the MS data were analyzed for 120 and 168 h. Search results were exported to CSV format for each spot. In order to calculate heavy label incorporation and the relative abundance of NA (natural abundance) and H (heavy labeled) peptide populations, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS data were exported to mzXML files (CompassXport version 3.0 (Bruker)) and were subsequently converted to text files using the ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework version 6.21. Text files were then parsed using a script written in Mathematica version 7.0 (Wolfram Research) for further analysis. Isotopic envelopes were fitted using a two-population model consisting of natural abundance and 15N-labeled fractions with the open source program Isodist (29.Sperling E. Bunner A.E. Sykes M.T.

An average KD among subunits within CI+III2, CI, and 650- and 200-kDa subcomplexes was separately determined at 24, 120, and 168 h. Half-lives of CI+III2, CI, and 650- and 200-kDa subcomplexes at 24, 120, and 168 h were determined from KD as half-life = ln2/KD. The final KD values and half-lives for CI+III2, CI, and 650- and 200-kDa subcomplexes were determined by averaging the values obtained at 24, 120, and 168 h. The full cDNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana CA1 (At1g19580), CA2 (At1g472660), CA3 (At5g66510), 20.9-(At4g16450), CAL1 (At5g63510), CAL2 (At3g48680), and ATPE (At1g51650) were cloned into pDest14 (Invitrogen) using gateway cloning techniques (Invitrogen) for in vitro transcription and translation as described previously (30.Carrie C.

https://openalex.org/W2026700322,"The inhibition of MyoD expression is important for obtaining muscle progenitors that can replenish the satellite cell niche during muscle repair. Progenitors could be derived from either embryonic stem cells or satellite cells. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is important for MyoD expression during embryogenesis and adult muscle regeneration. To date, the mechanistic understanding of MyoD regulation by Hh signaling is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Hh effector, Gli2, regulates MyoD expression and associates with MyoD gene elements. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in pluripotent P19 cells show that Gli2 activity is sufficient and required for efficient MyoD expression during skeletal myogenesis. Inhibition of Hh signaling reduces MyoD expression during satellite cell activation in vitro. In addition to regulating MyoD expression, Hh signaling regulates MyoD transcriptional activity, and MyoD activates Hh signaling in myogenic conversion assays. Finally, Gli2, MyoD, and MEF2C form a protein complex, which enhances MyoD activity on skeletal muscle-related promoters. We therefore link Hh signaling to the function and expression of MyoD protein during myogenesis in stem cells."

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) exhibit potent cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. We therefore sought to determine the effect of reconstituted HDLs (rHDLs) on SMC chemokine expression and proliferation and elucidate the mechanisms. Preincubation of primary human SMCs with rHDLs containing apolipoprotein (apo)A-I and phosphatidylcholine (20 μM, final apoA-I concentration), before stimulation with TNF-α, inhibited CCL2 (54%), CCL5 (38%), and CX3CL1 (33%) protein levels. The chemokine receptors CCR2 (29%) and CX3CR1 (22%) were also reduced by rHDLs. Incubation with rHDLs reduced the NF-κB subunit p65 in the nucleus (39%) and phosphorylated IκBα (28%), both regulators of chemokine expression. Furthermore, rHDLs inhibited the upstream signaling proteins phosphoinositide 3-kinase (37%) and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt, 49%). Incubation with rHDLs strikingly suppressed SMC proliferation (84%) and ERK phosphorylation (pERK, 29%). Finally, siRNA knockdown of the scavenger receptor SR-B1 attenuated rHDL-induced inhibition of SMC chemokine expression, p65, and proliferation, indicating that SR-B1 plays a key role in mediating these effects. Thus, rHDLs reduce SMC chemokine expression (via NF-κB/pAkt inhibition) and proliferation (via pERK inhibition). This has important implications for preventing the pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia, the main cause of early vein graft/stent failure."
https://openalex.org/W1986689815,"A small number of transcription factors, including Oct-3/4 and Sox2, constitute the transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Previous reports suggested that some of these factors form a complex that binds the Oct-Sox element, a composite sequence consisting of closely juxtaposed Oct-3/4 binding and Sox2 binding sites. However, little is known regarding the components of the complex. In this study we show that Sall4, a member of the Spalt-like family of proteins, directly interacts with Sox2 and Oct-3/4.

A small number of transcription factors including Oct-3/4 and Sox2 play a key role in maintaining these properties. Pou5f1 (encoding Oct-3/4) and Sox2 show similar expression profiles during early development. At the blastocyst stage Pou5f1 and Sox2 are expressed in the inner cell mass, a group of cells retaining pluripotency, but not in trophectodermal cells. In vitro, Pou5f1 and Sox2 are expressed in undifferentiated ES cells and become repressed once ES cells are induced to differentiate. The level of Pou5f1 and Sox2 expression is precisely controlled to maintain pluripotency (1Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G.

ES cells establish and maintain a transcriptional network to achieve the precise control of the key transcription factors required for pluripotency. Many target genes of their transcription factors have been identified in ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-seq analyses in mouse ES cells (8Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L.

An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). These analyses led to the identification of two noteworthy features of the network. First, some transcription factors bind to the regulatory elements of members of the network, including themselves, thereby forming positive feedback loops among the network members. Second, members of the network physically interact to form a complex to establish another layer of feedback within the network. Global targets of transcription factors interacting with Oct-3/4 or Nanog have been determined. It is suggested that promoters occupied by multiple transcription factors are active in pluripotent cells, and the consensus motif recognized by these factors is similar to the Oct-Sox element (9Kim J. Chu J. Shen X. Wang J. Orkin S.H. An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that some of these factors form a complex and function at the Oct-Sox element, but it remains to be determined which proteins comprise the complex. Sall4 (Sal-like 4) is a member of the Spalt (Sal)-like (Sall) family of proteins containing multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs. Spalt was first isolated as a homeotic gene required for the development of the head and tail regions in Drosophila (15Kühnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jäckle H.

Sal-like family proteins have been identified in various species ranging from Drosophila to humans. Sall4-null mice die during peri-implantation, and heterozygous mutant mice exhibit anorectal anomalies and exencephaly (17Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S. Matsumoto Y. Takasato M.

It was suggested that this effect was caused by a decrease of Pou5f1 expression that is regulated by Sall4. However, some reports showed that Sall4-null ES cells maintain the expression of Pou5f1 (17Sakaki-Yumoto M. Kobayashi C. Sato A. Fujimura S. Matsumoto Y. Takasato M. Kodama T. Aburatani H.

Moreover, it has been shown that Sall4 positively regulates the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell generation from mouse somatic cells. Sall4 occupies the promoter regions of genes occupied by Oct-3/4, Sox2, and Nanog (22Lim C.Y. Tam W.L. Zhang J. Ang H.S. Jia H. Lipovich L. Ng H.H. Wei C.L. Sung W.K. Robson P. Yang H. Lim B.

As such, it is believed that Sall4 is among the key regulators in the transcriptional network in ES cells. Efforts for systematic isolation of Oct-3/4- and Sox2-interacting factors identified Sall4 as a binding protein (23van den Berg D.L. Snoek T. Mullin N.P. Yates A. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J.

In this study we addressed the question of which proteins form a complex at the Oct-Sox element in mouse ES cells. We identified proteins associated with the Oct-Sox elements by purifying proteins that bind to the elements in vitro. We found that Sall4 directly binds with Sox2 and Oct-3/4 and that Sall4 is associated with the Oct-Sox elements in vivo. Furthermore, we have revealed that Sall4 and Sox2 occupy the same regions of the promoters or enhancers, including the Oct-Sox elements, in a set of genes that is enriched for those active in maintaining pluripotency in ES cells. We furthermore have shown that Sall4, Sox2, and Oct-3/4 are all present at the promoter regions of genes involved in maintaining pluripotency. These results thus demonstrate that Sall4 is involved in the transcriptional regulatory network maintaining pluripotency along with Oct-3/4 and Sox2. E14 mouse ES cells, cultured in feeder-free conditions, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and leukemia inhibitory factor. Transfection of plasmids into mouse ES cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Transfection of plasmids into COS-7 cells was performed using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). Anti-Sall4 antibody was raised against a recombinant N-terminal 533-residue peptide expressed in Escherichia coli. Other primary antibodies were as follows: anti-Sox2 antibody from Santa Cruz (Y-17X) and Abcam (ab15830); anti-Oct-3/4 antibody from Santa Cruz (H-134 and N-19X); anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody clone 16B12 from Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.; anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody clone 3F10 from Roche Applied Science; anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody from Sigma (F3165). Extracts of mouse ES cells or COS-7 cells were diluted and incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody complexes were pulled down with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen). For FLAG-Sall4, COS-7 extracts were diluted and incubated with Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). For immunoblotting, proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore), and detected with ECL, ECL plus, or ECL advance immunoblotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Bacterial GST-Sall4-N and GST-Sall4-C fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro expression of Oct-3/4 or Sox2, TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) was used in the presence of [35S]methionine. The protein complexes were pulled down using glutathione beads. For RNAi design, 19-base pair gene-specific regions were selected using siDirect. Oligonucleotides were cloned into pSuper.retro.puro (Oligoengine). Transfection of shRNA plasmids into mouse ES cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Puromycin selection was performed starting 1 day after transfection and continued for 3 days. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAs were reverse-transcribed using an RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa) and oligo-dT primers. Quantitative PCR was then performed using StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). One day after transfection with shRNA plasmids, ES cells were plated at a clonal density in 6-well plates and incubated for 4 days under puromycin selection. Cells were stained with alkaline phosphatase using an alkaline phosphatase kit (Sigma) to count the alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies. Reporter plasmids and phRL-TK control plasmid were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after the transfection, luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). ChIP assays were carried out as previously described (25Boyer L.A. Lee T.I.

Protein complexes were eluted by incubating the immunoprecipitated beads for 30 min at 37 °C in 25 μl 10 mm dithiothreitol. After the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 50 times and subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated beads were washed once with buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), twice with buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), once with buffer C (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), and once with buffer D (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate). For ChIP and sequential ChIP analyses, quantitative PCR was performed using the 7300 real-time PCR system or StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For ChIP-on-chip analysis, the immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by in vitro transcription, labeled with biotin, and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Promoter 1.0R Arrays (Affymetrix). Hybridization and scanning were performed according to protocols from Affymetrix. Using Tiling Analysis Software (Affymetrix), the probe signals were calculated as the ratio relative to input (bandwidth = 250). Integrated Genome Browser (Affymetrix) was used to visualize the data and gene annotations. To identify the protein binding regions, the following conditions were used: threshold = 0.27, Max Gap = 100, Min Run = 350. Genes between 5.5 kb upstream and 2.5 kb downstream of transcription start site were annotated using genome annotation (mm8) from NCBI. Among the regions positive for both Sall4 and Sox2, Sall4-positive regions overlapping with Sox2-positive regions were termed “overlapping,” and the rest of the Sall4-positive regions were “non-overlapping.” The promoter array data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE40072. To detect the fold differences of gene expression in ES cells relative to differentiated ES cells, we obtained microarray data from a previous study (27Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Dissecting self-renewal in stem cells with RNA interference.Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Genes were annotated using Na32 from Affymetrix. The ratios of CCE_RA_d0/CCE_RA_d6 were calculated and plotted. The ratios in each group were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Total 18781 genes were annotated with GO terms. 12350 GO terms were examined. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate p values for each GO term. It has been shown that the ternary complex consisting of Oct1, which is closely related to Oct-3/4, Sox2, and a target DNA, induces structural changes in each of the three components, thereby establishing cooperative binding (28Reményi A. Lins K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Schöler H.R. Wilmanns M. Crystal structure of a POU/HMG/DNA ternary complex suggests differential assembly of Oct4 and Sox2 on two enhancers.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Anticipating that additional proteins modulate such a complex, we sought to isolate proteins specifically bound with the ternary complex of Oct-3/4, Sox2, and target DNA. To identify such proteins, nuclear extracts derived from mouse E14 ES cells (29Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. HPRT-deficient (Lesch-Nyhan) mouse embryos derived from germline colonization by cultured cells.Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) were subjected to affinity precipitation using biotin-tagged oligonucleotides containing the Oct-Sox element (supplemental Fig. S1). First, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a biotin-tagged double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotide containing a mutated Oct-Sox element (mut-OS oligo, TTGTTCCT-TCCCATT; the underlines indicate the substituted nucleotides for the consensus Oct-Sox element sequence) that does not bind to the Oct-3/4-Sox2 complex. These same nucleotide substitutions diminished the promoter activity of the Nanog gene (10Kuroda T. Tada M. Kubota H. Kimura H. Hatano S.Y. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T.

The Oct-3/4-Sox2-mut-OS oligonucleotide complex did not form in an EMSA experiment (supplemental Fig. S1B). After the preincubation, avidin-conjugated magnetic beads were added, and mut-OS bound protein fractions were recovered by magnetic separation. Next, the mut-OS unbound protein fraction (supernatant) was incubated with a biotin-tagged ds-oligonucleotide containing the wild-type Oct-Sox element (wt-OS oligo, ATTAGCAT-AACAATG). The wt-OS nucleotide consensus sequence was deduced from the Oct-Sox elements found in the Fgf4, Fbxo15, Nanog, Sox2, and Utf1 genes (7Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H.

https://openalex.org/W2010925232,"The Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 has been known to regulate various signaling pathways triggered by receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Here we describe a novel function of Shp2 in control of lipid metabolism by mediating degradation of fatty acid synthase (FASN). p38-phosphorylated COP1 accumulates in the cytoplasm and subsequently binds FASN through Shp2 here as an adapter, leading to FASN-Shp2-COP1 complex formation and FASN degradation mediated by ubiquitination pathway. By fasting p38 is activated and stimulates FASN protein degradation in mice. Consistently, the FASN protein levels are dramatically elevated in mouse liver and pancreas in which Shp2/Ptpn11 is selectively deleted. Thus, this study identifies a new activity for Shp2 in lipid metabolism."

We show that the triacidic amino acid sequence is critical for hemITAM phosphorylation but that CLEC-2 is unable to signal via Zap-70.

Twenty hours after transfection, live cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion and samples divided for luciferase assay (1 × 105/well) and flow cytometry (5 × 105). Luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (29Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A.

Luciferase activity was measured with a Centro LB 960 microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies). All luciferase data were averaged from triplicate readings. Surface expression of Myc-tagged CLEC-2 was measured by flow cytometry. Cells (5 × 105) were stained in a 25 μl volume for 20 min on ice with 10 μg/ml α-Myc antibody. Cells were then washed and incubated for 20 min on ice with 15 μg/ml FITC-conjugated α-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were collected and analyzed using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore T100 machine (Biacore, GE Healthcare). Biotin-tagged CLEC-2 peptides were attached to carboxymethylated dextran-coated CM5 research grade sensor chips (Biacore) following attachment of streptavidin to the chip surface using amine coupling. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20. GST-tagged recombinant Syk domains were expressed and purified as described previously (3Hughes C.E. Pollitt A.Y. Mori J. Eble J.A. Tomlinson M.G. Hartwig J.H. O'Callaghan C.A. Fütterer K. Watson S.P. CLEC-2 activates Syk through dimerization.Blood. 2010; 115: 2947-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The domains expressed were the N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2), the C-terminal SH2 domain (C-SH2), and both SH2 domains with the linker region, referred to as the tandem SH2 domains (tSH2). A range of concentrations (0–250 μm) of N-SH2, C-SH2, and tSH2 domains were injected over all peptide surfaces to determine equilibrium dissociation constants (KD). Specific binding was identified by subtraction of the signal from an appropriate reference flow cell. KD values were derived by nonlinear fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in the program Origin (OriginLab). NFAT-luciferase data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired Student's t test. Significance was taken for p < 0.05. Zap-70 and Syk are the only two members of a family of tyrosine kinases characterized by the presence of tandem SH2 domains and shown to mediate signaling by ITAM receptors. To date, there has been no comparison of the ability of Zap-70 and Syk to mediate signaling by hemITAM receptors. To address this, Syk−/− DT40 cells were transiently transfected with CLEC-2 and either Syk or Zap-70, and activation was monitored using a highly sensitive NFAT reporter assay.

The purpose of this study was to provide further insight into its multiple roles at the whole-animal level, using Drosophila. Reduced expression of dPrx4 (up to 90%) resulted in greater sensitivity to oxidative stress, an elevated H₂O₂ flux, and increases in lipid peroxidation, but no effect on longevity. Overexpression at low levels (<2-fold) gave reduced levels of oxidative damage and tended to show an increase in longevity. Flies expressing dPrx4 globally at high levels (>5-fold) had a dramatically reduced life span (by 20-80%) and increased apoptosis. Analysis of these overexpressors revealed an aberrant redistribution of the dPrx4 protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cytosol and hemolymph. In addition to the known proapoptotic effects of the cytosolic form of dPrx4, dPrx4 overexpression triggered an NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory response, similar to that observed in cells under ER stress or when microbially challenged. Finally, we provide the first evidence that dPrx4, on secretion into the hemolymph, elicits a JAK/STAT-mediated response. The effects on fly survival and homeostasis appear to represent a combination of differential effects dictated in large part by dPrx4 subcellular and tissue-specific localization."

However, the concept that it is not just the absence or presence of cyclic nucleotides, but a highly coordinated balance between these molecules that regulates cell migration, is new and revolutionary. In this study, we used multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4)-expressing cell lines and MRP4 knock-out mice as model systems and wound healing assays as the experimental system to explore this unique and emerging concept. MRP4, a member of a large family of ATP binding cassette transporter proteins, localizes to the plasma membrane and functions as a nucleotide efflux transporter and thus plays a role in the regulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels. Here, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Mrp4−/− mice have higher intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels and migrate faster compared with MEFs from Mrp4+/+ mice. Using FRET-based cAMP and cGMP sensors, we show that inhibition of MRP4 with MK571 increases both cAMP and cGMP levels, which results in increased migration. In contrast to these moderate increases in cAMP and cGMP levels seen in the absence of MRP4, a robust increase in cAMP levels was observed following treatment with forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine, which decreases fibroblast migration. In response to externally added cell-permeant cyclic nucleotides (cpt-cAMP and cpt-cGMP), MEF migration appears to be biphasic.

https://openalex.org/W1971858021,"Accumulating evidence suggests that reactive astrogliosis has beneficial and detrimental outcomes in various CNS disorders, but the mechanism behind this dichotomy is unclear. Recent advances in this direction suggested that NO signaling is critical to regulate the outcomes of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we here investigated the effect of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; a physiological NO donor) in astrocytes in vitro settings. GSNO enhanced the expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurotrophic factors including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The enhanced CNTF expression in GSNO-treated astrocytes was ascribed to NO-mediated sGC/cGMP/PKG signaling. It was associated with p38 MAPK-dependent increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ transactivation. In addition, the chromatin accessibility of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ accompanied with ATF2 and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) was enhanced across the CNTF gene promoter in GSNO treated astrocytes. Interestingly, secreted CNTF was responsible for increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in GSNO-treated astrocytes in an autocrine manner via a JAK2- and STAT3-dependent mechanism. In addition, CNTF secreted by GSNO-treated astrocytes enhanced the differentiation of immature oligodendrocytes in vitro. These effects of GSNO were consistent with an endogenously produced NO in astrocytes stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. We conclude that NO signaling induces CNTF expression in astrocytes that favors the beneficial outcomes of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. Our data suggest that the endogenously produced NO or its exogenous source has potential to modulate the outcomes of reactive astrogliosis to protect CNS under pathological conditions."

Flexible gates. Dynamic topologies and functions for FG nucleoporins in nucleocytoplasmic transport.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 1814-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)). Selective transport of macromolecules across the NPC is highly efficient. Whereas very large proteins or ribonucleoprotein particles up to the size of ribosomal subunits may pass this gate at a high rate, passage of other, much smaller proteins can be restricted. A subclass of ∼10 nucleoporins containing several phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motives are well accepted as important components of the selectivity barrier. FG repeats are known to interact with soluble nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) that mediate the translocation of transport substrates across the nuclear envelope (3Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Structural basis for the interaction between FxFG nucleoporin repeats and importin-β in nuclear trafficking.Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These NTRs mostly belong to the family of importin β-like proteins, also referred to as karyopherins. The prototype is importin β itself, which together with its adapter importin α interacts in the cytoplasm with proteins carrying a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS; for review see Ref. 4Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. Classical nuclear localization signals. Definition, function, and interaction with importin α.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Another major importin with a large number of identified substrates is transportin (5Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. A novel receptor-mediated nuclear protein import pathway.Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), which recognizes a specific localization signal, the PY-NLS (for review see Ref. 6Xu D. Farmer A. Chook Y.M. Recognition of nuclear targeting signals by Karyopherin-β proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For other import receptors like importin 5, importin 7, importin 9, or importin 13, only a limited number of substrates have been found so far and their cognate NLSs remain to be described in detail (6Xu D. Farmer A. Chook Y.M. Recognition of nuclear targeting signals by Karyopherin-β proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Exportins, on the other hand, interact with their cargo in the nucleus via nuclear export sequences (NESs; for review see Ref. 7Hutten S. Kehlenbach R.H. CRM1-mediated nuclear export. To the pore and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Binding of transport cargoes to their receptors is controlled by the small G-protein Ran, which interacts with all importin β-like proteins. In nuclear import, nuclear RanGTP binds to a conserved region present in all importins and exportins and dissociates the binding of incoming NLS substrates, terminating transport (8Rexach M. Blobel G. Protein import into nuclei. Association and dissociation reactions involving transport substrate, transport factors, and nucleoporins.Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The import receptor can then recycle back to the cytoplasm in a complex with RanGTP. In nuclear export, by contrast, RanGTP is an integral component of a trimeric transport complex as it promotes the interaction of NES cargos with exportins in the nucleus (9Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich nuclear export signals.Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). After translocation through the NPC, GTP hydrolysis on Ran then initiates the dissociation of the export complex. The localization of GTP hydrolysis and GTP loading of Ran is largely restricted to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. This results from the strict compartmentalization of the cytoplasmic GTPase-activating protein for Ran, RanGAP, and the chromatin-bound nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation 1; for review see Ref. 10Fried H. Kutay U. Nucleocytoplasmic transport. Taking an inventory.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Besides controlling the cargo-receptor interaction, RanGTP also affects binding of NTRs to FG-Nups, either negatively (8Rexach M. Blobel G. Protein import into nuclei. Association and dissociation reactions involving transport substrate, transport factors, and nucleoporins.Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) or positively (11Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. RanGTP Targets p97 to RanBP2, a filamentous protein localized at the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear pore complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular details and consequences of the Nup-NTR interaction will be required to mechanistically explain nucleocytoplasmic transport through the NPC. In the selective phase model (12Ribbeck K. Görlich D. Kinetic analysis of translocation through nuclear pore complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), FG-Nups were suggested to be cohesive, resulting in a sieve-like structure that restricts passage of proteins unable to interact with the FG motives. Transport complexes containing NTRs, by contrast, bind to these motives, leading to disengagement of the FG-FG contacts and to partitioning of the complex into the sieve. RanGTP binding on the nuclear side (import) or GTP hydrolysis on Ran on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC (export) then confers directionality to the transport event. In other models, like the virtual gate model (13Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Magnasco M.O. Chait B.T. Virtual gating and nuclear transport. The hole picture.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 622-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), FG-Nups that are predominantly noncohesive are postulated to form FG filaments, repelling proteins that do not interact with FG motives by entropic forces. nucleoporin amino acids classical NLS chromosome region maintenance 1 phenylalanine glycine glucocorticoid receptor negative cofactor 2β nuclear export signal nuclear factor of activated T-cells nuclear localization signal nuclear pore complex nuclear transport receptor Ras-related nuclear protein Ran GTPase-activating protein Snurportin 1. Although certain FG-Nups may play a more prominent role in establishing the selective barrier than others (14Hülsmann B.B. Labokha A.A. Görlich D. The permeability of reconstituted nuclear pores provides direct evidence for the selective phase model.Cell. 2012; 150: 738-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), multiple nucleoporins are thought to act together as a functional entity in all current models. Besides this collaborative role of FG-Nups as components of the general permeability barrier of the NPC, individual nucleoporins were shown to play roles in specific transport pathways as defined by specific NTRs. The cytoplasmic nucleoporin Nup358, for example, plays a general role in nuclear protein import, but not in export (15Hamada M. Haeger A. Jeganathan K.B. van Ree J.H. Malureanu L. Wälde S. Joseph J.

In addition, it is required for efficient import of a subset of proteins (18Wälde S. Thakar K. Hutten S. Spillner C. Nath A. Rothbauer U. Wiemann S. Kehlenbach R.H.

Nup214, also known as CAN, is also found at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, but has been implicated in nuclear protein export rather than import (19Bernad R. Engelsma D. Sanderson H. Pickersgill H.

Interestingly, Nup214 was found in multiple fusions with nuclear proteins like the histone chaperone Set or the chromatin-binding protein Dek, leading to oncogenic transformation (for review see Ref. 24Xu S. Powers M.A. Nuclear pore proteins and cancer.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The predicted domains of Nup214 (Fig. 1A) are not very well characterized at the structural level. An exception is the N-terminal domain, which was shown to form a seven-bladed β-propeller (25Napetschnig J. Blobel G. Hoelz A.

CRM1 mediates nuclear export of hundreds of proteins carrying typical hydrophobic sequences that were originally described as leucine-rich NESs (30Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W.

https://openalex.org/W2161267015,"Caspases are important regulators and executioners in the apoptosis pathways and play crucial roles in carcinogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that functional variants of CASP genes are associated with risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and second primary malignancy (SPM). We genotyped 7 selected, potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the microRNA binding sites of the 3' untranslational region (UTR; 2 in CASP3, 1 in CASP6, and 4 in CASP7) and evaluated their associations first with risk of SCCHN in 1066 patients with SCCHN and 1074 cancer-free control subjects and then with SPM in 846 patients in the same non-Hispanic white study population. We found that compared with the CASP3 TT genotype of rs1049253, the variant TC/CC genotypes were associated with significantly increased risk of SCCHN (adjusted odds ratio=1.29 and 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.56) and SPM (adjusted hazard ratio=1.79 and 95% CI=1.02-3.16) and worse SPM-free survival (log-rank P = 0.020), but no associations were found for the other 6 SNPs. We then performed additional experiments to seek functional relevance of the rs1049253 SNP. First, the luciferase activity and miR-885-5p mimic transfection tests suggested that CASP3 was the target of miR-885-5p and that rs1049253T>C resulted in altered regulation of the CASP3 expression. Second, the rs1049253 CC genotype was associated with reduced levels of CASP3 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 118 SCCHN patients and 103 cancer-free control subjects and lower levels of CASP3 protein expression in 11 head and neck cancer cell lines, compared with the TT genotype. Taken together, our data suggest that the miR-885-5p binding site rs1049253T>C SNP in the 3'-UTR of CASP3 modulates CASP3 expression at both mRNA and protein levels and thus contributes to SCCHN susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2073967491,"α-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a molecular chaperone that binds monomeric α-subunits of human hemoglobin A (HbA) and modulates heme iron oxidation and subunit folding states. Although AHSP·αHb complexes autoxidize more rapidly than HbA, the redox mechanisms appear to be similar. Both metHbA and isolated met-β-subunits undergo further oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to form ferryl heme species. Surprisingly, much lower levels of H(2)O(2)-induced ferryl heme are produced by free met-α-subunits as compared with met-β-subunits, and no ferryl heme is detected in H(2)O(2)-treated AHSP·met-α-complex at pH values from 5.0 to 9.0 at 23 °C. Ferryl heme species were similarly not detected in AHSP·met-α Pro-30 mutants known to exhibit different rates of autoxidation and hemin loss. EPR data suggest that protein-based radicals associated with the ferryl oxidation state exist within HbA α- and β-subunits. In contrast, treatment of free α-subunits with H(2)O(2) yields much smaller radical signals, and no radicals are detected when H(2)O(2) is added to AHSP·α-complexes. AHSP binding also dramatically reduces the redox potential of α-subunits, from +40 to -78 mV in 1 m glycine buffer, pH 6.0, at 8 °C, demonstrating independently that AHSP has a much higher affinity for Fe(III) versus Fe(II) α-subunits. Hexacoordination in the AHSP·met-α complex markedly decreases the rate of the initial H(2)O(2) reaction with iron and thus provides α-subunits protection against damaging oxidative reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2014895093,"Post-translational phosphorylation plays critical roles in the assembly of signaling and repair proteins in the DNA damage response pathway. RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, is crucial in cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair. However, its molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we identified Cdk1 as a new RAP80-binding protein and demonstrated that the Cdk1-cyclin B(1) complex phosphorylates RAP80 at Ser-677 using an in vitro kinase assay and a phosphopeptide-specific antibody against phospho-Ser-677 of RAP80. RAP80 Ser-677 phosphorylation occurred in the M phase of the cell cycle when Cdk1 was in an active state. In addition, ionizing radiation (IR) induced RAP80 phosphorylation at Ser-677. Mutation of Ser-677 to alanine sensitized cells to IR and functioned in G(2)/M checkpoint control. These results suggest that post-translational phosphorylation of RAP80 by the Cdk1-cyclin B(1) complex is important for RAP80 functional sensitivity to IR and G(2)/M checkpoint control."
https://openalex.org/W2073327767,"Stable intercellular adhesions formed through the cadherin-catenin complex are important determinants of proper tissue architecture and help maintain tissue integrity during morphogenetic movements in developing embryos. A key regulator of this stability is α-catenin, which connects the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Although the C-terminal F-actin-binding domain of α-catenin has been shown to be crucial for its function, a more detailed in vivo analysis of discrete regions and residues required for actin binding has not been performed. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we have characterized mutations in hmp-1/α-catenin that identify HMP-1 residues 687–742 and 826–927, as well as amino acid 802, as critical to the localization of junctional proximal actin during epidermal morphogenesis. We also find that the S823F transition in a hypomorphic allele, hmp-1(fe4), decreases actin binding in vitro. Using hmp-1(fe4) animals in a mutagenesis screen, we were then able to identify 11 intragenic suppressors of hmp-1(fe4) that revert actin binding to wild-type levels. Using homology modeling, we show that these amino acids are positioned at key conserved sites within predicted α-helices in the C terminus. Through the use of transgenic animals, we also demonstrate that HMP-1 residues 315–494, which correspond to a putative mechanotransduction domain that binds vinculin in vertebrate αE-catenin, are not required during epidermal morphogenesis but may aid efficient recruitment of HMP-1 to the junction. Our studies are the first to identify key conserved amino acids in the C terminus of α-catenin that modulate F-actin binding in living embryos of a simple metazoan.Background: α-Catenin is a crucial link between adherens junctions and F-actin.Results: C-terminal amino acids in HMP-1/α-catenin quantitatively modulate its ability to bind F-actin, but a putative vinculin-binding domain is not required in vivo.Conclusion: Key C-terminal residues in α-catenin modulate its ability to bind F-actin.Significance: This is the first genetic dissection of the ability of α-catenin to bind F-actin. Stable intercellular adhesions formed through the cadherin-catenin complex are important determinants of proper tissue architecture and help maintain tissue integrity during morphogenetic movements in developing embryos. A key regulator of this stability is α-catenin, which connects the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Although the C-terminal F-actin-binding domain of α-catenin has been shown to be crucial for its function, a more detailed in vivo analysis of discrete regions and residues required for actin binding has not been performed. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we have characterized mutations in hmp-1/α-catenin that identify HMP-1 residues 687–742 and 826–927, as well as amino acid 802, as critical to the localization of junctional proximal actin during epidermal morphogenesis. We also find that the S823F transition in a hypomorphic allele, hmp-1(fe4), decreases actin binding in vitro. Using hmp-1(fe4) animals in a mutagenesis screen, we were then able to identify 11 intragenic suppressors of hmp-1(fe4) that revert actin binding to wild-type levels. Using homology modeling, we show that these amino acids are positioned at key conserved sites within predicted α-helices in the C terminus. Through the use of transgenic animals, we also demonstrate that HMP-1 residues 315–494, which correspond to a putative mechanotransduction domain that binds vinculin in vertebrate αE-catenin, are not required during epidermal morphogenesis but may aid efficient recruitment of HMP-1 to the junction. Our studies are the first to identify key conserved amino acids in the C terminus of α-catenin that modulate F-actin binding in living embryos of a simple metazoan. Background: α-Catenin is a crucial link between adherens junctions and F-actin. Results: C-terminal amino acids in HMP-1/α-catenin quantitatively modulate its ability to bind F-actin, but a putative vinculin-binding domain is not required in vivo. Conclusion: Key C-terminal residues in α-catenin modulate its ability to bind F-actin. Significance: This is the first genetic dissection of the ability of α-catenin to bind F-actin.

Proper development requires that cadherin-based adhesions be highly adaptable; they must be stable enough to transmit forces to the cell surface that drive cell shape changes and tissue architecture, but at the same time dynamic enough to allow the cell rearrangements and morphogenetic movements required to shape the embryo (1.Gumbiner B.M.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that interactions between α-catenin and the actin cytoskeleton occur through both direct and indirect mechanisms, and the contribution of each depends on the cellular context (33.Maiden S.L. Hardin J. The secret life of α-catenin. Moonlighting in morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently αE-catenin has been shown to be a coactivator of vinculin (26.Choi H.J. Pokutta S. Cadwell G.W. Bobkov A.A. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Weis W.I. αE-catenin is an autoinhibited molecule that coactivates vinculin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 8576-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the binding of vinculin to αE-catenin has been found to be force-dependent, suggesting a role for αE-catenin in mechanotransduction (22.Yonemura S. Wada Y. Watanabe T. Nagafuchi A. Shibata M. α-Catenin as a tension transducer that induces adherens junction development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether or not this function is conserved among other α-catenins. Detailed in vivo analysis of α-catenin function in mammals has been difficult due to its requirement in early development (23.Torres M. Stoykova A. Huber O. Chowdhury K. Bonaldo P. Mansouri A. Butz S. Kemler R. Gruss P. An αE-catenin gene trap mutation defines its function in preimplantation development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated recombination has allowed several studies to temporally control conditional ablation of α-catenin in specific tissues (34.Lien W.H. Klezovitch O. Fernandez T.E. Delrow J. Vasioukhin V. αE-catenin controls cerebral cortical size by regulating the hedgehog signaling pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35.Vasioukhin V.

Hyperproliferation and defects in epithelial polarity upon conditional ablation of α-catenin in skin.Cell. 2001; 104: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar); however, this method has only been used to create null mutants rather than to examine requirements for specific domains or single amino acids of α-catenin. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a unique opportunity to study the requirements for α-catenin function in a simple metazoan. This powerful invertebrate model system is amenable to mutagenesis and genetic manipulation, and its transparency allows the visualization of complex morphogenetic movements during development. There are conserved C. elegans homologs for each of the main CCC proteins: HMR-1/cadherin, JAC-1/p120-catenin, HMP-2/β-catenin, and HMP-1/α-catenin (36.Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 37.Pettitt J. Cox E.A. Broadbent I.D. Flett A. Hardin J. The Caenorhabditis elegans p120 catenin homologue, JAC-1, modulates cadherin-catenin function during epidermal morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). HMP-1 is 35–38% identical to vertebrate and invertebrate α-catenins (36.Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike vertebrates, HMP-1 is the sole α-catenin homolog in C. elegans, removing any issues of functional redundancy. Mutations in hmp-1 result in a characteristic defect during epidermal morphogenesis, when Rho-dependent actomyosin-mediated contractile forces are transmitted along circumferential actin filament bundles (CFBs) to cell-cell junctions to drive the cell shape changes necessary for elongation of the embryo. Strong zygotic loss-of-function (LOF) hmp-1 mutants exhibit loss of junctional proximal actin and detachment of CFBs, which leads to the formation of dorsal folds in the epidermis (the Humpback phenotype). Removal of both maternal and zygotic HMP-1 via RNAi or through germline mosaics results in a more severe phenotype, in which ventral epidermal cells fail to properly adhere to one another. This results in anterior rupture of the embryo at the onset of elongation, mimicking mutations in hmr-1/E-cadherin (36.Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we identify discrete regions and single amino acids in the HMP-1/α-catenin ABD that modulate attachment to F-actin. Through characterization of hmp-1 alleles isolated in a previous EMS mutagenesis screen (36.Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we have identified residues 687–742, 826–927, and 802, all within the ABD, as critical to proper HMP-1 function and actin binding during epidermal morphogenesis. Utilizing a hypomorphic allele, hmp-1(fe4), we have also used EMS mutagenesis to identify second site mutations in the ABD that alleviate the fe4 weak LOF phenotype. Through in vitro actin cosedimentation assays, we find that these mutations are able to rescue the ability of HMP-1 to bind F-actin directly. Through the use of transgenic deletion constructs, we also show that residues 315–494 of HMP-1, the putative vinculin-binding domain, are not essential for embryonic development. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of embryos expressing a construct lacking this region nevertheless suggests that this domain may be required for efficient targeting of HMP-1 to the CCC. C. elegans strains were cultured using standard protocols (38.Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bristol strain N2 was used as wild-type. The strong zygotic loss-of-function hmp-1 mutants were derived from a previous EMS mutagenesis screen (36.Costa M. Raich W. Agbunag C. Leung B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. A putative catenin-cadherin system mediates morphogenesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For a complete list, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the ability of different domains of HMP-1 to rescue hmp-1(zu278), hmp-1::gfp deletion constructs were microinjected (39.Mello C. Fire A. DNA transformation.Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) at 1 ng/μl along with rol-6(su1006) (79 ng/μl) and noncoding DNA (F35D3, 20 ng/μl) into the gonads of either N2 or SU370 (+/nT1[qIs5I] IV; hmp-1(zu278)/nT1[qIs5I] V) hermaphrodites. Extrachromosomal arrays maintained in N2 were crossed into SU370 hermaphrodites later. If hmp-1(zu278) mutant embryos were rescued to viability, a separate line was maintained. For a complete list of strains, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” hmp-1(fe4) suppressors were isolated from nonclonal screens by mutagenizing hmp-1(fe4) homozygotes with 50 mm EMS and starting cultures with individual mutagenized adults. Once the F2 generation had reached adulthood, plates were screened by eye for morphologically wild-type animals. In some cases, the animals picked still segregated a proportion of Vab progeny, suggesting either that they were heterozygous and that the mutations might be dominant/semi-dominant, or that the suppressor effect was incompletely penetrated. In each case we were able to establish strains that segregated almost completely wild-type animals, indicating that the former explanation was more likely. Subsequent outcrosses with unmutagenized hmp-1(fe4) homozygotes confirmed this assessment. For strong LOF alleles, individual homozygous hmp-1 mutant embryos were isolated based on phenotype and treated for 2 min with a 20 mg/ml of chitinase solution. If hatchoids were chosen, no chitinase was used. Embryos were transferred to 5 μl of single worm lysis buffer and frozen for 15 min at 80 °C, then lysed at 65 °C for 1 h followed by 95 °C for 15 min. Embryonic lysate was used to PCR amplify fragments of hmp-1 and the products were cloned using the pCR8/GW/TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, K250020). Clones were miniprepped and DNA was sequenced via Sanger sequencing through the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. For fe4 intragenic suppressors, genomic DNA was amplified from single worm lysates derived from each suppressor mutant strain using primer pairs hmp1ex1/3S-3AS, hmp1ex4/5S-5AS, hmp1ex6–1/6–2, hmp1ex7–1/7–2 and hmp1ex8–1/8–2 (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for sequences), which amplify exons 1–3, 4–5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The resulting PCR products were sequenced directly. This also allowed the verification of the presence of the original fe4 mutation. In only one strain was the fe4 mutation found to be absent, suggesting that this was a revertant. Embryos were isolated from plates and gravid hermaphrodites with 0.5% NaOCl in 250 mm NaOH for 5 min followed by three washes in distilled deionized water. For phalloidin staining, embryos were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated ring slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 mg/ml of lysolecithin, 48 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA for 20 min and then washed three times with PBS. Embryos were incubated in the dark with 1:20 Alexa 555:phalloidin in PBST overnight at 4 °C, then washed three times with PBS before being covered with antifade reagent and sealed with nail polish. For antibody staining, embryos were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated ring slides and covered with a coverslip. Slides were quick frozen for 10 min on dry ice, then the coverslips were removed with a razor blade. Slides were immediately transferred to methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, acetone at −20 °C for 5 min, and PBST at room temperature for 5 min, followed by two additional PBST washes. Embryos were incubated with 1:3000 rabbit anti-HMP-1 and 1:20 mouse anti-AJM-1 (MH27) in 0.5% milk/PBST in the dark overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times with PBST then incubated in the dark for 4 h at room temperature with 1:50 anti-rabbit Texas Red and 1:50 anti-mouse FITC in 0.5% milk/PBST. Slides were washed three times with PBST before being covered with antifade reagent and sealed with nail polish. Using an existing hmp-1::gfp containing the endogenous promoter, 5 targeted in-frame deletions were created using site-directed mutagenesis. Forward and reverse primers flanking the region to be deleted were used to create a linear PCR product. Subsequent phosphorylation and ligation created a circular plasmid that was transformed into DH5α competent cells. Deletion-positive clones were identified via gel electrophoresis and sequencing. For the actin cosedimentation assays, a previously published gst::hmp-1(677–927) (21.Kwiatkowski A.V. Maiden S.L. Pokutta S. Choi H.J. Benjamin J.M. Lynch A.M. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Hardin J.

https://openalex.org/W1967543279,"The PriA protein serves as an initiator for the restart of DNA replication on stalled replication forks and as a checkpoint protein that prevents the replicase from advancing in a strand displacement reaction on forks that do not contain a functional replicative helicase. We have developed a primosomal protein-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay using a minimal fork substrate composed of synthetic oligonucleotides. We demonstrate that a self-loading reaction, which proceeds at high helicase concentrations, occurs by threading of a preassembled helicase over free 5'-ends, an event that can be blocked by attaching a steric block to the 5'-end or coating DNA with single-stranded DNA binding protein. The specificity of PriA for replication forks is regulated by its intrinsic ATPase. ATPase-defective PriA K230R shows a strong preference for substrates that contain no gap between the leading strand and the duplex portion of the fork, as demonstrated previously. Wild-type PriA prefers substrates with larger gaps, showing maximal activity on substrates on which PriA K230R is inactive. We demonstrate that PriA blocks replicase function on forks by blocking its binding."
https://openalex.org/W1995100763,"Friedreich ataxia is an early-onset multisystemic disease linked to a variety of molecular defects in the nuclear gene FRDA. This gene normally encodes the iron-binding protein frataxin (FXN), which is critical for mitochondrial iron metabolism, global cellular iron homeostasis, and antioxidant protection. In most Friedreich ataxia patients, a large GAA-repeat expansion is present within the first intron of both FRDA alleles, that results in transcriptional silencing ultimately leading to insufficient levels of FXN protein in the mitochondrial matrix and probably other cellular compartments. The lack of FXN in turn impairs incorporation of iron into iron-sulfur cluster and heme cofactors, causing widespread enzymatic deficits and oxidative damage catalyzed by excess labile iron. In a minority of patients, a typical GAA expansion is present in only one FRDA allele, whereas a missense mutation is found in the other allele. Although it is known that the disease course for these patients can be as severe as for patients with two expanded FRDA alleles, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not understood. Human cells normally contain two major mitochondrial isoforms of FXN (FXN(42-210) and FXN(81-210)) that have different biochemical properties and functional roles. Using cell-free systems and different cellular models, we show that two of the most clinically severe FXN point mutations, I154F and W155R, have unique direct and indirect effects on the stability, biogenesis, or catalytic activity of FXN(42-210) and FXN(81-210) under physiological conditions. Our data indicate that frataxin point mutations have complex biochemical effects that synergistically contribute to the pathophysiology of Friedreich ataxia."

In the lung, epithelial cells serve as the initial barrier to airway infections, yet their responses to B. cenocepacia have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the molecular responses of human airway epithelial cells to B. cenocepacia infection. Infection led to early signaling events such as activation of Erk, Akt, and NF-κB. Further, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β were all significantly induced upon infection, but no IL-1β was detected in the supernatants. Because caspase-1 is required for IL-1β processing and release, we examined its expression in airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, little to no caspase-1 was detectable in airway epithelial cells. Transfection of caspase-1 into airway epithelial cells restored their ability to secrete IL-1β following B. cenocepacia infection, suggesting that a deficiency in caspase-1 is responsible, at least in part, for the attenuated IL-1β secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2004641814,"Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) is a multidomain, membrane-associated receptor guanylyl cyclase. GC-C is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, where it mediates fluid-ion homeostasis, intestinal inflammation, and cell proliferation in a cGMP-dependent manner, following activation by its ligands guanylin, uroguanylin, or the heat-stable enterotoxin peptide (ST). GC-C is also expressed in neurons, where it plays a role in satiation and attention deficiency/hyperactive behavior.

Systematic mutagenesis of each of the 10 sites of glycosylation in GC-C, either singly or in combination, identified two sites that were critical for ligand binding and two that regulated ST-mediated activation. We also show that GC-C is the first identified receptor client of the lectin chaperone vesicular integral membrane protein, VIP36. Interaction with VIP36 is dependent on glycosylation at the same sites that allow GC-C to fold and bind ligand.

An important causative agent for watery diarrhea in children and travelers to developing countries is the heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) 2The abbreviations used are: STheat-stable enterotoxin peptideGC-Aguanylyl cyclase AGC-Bguanylyl cyclase BGC-Cguanylyl cyclase CPNGase FPeptide-N-Glycosidase FVIP 36vesicular integral membrane protein of 36 kDa. peptide, which disrupts intestinal fluid and ion secretion, leading to secretory diarrhea (2Field M.

Guanylyl cyclase C is the receptor for the ST peptides and is a member of the membrane-associated receptor guanylyl cyclase family. The endogenous ligands for GC-C are the gastrointestinal hormones, guanylin and uroguanylin, which, on binding GC-C, lead to receptor activation and cGMP production (3Hamra F.K. Forte L.R. Eber S.L.

ST is a superagonist of GC-C, and the abnormally high levels of intracellular cGMP produced on ST binding to GC-C cause aberrant fluid-ion efflux, leading to diarrhea (6Kopic S. Geibel J.P.

Med. 2012; 366: 1586-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Members of a Norwegian family presented with a dominantly inherited, fully penetrant syndrome of frequent diarrhea, caused by a heterozygous mutation in GUCY2C (14Fiskerstrand T. Arshad N.

Familial diarrhea syndrome caused by an activating GUCY2C mutation.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 1586-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We reported that the effect of the Ser840 mutation to an Ile in GC-C resulted in a hyper-responsive form of GC-C, whereby levels of cGMP produced by the mutant receptor on ligand binding were 6–10-fold higher than observed for the wild type receptor. These elevated levels of cGMP could have caused the frequent diarrhea that is seen in patients, but additional clinical features such as a heightened susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease revealed additional roles of GC-C in the intestine. A second study reported inactivating mutations of GC-C in a small Bedouin population where an amino acid substitution in the extracellular domain reduced cGMP production by ∼50%, and an insertion of a single base pair in the intracellular domain resulted in truncation of the receptor before the C-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain (15Romi H. Cohen I. Landau D. Alkrinawi S. Yerushalmi B. Hershkovitz R. Newman-Heiman N. Cutting G.R. Ofir R. Sivan S. Birk O.S.

These patients reported multiple disturbances, which led to meconium ileus, and blockage of the small intestine caused by thick mucoid stools, presumably as a result of inadequate fluid secretion via the GC-C signaling pathway. Interestingly, human data contrast with that seen in mice, where the GC-C knock-out mouse was normal in terms of gastrointestinal function. These critical roles of GC-C in human disease warrant a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which the activity of human GC-C is regulated. GC-C has an extracellular domain that is involved in ligand binding (5Basu N. Arshad N. Visweswariah S.S. Receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C): regulation and signal transduction.Mol Cell Biochem. 2010; 334: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A single transmembrane domain is followed by a pseudokinase domain with sequence similarity to protein kinases (16Jaleel M. Saha S. Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S.

The C-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain is linked to the kinase homology domain by a linker region (18Saha S. Biswas K.H. Kondapalli C. Isloor N. Visweswariah S.S.

We have shown that the kinase homology domain binds ATP and mutation of a critical lysine residue involved in interacting with the β-phosphate of ATP prevents ligand-mediated activation of GC-C (16Jaleel M.

The linker region appears to adopt a helical structure and extensive mutational analysis demonstrated the critical requirement of the linker in repressing the guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor in the absence of its ligands (18Saha S.

In the case of GC-C, the activity of the guanylyl cyclase domain is down regulated by phosphorylation by c-src tyrosine kinase (19Basu N. Bhandari R. Natarajan V.T. Visweswariah S.S. Cross talk between receptor guanylyl cyclase C and c-src tyrosine kinase regulates colon cancer cell cytostasis.Mol. Cell.

In the current study, we focused our attention on the extracellular domain of GC-C and the role of glycosylation in mediating ligand binding and receptor activation. Differentially N-glycosylated forms of GC-C are seen in both intestinal cells (21Ghanekar Y. Chandrashaker A. Visweswariah S.S. Cellular refractoriness to the heat-stable enterotoxin peptide is associated with alterations in levels of the differentially glycosylated forms of guanylyl cyclase C.Eur. J.

J. 2004; 379: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have now identified sites for glycosylation in human GC-C that modulate ligand binding and ligand-mediated activation of GC-C. We also demonstrate that GC-C forms carbohydrate-mediated interactions with the lectin chaperone VIP36 (23Yamashita K. Hara-Kuge S. Ohkura T. Intracellular lectins associated with N-linked glycoprotein traffic.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thus providing the first evidence for a plasma membrane-bound receptor serving as a client for VIP36.

The sequences of the mutagenic primers and details of cloning strategies are available upon request, and all mutations were verified by sequencing (Macrogen) prior to use. The extracellular domain of GC-C (amino acid residues 21 to 435) was cloned into the pGEX6P1 vector (GE Healthcare) to generate the plasmid pGEX6P1GC-CECDWT and pGEX6P1GC-CECDΔ10N. The human VIP36 coding region from amino acid 45–322 was amplified by PCR from cDNA prepared from the T84 colorectal carcinoma cell line and cloned into pGEX6P3 to generate the plasmid pGEX6P3VIP36.GST or GST tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Endo− cells following induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (500 μm). Induction was carried out at 16 °C for 20 h for the expression and purification of GST-GC-CWT-ECD and GST-GC-CΔ10N-ECD, and at 37 °C for 3 h for the expression and purification of GST-VIP36. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm PMSF, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was interacted with GSH beads (Bioline), and the matrix was washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, followed by washes with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 °C. For GST-VIP36, lysis and wash buffers without EDTA and supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 were used. Purity of protein was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Wild type and mutant GC-C were expressed in HEK293T cells and membrane protein fractions were prepared as described previously (18Saha S. Biswas K.H. Kondapalli C. Isloor N. Visweswariah S.S.

In some cases, monolayers of cells were treated with 20 μg/ml of tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 18-h post transfection, and membrane fractions were prepared from these cells 24-h post treatment. For enzymatic deglycosylation of GC-C post expression in HEK293T cells, membrane protein (40 μg) from cells expressing wild type GC-C was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). PNGase F (250 units; New England Biolabs) was added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 12 h. Treated or untreated membrane protein was then subjected to Western blot analysis using GC-C:C8 monoclonal antibody (22Ghanekar Y. Chandrashaker A. Tatu U. Visweswariah S.S.

The concentrations of free metals and metal-GTP complexes in assays were calculated using MaxChelator. When MnGTP was used as a substrate, activity measured represents the full catalytic potential of the guanylyl cyclase domain in GC-C (18Saha S. Biswas K.H. Kondapalli C. Isloor N. Visweswariah S.S.

For Scatchard analysis, membrane protein was incubated with varying concentrations (10−11–10−9 m) of 125I-labeled STY72F for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, samples were filtered through GF/C filters (Whatman) and washed with 5 ml of chilled 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), containing 0.9% NaCl and 0.2% BSA. The filters were dried, and the associated radioactivity was measured using a gamma counter. Ligand-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity was measured in intact HEK293T cells expressing either wild type or mutant GC-C, 72 h post transfection. The cell monolayer was incubated in medium containing 500 μm isobutyl methyl xanthine for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator. ST (10−7 m) was then added, and incubation was continued for another 15 min, following which the cells were lysed in 200 μl of 0.1 n HCl.

Following interaction, beads were washed three times with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl) and twice with wash buffer without detergent. Protein associated with the beads was analyzed by Western blotting using the GC-C:C8 monoclonal antibody. There are 10 Asn residues in the extracellular domain of GC-C that lie within a consensus site for glycosylation, but only 8 are predicted to be glycosylated (Table 1). We mutated all 10 Asn residues to Ala to abolish glycosylation (GC-CΔ10N). We expressed wild type or mutant receptor in HEK293T cells, in the absence or presence of tunicamycin, to pharmacologically inhibit glycosylation. GC-CΔ10N or wild type GC-C expressed in tunicamycin-treated cells migrated at a size of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 1A), indicating that all sites of N-linked glycosylation had been removed on mutation of the 10 Asn residues.TABLE 1Predicted sites of N-linked glycosylation in GC-CAmino acid positionSequenceScore32NGSY++75NVTV+++79NATF+195NGTE+284NVTA+++307NSSF+313NLSP---345NITT+357NLTF-402NKTY++ Open table in a new tab Membranes were prepared from transfected cells, and binding of radiolabeled ST was measured.

https://openalex.org/W2063944286,"Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes nitric oxide (NO) synthesis via a two-step process: L-arginine (L-Arg) → N-hydroxy-L-arginine → citrulline + NO. In the active site the heme is coordinated by a thiolate ligand, which accepts a H-bond from a nearby tryptophan residue, Trp-188. Mutation of Trp-188 to histidine in murine inducible NOS was shown to retard NO synthesis and allow for transient accumulation of a new intermediate with a Soret maximum at 420 nm during the L-Arg hydroxylation reaction (Tejero, J., Biswas, A., Wang, Z. Q., Page, R. C., Haque, M. M., Hemann, C., Zweier, J. L., Misra, S., and Stuehr, D. J. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 33498-33507). However, crystallographic data showed that the mutation did not perturb the overall structure of the enzyme. To understand how the proximal mutation affects the oxygen chemistry, we carried out biophysical studies of the W188H mutant. Our stopped-flow data showed that the 420-nm intermediate was not only populated during the L-Arg reaction but also during the N-hydroxy-L-arginine reaction. Spectroscopic data and structural analysis demonstrated that the 420-nm intermediate is a hydroxide-bound ferric heme species that is stabilized by an out-of-plane distortion of the heme macrocycle and a cation radical centered on the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor. The current data add important new insights into the previously proposed catalytic mechanism of NOS (Li, D., Kabir, M., Stuehr, D. J., Rousseau, D. L., and Yeh, S. R. (2007) J. Am. Chem.

The adverse consequences of cancer treatments include impaired puberty and fertility. In prepubertal girls, the only therapeutic option is the cryopreservation of an ovary. To date, a dozen births have been reported after reimplantation of cryopreserved mature ovaries. To analyze ovarian function after immature grafts, we performed ovarian grafting in a ewe model. Fresh or cryopreserved ovaries from immature ewes were autografted in prepubertal or adult ewes. Cyclic hormonal activity was recovered 3 mo after grafting. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of all follicle populations and corpora lutea not affected by cryopreservation. After 3 reproductive seasons, births had been observed in all groups, and the follicle-stimulating hormone status was under the limit, which indicated an exhausted ovary. As an indicator of potential imprinting default, the methylation status of the Igf2r gene was analyzed and did not show significant alteration compared with that of nonmanipulated animals. Taken together, these results demonstrate that immature ovarian grafting is able to restore spontaneous puberty and fertility and could guide the reimplantation of immature cortex in women.—Sauvat, F., Bouilly, J., Capito, C., Lefèvre, A., Blachère, T., Borenstein, N., Sarnacki, S., Dandolo, L., Binart, N.

All three methods showed that O-GlcNAc modification was predominantly in a group of bands ~90 kDa that did not correspond to any of the major myofibrillar proteins. MALDI-MS/MS identified the 90-kDa band as the protein ZASP (Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ motif protein), a minor component of the Z-disc (about 1 per 400 α-actinin) important for myofibrillar development and mechanotransduction. This was confirmed by the co-localization of O-GlcNAc and ZASP in Western blotting and by immunofluorescence microscopy. O-GlcNAcylation of ZASP increased in diseased heart, being 49 ± 5% of all O-GlcNAc in donor, 68 ± 9% in end-stage failing heart, and 76 ± 6% in myectomy muscle samples (donor versus myectomy p < 0.05).

A total of 44 cysteine variants were purified and covalently labeled with monobromobimane fluorescent probe. A variety of fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for both the soluble and membrane-bound states of the channel peptide, including the fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. Using site-directed fluorescence labeling combined with our novel helical periodicity analysis method, the data revealed that helices 6, 7, and 10 are separate amphipathic α-helices with a calculated periodicity of T = 3.34 ± 0.08 for helix 6, T = 3.56 ± 0.03 for helix 7, and T = 2.99 ± 0.12 for helix 10 in the soluble state.

https://openalex.org/W2063995133,"Tropomodulin (Tmod) is an actin-capping protein that binds to the two tropomyosins (TM) at the pointed end of the actin filament to prevent further actin polymerization and depolymerization. Therefore, understanding the role of Tmod is very important when studying actin filament dependent processes such as muscle contraction and intracellular transport. The capping ability of Tmod is highly influenced by TM and is 1000-fold greater in the presence of TM. There are four Tmod isoforms (Tmod1-4), three of which, Tmod1, Tmod3, and Tmod4, are expressed in skeletal muscles. The affinity of Tmod1 to skeletal striated TM (stTM) is higher than that of Tmod3 and Tmod4 to stTM. In this study, we tested mutations in the TM-binding sites of Tmod1, using circular dichroism (CD) and prediction analysis (PONDR). The mutations R11K, D12N, and Q144K were chosen because they decreased the affinity of Tmod1 to stTM, making it similar to that of affinity of Tmod3 and Tmod4 to stTM. Significant reduction of inhibition of actin pointed-end polymerization in the presence of stTM was shown for Tmod1 (R11K/D12N/Q144K) as compared with WT Tmod1. When GFP-Tmod1 and mutants were expressed in primary chicken skeletal myocytes, decreased assembly of Tmod1 mutants was revealed. This indicates a direct correlation between TM-binding and the actin-capping abilities of Tmod. Our data confirmed the hypothesis that assembly of Tmod at the pointed-end of the actin filament depends on its TM-binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2018841475,"Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to vascular injury plays a critical role in vascular lesion formation. Emerging data suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC-1) is a key regulator of energy metabolism and other biological processes. However, the physiological role of PGC-1β in VSMCs remains unknown. A decrease in PGC-1β expression was observed in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. PGC-1β overexpression substantially inhibited neointima formation in vivo and markedly inhibited VSMC proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G(1)/S transition phase in vitro. Accordingly, overexpression of PGC-1β decreased the expression of minichromosome maintenance 4 (MCM4), which leads to a decreased loading of the MCM complex onto chromatin at the replication origins and decreased cyclin D1 levels, whereas PGC-1β loss of function by adenovirus containing PGC-1β shRNA resulted in the opposite effect. The transcription factor AP-1 was involved in the down-regulation of MCM4 expression. Furthermore, PGC-1β is up-regulated by metformin, and metformin-associated anti-proliferative activity in VSMCs is at least partially dependent on PGC-1β. Our data show that PGC-1β is a critical component in regulating DNA replication, VSMC proliferation, and vascular lesion formation, suggesting that PGC-1β may emerge as a novel therapeutic target for control of proliferative vascular diseases."

To determine the role of Chst10 in vivo, we generated systemic Chst10-deficient mutant mice. Although Chst10(-/-) mice were born and grew to adulthood with no gross defects, they were subfertile. Uteri from Chst10(-/-) females at the pro-estrus stage were larger than those from wild-type females and exhibited a thick uterine endometrium. Serum estrogen levels in Chst10(-/-) females were higher than those from wild-type females, suggesting impaired down-regulation of estrogen. Because steroid hormones are often conjugated to glucuronic acid, we hypothesized that Chst10 sulfates glucuronidated steroid hormone to regulate steroid hormone in vivo. Enzymatic activity assays and structural analysis of Chst10 products by HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that Chst10 indeed sulfates glucuronidated estrogen, testosterone, and other steroid hormones. We also identified an HPLC peak corresponding to sulfated and glucuronidated estradiol in serum from wild-type but not from Chst10 null female mice. Estrogen-response element reporter assays revealed that Chst10-modified estrogen likely did not bind to its receptor. These results suggest that subfertility exhibited by female mice following Chst10 loss results from dysregulation of estrogen. Given that Chst10 transfers sulfates to several steroid hormones, Chst10 likely functions in widespread regulation of steroid hormones in vivo."

Given such complexity, regulation of cyclin degradation should be crucial for coordinating progression through the cell cycle. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SCF is the only E3 ligase known to date to be involved in G(1) cyclin degradation. Here, we report the design of a genetic screening that uncovered Dma1 as another E3 ligase that targets G(1) cyclins in yeast. We show that the cyclin Pcl1 is ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo by Dma1, and accordingly, is stabilized in dma1 mutants. We demonstrate that Pcl1 must be phosphorylated by its own CDK to efficiently interact with Dma1 and undergo degradation. A nonphosphorylatable version of Pcl1 accumulates throughout the cell cycle, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the proposed mechanism. Finally, we present evidence that the levels of Pcl1 and Cln2 are independently controlled in response to nutrient availability. This new previously unknown mechanism for G(1) cyclin degradation that we report here could help elucidate the specific roles of the redundant CDK-cyclin complexes in G(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2018453584,"Scalloped (SD) is a transcription factor characterized by a TEA/ATTS DNA binding domain. To activate transcription, SD must interact with its coactivators, including Yorkie (YKI) or Vestigial (VG). YKI is the downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that plays a key role in the control of tissue growth. The core components of this pathway are two kinases, Hippo (HPO) and Warts (WTS), which negatively regulate the activity of the SD/YKI complex, retaining YKI in the cytoplasm. We previously showed that HPO kinase can also reduce SD/VG transcriptional activity in Drosophila S2 cells. We further investigated the relationship between the SD/VG complex and the Hippo pathway. We show here that HPO overexpression suppresses overgrowth induced by SD/VG in vivo during Drosophila development. Using S2 cells, we show that HPO promotes the translocation of SD to the cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the induction of SD/VG target genes. Using RNAi-mediated depletion of yki and a mutant SD protein unable to interact with YKI, we demonstrate that HPO regulates SD localization independently of YKI. This function requires HPO kinase activity, yet surprisingly, not its downstream effector kinase WTS. Taken together, these observations reveal a new and unexpected role of HPO kinase in the regulation of a transcription factor independently of YKI."

Conclusion: Inflammatory stimuli downregulate meprin α by inducing TTP expression and binding to the transcript. Significance: Determining how inflammation alters meprin α regulation is crucial to understanding its role in IBD. Meprins are zinc metalloproteases that are members of the astacin family of proteinases (1Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Bond J.S. Meprins, membrane-bound and secreted astacin metalloproteinases.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. The astacin family of metalloendopeptidases.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The two subunits, encoded by the human genes MEP1A (meprin α; chromosome 6p) and MEP1B (meprin β; chromosome 18q), are evolutionarily related and highly conserved at the amino acid level (2Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. The astacin family of metalloendopeptidases.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Both subunits have similar domain structure and organization (1Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Bond J.S. Meprins, membrane-bound and secreted astacin metalloproteinases.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with the exception that meprin α has an inserted domain with a proteolytic cleavage site that results in secretion from the cell, whereas meprin β remains bound to the plasma membrane (3Hahn D.

The α subunit also forms disulfide-linked homodimers (homomeric meprin A), and can further oligomerize to form large species. In addition, the α and β subunits can associate to form heterotetramers that are linked to the cell surface (heteromeric meprin A). Meprins are highly expressed in the brush border membrane of the kidney and intestinal epithelium (5Jiang W. Le B.

Meprins are capable of cleaving a wide variety of substrates, including gastrointestinal peptides, extracellular matrix proteins, cell junction molecules, cytokines, and chemokines (1Sterchi E.E.

Thus, meprins have the potential to modulate the immune response by generation of either active or inactive protein fragments (1Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Bond J.S.

IBD is a group of illnesses characterized by aberrant inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract, and several lines of evidence suggest a role for meprin α in the disease. Studies with meprin knock-out (KO) mice indicate that meprin α expression in the intestine may be protective, as both αKO and αβKO mice developed a more severe dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis compared with wild-type (WT) or βKO mice (15Banerjee S.

In addition, there is a strong correlation between decreased MEP1A mRNA expression in inflamed mucosa of patients with IBD relative to unaffected tissue from all groups (16Banerjee S. Oneda B.

One of these studies found a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3′-UTR and IBD (16Banerjee S. Oneda B. Yap L.M. Jewell D.P. Matters G.L. Fitzpatrick L.R.

MEP1A allele for meprin A metalloprotease is a susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease.Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether post-transcriptional regulation of meprin α might play a role in IBD. Post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) is recognized as an important means by which cells can rapidly adjust to changing conditions, as well as an additional level of control for genes whose expression must be transient (21Khabar K.S.

Chem. 2008; 389: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This form of regulation is known to be effected through RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and regulatory sequences in the 3′-UTR of target mRNA broadly categorized as AU-rich elements (AREs) (23Kishore S.

AU-rich elements and associated factors: are there unifying principles?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The consequences of PTR may be a change in RNA shuttling, stability, and/or translation efficiency depending on the protein(s) bound (23Kishore S. Luber S. Zavolan M.

Two ubiquitously expressed RBPs are TTP, which is known to destabilize transcripts directly by promoting their deadenylation (26Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J.

Both HuR and TTP have been demonstrated to regulate a number of cytokines and chemokines, and post-transcriptional regulation is recognized to be important in the inflammatory response (32Khabar K.

Thus, dysregulation of ARE-binding proteins has implications for multiple disease processes, including IBD and cancer (21Khabar K.S.

The studies herein were conducted to determine whether expression of meprin α is subject to PTR and, using a tissue culture model of IBD, whether this regulation is altered in response to inflammatory stimuli. Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC) were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). A549 human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC) were grown under similar conditions in F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Where indicated, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Acros Organics), 5 μg/ml Actinomycin D (Acros Organics), or vehicle control (DMSO or methanol, respectively). The luciferase reporter vector pmirGLO was purchased from Promega for expression of both firefly and Renilla luciferase from the same plasmid under the control of separate promoters. This reporter was used as both a reference control in transfection experiments (described below) and as the backbone vector for the hMEP1A 3′-UTR construct. The vector pSGG-MEP1A-3UTR (SwitchGear Genomics) was used as template for amplification of the target sequence by Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Oy) and subcloning into the pmirGLO vector. The following primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and used to introduce restriction endonuclease sites for DraI and XbaI (bases changed/added in lowercase; recognition sites underlined): 5′-aaatttAAAGGCCAAGGAAGTGACCTG-3′ and 5′-aatctagAAGGTGCTAACTCAAT-3′. Plasmid DNA was isolated from multiple colonies using the Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) for screening via restriction analysis, and all positive clones were confirmed by sequencing at the Penn State University Nucleic Acid Facility. The final construct, pmG-hMEP1A-3UTR-WT, consisted of the pmirGLO vector with the complete human MEP1A 3′-UTR sequence (GenBank accession number NM_005588.2) cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase coding region. To generate the TTP expression construct, Caco-2 cDNA was used as template for amplification of the TTP coding sequence by Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Oy) and subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen). The following primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies to first amplify TTP cDNA: 5′-acttcagcgctcccactctc-3′ and 5′-cttgattactgtcccccaagtc-3′. A second set of primers was then used to introduce restriction endonuclease sites for KpnI and SacII (bases changed/added in lowercase; recognition sites underlined): 5′-aaaaATGGggtACCGTTACACC-3′ and 5′-aaaaccgCGGGCAGTCACTTTG-3′. Plasmid DNA was isolated from multiple colonies using the Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) for screening via restriction analysis, and all positive clones were confirmed by sequencing at the Penn State University Nucleic Acid Facility. The final construct, pcDNA-hTTP, includes the ORF from GenBank accession number NM_003407.2 with an intact stop codon such that the V5-His tag is not translated. Silencing experiments were conducted with TTP, HuR, or negative control shRNA constructs obtained from Genecopoeia. For each target, three shRNA constructs were tested. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 6-well plates, and 2 μg of each plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Medium was changed after 16 h, and cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection for isolation of both RNA and protein. Efficacy of silencing was assessed by Western blot for either HuR or TTP. The shRNA construct that gave the greatest silencing was used in subsequent experiments. For reporter mRNA stability assays, A549 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 6-well plates and cotransfected by Attractene reagent with 50 ng of either pmirGLO or pmG-hMEP1A-3UTR-WT and 200 ng of either negative control shRNA, HuR shRNA2, pUC19, or TTP expression plasmid where appropriate. Actinomycin D assays were performed 24 h post-transfection, and half-lives were calculated from the decay curves generated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and quantitated by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Within an experiment, equivalent amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using template cDNA, 2× SensiMix SYBR Master Mix with fluorescein (Bioline), and the gene-specific primers in Table 1. All reactions were run in 96-well plates on the MyiQ2 Two-Color Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) using the following program: 2-min hot start at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C, and 2 min at 10 °C.

Samples were prepared for Western blotting by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using precast 4–20% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) for ∼45 min at 200 V or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 45 min at 45 mA. The following antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution: HuR (sc-5261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TTP (T5327; Sigma), β-actin (A5441; Sigma), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934; GE Healthcare), and donkey anti-mouse IgG (sc-2314; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of secreted meprin A, 1 ml of medium was collected from Caco-2 cells stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) or control for 24 h. Samples were dialyzed into a 0.01% SDS solution using a 100-kDa-molecular mass-cutoff cellulose ester membrane (Spectrum Laboratories) and concentrated 100-fold by vacuum drying (SpeedVac concentrator, Savant).

https://openalex.org/W1987353118,"MafA and Pdx1 represent critical transcriptional regulators required for the maintenance of pancreatic islet β-cell function. The in vivo β-cell-enriched expression pattern of these genes is principally directed by islet transcription factors binding within conserved Region 3 (base pairs (bp) -8118/-7750) of MafA and Area II (bp -2153/-1923) of the Pdx1 gene. Comprehensive mutational analysis of conserved MafA Region 3 revealed two new β-cell line-specific cis-activation elements, termed Site 4 (bp -7997 to -7988) and Site 12 (bp -7835 to -7826). Gel mobility and antibody super-shift analysis identified Pdx1 as the Site 4 binding factor, while an 80-88 kilodalton (kDa) β-cell line-enriched protein complex bound Site 12 and similar aligned nucleotides within Pdx1 Area II. The 80-88 kDa activator was also found in adult mouse islet extract. Strikingly, the molecular weight, DNA binding, and antibody recognition properties of this activator were unique when compared with all other key islet transcription factors tested, including Prox1 (83 kDa), Hnf1α (67 kDa), FoxA2 (48 kDa), MafA (46 kDa), Isl1 (44 kDa), Pdx1 (42 kDa), and Nkx2.2 (30 kDa). Collectively, these data define an apparently novel MafA Region 3 and Pdx1 Area II activator contributing to expression in β-cells."

Here, a novel type of immunogen was designed that targeted the conformation of a highly conserved region of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) composed of two separate sequences that associate to form an anti-parallel β-sheet structure. Our previous study identified this β-sheet region as the structural core in the epitope of a characteristic antibody (B-1) that strongly neutralizes a wide variety of strains within the H3N2 serotype, and therefore this β-sheet region was considered a good target to induce broadly reactive immunity against the influenza A virus.

Through site-directed mutagenesis, several modified EGFPs with an epitope-mimicking structure embedded in their surface were prepared. Two EGFP variants, differing from wild-type (parental) EGFP by only five and nine residues, induced mice to produce antibodies that specifically bind to H3-type HA and neutralize H3N2 virus.

Significance: Because of its instant producibility, this type of immunogen meets the requirement for next-generation influenza vaccines. Humankind has encountered a number of influenza pandemics. In addition, frequently emerging minor mutations of a vaccine target may also interrupt our efforts to prevent influenza. Generally, influenza vaccine manufacturing takes months (1Gerdil C. The annual production cycle for influenza vaccine.Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1776-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), approximately half a year for egg-grown virus and at least 2 months for cell culture-grown virus. Such latencies may cause severe problems, especially in pandemics. For example, in the case of the most recent swine-origin pandemic influenza A in 2009 (H1N1pdm) (2Dawood F.S. Jain S. Finelli L. Shaw M.W. Lindstrom S. Garten R.J. Gubareva L.V. Xu X. Bridges C.B. Uyeki T.M. Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation TeamEmergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus in humans.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar), serious concerns arose in countries in the southern hemisphere, such as Australia, because the outbreak occurred immediately before the influenza season (3Bishop J.F. Murnane M.P. Owen R. Australia's winter with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2591-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To overcome such limitations of conventional vaccination methods, there is a need to develop new methods that can be instantly updateable to newly emerged viral strains and/or induce viral neutralization antibodies that target highly conserved regions. In a previous study, we succeeded in isolating several clones of human-type monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of influenza-vaccinated volunteers (4Kubota-Koketsu R. Mizuta H. Oshita M. Ideno S. Yunoki M. Kuhara M. Yamamoto N. Okuno Y. Ikuta K. Broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus from vaccinated healthy donors.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 387: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Among them, one notable antibody clone, named B-1, demonstrated high neutralization titers against a wide variety of influenza A viral strains belonging to the H3N2 serotype, including strains isolated more than 40 years ago. Through an epitope-mapping study using synthetic oligopeptides, B-1 antibody was shown to recognize a region of hemagglutinin (HA) protein composed of two separate sequences spanning residues 167–187 and 225–241 (supplemental Fig. S1). According to the known crystal structure of HA, these two subregions appear to associate with each other through an anti-parallel β-sheet structure to form one epitope region located beneath the receptor-binding site (supplemental Fig. S1). Phylogenic analysis indicated that these sequences and their corresponding sequences in other HA serotypes, including H1N1pdm, are highly conserved in a serotype-dependent manner, suggesting that their broad neutralizing properties have arisen from this high conservation (5Yamashita A. Kawashita N. Kubota-Koketsu R. Inoue Y. Watanabe Y. Ibrahim M.S. Ideno S. Yunoki M. Okuno Y. Takagi T. Yasunaga T. Ikuta K. Highly conserved sequences for human neutralization epitope on hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses H3N2, H1N1 and H5N1. Implication for human monoclonal antibody recognition.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 393: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Particularly, the β-sheet portion composed of two sequences spanning residues 175–184 and 229–238 (called the “upper” and “lower” subregions, respectively) appears to be highly conserved; DKLYIWGVHH occupies 97.8% of the upper subregion, and RISIYWTIVK occupies 94.5% of the lower subregion among 12,879 HA sequences of H3N2 strains isolated from human within the past 43 years. A similar broadly neutralizing antibody clone, named D-1, has also been established from another donor's peripheral blood mononuclear cells and, interestingly, recognizes a region almost identical to that of B-1 (4Kubota-Koketsu R. Mizuta H. Oshita M. Ideno S. Yunoki M. Kuhara M. Yamamoto N. Okuno Y. Ikuta K. Broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus from vaccinated healthy donors.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 387: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Currently, vaccinations with synthetic oligopeptide(s) corresponding to highly conserved epitopes are widely applied to produce antibodies that protect against a broad range of viral strains (6Ben-Yedidia T. Arnon R. Epitope-based vaccine against influenza.Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2007; 6: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Staneková Z. Varečková E. Conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing protective immunity and their prospects for universal vaccine development.Virol. J. 2010; 7: 351Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because B-1 and D-1 were the strongest and the broadest neutralizing antibodies among those isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population of each vaccinee, the B-1 (D-1) epitope, which has not to our knowledge been previously mapped, was thought to be an attractive candidate target for peptide-based vaccines. Thus, we tested the ability of synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the epitope sequences to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human vaccinees were stimulated by the oligopeptide(s) ex vivo, we observed production of antibodies with viral neutralizing activity, 2R. Kubota-Koketsu and K. Ikuta, unpublished data. indicating that oligopeptide stimulation may be effective for individuals that already have certain memories. However, our attempt to immunize naive animals with the synthetic oligopeptide(s) to induce production of virus-neutralizing antibodies appeared less successful, 3S. Ideno, K. Sakai, M. Yunoki, R. Kubota-Koketsu, Y. Inoue, S. Nakamura, T. Yasunaga, and K. Ikuta, submitted for publication. probably because the antigenicity for primary immunity was highly dependent on the conformation of the epitope. In addition, according to previously determined crystal structure models, this epitope region appears mostly buried within the stable HA trimer (supplemental Fig. S1), and therefore immunization with intact HA would not be so effective to target this region, although B-1 and D-1 were probably raised against HA in vaccines. In this study, to induce antibodies specifically recognizing this region, we designed immunogens using a novel strategy focusing on secondary structure. The basic strategy was to build an epitope-mimicking structure directly on the surface of an epitope carrier protein that originally exposes anti-parallel β-sheet structure. The model carrier proteins we selected here are two fluorescent proteins: enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 4The abbreviations used are: EGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinFCAFreund's complete adjuvantFRNTfocus reduction neutralization testproKproteinase KRDEreceptor-destroying enzymeMEMminimum essential medium. and mCherry (8Shaner N.C.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Despite the rather low overall similarity between their sequences, their overall structures are quite similar, with 11 β-strands on the surface surrounding the fluorophore to form a barrel-like structure. Utilizing this scaffold, the epitope-derived residues were introduced directly onto the surface of EGFP and mCherry by site-directed mutagenesis. We prepared four variants for each carrier protein. By using these as immunogens, we tested the induction of anti-HA antibody production and the acquisition of anti-influenza immunity. Using monoclonal antibodies isolated from mice immunized with the modified EGFPs, we also evaluated their viral neutralization activities. enhanced green fluorescent protein Freund's complete adjuvant focus reduction neutralization test proteinase K receptor-destroying enzyme minimum essential medium. As a positive control for immunization, a seasonal influenza vaccine, Biken HA (Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, Kanonji, Japan), containing a mixture of HA-enriched extracts from A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 strains, was used at 100 μl/body. As an ELISA antigen to test anti-HA reactivity, HA-enriched split vaccine prepared from A/Hiroshima/52/2005 (H3N2) virus was used. As a probe for cell infection by influenza A virus, anti-influenza-A NP antibody C43 (Abcam) was used (9Okuno Y. Isegawa Y. Sasao F. Ueda S. A common neutralizing epitope conserved between the hemagglutinins of influenza A virus H1 and H2 strains.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-strands of EGFP to which HA-derived residues were introduced were determined mainly through the evaluation of the structural similarity between α-carbons (Cα) from HA and EGFP in their crystal structure (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 2VIU and 1EMA, respectively), which was estimated by the root mean square value calculated using PyMOL software (DeLano Scientific). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are summarized in supplemental Table S1. All PCRs were performed with KOD Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The ORFs of pEGFP-N and pmCherry-N (Clontech) were previously subcloned onto pET-28a(+) plasmid vector (Merck Millipore) to produce pET-EGFP and pET-mCherry, respectively. Using each plasmid as a template, fragments containing the sequences corresponding to N-terminal and C-terminal halves of EGFP or mCherry were amplified by PCR with primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4, respectively. In the course of this PCR step, mutations were introduced by primers P2 and P3. These two fragments were combined by PCR with the P1/P4 primer pair. The combined fragment was subcloned onto the pET28a vector (Novagen) using NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites. UL1 variants were produced by introducing L1 mutations into the U1 variants. Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (EMD Millipore) cells were transformed by each plasmid prepared as described above. Transformed cells were cultured in LB (plus kanamycin) medium at 37 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Importantly, the culturing temperature should be changed to 18 °C immediately after the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition because the maturation of several variants of EGFP or mCherry was found to be inefficient with standard culture at 37 °C. Cell culture was continued overnight. If EGFP or mCherry and their variants were expressed successfully, the collected cell pellet would already appear green or purple-red in color, respectively. After the protein expression, collected E. coli cells suspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Seikagaku Corp.) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) were incubated for 30 min on ice and lysed by sonication. After removal of the insoluble fraction by centrifugation, the cell extract was applied onto a nickel-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with PBS containing 5 mm imidazole. After washing the column with PBS containing 40 mm imidazole, bound protein was eluted by PBS containing 300 mm imidazole. Colored fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and applied onto a Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After washing the column, bound protein was eluted by a 0–200 mm NaCl gradient. The purity of each fraction was checked with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. The EGFP- and mCherry-enriched fractions were collected and dialyzed against PBS. If necessary, protein was concentrated by Centriprep 10k (Millipore). In SDS-PAGE, every variant protein was found to retain its fluorescence in the gel but had a unique mobility when boiling was omitted prior to sample injection (Fig. 1C), whereas almost equal mobility was observed when samples were boiled in SDS (Fig. 2C, without proteinase K treatment). Protein concentration was quantified by the Pierce 660-nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific). In SDS-PAGE of mCherry or its variants purified as described above and boiled in SDS, some extra bands appeared below the full-length protein, whereas very little additional banding appeared in the non-boiled condition. This observation indicates that these samples contain some degraded fragments that cannot be fully separated by column under native conditions because they have been integrated to form the mature mCherry structure.FIGURE 2Protease resistance and thermostability of EGFP and its variants. A, EGFP and its variants (100 mm) were treated in the absence or presence of 1 mg/ml proK. After 48-h incubation at 37 °C, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE with (bottom panel) or without (top two panels) boiling in sample buffer containing SDS before electrophoresis. In unboiled samples, a fluorescence image was also taken before Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. B, fluorescence of EGFP and its variants treated with or without proK as described in A was measured over time. C, EGFP and its variants were incubated with the indicated concentration of proK for 48 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence was measured. D, EGFP and its variants (100 nm) were incubated for 5 min at the indicated temperature in the presence (bottom) or absence (top) of 0.1% SDS, and fluorescence was measured.

Far-UV CD spectra were measured in a 0.1-mm path length cell from 260 to 190 nm using a CD spectrometer (model 202, Aviv Biomedical). All measurements were performed at room temperature under a nitrogen flow. To test protease resistance, EGFP and its variants, each at a final concentration of 100 nm, were incubated with the indicated concentration of proteinase K (proK) for the indicated time at 37 °C. After the incubation, fluorescence was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths at 470 and 507 nm, respectively. To test thermostability, each EGFP or its variant at a final concentration of 100 nm was incubated in the absence or presence of 0.1% SDS for 5 min at the indicated temperature. Fluorescence was measured as described above. Denaturation temperature (Td) was estimated by fitting the plot to a sigmoidal function, F = Fmax/(1 + exp(p(Td − T))), where F is the fluorescence after heat treatment at T (°C), and Fmax is the fluorescence without heat treatment. Td indicates the temperature at which the fluorescence F = 0.5 × Fmax. To prepare immunogens, each purified variant of EGFP or mCherry was adjusted to the appropriate concentration in PBS and mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) or Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Wako) into an emulsion. Emulsion can be formed efficiently by plunging back and forth in two 2.5-ml syringes linked with a three-way stopcock. Immunogen prepared as described above containing 7.5 mg/ml EGFP variant with FCA was inoculated intraperitoneally into female 6-week-old BALB/c mice at 200 μl (1.5 mg)/body. After 3 weeks, booster immunization was performed with the same immunogen. Mice immunized with seasonal influenza vaccine at 100 μl/body were used as a positive control group, and mice immunized with PBS/FCA emulsion were used as a negative control group. After 3 weeks, blood was collected from the tail, and serum was used for tests. Hybridomas described below were prepared from mice immunized in that manner. For virus challenge, immunogen containing 750 or 75 μg/ml EGFP variants was prepared as emulsion with FCA and inoculated into female 5-week-old BALB/c mice at 200 μl (150 or 15 μg)/body. After 2 weeks, antigens prepared with the same concentration of equivalent mCherry variants and Freund's incomplete adjuvant were inoculated intraperitoneally at 200 μl/body as a booster. After a further 2 weeks, influenza A/Guizhou/54/1989 × Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H3N2) mouse-adapted reassortant virus was infected intranasally at 6 × 102 focus-forming units/g body weight. Fifty microliters of 2 μg/ml antigen solution were adsorbed on the bottom of F96 Maxisorp Nunc-Immuno Plates (Thermo Scientific) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with PBS containing 25% (v/v) Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque), the plate was reacted with serum or purified antibody appropriately diluted in PBS containing 5% (v/v) Blocking One. After five washes with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the plate was reacted with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution. After five washes with PBS-T, 50 μl of SureBlue TMB 1-component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL) was added and incubated at room temperature. Color development was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4, and optical density at 450 nm was measured. Mice that exhibited sera with a high content of HA-reactive antibodies and high viral neutralization titers were finally boosted by intraperitoneal inoculation with the equivalent variant of mCherry without adjuvant at 0.2 mg/body. After 3 days, splenocytes were collected and fused with mouse myeloma PAI cells by a standard polyethylene glycol fusion method. Fused cells were cultured on 5 × 96-well plates at 100 μl/well. After forming colonies, culture supernatants were tested by ELISA against either HA vaccine prepared from A/Hiroshima/52/2005 (H3N2) virus or EGFP. Cells containing HA-reactive clones were diluted to 10–50 cells/ml and mixed with fresh splenocytes from a naive mouse (∼106 cells/ml) and then cultured on a 96-well plate at 100 μl/well. Finally, through a second screening by ELISA, HA-reactive clones were stocked. To prepare antibodies produced by these clones, cultured hybridomas were inoculated intraperitoneally into female BALB/c mice previously stimulated with pristane (Sigma) at 7 days prior to hybridoma inoculation. Antibodies were purified by protein G columns from the ascites fluids accumulated in hybridoma-inoculated mice. Viral neutralization by antibodies was tested in vitro by focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) (10Okuno Y. Tanaka K. Baba K. Maeda A. Kunita N. Ueda S. Rapid focus reduction neutralization test of influenza A and B viruses in microtiter system.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sera collected from immunized animals were treated with three volumes of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (RDE(II) “SEIKEN,” Denka Seiken) for 16 h at 37 °C, and the enzyme was inactivated by incubation for 30 min at 56 °C. In the case of purified antibodies, this treatment was omitted. After adjusting to the appropriate concentrations, the RDE-treated sera or antibodies were mixed with an equal volume of MEM containing 2,000 focus-forming units of either influenza A/Hiroshima/52/2005 (H3N2), A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), or A/duck/Czechoslovakia/1/1956 (H4N6) virus. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 100 μl of the complexes were applied to 90% confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, medium was changed to MEM containing 10% FBS, and incubation was continued overnight. Infected cells were visualized by an immunofluorescence assay as described below and counted. The changes in number of infected cells were represented as percentages calculated as 100 × (N− − N+)/N−, where N+ is the number of infected cells in the presence of antibody, and N− is the average number of infected cells in the absence of antibody. When antibody treatment was performed after viral adsorption, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were previously incubated with virus in cold MEM without antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After the removal of supernatant, cells were incubated with cold MEM containing the appropriate concentration of antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C followed by further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. After changing the medium to MEM (plus 10% FBS), the assay was continued as described above. Infected cells were treated with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min and with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then treated with antibody appropriately diluted in PBS for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 at 1:5,000 dilution for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy, and if necessary, cells with fluorescent focus were counted. The anti-parallel β-sheet region in HA focused on in the present study is composed of two separate sequences: residues 175–184 (upper) and 229–238 (lower). EGFP variants were first constructed by introducing substitutions at several positions that take part in its β-barrel scaffold. Corresponding to the side of the β-sheet in the epitope, two types of variants were possible: one type mimics the side facing the central axis of the HA trimer, and the other mimics the side facing laterally (Fig. 1, A and B). To design the former variant, named UL1, amino acids at EGFP residue positions 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 179, 181, (183), 185, and 187 were substituted to Lys, Tyr, Trp, Val, His, Arg, Ser, (Tyr), Thr, and Val, respectively, which were originally located at residue positions 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 229, 231, (233), 235, and 237 in HA1 of the major H3N2 strain. Upper region-only and lower region-only versions, named U1 and L1 respectively, were also constructed. Likewise, the latter variant, named UL2, was designed by introducing Asp-175, (Leu-177), Ile-179, Gly-181, His-183, Ile-230, Ile-232, Trp-234, Ile-236, and Lys-238 of HA1 onto EGFP at residue positions 177, (179), 181, 183, 185, 163, 165, 167, 169, and 171 (Fig. 1, A and B). Conformational similarity between the mutated region on EGFP and the corresponding region of the B-1 epitope was evaluated as the root mean square between Cα atoms (Table S2). No calculated root mean square value exceeded 2 Å. The relevance of these conformational gaps is discussed collectively with the results from immunization tests (see “Discussion”). Each EGFP variant was expressed in E. coli and purified. Fluorescence of the expressed protein was used as a helpful indicator of whether it has been folded successfully or not because the fluorophore formation of fluorescent proteins generally depends on folding accuracy of the entire molecule, including the β-barrel (11Cody C.W. Prasher D.C. Westler W.M. Prendergast F.G. Ward W.W. Chemical structure of the hexapeptide chromophore of the Aequorea green-fluorescent protein.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Several variants were hardly expressed with the correct fluorescent conformations under culture at 37 °C, but by culturing at a lower temperature, such as 18 °C, every variant was expressed successfully. Every purified EGFP variant retained its fluorescence and distinct mobility after SDS-PAGE under non-boiling conditions (Fig. 1C). Equivalent variants of mCherry were prepared similarly to the EGFP variants. Although the overall β-barrel scaffold of fluorescent proteins is nearly assured by their fluorescence (12Bokman S.H.

Reversible denaturation of Aequorea green-fluorescent protein. Physical separation and characterization of the renatured protein.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4535-4540Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we confirmed the structural relevance of EGFP UL1 and UL2 variants using far-UV CD spectra. Both variants demonstrated spectra similar to that of wild-type EGFP, indicating practically no change in secondary structure (supplemental Fig. S2). GFP and its derivatives are known to demonstrate high stability against protease digestion, detergent, and heat treatment (12Bokman S.H. Ward W.W. Renaturation of Aequorea green-fluorescent protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 1372-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which are favorable for application as a scaffold for our immunogen carrier. We tested the protease resistance and thermostability of EGFP variants used here. Upon proK treatment, wild-type EGFP showed no significant decrease in fluorescence for up to 2 days at 37 °C. This finding indicates the maintenance of overall structure, because fluorescent proteins should generally lose their fluorescence by destruction of the β-barrel structure, even after the formation of their fluorophores (12Bokman S.H.
