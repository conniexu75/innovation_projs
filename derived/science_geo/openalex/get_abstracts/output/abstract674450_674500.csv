https://openalex.org/W3160261359,"This paper explores to what extent product and marketing channel diversification contributed to the economic success of small-scale agricultural producers involved in short food supply chains after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was conducted between April and July 2020 in four countries of the European Union–Estonia, Hungary, Portugal and Romania,–resulting in a relatively large sample of farmers (N = 421). The analysis was built on a semi-nonparametric approach. Approximately 19 percent of small-scale producers were able to increase sales during the first wave of the pandemic, although country-level variation was significant. Fruits and vegetables were by far the most popular products. The importance of specific channels varied across countries, but farm gate sales were among the most important marketing channels both before and during the first wave. The importance of channels that were based on digital resources and home delivery increased. Our evidence indicates that diversification was a strategy that paid off, both in terms of marketing channels and different product categories. However, the impact appears to be nonlinear; the initial advantage generated by diversification rapidly tapered off, either temporarily (in the case of products), or permanently (in the case of marketing channels). Later research may clarify whether these findings are generalizable in other socio-economic contexts, as well as in a non-COVID situation."
https://openalex.org/W3103510420,"Cancer progression is driven by both somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) and chromatin remodeling, yet little is known about the interplay between these two classes of events in shaping the clonal diversity of cancers. We present Alleloscope, a method for allele-specific copy number estimation that can be applied to single-cell DNA- and/or transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing (scDNA-seq, ATAC-seq) data, enabling combined analysis of allele-specific copy number and chromatin accessibility. On scDNA-seq data from gastric, colorectal and breast cancer samples, with validation using matched linked-read sequencing, Alleloscope finds pervasive occurrence of highly complex, multiallelic CNAs, in which cells that carry varying allelic configurations adding to the same total copy number coevolve within a tumor. On scATAC-seq from two basal cell carcinoma samples and a gastric cancer cell line, Alleloscope detected multiallelic copy number events and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, enabling dissection of the contributions of chromosomal instability and chromatin remodeling to tumor evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3119354509,"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is an important and ancient oilseed crop. Sesame seed coat color is related to biochemical functions involved in protein and oil metabolism, and antioxidant content. Because of its complication, the genetic basis of sesame seed coat color remains poorly understood. To elucidate the factors affecting the genetic architecture of seed coat color, 366 sesame germplasm lines were evaluated for seed coat color in 12 environments. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for three seed coat color space values, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) values from a multi-environment trial analysis and principal component scores (PCs) of three seed coat color space values were conducted. GWAS for three seed coat color space values identified a total of 224 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, P < 2.34×10-7), with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranging from 1.01% to 22.10%, and 35 significant SNPs were detected in more than 6 environments. Based on BLUP values, 119 significant SNPs were identified, with PVE ranging from 8.83 to 31.98%. Comparing the results of the GWAS using phenotypic data from different environments and the BLUP values, all significant SNPs detected in more than 6 environments were also detected using the BLUP values. GWAS for PCs identified 197 significant SNPs, and 30 were detected in more than 6 environments. GWAS results for PCs were consistent with those for three color space values. Out of 224 significant SNPs, 22 were located in the confidence intervals of previous reported quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Finally, 92 candidate genes were identified in the vicinity of the 4 SNPs that were most significantly associated with sesame seed coat color. The results in this paper will provide new insights into the genetic basis of sesame seed coat color, and should be useful for molecular breeding in sesame."
https://openalex.org/W3163165984,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) represents a clinical condition with poor prognosis. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients was about 22-57%. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CS) are particularly exposed to AKI because of the related oxidative stress, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion damage. Hence, the risk profile of patients undergoing CS who develop AKI and who are consequently at increased mortality risk deserves further investigation.We designed a retrospective study examining consecutive patients undergoing any type of open-heart surgery from January to December 2018. Patients with a history of AKI were excluded. AKI was diagnosed according to KDIGO criteria. Univariate associations between clinical variables and AKI were tested using logistic regression analysis. Variable thresholds maximizing the association with AKI were measured with the Youden index. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of AKI through backward selection. Mortality risk factors were assessed through the Cox proportional hazard model.We studied 158 patients (mean age 51.2±9.7 years) of which 74.7% were males. Types of procedures performed were: isolated coronary artery bypass (CABG, 50.6%), valve (28.5%), aortic (3.2%) and combined (17.7%) surgery. Overall, incidence of AKI was 34.2%. At multivariable analysis, young age (p = 0.016), low blood glucose levels (p = 0.028), estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (p = 0.007), pH (p = 0.008), type of intervention (p = 0.031), prolonged extracorporeal circulation (ECC, p = 0.028) and cross-clamp (p = 0.021) times were associated with AKI. The threshold for detecting AKI were 91 and 51 minutes for ECC and cross-clamp times, respectively. At survival analysis, the presence of AKI, prolonged ECC and cross-clamp times, and low blood glucose levels forecasted mortality.AKI is common among CS patients and associates with shortened life-expectancy. Several pre-operative and intra-operative predictors are associated with AKI and future mortality. Future studies, aiming at improving prognosis in high-risk patients, by a stricter control of these factors, are awaited."
https://openalex.org/W3161367466,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent worldwide. Identifying high-risk patients is critical to best utilize limited health care resources. We established a community-based care pathway using 2D ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) to identify high risk patients with NAFLD. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of various non-invasive strategies to correctly identify high-risk patients. Methods A decision-analytic model was created using a payer’s perspective for a hypothetical patient with NAFLD. FIB-4 [≥1.3], NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) [≥-1.455], SWE [≥8 kPa], transient elastography (TE) [≥8 kPa], and sequential strategies with FIB-4 or NFS followed by either SWE or TE were compared to identify patients with either significant (≥F2) or advanced fibrosis (≥F3). Model inputs were obtained from local data and published literature. The cost/correct diagnosis of advanced NAFLD was obtained and univariate sensitivity analysis was performed. Results For ≥F2 fibrosis, FIB-4/SWE cost $148.75/correct diagnosis while SWE cost $276.42/correct diagnosis, identifying 84% of patients correctly. For ≥F3 fibrosis, using FIB-4/SWE correctly identified 92% of diagnoses and dominated all other strategies. The ranking of strategies was unchanged when stratified by normal or abnormal ALT. For ≥F3 fibrosis, the cost/correct diagnosis was less in the normal ALT group. Conclusions SWE based strategies were the most cost effective for diagnosing ≥F2 fibrosis. For ≥F3 fibrosis, FIB-4 followed by SWE was the most effective and least costly strategy. Further evaluation of the timing of repeating non-invasive strategies are required to enhance the cost-effective management of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3161650202,"Reactive microglia are suggested to be involved in neurological disorders, and the mechanisms underlying microglial activity may provide insights into therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases. Microglia produce immunological responses to various stimuli, which include fractalkine (FKN or CX3CL1). CX3CR1, a FKN receptor, is present in microglial cells, and when FKN is applied before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, LPS-induced inflammatory responses are inhibited, suggesting that the activation of the FKN signal is beneficial. Considering the practical administration for treatment, we investigated the influence of FKN on immunoreactive microglia using murine primary microglia and BV-2, a microglial cell line. The administration of LPS leads to nitric oxide (NO) production. NO was reduced when FKN was administered 4 h after LPS administration without a change in inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. In contrast, morphological changes, migratory activity, and proliferation were not altered by delayed FKN treatment. LPS decreases the CX3CR1 mRNA concentration, and the overexpression of CX3CR1 restores the FKN-mediated decrease in NO. CX3CR1 overexpression decreased the NO production that is mediated by LPS even without the application of FKN. ATP and ethanol also reduced CX3CR1 mRNA concentrations. In conclusion, the delayed FKN administration modified the LPS-induced microglial activation. The FKN signals were attenuated by a reduction in CX3CR1 by some inflammatory stimuli, and this modulated the inflammatory response of microglial cells, at least partially."
https://openalex.org/W3160294916,"Background Malnutrition among under-five children is a common public health problem and it is one of the main cause for the mortality of under-five children in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Therefore, lack of evidence about geographic heterogeneity and predictors of under-nutrition hinders for evidence-based decision-making process for the prevention and control programs of under-nutrition in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to address this gap. Methods The data were obtained from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016. A total of 9,384 under-five children nested in 645 clusters were included with a stratified two-stage cluster sampling. ArcGIS version 10.5 software was used for global, local and ordinary least square analysis and mapping. The spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) statistic was held in order to assess the pattern of wasting, stunting, and underweight whether it was dispersed, clustered, or randomly distributed. In addition, a Bernoulli model was used to analyze the purely spatial cluster detection of under-nutrition indicators through SaTScan version 9.6 software. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) version 4.0 software was used to model spatial relationships in the GWR analysis. Finally, a statistical decision was made at p -value&lt;0.05 with 95%CI for ordinary least square analysis and geographically weighted regression. Main findings Childhood under-nutrition showed geographical variations at zonal levels in Ethiopia. Accordingly, Somali region (Afder, Gode, Korahe, Warder Zones), Afar region (Zone 2), Tigray region (Southern Zone), and Amhara region (Waghmira Zones) for wasting, Amhara region (West Gojam, Awi, South Gondar, and Waghmira Zones) for stunting and Amhara region (South Wollo, North Wollo, Awi, South Gondar, and Waghmira zones), Afar region (Zone 2), Tigray region (Eastern Zone, North Western Zone, Central Zone, Southern Zone, and Mekele Special Zones), and Benshangul region (Metekel and Assosa Zones) for underweight were detected as hot spot (high risk) regions. In GWR analysis, had unimproved toilet facility for stunting, wasting and underweight, father had primary education for stunting and wasting, father had secondary education for stunting and underweight, mothers age 35–49 years for wasting and underweight, having female children for stunting, having children eight and above for wasting, and mother had primary education for underweight were significant predictors at ( p &lt;0.001). Conclusions Our study showed that the spatial distribution of under-nutrition was clustered and high-risk areas were identified in all forms of under-nutrition indicators. Predictors of under-nutrition were identified in all forms of under-nutrition indicators. Thus, geographic-based nutritional interventions mainly mobilizing additional resources could be held to reduce the burden of childhood under-nutrition in hot spot areas. In addition, improving sanitation and hygiene practice, improving the life style of the community, and promotion of parent education in the identified hot spot zones for under-nutrition should be more emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W3160948441,"Phytophthora agathidicida is associated with a root rot that threatens the long-term survival of the iconic New Zealand kauri. Although it is widely assumed that this pathogen arrived in New Zealand post-1945, this hypothesis has yet to be formally tested. Here we describe evolutionary analyses aimed at evaluating this and two alternative hypotheses. As a basis for our analyses, we assembled complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 16 accessions representing the geographic range of P . agathidicida as well as those of five other members of Phytophthora clade 5. All 21 mitogenome sequences were very similar, differing little in size with all sharing the same gene content and arrangement. We first examined the temporal origins of genetic diversity using a pair of calibration schemes. Both resulted in similar age estimates; specifically, a mean age of 303.0–304.4 years and 95% HPDs of 206.9–414.6 years for the most recent common ancestor of the included isolates. We then used phylogenetic tree building and network analyses to investigate the geographic distribution of the genetic diversity. Four geographically distinct genetic groups were recognised within P . agathidicida . Taken together the inferred age and geographic distribution of the sampled mitogenome diversity suggests that this pathogen diversified following arrival in New Zealand several hundred to several thousand years ago. This conclusion is consistent with the emergence of kauri dieback disease being a consequence of recent changes in the relationship between the pathogen, host, and environment rather than a post-1945 introduction of the causal pathogen into New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W3161113785,"Under conditions of the rapidly developing e-commerce sector especially during pandemic, ensuring high quality of courier service is essential both for clients, as well as courier companies. However, the literature lacks research linking the perspective of clients and organization in the context of courier service quality. The study aims to identify the factors determining courier service quality, their functions and interrelationships in business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce. The main effect of research is the relational model, which is an original and complex approach to courier service quality considering the multi-stakeholder perspective of an online shop, a courier company and an e-customer. Apart from scientific contribution, the model can be used into managerial practice to formulate the recommendations for e-commerce and courier service sector. The research process involved using the quantitative method (electronic surveys conducted among e-shops and e-clients) and the qualitative method (in-depth-interviews carried out among courier enterprises). Finally, based on the empirical research results, the structural analysis was used to develop the model. As a result, the following groups of factors were distinguished that determine the quality of courier services: crucial, determinant, result, autonomous and external factors."
https://openalex.org/W3161537545,"China has a high cesarean delivery (CD) and low labor epidural analgesia (LEA) rate. This online survey was conducted to explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and potential solutions.A voluntary, anonymous survey was distributed via both WeChat and professional websites for 4 months amongst groups of Chinese perinatal professionals. Data was collected and analyzed using a Chi-square test and presented as percentages of respondents.1412 respondents were recorded (43% anesthesiologists, 35% obstetricians, 15.5% midwives or labor and delivery nurses, and 6.5% others), and 1320 respondents were care providers. It was found that 82.7% (1092/1320) of the provider respondents used CD per patient request in fear of lawsuits or yinao/yibao and 63.4% (837/1320) used CD for respecting superstitious culture. The number one reason (noted by 60.2% (795/1320) of all the three specialties) for low LEA use was lack of anesthesia manpower without statistical difference among specialties. The most recommended solution was increasing the anesthesia workforce, proposed by 79.8% (1053/1320) of the three specialties. However, the top solution provided by the two non-anesthesia specialties is different from the one proposed by anesthesiologists. The later (83%, 504/606) suggested increasing the incentive to provide the service is more effective. The answers to questions related to medical knowledge about CD and LEA, and unwillingness of anesthesiologists, parturients and their family members to LEA were similar for the most part, while the opinions regarding low LEA use related to poor experiences and unwillingness of obstetricians and hospital administrators were significantly divided among the three specialties. In the providers' point of view, the unwillingness to LEA from parturient's family members was the most salient (26.1%, 345/1320), which is more than all care providers, hospital administrators, and parturients themselves (16.8%, 222/1320).The reasons for high CD rate and low LEA use are multifactorial. The sociological issues (fear of yinao/yibao and superstitious culture) were the top two contributing factors for the high CD rate in China, while lack of anesthesia manpower was the top response for the low LEA use, which contributes to its being the most recommended solution overall from the three specialties. An incentive approach to providers is a short-term solution while training more perinatal care providers (especially among anesthesiologists and midwives), improving billing systems, and reforming legal systems are 3 systemic approaches to tackling this problem in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W3162055488,"Potato waste was processed and used as a sole substrate for simultaneously producing antifungals and biopigments using Streptomyces spp. Out of three different Streptomyces isolates, strain SO6 stood out due to its ability to produce antifungals against economically important fungal phytopathogens and intracellular biopigments using potato waste powders without additional nutrients. This strain also showed the potential to secrete a broad range of enzymes for fermentation of eight sugars that could be involved in potato waste bioconversion. The results of the fermentation assay indicated that Streptomyces sp. strain SO6 degrades potato wastes during submerged fermentation, diminishing total dry weight and increasing reducing sugars from 0.3 to 3.6 mg·mL-1 and total proteins from 70.6 to 187.7 μg·mL-1. The results showed that Streptomyces strain SO6 was able to convert the potato waste into 0.96 mg·g-1 of diffusible antifungals and 1.75 mg·g-1 of reddish-purple biopigments. On the contrary, an absence of pigment production was observed during the fermentation of the commercial medium used as reference. According to our results, replacement of commercial culture media with available low-cost agroindustrial wastes for producing bioactive chemicals is a real opportunity to enhance the Streptomyces pigment production and antibiotic sustainability with cost-competitiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the simultaneous production of biopigments and diffusible antifungal antibiotics produced by Streptomyces spp. using potato solid waste as the sole nutrient source."
https://openalex.org/W3162423541,"Emerging evidence has shown that active enhancers are abundantly transcribed, generating long non-coding RNAs, called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). While putative eRNAs are often observed from RNA sequencing, the roles of most eRNAs remain largely unknown. Previously, we identified putative enhancer regions at the MALAT1 locus that form chromatin-chromatin interactions under hypoxia, and one of these enhancers is located about 30 kb downstream of the NEAT1 gene and -20 kb upstream of the MALAT1 gene (MALAT1-20 kb enhancer). Here, we report that a novel eRNA, named eRNA of the NEAT1-MALAT1-Locus (eNEMAL), is transcribed from the MALAT1-20 kb enhancer and conserved in primates. We found that eNEMAL is upregulated in response to hypoxia in multiple breast cancer cell lines, but not in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Overexpression and knockdown of eNEMAL revealed that alteration of eNEMAL level does not affect MALAT1 expression. Instead, we found that eNEMAL upregulates the long isoform of NEAT1 (NEAT1_2) without increasing the total NEAT1 transcript level in MCF7 breast cancer cells, suggesting that eNEMAL has a repressive effect on the 3'-end polyadenylation process required for generating the short isoform of NEAT1 (NEAT1_1). Altogether, we demonstrated that an eRNA transcribed from a MALAT1 enhancer regulates NEAT1 isoform expression, implicating the MALAT1-20 kb enhancer and its transcript eNEMAL in co-regulation of MALAT1 and NEAT1 in response to hypoxia in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3163461246,"Against the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide have devised a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate it. However, it is generally difficult to estimate the joint impact of different control strategies. In this paper, we tackle this question with an extended epidemic SEIR model, informed by a socio-political classification of different interventions. First, we inquire the conceptual effect of mitigation parameters on the infection curve. Then, we illustrate the potential of our model to reproduce and explain empirical data from a number of countries, to perform cross-country comparisons. This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs. For instance, our results suggest that, while rapid and strong lockdown is an effective pandemic mitigation measure, a combination of social distancing and early contact tracing can achieve similar mitigation synergistically, while keeping lower isolation rates. This quantitative understanding can support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions, to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks. This paper also provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model."
https://openalex.org/W3160510610,"Antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved prognosis in treatment against HIV infection, however, prolonged exposure is associated to cardiovascular diseases, lipodystrophy, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, metabolic alteration, as obesity which includes the accumulation of oxidative stress in adipose tissue. FGF21 is a peptide hormone that is known to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. FGF21 is expressed and secreted primarily in the liver and adipose tissue, promoting oxidation of glucose/fatty acids and insulin sensitivity. Alterations in FGF21 may be associated with the development of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that FGF21 protein levels are associated with metabolic abnormalities, placing special attention to the alterations in relation to the concurrence of overweight/obesity in people living with HIV (PLWH).Serum FGF21 was analyzed in 241 subjects, 160 PLWH and 81 unrelated HIV-uninfected subjects as a control group. Clinical records were consulted to obtain CD4+ cell counting and number of viral RNA copies. Serum FGF21 levels were tested for correlation with anthropometric and metabolic parameters; glucose, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides, insulin and indexes of atherogenesis and insulin resistance (HOMA).The participants were classified into four groups: (i) PLWH with normal weight, (ii) PLWH with overweight/obesity, (iii) HIV-uninfected with normal weight, and (iv) HIV-uninfected with overweight/obesity. Insulin levels were higher in normal-weight PLWH than in the HIV-uninfected group but not statistically significant, however, for the overweight/obesity PLWH group, insulin levels were significantly higher in comparison with the other three groups (p<0.0001). For FGF21, serum levels were slightly higher in the overweight/obesity groups in both patients and controls. In HIV-infected subjects, FGF21 levels showed a strong positive correlation with triglycerides, insulin levels and insulin resistance with a p-value <0.0001. In the seronegative group, FGF21 was only correlated with weight and waist circumference, showing an important association of FGF21 levels with the degree of obesity of the individuals.Insulin resistance and FGF21 elevations were observed in overweight-obese PLWH. FGF21 elevation could be viewed as a compensation mechanism as, in the control group, FGF21 correlations appeared to be confined to weight and waist circumference. This can be explained based on the action of FGF21 promoting the uptake of glucose in adipose tissue. In PLWH, FGF21 was low, possibly as a result of a change in adiposity leading to a metabolic disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3160704240,"Human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs), a source of cell therapy, have received a great deal of attention due to their homing or migrating ability in response to signals emanating from damaged sites. It has been found that IL-1β possesses the ability to induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in bone marrow MSCs. MMP-3 is involved in cell migration in various types of cells, including glioblastoma, vascular smooth muscle, and adult neural progenitor cells. In this study, we proposed that IL-1β influences hUCMSCs migration involving MMP-3. The expression level of MMP-3 in IL-1β-induced hUCMSCs was verified using cDNA microarray analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA and Western blot. Wound-healing and trans-well assay were used to investigate the cell migration and invasion ability of IL-1β-treated hUCMSCs. In addition, we pre-treated hUCMSCs with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, MMP-3 inhibitors (ALX-260-165, UK 356618), or transfected with MMP-3 siRNA to confirm the role of MMP3 in IL-1β-induced cell migration. Our results showed that IL-1β induced MMP-3 expression is related to the migration of hUCMSCs. Moreover, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126, p38 inhibitor SB205380, JNK inhibitor SP600125 and Akt inhibitor GSK 690693 decreased IL-1β-induced MMP-3 mRNA and protein expression. The migration and invasion ability analyses showed that these inhibitors attenuated the IL-1β-induced migration and invasion ability of hUCMSCs. In conclusion, we have found that IL-1β induces the expression of MMP-3 through ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways to enhance the migration of hUCMSCs. These results provide further understanding of the mechanisms in IL-1β-induced hUCMSCs migration to injury sites."
https://openalex.org/W3162227343,"We evaluated the long-term stability of a newly developed viscoelastic phantom made of polyacrylamide (PAAm) gel for magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and ultrasound-based shear-wave elastography (US SWE). The stiffness of the cylindrical phantom was measured at 0, 13 and 18 months. Storage and loss moduli were measured with MRE, and shear-wave speed (SWS) was measured with US SWE. Long-term stability was evaluated in accordance with the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) profiles for each modality. The initial storage and loss moduli of the phantom were 5.01±0.22 and 1.11±0.15 respectively, and SWS was 2.57±0.04 m/s. The weight of the phantom decreased by 0.6% over the 18 months. When measured with MRE, the stiffness of the phantom decreased and changes to the storage and loss moduli were -3.0% and -4.6% between 0 and 13 months, and -4.3% and 0.0% between 0 and 18 months. The US measurements found that SWS decreased by 2.4% over the first 13 months and 3.6% at 18 months. These changes were smaller than the tolerances specified in the QIBA profiles, so the viscoelastic PAAm gel phantom fulfilled the condition for long-term stability. This new phantom has the potential to be used as a quality assurance and quality control phantom for MRE and US SWE."
https://openalex.org/W3162495998,"Coenzyme A (CoA) is a fundamental cofactor involved in a number of important biochemical reactions in the cell. Altered CoA metabolism results in severe conditions such as pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) in which a reduction of the activity of pantothenate kinase isoform 2 (PANK2) present in CoA biosynthesis in the brain consequently lowers the level of CoA in this organ. In order to develop a new drug aimed at restoring the sufficient amount of CoA in the brain of PKAN patients, we looked at its turnover. We report here the results of two experiments that enabled us to measure the half-life of pantothenic acid, free CoA (CoASH) and acetylCoA in the brains and livers of male and female C57BL/6N mice, and total CoA in the brains of male mice. We administered (intrastriatally or orally) a single dose of a [13C3-15N-18O]-labelled coenzyme A precursor (fosmetpantotenate or [13C3-15N]-pantothenic acid) to the mice and measured, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, unlabelled- and labelled-coenzyme A species appearance and disappearance over time. We found that the turnover of all metabolites was faster in the liver than in the brain in both genders with no evident gender difference observed. In the oral study, the CoASH half-life was: 69 ± 5 h (male) and 82 ± 6 h (female) in the liver; 136 ± 14 h (male) and 144 ± 12 h (female) in the brain. AcetylCoA half-life was 74 ± 9 h (male) and 71 ± 7 h (female) in the liver; 117 ± 13 h (male) and 158 ± 23 (female) in the brain. These results were in accordance with the corresponding values obtained after intrastriatal infusion of labelled-fosmetpantotenate (CoASH 124 ± 13 h, acetylCoA 117 ± 11 and total CoA 144 ± 17 in male brain)."
https://openalex.org/W3162785261,"Introduction In pursuing optimal health care, an adequate medical workforce is crucial. However, many countries are struggling with a misalignment of students’ specialty preferences and societal needs regarding the future medical workforce. In order to bridge this gap, it is relevant to gain a better understanding of the medical career choice processes. We explored career orientations among medical students in the Netherlands and their implications for future career choices. Methods We used Q-methodology, a hybrid qualitative–quantitative method, to explore career orientations of medical students. Medical students from two universities in the Netherlands, varying in year of progression of medical school, ranked 62 statements with regard to importance for their future career choice. Participants explained their ranking in an interview and completed a questionnaire regarding demographics. Using by-person factor analysis we identified groups of individuals with similar orientations. Results Twenty-four students participated in this study, resulting in three distinct orientations towards future careers: a first career orientation that highly values lifelong self-development; a second that values work-life balance, and a third that was more concerned with achievement and recognition of their work. Conclusion Medical students’ career orientations differed in the importance of challenge, work-life balance, and need for recognition. This knowledge can help to design interventions to shift career choices of medical students closer towards future needs in society. Offering career coaching to students that challenges them to explore and prioritise their values, needs and motivations, for example using the materials form this study as a tool, and stimulates them to consider specialties accordingly, could be a promising strategy for guiding students to more long-term satisfying careers."
https://openalex.org/W3111291996,"We aimed to explore the associations of musculoskeletal inflammation patterns with peripheral blood innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations, serum cytokines/chemokines, and treatment response to methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA).We enrolled 100 patients with either RA or SpA and performed ultrasound to evaluate power Doppler signals for synovitis (52 joint regions), tenosynovitis (20 tendons), and enthesitis (44 sites). We performed clustering analysis using unsupervised random forest based on the multi-axis ultrasound information and classified the patients into groups. We identified and counted ILC1-3 populations in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry and also measured the serum levels of 20 cytokines/chemokines. We also determined ACR20 response at 3 months in 38 patients who began treatment with methotrexate after study assessment.Synovitis was more prevalent and severe in RA than in SpA, whereas tenosynovitis and enthesitis were comparable between RA and SpA. Patients were classified into two groups which represented synovitis-dominant and synovitis-nondominant inflammation patterns. While peripheral ILC counts were not significantly different between RA and SpA, they were significantly higher in the synovitis-nondominant group than in the synovitis-dominant group (ILC1-3: p = 0.0007, p = 0.0061, and p = 0.0002, respectively). On the other hand, clustering of patients based on serum cytokines/chemokines did not clearly correspond either to clinical diagnoses or to synovitis-dominant/nondominant patterns. The synovitis-dominant pattern was the most significant factor that predicted clinical response to methotrexate (p = 0.0065).Musculoskeletal inflammation patterns determined by ultrasound are associated with peripheral ILC counts and could predict treatment response to methotrexate."
https://openalex.org/W3160171217,"Generally, electron therapy is applied to tumors on or close to the skin surface. However, this causes a variety of skin-related side effects. To alleviate the risk of these side effects, clinical treatment uses skin dosimeters to verify the therapeutic dose. However, dosimeters suffer from poor accuracy, because their attachment sites are approximated with the help of naked eyes. Therefore, a dosimeter based on a flexible material that can adjust to the contours of the human body is required. In this study, the reproducibility, linearity, dose-rate dependence, and percentage depth ionization (PDI) of PbO and HgO film-based dosimeters are evaluated to explore their potential as large-scale flexible dosimeters. The results demonstrate that both dosimeters deliver impressive reproducibility (within 1.5%) and linearity (≥ 0.9990). The relative standard deviations of the dose-rate dependence of the PbO and HgO dosimeters were 0.94% and 1.16% at 6 MeV, respectively, and 1.08% and 1.25% at 9 MeV, respectively, with the PbO dosimeter outperforming the 1.1% of existing diodes. The PDI analysis of the PbO and HgO dosimeters returned values of 0.014 cm (-0.074 cm) and 0.051 cm (-0.016 cm), respectively at 6 MeV (9 MeV) compared to the thimble chamber and R50. Therefore, the maximum error of each dosimeter is within the allowable range of 0.1 cm. In short, the analysis reveals that the PbO dosimeter delivers a superior performance relative to its HgO counterpart and has strong potential for use as a surface dosimeter. Thus, flexible monoxide materials have the necessary qualities to be used for dosimeters that meet the requisite quality assurance standards and can satisfy a variety of radiation-related applications as flexible functional materials."
https://openalex.org/W3160449589,"Retention in HIV care is a challenge in Mozambique. Mozambique´s southern provinces have the highest mobility levels of the country. Mobility may result in poorer response to HIV care and treatment initiatives.We conducted a cross-sectional survey to explore the impact of mobility on retention for HIV-positive adults on ART presenting to the clinic in December 2017 and January 2018. Survey data were linked to participant clinical records from the HIV care and treatment program. This study took place in Manhiça District, southern Mozambique. We enrolled self-identified migrants (moved outside of Manhiça District ≤12 months prior to survey) and non-migrants, matched by age and sex.390 HIV-positive adults were included. We found frequent movement: 45% of migrants reported leaving the district 3-5 times over the past 12 months, usually for extended stays. South Africa was the most common destination (71%). Overall, 30% of participants had at least one delay (15-60 days) in ART pick-up and 11% were delayed >60 days, though no significant difference was seen between mobile and non-mobile cohorts. Few migrants accessed care while traveling.Our population of mobile and non-mobile participants showed frequent lapses in ART pick-up. Mobility could be for extended time periods and HIV care frequently did not continue at the destination. Studies are needed to evaluate the impact of Mozambique´s approach of providing 3-months ART among mobile populations and barriers to care while traveling, as is better education on how and where to access care when traveling."
https://openalex.org/W3161447459,"The volume of Amharic digital documents has grown rapidly in recent years. As a result, automatic document categorization is highly essential. In this paper, we present a novel dimension reduction approach for improving classification accuracy by combining feature selection and feature extraction. The new dimension reduction method utilizes Information Gain (IG), Chi-square test (CHI), and Document Frequency (DF) to select important features and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine the features that have been selected. We evaluate the proposed dimension reduction method with a dataset containing 9 news categories. Our experimental results verified that the proposed dimension reduction method outperforms other methods. Classification accuracy with the new dimension reduction is 92.60%, which is 13.48%, 16.51% and 10.19% higher than with IG, CHI, and DF respectively. Further work is required since classification accuracy still decreases as we reduce the feature size to save computational time."
https://openalex.org/W3162276636,"There is limited insight into gender differences in suicide-related communication (SRC) in youths. SRC is defined as ""the act of conveying one's own suicide ideation, intent or behaviours to another person"". Increasing our understanding of SRC in youths will enable us to recognize and specify needs of female versus male youths. The current study explores SRC in a sample of Dutch suicide victims aged under 20 and examines gender differences.Interview data from a psychological autopsy study of 35 youths who died by suicide in the Netherlands in 2017 were analysed. Qualitative analyses were performed to examine explicit SRC throughout the youths' lives and implicit SRC during the last months prior to suicide. We employed the Constant Comparative Method to explore patterns in the debut, form, frequency, medium, content, type of recipient, and SRC in the last months prior to suicide death.We identified commonalities in the SRC of youths, including the content of suicide notes and an emphasis on suicide method and preparation in the last months. Girls, however, had an earlier debut of SRC, a higher frequency of explicit SRC, and more often directed SRC towards varied types of recipients compared to boys. Moreover, SRC of girls seemed focused on coping and achieving support from others more than SRC of boys. The SRC of boys in comparison to girls was often ambiguous or diluted by ""humorous"" connotations.Unique patterns in SRC of boys and girls posed corresponding challenges for next of kin to interpret communications and respond adequately to SRC. The early debut of girls' SRC highlights the importance of early screening and prevention efforts in girls, while the late debut and ambiguity in boys' SRC implores professionals and next of kin to encourage young males to be unequivocal about suicide ideation or intent."
https://openalex.org/W3160058665,"Identifying the influential nodes of complex networks is now seen as essential for optimizing the network structure or efficiently disseminating information through networks. Most of the available methods determine the spreading capability of nodes based on their topological locations or the neighbor information, the degree of node is usually used to denote the neighbor information, and the k-shell is used to denote the locations of nodes, However, k-shell does not provide enough information about the topological connections and position information of the nodes. In this work, a new hybrid method is proposed to identify highly influential spreaders by not only considering the topological location of the node but also the neighbor information. The percentage of triangle structures is employed to measure both the connections among the neighbor nodes and the location of nodes, the contact distance is also taken into consideration to distinguish the interaction influence by different step neighbors. The comparison between our proposed method and some well-known centralities indicates that the proposed measure is more highly correlated with the real spreading process, Furthermore, another comprehensive experiment shows that the top nodes removed according to the proposed method are relatively quick to destroy the network than other compared semi-local measures. Our results may provide further insights into identifying influential individuals according to the structure of the networks."
https://openalex.org/W3161303949,"A healthy democracy requires trust that people can be impartial in important truth-seeking institutions including journalism, justice, and science. Recently some U.S. elites have adopted alarmingly extreme rhetoric against truth-seekers, denouncing mainstream journalism as fake news, criminal investigations as partisan witch-hunts, climate science as a hoax, and career civil servants as a deep state conspiracy. In response, some news organizations have taken the unusual step of publishing op/eds defending these institutions. Two experiments tested effects of such op/eds. In study 1, participants spent twelve days using a purpose-built news portal containing real, timely news with random assignment to the availability of real, timely op/eds defending impartiality of truth-seekers. These op/eds increased trust in truth-seeking institutions and increased the belief that people can serve as impartial professionals. Study 2 replicated this with a laboratory experiment assigning video op/ed exposure instead of text op/ed availability while adding several outcomes."

Most family farmers in the region are on the verge of income and food insufficiency, both of which are exacerbated in prolonged periods of droughts. The program assisted farmers in their milk and sheepmeat production, implementing a set of climate-smart production practices and locally-adapted technologies. We find that the program under evaluation had substantive and significant impacts on production practices, land management, and quality of life in general, using several different quasi-experimental strategies to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated farmers. We highlight the strengths and limitations of each evaluation strategy and how the set of analyses and outcome indicators complement each other. The evaluation provides valuable insights into the economic and environmental sustainability of family farming in semiarid regions, which are under growing pressure from climate change and environmental degradation worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3161547567,"To validate the reference ranges proposed by the manufacturer of the Oculus HMC Anomaloscope MR for Rayleigh and Moreland tests in healthy young adults.The manual Rayleigh (red-green) and the Moreland (blue-green) anomaloscope tests were performed on 90 healthy subjects (54 female, 36 male, 178 eyes) residing in Poland, aged between 18-45 years, and without color vision disorders (assessed with HRR test). The analyzed parameters for both the Rayleigh and the Moreland tests were as follows: the lower (R1/M1) and the upper (R2/M2) limits; the center (RC/MC) and the width (RW/MW) of the matching ranges.The results of the Rayleigh test were similar to the values proposed in the anomaloscope user's manual, however, with a small shift of RC and R2 towards the red color. The double-peak distribution of R2 with a small second peak (approximately at R2 = 52) was mainly due to the measurements in male subjects (nmale = 8, nfemale = 2), which suggests that this group might be diagnosed with subtle protanomaly. The results of the Moreland test showed a high MW which did not correspond to the reference range described in the anomaloscope user's manual. The observed significant correlations between R1 and M1 suggest that the M1 parameter seems to be the best indicator of blue vision quality.Oculus HMC Anomaloscope MR is a sensitive tool for detection of prot-deuteranomalies but the reference ranges for young adults require a certain adjustment towards the red color. The parameters obtained for the Moreland test varied significantly between the subjects and therefore the test should not be used as is to diagnose color vision deficits in the green-blue area (tritanomaly)."
https://openalex.org/W3161718901,"There are few studies that characterize sex-related differences in HIV outcomes among adolescents and young adults (AYA) 15-24 years of age.We conducted a retrospective cohort study among AYA who enrolled in a comprehensive HIV program in Mozambique between 2012-2016. We assessed patients by sex and pregnancy/lactation status, comparing time to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation using Cox proportional hazard models. We employed multivariable logistic regression to investigate pre- and post-ART retention. Patients were defined as 'retained pre-ART' if they attended at least 3 of 4 required visits or started ART in the 6 months after enrollment, and 'retained post-ART' if they had any ART pickup or clinical visit during the last 90 days of the one-year follow-up period.Of 47,702 patients in the cohort, 81% (n = 38,511) were female and 19% (n = 9,191) were male. Of the females, 57% (n = 21,770) were non-pregnant and non-lactating (NPNL) and 43% (n = 16,741) were pregnant or lactating (PL). PL (aHR 2.64, 95%CI:2.47-2.81) and NPNL females (aHR 1.36, 95%CI:1.30-1.42) were more likely to initiate ART than males. PL females had higher odds of pre-ART retention in care (aOR 3.56, 95%CI: 3.30-3.84), as did NPNL females (aOR 1.71, 95%CI: 1.62-1.81), compared to males. This was also true for retention post-ART initiation, with higher odds for both PL (aOR 1.78, 95%CI:1.63-1.94) and NPNL females (aOR 1.50, 95%CI:1.35-1.65) compared to males.PL females were most likely to initiate ART and remain in care post-ART in this AYA cohort, likely reflecting expansion of Option B+. Despite pregnancy and policy driven factors, we observed important sex-related disparities in this cohort. NPNL females were more likely to initiate ART and be retained in care before and after ART initiation than males. These data suggest that young males need targeted interventions to improve these important care continuum outcomes."

Taking a University campus environment as a case, we enquire about the social licence for Wi-Fi-based tracking-data analytics. Staff and student participants answered a questionnaire presenting hypothetical scenarios involving Wi-Fi tracking for university research and services. Our results present a Bayesian logistic mixed-effects regression of acceptability judgements as a function of participant ratings on 11 privacy dimensions. Results show widespread acceptance of tracking-data analytics on campus and suggest that trust, individual benefit, data sensitivity, risk of harm and institutional respect for privacy are the most predictive factors determining this acceptance judgement."
https://openalex.org/W3163875370,"Across eukaryotes, homopolymeric repeats of amino acids are enriched in regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. These domains play important roles in signaling, binding, prion formation, and functional phase separation. Azf1p is a prion-forming yeast transcription factor that contains two homorepeat domains, a polyglutamine and a polyasparagine domain. In this work, we report a new phenotype for Azf1p and identify a large set of genes that are regulated by Azf1p during growth in glucose. We show that the polyasparagine (polyN) domain plays a subtle role in transcription but is dispensable for Azf1p localization and prion formation. Genes upregulated upon deletion of the polyN domain are enriched in functions related to carbon metabolism and storage. This domain may therefore be a useful target for engineering yeast strains for fermentation applications and small molecule production. We also report that both the polyasparagine and polyglutamine domains vary in length across strains of S . cerevisiae and propose a model for how this variation may impact protein function."
https://openalex.org/W3161106465,"N-fixing leguminous species can reach atmospheric dinitrogen gas (N 2 ), having an advantage under N-limited degraded environments. These N-fixers are constantly used as facilitative species. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChF) acknowledges how different species take up and use light energy during photosynthesis. These techniques assess stress and performance responses to photosynthesis and are used for the selection of species with potential for reforestation. Six Fabaceae species were selected for this study: three nonfixing species ( Cenostigma tocantinum , Senna reticulata and Dipteryx odorata ) and three N-fixing species ( Clitoria fairchildiana , Inga edulis and Acacia spp.). Variations in chlorophyll fluorescence under high vs. low water and nutrient conditions were studied. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect the effects of seasonality and fertilization on dark-adapted ChF two years after the experiment was established. The correlation among ChF variables and growth, photosynthesis and foliar nutrient concentrations was evaluated. Under high water- and nutrient-availability conditions, plants exhibited an enhanced performance index on absorption basis values correlated with electron transport fluxes. Under drought and nutrient-poor conditions, most species exhibit increased energy dissipation as photoprotection. High interspecific variation was found; therefore, species-specific responses should be considered in future ChF studies. Corroborating the ability to colonize high-light environments, N-fixers showed an increased performance index correlated with electron transport and Zn and N foliar concentrations. Negative correlations were found between photosynthesis and trapped fluxes. Diameter growth was positively correlated with electron transport fluxes. Given the different responses among species, ChF is an effective technique to screen for seasonality, fertilization and species effects and should be considered for use during forest restoration. Finally, the addition of fertilization treatments may facilitate tropical forest restoration due to the importance of nutrients in physiological processes. N-fixers showed high photochemical performance and tolerance to abiotic stress in degraded areas and therefore should be included to support ecosystem biomass restoration."

Traffic accessibility must be considered in optimizing the location of rural waste transfer stations, which is an important difference from the location of rural waste transfer stations. On the basis of previous studies, this study will consider the impact of traffic network on the optimization locations of waste transfer station in the rural areas. The objective of this study was to ensure the minimum Euclidean distance between the waste transfer station and the population center is the maximum, minimize the garbage transportation cost of each population center, construction costs for waste transfer stations, construction and upgrade costs for roads on a traffic network. A multi-objective facility location-network design model and an improved multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm was used to solve the problem. A detailed practical case study was used to illustrate the application of the proposed mathematical model. The results show that transportation network plays an important role in facility location optimization, and the improvement of traffic network conditions can greatly reduce waste transportation costs."

This study traced WLWHIV disengaged from care and their infants and compared their outcomes with those retained in care.The study included WLWHIV who initiated ART during pregnancy at six public clinics in Uganda. A woman was defined as disengaged (DW) if she had not attended her 6-week post-partum visit by 10 weeks after her estimated date of delivery. DW were matched with retained women (RW) by age and duration on ART. Nurse counselors traced all selected DW via telephone and community visits to assess vital status, infant HIV sero-status and maternal HIV viral load through blood draws.Between July 2017 and July 2018, 734 women (359 DW and 375 RW) were identified for the study. Tracing was attempted on 349 DW and 160 (44.6%) were successfully located and enrolled in the study. They were matched with 162 RW. Among DW, 52 (32.5%) transferred to another health facility. Very few DW, 39.0% were HIV virally suppressed (<1000 copies/ml) compared to RW 89.5%, P<0.001). Among 138 babies born to DW, 4.3% tested positive for HIV compared to 1.4% among babies born to RW (P = 0.163).Pregnant and breastfeeding WLWHIV who disengage from care are difficult to find in urban environments.

They were classified into three groups according to the amniotic fluid index (AFI) and ultrasonographic estimated fetal weight (EFW) as isolated oligohydramnios (defined as AFI below 5% and appropriate EFW corresponding to gestational age) (n = 34) and IUGR (defined as EFW below 5% corresponding to gestational age irrespective amniotic fluid) (n = 17), and normal pregnancy (n = 61). HFUPR was measured using three-dimensional virtual organ computer-aided analysis. Adverse perinatal outcomes in all participants were examined.There was no significant difference in HFUPR between patients with isolated oligohydramnios and women with normal pregnancies (median, 40.0 mL/h [interquartile range [IQR] 31.0-66.5] vs. 48.6 [31.5-81.2], p = 0.224). HFUPR was significantly decreased in the IUGR group (13.8 mL/h [IQR 10.1-24.8]), compared to the normal pregnancy group (p<0.001) and the isolated oligohydramnios group (p<0.001). HFUPR was significantly decreased in neonates with adverse perinatal outcomes compared to the control (24.7 mL/h [IQR 13.4-47.4] vs. 43.6 [29.8-79.0], p = 0.016).HFUPR was not decreased in patients with isolated oligohydramnios but was decreased in patients with IUGR when compared to normal controls at term."
https://openalex.org/W3162389971,"The aim of our study was to quantify sex-specific patterns of smoking prevalence and initiation in 10-year birth cohorts from 1910 to 1989 in Australia. We combined individual data of 385,810 participants from 33 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1962 and 2018. We found that age-specific smoking prevalence varied considerably between men and women within birth cohorts born before 1960. The largest difference was observed in the earliest cohort (1910-1919), with up to 37.7% point greater proportion of current smokers in men than in women. In subsequent cohorts, the proportion decreased among men, but increased among women, until there was no more than 7.4% point difference in the 1960-69 birth cohort. In the 1970-79 and 1980-89 cohorts, smoking among men marginally increased, but the proportion was at most ~11.0% points higher than women. Our analysis of initiation indicated that many women born before the 1930s who smoked commenced smoking after age 25 years (e.g., ~27% born in 1910-19); compared to at most 8% of men in any birth cohort. The earliest birth cohort (1910-1919) had the greatest difference in age at initiation between sexes; 26.6 years in women versus 19.0 in men. In later cohorts, male and female smokers initiated increasingly earlier, converging in the 1960-69 cohort (17.6 and 17.8 years, respectively). While 22.9% of men and 8.4% of women initiated smoking aged < = 15 in the 1910-1919 cohort, in the latest cohort (1980-89) the reverse was true (21.4% and 28.8% for men and women, respectively). Marked differences in smoking prevalence and age at initiation existed between birth cohorts of Australian men and women born before 1960; after this, sex-specific trends in prevalence and initiation were similar. Understanding these patterns may inform the evaluation of tobacco control policies and the targeting of potential interventions for exposed populations such as lung cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3162956632,"Lung cancer (LC) is a malignant tumor that poses the greatest threat to human health and life. Most studies suggested that the occurrence of LC is associated with environmental and genetic factors. We aimed to explore the association between COL6A4P2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CHD risk in the Chinese Southern Han population. Based on the 'case-control' experimental design (510 cases and 495 controls), we conducted an association study between five candidate COL6A4P2 SNPs and the corresponding LC risk. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression to analyze the LC susceptibility under different genetic models. The results showed that COL6A4P2 rs34445363 was significantly associated with LC risk under alleles model (OR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.01-1.58, p = 0.038). In addition, rs34445363 was also significantly associated with LC risk under the log-additive model (OR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.01-1.58, p = 0.041).

Since long, dietary education has been performed to improve the nutritional status of patients after a gastrectomy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of simplified dietary education on the nutritional status of patients after a gastrectomy. A total of 1,150 patients with gastric cancer underwent surgery between March 2014 and October 2015 at the Samsung Medical Center (SMC). Of these, we used the case-control matching method (1:1 match) by stratifying the factors of age and sex and included 100 patients in each group. The clinicopathologic data of the patients for two years after the gastrectomy were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The educated group (ED, N = 100) was provided with a simplified, ordinary dietary education at regular outpatient clinic visits that occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after gastrectomy and at 1-year intervals thereafter. The clinicopathologic characteristics and nutritional parameters of the educated group (ED) (N = 100) and the non-educated group (NED) (n = 100) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical characteristics and serological parameters. Nutritional parameters, which included body weight loss, body mass index (BMI) change, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), were also not significantly different between the two groups. Simplified dietary education at regular outpatient clinic visits was ineffective in reducing weight loss after a subtotal gastrectomy. Further research or other methods may be needed to reduce weight loss after a gastrectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3160469807,"Early diagnosis of prostate cancer is a challenging issue due to the lack of specific markers. Therefore, a sensitive diagnostic marker that is expressed or upregulated exclusively in prostate cancer cells would facilitate diagnostic procedures and ensure a better outcome. We evaluated the expression of myosin 1C isoform A in 5 prostate cell lines, 41 prostate cancer cases, and 11 benign hyperplasias. We analyzed the expression of 12 surface molecules on prostate cancer cells by flow cytometry and analyzed whether high or low myosin 1C isoform A expression could be attributed to a distinct phenotype of prostate cancer cells. Median myosin 1C isoform A expression in prostate cancer samples and cancer cell lines was 2 orders of magnitude higher than in benign prostate hyperplasia. Based on isoform A expression, we could also distinguish clinical stage 2 from clinical stage 3. Among cell lines, PC-3 cells with the highest myosin 1C isoform A level had diminished numbers of CD10/CD13-positive cells and increased numbers of CD29 (integrin β1), CD38, CD54 (ICAM1) positive cells. The surface phenotype of clinical samples was similar to prostate cancer cell lines with high isoform A expression and could be described as CD10-/CD13- with heterogeneous expression of other markers. Both for cell lines and cancer specimens we observed the strong correlation of high myosin 1C isoform A mRNA expression and elevated levels of CD29 and CD54, suggesting a more adhesive phenotype for cells with high isoform A expression. Compared to normal tissue, prostate cancer samples had also reduced numbers of CD24- and CD38-positive cells. Our data suggest that a high level of myosin 1C isoform A is a specific marker both for prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer cell lines. High expression of isoform A is associated with less activated (CD24/CD38 low) and more adhesive (CD29/CD54 high) surface phenotype compared to benign prostate tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3160862363,"In many physiological systems, real-time endogeneous and exogenous signals in living organisms provide critical information and interpretations of physiological functions; however, these signals or variables of interest are not directly accessible and must be estimated from noisy, measured signals. In this paper, we study an inverse problem of recovering gas exchange signals of animals placed in a flow-through respirometry chamber from measured gas concentrations. For large-scale experiments (e.g., long scans with high sampling rate) that have many uncertainties (e.g., noise in the observations or an unknown impulse response function), this is a computationally challenging inverse problem. We first describe various computational tools that can be used for respirometry reconstruction and uncertainty quantification when the impulse response function is known. Then, we address the more challenging problem where the impulse response function is not known or only partially known. We describe nonlinear optimization methods for reconstruction, where both the unknown model parameters and the unknown signal are reconstructed simultaneously. Numerical experiments show the benefits and potential impacts of these methods in respirometry."

A serial reaction time task was used as a measure of implicit sequence learning and a similar task but with the addition of a simple counting task, was used as a measure of dual task ability. We have present thorough descriptive statistics of the data but we have refrained from any inferential statistics due to the small sample size. All participants understood the task instructions and the difficulty level of both tasks was deemed acceptable. There were indications of task fatigue that demand careful choices for how best to analyse the data from such tasks in future trials. Ceiling effects were present in several accuracy outcomes, but not in the reaction time outcomes. Overall, we found both tasks to be feasible to use in samples of individuals with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and healthy older individuals."

We find a strong increase in built-up area over time, mostly concentrated in the vicinity of roads, and also directly on the coast. We find strong evidence of agglomeration effects both in the static sense-buildup in one cell predicts buildup in a nearby cell-and in a dynamic sense-buildup in a cell predicts buildup in that cell later on and an increase in buildup in nearby cells. These effects are strongest over a 3 to 15 Km radius, which corresponds to a natural hinterland for a population without mechanized transportation. We find no evidence that human settlements are spaced more or less equally either over the landscape or along roads. This suggests that arable land is not yet fully utilized, allowing rural settlements to be separated by areas of un-farmed land.

To reduce unnecessary restriction of patient's daily life after inpatient 131I ablation therapy, we propose a practical individualized method for radiation precaution based on dose rate at release time.We evaluated 215 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent inpatient 131I ablation therapy following total thyroidectomy. Effective dose equivalent rates at 1-m distance were measured upon release (EDRR) on day 2 and during delayed whole-body scan (EDRD) visits on day 6‒8 after 131I administration. The biexponential model was designed to estimate total effective dose equivalent to others. To assess conservativeness of our model, EDRD estimated by our model was compared with measured EDRD. EDRR-based periods of precaution not to receiving 1 mSv of radiation exposure were estimated and compared with those based on administered radioactivities on American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommendations.The EDRR ranged from 1.0-48.9 μSv/hr. The measured EDRD were equal to or lower than estimated EDRD in all patients, except for one, indicating that our model is sufficiently conservative. According to our model, no subjects needed additional daytime restriction after release. The maximum permissible times for public transportation use were longer in all patients compared with those based on administered radioactivities. Nighttime restriction periods were significantly shorter than those based on administered radioactivity; median periods requiring sleeping apart were 0 (range, 0‒5), 4 (range, 1‒14), and 3 (range, 2‒13) days after release in patients treated with radioactivity doses of 2.96, 5.50, and 7.40 GBq, respectively, needing 8, 16, and 19 additional days, respectively, based on administered radioactivity.Radiation safety instructions using proposed method based on EDRR of individual patient could safely reduce the burden of radiation precaution."
https://openalex.org/W3163806459,"Introduction Multi-site pain has not been investigated among adolescents suffering from knee pain. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of pain in adolescents with knee-pain, to determine if multi-site pain in adolescents together with other established prognostic factors (frequency of pain, sex, sports participation, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)) was associated with five-year prognosis of knee-pain and function. Methods This prospective cohort study included 504 adolescents with knee pain and 252 controls. At five-year follow-up, participants responded to an questionnaire which documented prescence and severity of knee pain and co-occurring pain. Results At follow-up, 358 (71.0%) of those with knee-pain at baseline, and 182 (72.2%) controls responded. Female sex, low HRQoL, daily pain, and multi-site pain were associated with an increased odds of knee pain after 5 years (odds ratio: 1.41–3.37). Baseline multi-site pain was not associated with problems running at follow-up, whereas higher sports participation at baseline was associated with less problems running at follow-up (odd ratio 0.49). Among those with knee-pain at inclusion, the number of pain sites increased from a median of 2 (IQR 1–3) to 4 (IQR 2–6) at follow-up (P&lt;0.05). Those with multi-site pain at follow-up score significantly worse in self-reported knee function, compared to those with one pain site only. Conclusion This study identified a set of factors that appeared to be associated with an increased risk of knee pain at five years follow up. Research is needed to understand and help direct treatment of adolescents with multi-site pain."
https://openalex.org/W3161016612,"Studies on physiotherapists are generally focused on clinical professionalism, with very few examining job performance from a management standpoint. To address this gap, this study sought to investigate the relationship between impression management and organizational citizenship behavior and job performance. This study targeted medical institutions offering rehabilitation and physiotherapy services and conducted a questionnaire survey based on scales developed by domestic and foreign scholars. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed and 523 valid ones collected. The data was tested and verified using regression analysis and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). In the survey, the Impression Management Scale, Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale, and Job Performance Scale indicated that at the individual level, the impression management of physiotherapists is significantly related to their organizational citizenship behaviors and job performance. The organizational citizenship behaviors were also found to have a mediating effect between impression management and job performance. At the group level, impression management had a conditioning effect on organizational citizenship behaviors and job performance. In terms of statistical methods, group-level variables act as moderators, which affects the power of individual-level explanatory variables on outcome variables, i.e., the influence of the slope. The job behaviors of physiotherapists entail direct service and their performance is closely related to organizational development. Impression management gives people certain purposes and behaviors while organizational citizenship behaviors are a type of non-self-seeking, selfless dedication behaviors. Therefore, the motivation of physiotherapists who demonstrate organizational citizenship behaviors should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W3161519325,"Scholars from different theoretical schools have posited that in recent decades, science and society have moved closer together, and the concept of academic engagement has been proposed to capture one part of this approximation empirically. This study analyzes the academic engagement of individual scholars towards politicians, industry representatives and journalists. It uses comprehensive survey data on Swiss professors from all disciplines, all the country's universities and from associated research institutes. It assesses, firstly, the degree to which these professors have professional contacts to journalists, politicians and industry representatives. Secondly, it explains the extent of these contacts, using multi-level modelling that incorporates individual factors as well as organizational and institutional contexts. Our study shows that academic engagement is quite common with strong differences between disciplines. Furthermore, professors with higher academic productivity, positive personal attitude towards communication activities as well as a leadership position have more outside contacts. The gender and nationality of the professors, however, only play a role for some of the contacts with non-scientific actors."
https://openalex.org/W3161669535,"Considering the amorphous and nano-crystalline cluster structure and their activity, on the basis of the mixed structure Ni-Mo alloys, the crystallization kinetics of the alloys and the performance of the alloys after heat treatment with different mixed structure were studied. The phase structure and composition were determined by X-ray powder diffraction. The crystallization activation energy of the mixed structure was obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. The electrochemical activity of the mixed structure alloy was determined by electrochemical analysis. The experimental results show that the structural stability of the mixed-structure alloy is better, but the crystallization activation energy is much lower than that of the amorphous alloy. The crystallization process consists of a meta-stable structure transition and a new phase formation. The electrochemical properties of the alloy indicated that the alloy with the mixed structure has higher electrochemical activity, with higher hardness and better corrosion resistance, which results from the large true contact surface and the large number of active centers in this material structure."
https://openalex.org/W3162107334,"Extreme cold and frost cause significant stress to plants which can potentially be lethal. Low temperature freezing stress can cause significant and irreversible damage to plant cells and can induce physiological and metabolic changes that impact on growth and development. Low temperatures cause physiological responses including winter dormancy and autumn cold hardening in strawberry ( Fragaria ) species, and some diploid F . vesca accessions have been shown to have adapted to low-temperature stresses. To study the genetics of freezing tolerance, a F . vesca mapping population of 143 seedlings segregating for differential responses to freezing stress was raised. The progeny was mapped using ‘Genotyping-by-Sequencing’ and a linkage map of 2,918 markers at 851 loci was resolved. The mapping population was phenotyped for freezing tolerance response under controlled and replicated laboratory conditions and subsequent quantitative trait loci analysis using interval mapping revealed a single significant quantitative trait locus on Fvb2 in the physical interval 10.6 Mb and 15.73 Mb on the F . vesca v4.0 genome sequence. This physical interval contained 896 predicted genes, several of which had putative roles associated with tolerance to abiotic stresses including freezing. Differential expression analysis of the 896 QTL-associated gene predictions in the leaves and crowns from ‘Alta’ and ‘NCGR1363’ parental genotypes revealed genotype-specific changes in transcript accumulation in response to low temperature treatment as well as expression differences between genotypes prior to treatment for many of the genes. The putative roles, and significant interparental differential expression levels of several of the genes reported here identified them as good candidates for the control of the effects of freezing tolerance at the QTL identified in this investigation and the possible role of these candidate genes in response to freezing stress is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3162484250,"Single Particle Tracking (SPT) is a well known class of tools for studying the dynamics of biological macromolecules moving inside living cells. In this paper, we focus on the problem of localization and parameter estimation given a sequence of segmented images. In the standard paradigm, the location of the emitter inside each frame of a sequence of camera images is estimated using, for example, Gaussian fitting (GF), and these locations are linked to provide an estimate of the trajectory. Trajectories are then analyzed by using Mean Square Displacement (MSD) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques to determine motion parameters such as diffusion coefficients. However, the problems of localization and parameter estimation are clearly coupled. Motivated by this, we have created an Expectation Maximization (EM) based framework for simultaneous localization and parameter estimation. We demonstrate this framework through two representative methods, namely, Sequential Monte Carlo combined with Expectation Maximization (SMC-EM) and Unscented Kalman Filter combined with Expectation Maximization (U-EM). Using diffusion in two-dimensions as a prototypical example, we conduct quantitative investigations on localization and parameter estimation performance across a wide range of signal to background ratios and diffusion coefficients and compare our methods to the standard techniques based on GF-MSD/MLE. To demonstrate the flexibility of the EM based framework, we do comparisons using two different camera models, an ideal camera with Poisson distributed shot noise but no readout noise, and a camera with both shot noise and the pixel-dependent readout noise that is common to scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. Our results indicate our EM based methods outperform the standard techniques, especially at low signal levels. While U-EM and SMC-EM have similar accuracy, U-EM is significantly more computationally efficient, though the use of the Unscented Kalman Filter limits U-EM to lower diffusion rates."
https://openalex.org/W3162351359,"To develop and assess a novel guidance technique and instrumentation system for minimally invasive short-stemmed total shoulder arthroplasty that will help to reduce the complications associated with traditional open replacement such as poor muscle healing and neurovascular injury. We have answered key questions about the developed system including (1) can novel patient-specific guides be accurately registered and used within a minimally invasive environment?; (2) can accuracy similar to traditional techniques be achieved?A novel intra-articular patient-specific guide was developed for use with a new minimally invasive posterior surgical approach that guides bone preparation without requiring muscle resection or joint dislocation. Additionally, a novel set of instruments were developed to enable bone preparation within the minimally invasive environment. The full procedure was evaluated in six cadaveric shoulders, using digitizations to assess accuracy of each step.Patient-specific guide registration accuracy in 3D translation was 2.2±1.2mm (RMSE±1 SD; p = 0.007) for the humeral component and 2.7±0.7mm (p<0.001) for the scapula component. Final implantation accuracy was 2.9±3.0mm (p = 0.066) in translation and 5.7-6.8±2.2-4.0° (0.001<p<0.009) across the humerus implants' three rotations. Similarly, the glenoid component's implantation accuracy was 3.0±1.7mm (p = 0.008) in translation and 2.3-4.3±2.2-4.4° (0.008<p<0.09) in rotation.This system achieves minimally invasive shoulder replacement with accuracy similar to traditional open techniques while avoiding common causes of complications.This novel technique could lead to a paradigm shift in shoulder arthroplasty for patients with moderate arthritis, which could significantly improve rehabilitation and functional outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3163948993,"Redox imbalance may compromise the homeostasis of physiological processes indispensable to gestational development in HIV-infected women. The present study aims to evaluate markers of the redox system in the development of pregnancy of these women. HIV-positive pregnant women, HIV-negative pregnant women and non-pregnant were studied. Redox markers superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), protein carbonylation and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed at first or second trimester, third trimester and postpartum from pregnant and from non-pregnant women. According to the longitudinal analysis model, CAT activity was increased in the postpartum in HIV-positive women and before delivery in HIV-negative women. Increased carbonylation was observed in the pre-delivery period of HIV-negative pregnant women and MDA concentrations were higher in HIV-positive pregnant women compared to those non-infected by HIV at all times. According to the factorial model, higher SOD and CAT activities were observed in HIV-positive women in the initial months of pregnancy and in non-pregnant women. Carbonylation at third trimester was more evident in HIV-negative pregnant women. MDA levels were higher in HIV-positive pregnant women. Increased oxidative stress may occur in HIV-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, the HIV virus is not solely responsible for this process; instead, mechanisms inherent to the pregnancy seem to play a role in this imbalance."
