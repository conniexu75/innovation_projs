https://openalex.org/W1608005125,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been implicated in metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, due to their activity in liver and adipose tissue on genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis. Here, we show that the PPARα and PPARγ forms are expressed in differentiated human monocyte-derived macrophages, which participate in inflammation control and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Whereas PPARα is already present in undifferentiated monocytes, PPARγ expression is induced upon differentiation into macrophages. Immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrates that PPARα resides constitutively in the cytoplasm, whereas PPARγ is predominantly nuclear localized. Transient transfection experiments indicate that PPARα and PPARγ are transcriptionally active after ligand stimulation. Ligand activation of PPARγ, but not of PPARα, results in apoptosis induction of unactivated differentiated macrophages as measured by the TUNEL assay and the appearance of the active proteolytic subunits of the cell death protease caspase-3. However, both PPARα and PPARγ ligands induce apoptosis of macrophages activated with tumor necrosis factor α/interferon γ. Finally, PPARγ inhibits the transcriptional activity of the NFκB p65/RelA subunit, suggesting that PPAR activators induce macrophage apoptosis by negatively interfering with the anti-apoptotic NFκB signaling pathway. These data demonstrate a novel function of PPAR in human macrophages with likely consequences in inflammation and atherosclerosis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)1 are transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor gene family (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

PPARα is predominantly expressed in tissues exhibiting high catabolic rates of fatty acids (liver, heart, kidney, and muscle) (3Isseman I. Green S.

PPARs function as ligand-dependent transcription factors, which, upon heterodimerization with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, bind to specific response elements termed peroxisome proliferator-response element (PPRE), thus regulating the expression of target genes. Most PPREs identified to date reside in genes involved in intra- and extracellular lipid metabolism (for review, see Ref. 2Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin.

The observation that PPARs are activated by arachidonic acid metabolites suggested a role for these transcription factors not only in lipid metabolism, but also in inflammation control. Furthermore, both PPARα and PPARγ are activated by a number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin (13Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Unequivocal evidence for a role of PPARα in inflammation control came from the demonstration that mice rendered deficient for PPARα by homologous recombination display a prolonged response to inflammatory stimuli (10Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Formation of atherosclerotic lesions is a multicellular process in which lipids and extracellular matrix accumulate in the intima of arteries and a local inflammatory response is elicited due to the activation of macrophages, T-lymphocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (14Munro J.M. Cotran R.S. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar, 16Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Seifert P.S. Stemme S. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-loaden foam cells, derived principally from monocyte-derived macrophages (17Gerrity R.G. Naito H.K. Richardson M. Schwartz C.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1979; 95: 775-792PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rosenfeld M.E. Tsukada T. Gown A.M. Ross R. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 1: 9-23Crossref Google Scholar, 19Aqel N.M. Ball R.Y. Waldman H. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1984; 53: 265-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), are a characteristic feature of atherosclerotic plaques (20Guyton J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The accumulation of macrophages in the arterial wall follows adhesion of circulating monocytes to the endothelium and their subsequent transmigration into the arterial intima (17Gerrity R.G. Naito H.K. Richardson M. Schwartz C.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1979; 95: 775-792PubMed Google Scholar). In the subendothelial space monocytes mature into tissue macrophages and acquire the ability to recognize oxidatively modified lipoproteins by expressing scavenger receptors (21Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1990; 343: 508-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). When macrophages take up these lipoproteins, the cholesterol is stored in the cytoplasm in cholesteryl ester droplets, which give the cells its foamy appearance, thus accounting for the term foam cells (23Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulation of cholesterol triggers macrophages to secrete cytokines, growth factors, and other mediators that promote smooth muscle cell proliferation and provoke a local inflammatory reaction (15Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar, 24Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 14: 915-924Google Scholar). Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death involved in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis (25Wyllie A.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 1: 95-103Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar), may be induced by these cytokines resulting in cell death of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions (26Libby P. Geng Y.J. Aikawa M. Schoenbeck U. Mach F. Clinton S.K. Sukhova G.K. Lee R.T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition to apoptosis, in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, macrophages and lipid-loaded foam cells undergo necrosis thereby releasing their intracellular contents due to cytolysis resulting in the formation of the lipid-rich core of the atheromatous plaque (27Geng Y.J. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 251-266PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the role of PPARs in lipid metabolism and inflammatory control, we hypothesized a function for PPARs at the level of the vascular wall which, independent of their role in lipoprotein metabolism, could modulate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we initiated studies on the expression and functions of PPARs in circulating human monocytes and in macrophages during differentiation, a crucial event in atherosclerosis development and vascular inflammation. Our results show that PPARα is already expressed in undifferentiated human monocytes, whereas PPARγ only becomes expressed in human macrophages upon differentiation. Treatment of differentiated macrophages with PPAR activators induces apoptosis, an effect which is more pronounced in macrophages activated with IFNγ and TNFα. Finally, we show that PPARγ inhibits the transcriptional activity of the NFκB subunit p65/RelA, indicating that PPARγ activators may promote TNFα-induced apoptosis in macrophages by interfering negatively with the anti-apoptotic NFκB pathway (28Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 29Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood of healthy normolipidemic donors (thrombopheresis residues) (31Rouis M. Nigon F. Lafuma C. Hornebeck W. Chapman M.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 246-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After Ficoll gradient centrifugation, the monocytes were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing gentamycin (40 μg/ml), glutamine (0,05%) (Sigma), and either 5% pooled human serum and 5% fetal calf serum (apoptosis assays) or 10% pooled human serum (other assays). Cells were cultured at a density of 3 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plastic culture dishes (Primaria, Polylabo, Strasbourg, France). Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages occurred spontaneously by adhesion of cells to the culture dish. Mature monocyte-derived macrophages, as characterized by immunocytochemistry with anti-CD 68 antibody, were used for experiments after 12 days of culture. For treatment with the different activators medium was changed to RPMI 1640 medium with 1% Nutridoma HU (Boehringer Mannheim). Total cellular RNA was extracted using theRNA plus kit (Bioprobe System, Montreuil, France). For RT-PCR analysis of PPARα and PPARγ expression, total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland) and subsequently amplified by PCR using as primers for PPARα 5′-GACGAATGCCAAGATCTGAGAAAGC-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCCTTTGTAGTGCTGTCAGC-3′ (fragment size: 948 bp); and for PPARγ, 5′-GGCAATTGAATGTCGTGTCTGTGGAGATAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTCCAGGGCTTGTAGCAGGTTGTCTTGA-3′ (fragment size: 900 bp). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers (sense primer: 5′-ATGCAGCCCCGAATGCTCCTCATCGTGGCC-3′; antisense primer: 5′-TTCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT-3′) were used as control (fragment size, 239 bp). The resulting products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. For RNase protection analysis, an antisense human PPARα riboprobe was obtained by subcloning a SmaI/SacI human PPARα cDNA fragment (spanning bp 800–983 (32Mukherjee R. Jow L. Noonan D. McDonnell D.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar)) into the pBSKS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PPARα, covering 54 bp of vector sequence plus 183 bp of PPARα mRNA, and 36B4 riboprobes were in vitro transcribed in the presence of [32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) using T3 RNA Polymerase and the RNA transcription kit (Stratagene). The RNA protection assay was carried out using the HybSpeed RNase protection kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized simultaneously to human PPARα (8.4 × 104 cpm) and 36B4 (4 × 103 cpm) antisense probes. RNA samples were electrophoresed on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Protected fragments representing human PPARα and 36B4 mRNA were quantified on a GS525 PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Values were normalized to the internal 36B4 control. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing PBS, 1% Triton X-100, and a freshly prepared protease inhibitor mixture (ICN, Orsay, France) (10 μg/ml AEBSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 5 mg/ml EDTA-Na2) to which 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Cell homogenates were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchonic acid assay (Pierce Interchim, Montlucon, France). Electrophoresis of the indicated amount of protein lysate was performed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and membranes were checked for equal loading by Ponceau red staining. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 10% skim milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris, 55 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were subsequently incubated for 4 h at room temperature in 5% skim milk-TBST containing rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against N-terminal PPARα (amino acids 10–56), PPARγ peptides (33Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspé E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.-C. Deeb S. Vidal-Puig A. Flier J. Briggs M.R. Staels B. Vidal H. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18779-18789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody against caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories, Montlucon, France). Specificity of PPAR antibodies was checked by Western blot analysis using in vitro synthesized PPARα and PPARγ protein (Fig. 2 B). After incubation with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody, signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Cells were fixed (30 min at room temperature) in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), washed in 0.01m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.4) and incubated with 0.1 m lysine to avoid nonspecific fluorescence. After permeabilization in cold methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) for 5 min at room temperature, nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating the cells in TNO (0.01 m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% ovalbumin) with 1% preimmune goat serum. After incubation with anti-PPARα, -PPARγ, mouse monoclonal anti-CD68 antigen (clone KP1), or anti-CD3 antigen (clone T3–4B5) (Dako, Trappes, France) antibodies, proteins were visualized using secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies using a LEITZ DMR fluorescence microscope. The J3TKpGL3 plasmid, which contains 3 copies of the human apoA-II gene promoter PPRE-containing J site cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in the pGL3 luciferase expression vector (34Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), was used as a reporter vector. Monocyte-derived macrophages at day 12 of culture were transfected by the lipofection procedure (DOTAP; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) with the reporter plasmid (2.5 μg/well of a 6-well culture dish) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% Nutridoma HU. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells were washed with PBS and ligands for PPARα (Wy14, 643; Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS), PPARγ (BRL49653 and PG-J2), or solvent dimethyl sulfoxide were added in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% calf serum delipoproteinized by ultracentrifugation in KBr (1.21 g/ml) and subsequently treated with AG.1.X8 resin (Bio-Rad) plus activated charcoal, and cells were incubated further for 36 h. For NFκB and PPARγ co-transfection assays, transient transfections were performed in COS-1 cells at 50–60% confluency by the calcium-phosphate co-precipitation procedure using a mixture of plasmids containing the indicated reporter (2 μg/60-mm culture dish), expression (1 μg) and internal control pPGKβgeobpA (500 ng) β-galactosidase activity (35Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar) vectors. After 6 h cells were washed with PBS and incubated in fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum with BRL49653 (10 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) and incubated for another 48 h. Luciferase activity was determined on cell extracts using a luciferase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Monocyte-derived macrophages (12 days of culture) were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 1% Nutridoma HU, TNFα, and IFNγ and/or Wy14,643, BRL49653, PG-J2, or solvent (Me2SO). Apoptotic cells were detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection and Cell Death ELISA kits (Boehringer Mannheim). To study the expression of PPARα and PPARγ in human monocyte-derived macrophages, a qualitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using specific primers on RNA from freshly isolated human monocytes and macrophages at different stages of differentiation. RT-PCR amplification yielded a DNA fragment of the expected size (920 bp) indicating the presence of PPARα mRNA both in undifferentiated monocytes as well as in macrophages during all stages of differentiation (Fig. 1 A). Using a quantitative RNase protection assay human PPARα mRNA was detected in monocytes albeit at low levels (Fig. 1 B). PPARα mRNA levels increased between day 0 (monocytes) and day 4 (cells undergoing differentiation), staying constant during the following maturation phases (days 6–10) and further increasing in fully differentiated macrophages after 12 days of culture (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to PPARα, PPARγ mRNA was not detectable by RT-PCR analysis in non-differentiated cells (Fig. 1 A). However, PPARγ mRNA was induced during the first stages of macrophage differentiation staying present thereafter (Fig. 1 A). Similar results of PPARγ expression were obtained by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To determine PPAR protein expression in monocytes and differentiated macrophages, Western blot analysis was performed using PPARα- and PPARγ-specific antibodies, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis using in vitro produced PPARα and PPARγ protein (Fig. 2 B). A single band corresponding to PPARα was detected in undifferentiated monocytes (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the amount of PPARα protein increased upon differentiation (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, PPARγ protein was not detectable in monocytes, but its expression appeared in cells undergoing differentiation into macrophages (Fig. 2 A). Therefore PPARα and PPARγ protein levels closely follow the changes in mRNA levels (Figs. 1 and 2). To identify the subcellular localization of PPARα and PPARγ in differentiating macrophages, immunofluorescence analysis was performed. Staining with PPARα antibody revealed immunoreactivity in monocytes as well as in macrophages during all phases of the differentiation process (Fig. 3, A, E, I, and O). Interestingly, labeling was detected primarily in the cytoplasmic compartment, indicating that PPARα protein resides predominantly in the cytoplasm of macrophages (Fig. 3, O). Consistent with the results from the Western blot experiments (Fig. 2 A), no labeling with anti-PPARγ antibody was observed in monocytes (Fig. 3 B). However, in differentiating cells, immunoreactive staining was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 3, L and P), indicating that PPARγ is predominantly nuclear localized in macrophages. As a control for the monocyte-macrophage maturation process, monocytes and lymphocytes were identified using specific marker antibodies for macrophages (CD68) or lymphocytes (CD3). Along the differentiation process, cells became progressively reactive for the CD68 antibody and after 12 days of culture all adherent cells were CD68 positive (Fig. 3,D, H, N, and R). In contrast, whereas at day 0 a number of cells stained positive for CD3, this staining decreased progressively throughout differentiation disappearing completely at day 12, thus indicating the absence of T cells after 12 days of culture (Fig. 3, C, G, M, and Q). Since PPARs are transcription factors, it was determined whether endogenous PPARα and PPARγ are transcriptionally active in differentiated macrophages. Therefore, macrophages were transiently transfected with the PPRE-driven J3TKpGL3 luciferase reporter vector and cells were subsequently treated with PPARα- and PPARγ-specific ligands. Treatment with the PPARα ligand Wy14,643 at a concentration (10 μm) selectively activating PPARα, but not PPARγ, as measured by a co-transfection transactivation assay (data not shown), resulted in a 2-fold induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 4). Treatment with either BRL49653 or PG-J2 resulted in a stronger induction of luciferase activity which was dose-dependent (Fig. 4). Interestingly, treatment of differentiated macrophages with BRL49653 or PG-J2 at concentrations within the range of theirK D for PPARγ binding consistently induced pronounced changes of cellular morphology resulting eventually in cell death. Since these effects were very marked, were reproduced in several experiments using different macrophage preparations, and occurred primarily with the PPARγ ligands BRL49653 and PG-J2 at concentrations below those classically used in transactivation and adipocyte differentiation assays (and much less with the PPARα ligand Wy14,643 at 100-fold higher concentrations), it was analyzed whether PPAR activation of macrophages induced cellular apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Therefore, the induction of apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL assay in differentiated human monocyte-derived macrophages treated with either Wy14,643, BRL49653, or PG-J2 at a concentration and time point before changes in cell morphology became microscopically apparent. Both BRL49653 and PG-J2 induced an intense nuclear staining (Fig. 5, Cand D), indicating the appearance of apoptotic cells. The number of cells staining positively after PG-J2 treatment increased in a dose-dependent fashion (data not shown), similar as the activation of PPARγ transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). In contrast, when cells were treated with Wy14,643 at concentrations specifically activating PPARα, staining was comparable to solvent background (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating absence of apoptosis induction by Wy14,643. Next, it was analyzed whether PPAR activators could promote apoptosis in the presence of TNFα, a known inducer of macrophage apoptosis. Activation of differentiated macrophages by TNFα and IFNγ resulted in a significant number of cells staining positive by TUNEL labeling (Fig. 5 E). When macrophages were simultaneously treated with TNFα/IFNγ and BRL49653 or PG-J2, nuclear labeling was observed in a high number of cells which stained much more intensely than in the presence of each compound alone (Fig. 5, G and H). Interestingly, in the presence of TNFα/IFNγ, treatment with Wy14,643 resulted also in a significant number of cells stained positive by TUNEL labeling (Fig. 5 F). Quantitative analysis of apoptosis showed that treatment with BRL49653 resulted in an approximate 2-fold induction of cellular DNA fragmentation compared with solvent, whereas Wy14,643 was without effect (Fig. 6). Activation of macrophages with TNFα/IFNγ resulted in a 2-fold induction of cellular DNA fragmentation, an effect which was enhanced in cells simultaneously treated with TNFα/IFNγ and either BRL49653 or Wy14,643 (Fig. 6).Figure 6Quantification of apoptosis induced by PPAR activators. Human differentiated macrophages were treated with Wy14,643 (10 μm), BRL49653 (50 nm), or vehicle (Me2SO) for 24 h in the presence or absence of TNFα and IFNγ (each 10 ng/ml). Induction of apoptosis was quantitated by measuring the amount of cellular DNA fragmentation as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since cells undergoing apoptosis execute the death program by activating cysteine proteases of the caspase family (36Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar), it was analyzed whether treatment of differentiated macrophages with PPAR activators resulted in the activation of caspase-3/cystein protease protein 32, a key executioner of apoptosis (37Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed the appearance of the enzymatically active 17- and 12-kDa proteolytic cleavage products of the inactive 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor in differentiated macrophages treated for 24 h with either BRL49653, PG-J2, or TNFα/IFNγ alone (Fig. 7). Interestingly, compared with each compound alone, simultaneous activation of cells with TNFα/IFNγ and BRL49653 or PG-J2 significantly increased the amount of 17- and 12-kDa cleavage products (Fig. 7). In the presence of both TNFα/IFNγ and Wy14,643 a similar but less pronounced increase was observed (Fig. 7). Altogether these data indicate that PPAR activators potentiate TNFα-induced apoptosis. Since during the preparation of this article it was shown that PPARγ activators can negatively regulate transcription from a NFκB-response element driven promoter (38Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K.

Co-transfection of p65/RelA resulted in a more than 600-fold induction of luciferase reporter activity driven by a NFκB response element (Fig. 8 A). This induction by p65/RelA was almost completely inhibited by co-transfection of PPARγ, an effect which was further enhanced in the presence of BRL49653 (Fig. 8 A). By contrast PPARγ alone did not activate the NFκB response element driven reporter vector (Fig. 8 A), whereas transcription from a PPRE driven promoter was significantly enhanced by PPARγ co-transfection (Fig. 8 B). Altogether, these data indicate that PPAR activators induce cellular death of macrophages by apoptosis, most likely by negatively interfering with the antiapoptotic NFκB signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2063024150,"It has been previously shown that besides synthesizing nitric oxide (NO), neuronal and inducible NO synthase (NOS) generates superoxide (O⨪<sub>2</sub>) under conditions ofl-arginine depletion. However, there is controversy regarding whether endothelial NOS (eNOS) can also produce O⨪<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the mechanism and control of this process are not fully understood. Therefore, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping experiments to directly measure and characterize the O⨪<sub>2</sub> generation from purified eNOS. With the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-<i>N</i>-oxide (DMPO), prominent signals of O⨪<sub>2</sub> adduct, DMPO-OOH, were detected from eNOS in the absence of added tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>), and these were quenched by superoxide dismutase. This O⨪<sub>2</sub>formation required Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and was blocked by the specific NOS inhibitor <i>N</i>-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) but not its non-inhibitory enantiomerd-NAME. A parallel process of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent NADPH oxidation was observed which was also inhibited by l-NAME but notd-NAME. Pretreatment of the enzyme with the heme blockers cyanide or imidazole also prevented O⨪<sub>2</sub> generation. BH<sub>4</sub> exerted dose-dependent inhibition of the O⨪<sub>2</sub> signals generated by eNOS. Conversely, in the absence of BH<sub>4</sub>l-arginine did not decrease this O⨪<sub>2</sub> generation. Thus, eNOS can also catalyze O⨪<sub>2</sub>formation, and this appears to occur primarily at the heme center of its oxygenase domain. O⨪<sub>2</sub> synthesis from eNOS requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and is primarily regulated by BH<sub>4</sub> rather than l-arginine."

Here we characterize endogenous activin and BMP7 signaling pathways in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. We show that BMP7 and activin bind to the same type II receptors, ActRII and IIB, but recruit distinct type I receptors into heteromeric receptor complexes. The major BMP7 type I receptor observed was ALK2, while activin bound exclusively to ALK4 (ActRIB). BMP7 and activin elicited distinct biological responses and activated different Smad pathways. BMP7 stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 and 5, formation of complexes with Smad4 and induced the promoter for the homeobox gene,Tlx2. In contrast, activin induced phosphorylation of Smad2, association with Smad4, and induction of the activin response element from the Xenopus Mix.2gene. Biochemical analysis revealed that constitutively active ALK2 associated with and phosphorylated Smad1 on the COOH-terminal SSXS motif, and also regulated Smad5 and Smad8 phosphorylation. Activated ALK2 also induced the Tlx2promoter in the absence of BMP7. Furthermore, we show that ALK1 (TSRI), an orphan receptor that is closely related to ALK2 also mediates Smad1 signaling.

Recent studies have advanced significantly our understanding of how TGFβ1 superfamily members mediate their biological effects. The discovery of TGFβ receptors and Smad proteins along with recent insights into the mechanism of their activation have allowed us to trace a TGFβ signal transduction pathway from the cell membrane to the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 1Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 228: 235-272Google Scholar and 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). TGFβ family members initiate signaling at the cell surface by binding and bringing together two different but related serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. First, the ligand binds to the type II receptor, which recruits and transphosphorylates the type I receptor on the GS domain, a region in the juxtamembrane domain that is rich in serine and glycine residues (3Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). A mutation in the GS domain can lead to constitutive activation of the receptor (4Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and such an activated receptor mimics the effects of the entire receptor-ligand complex in the absence of growth factor and the type II receptor. Thus, the type I receptor is considered the primary transducer of signals to downstream components of the pathway. So far, seven type I receptors or activin receptor-like kinases (ALK1–7) have been identified in vertebrates (reviewed in Refs. 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Once the type I receptor is activated, it associates with specific receptor-regulated Smad proteins and phosphorylates them on the last two serine residues on the carboxyl-terminal domain (6Macı́as-Silva M.

Once receptor-regulated Smad proteins are phosphorylated they can associate with a common partner, Smad4, and translocate to the nucleus. Once there, they may associate with specific DNA-binding proteins in order to generate transcriptional complexes, which subsequently will activate specific target genes. For instance, TGFβ and activin regulate the Xenopus genesMix.2 (13Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), XFKH1 (19Howell M. Hill C.

Biochemical and biological studies have established at least two distinct TGFβ family pathways: one shared by TGFβ and activin and the other by the BMP2 and 4 subfamily. Characterization of these pathways has shown that a given ligand can induce the formation of heteromeric complexes between different receptors and that a given receptor can recognize different ligands and substrates, suggesting a certain redundancy or cooperativity in signaling. Thus, TβRI (ALK5) in concert with TβRII can transduce the TGFβ responses (25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J.

Consistent with these findings, TβRI and ActRIB, which display 90% identity between their kinase domains, can signal through the same downstream components, Smad2 and 3, to generate the same set of responses (6Macı́as-Silva M.

Thus, TGFβ and activin illustrate a case of convergent signaling. A similar scenario is displayed by the BMP subfamily. In this case, BMP2/4 bind BMPRII in concert with ALK3 or ALK6 (30ten Dijke P.

The existence of a plausible third pathway shared by activin and BMP7 has been suggested, since both ligands can bind ActRII and IIB and recruit the type I receptor, ALK2. Hence, ALK2 could represent a candidate receptor that mediates common responses for these factors. ALK2, also termed ActRI, SKR1, or Tsk-7L, was initially identified as an activin type I receptor because of its ability to bind activin in concert with ActRII or IIB. However, it was not demonstrated that such ligand-receptor complexes were active and could transduce signals under physiological conditions (34Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B.

A. 1993; 90: 11242-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Later, it was reported that a specific antisera to ALK2 receptor could immunoprecipitate both a BMP7, as well as an activin-receptor complex. This suggested that ALK2 might indeed mediate common responses for activin and BMP7 (37ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and depicted another example of receptor sharing and convergent signaling. However, the recent studies in early Xenopus embryos using a constitutively active form of the ALK2 receptor has shown that ALK2 generates signals similar to BMPs and that it cannot mimic activin signals in the early embryo (23Suzuki A. Ueno N. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1997; 124: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chen Y. Bhushan A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In order to characterize ALK2 function we investigated the signaling pathway regulated by this receptor. In the present study, we show that BMP7 and activin stimulate different pathways in the BMP and activin responsive cell line, P19. Although, both factors bind ActRII and IIB, BMP7 specifically binds endogenous ALK2 whereas activin binds ALK4. Stimulation of P19 cells with BMP7 leads to phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 and Smad5 and association with endogenous Smad4 as well as to induction of the promoter of the homeobox gene,Tlx2. In the same cells, activin signals through endogenous Smad2 and Smad4 leading to induction of a specific activin target gene. Thus, the ALK2 receptor appears to signal through Smad1 and 5 since an activated form of ALK2 mimics BMP7 but not activin signals in P19 cells. Moreover, activated ALK2 also induces the phosphorylation of Smad1, 5, and 8, and the association of Smad1 with Smad4 in transfected COS-1 cells. Therefore, we provide evidence that ALK2 functions as a BMP type I receptor and is likely to transduce BMP7 but not activin signals. In addition, we show that the orphan type I receptor ALK1 (TSRI) which is most closely related to the ALK2 receptor (34Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For 35S-metabolic labeling, cells were washed and then preincubated with methionine-free medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2 h at 37 °C as described previously (45Wrana J.L. Tran H. Attisano L. Arora K. Childs S.R. Massague J. O'Connor M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. P19 cells or transiently transfected COS-1 cells were affinity labeled using [125I]BMP7, [125I]BMP2, or [125I]activin in media containing 0.2% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 30 min and the receptors were cross-linked to the ligand as described previously (46Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol as described previously (45Wrana J.L. Tran H. Attisano L. Arora K. Childs S.R. Massague J. O'Connor M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In order to study specific ligand/receptor binding, lysates were immunoprecipitated using specific type I and II receptors polyclonal antisera. For determining Smad-receptor complex interactions, lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody as described previously (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS-1 cell lysates as described above except that immunoprecipitates were washed three times with TNTE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) followed by two washes in kinase buffer. Receptor complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in kinase buffer containing His/MH2 domain of Smad1 protein which was expressed in bacteria. Briefly, the His/MH2 domain of Smad1 was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial cultures. The protein was collected on Ni-NTA agarose beads, washed with TNT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Triton) containing 40 mm imidazole, and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted fusion protein was dialyzed overnight, concentrated, and 2 μg used as a substrate in the kinase assay as described previously (6Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To investigate BMP7 signaling we used P19 cells which respond to both BMPs and activin. To characterize the profile of BMP7 receptors, P19 cells were affinity labeled using [125I]BMP7 and receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies directed against various type I and type II receptors. BMP7 receptor complexes were detected on P19 cells and these were found to be composed of the previously characterized type II receptors, ActRII and ActRIIB, together with the type I receptor, ALK2. No cross-linking of BMP7 to ALK4 was detected, consistent with previous conclusions that ALK4 is an activin-specific type I receptor (26Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Since previous studies indicated that ALK2 may bind activin under some conditions (34Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), we also explored the profile of activin receptors expressed on these cells. Affinity labeling with 125I-activin, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to ALK4 or ALK2 revealed the presence of complexes of either ActRII or ActRIIB together with ALK4. However, no interaction of activin with ALK2 was detected, suggesting that in P19 cells ALK2 functions predominantly as a BMP7 receptor (Fig. 1 A). We also examined the profile of BMP2 receptors on these cells. BMP2 bound efficiently to both ALK3 and ALK6, as described previously for these receptors (37ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5961-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and formed heteromeric complexes with both ActRII and ActRIIB. Although earlier studies suggest that ActRII and IIB receptors do not bind BMP2 (48Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), subsequent work with theDrosophila activin-like type II receptor, Punt, showed that it functions as a BMP2 receptor when coexpressed with the appropriate type I receptor (49Letsou A. Arora K. Wrana J. Simin K. Twombly V. Jamal J. Staehling-Hampton K. Hoffmann F.M. Gelbart W.M. Massagué J. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1995; 80: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies are consistent with these findings and demonstrate that like PUNT, ActRII and IIB can bind BMP2 and function as type II receptors in the presence of the appropriate type I receptors (Fig. 1 B). To investigate BMP7 responses in P19 cells, we examined regulation of Tlx2, a homeobox gene of the HOX11 class. Previously, we showed thatTlx2 functions during gastrulation in the mouse and is strongly induced by BMP2 (24Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1888PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Tlx2 gene showed that it contained a BMP-responsive promoter that was induced by BMP2 in P19 cells (24Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1888PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize BMP7 signaling, pTlx2-Lux was transiently transfected into P19 cells and cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm BMP7, 10 nmBMP2, or 2 nm activin prior to analysis of reporter gene activation. Under these conditions, BMP7 induced the Tlx2promoter 7-fold, similar to the response observed for BMP2 (Fig. 2, TLX2-Lux). In contrast, activin had no detectable effect on the Tlx2 promoter, similar to previous observations (24Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1888PubMed Google Scholar). We also sought to determine whether BMP7 could induce activin-dependent signaling pathways. For this, we used the activin response element (ARE) that was initially characterized in Xenopus and mediates activin-specific induction of theMix.2 gene. In P19 cells activin treatment of cells transiently transfected with the ARE reporter, pA3-lux, resulted in a 6-fold induction of the reporter gene (Fig. 2, A3-Lux). In contrast, neither BMP7 nor BMP2 induced this promoter. Together, these results suggest that BMP7 specifically induces a BMP-like signaling pathway in P19 cells. MAD-related proteins are critical intracellular mediators of TGFβ superfamily signaling (reviewed in Refs. 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

The enzyme was detected initially on the basis of its capacity to hydrolyze artificial chitotrioside substrates and was therefore named chitotriosidase (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Chitotriosidase is synthesized by activated macrophages (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In plasma and tissues of patients suffering from Gaucher disease, chitotriosidase activity is markedly elevated because of its massive production and secretion by the lipid-laden macrophages that accumulate in these patients (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J.

McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1677-1698Google Scholar). Purification of chitotriosidase and cloning of the corresponding cDNA have revealed that the enzyme belongs to the family 18 of glycosylhydrolases and shares significant sequence identity to chitinases from various nonmammalian species (3Boot R.G.

The established antifungal action of homologous chitinases in plants and the tightly regulated expression of chitotriosidase in phagocytes suggest that chitotriosidase might fulfill a role in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens (6Collinge D.B. Kragh K.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Nielsen K.K. Rasmussen U. Vad K. Plant J. 1993; 3: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 7Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of other human members of the chitinase protein family have been identified: oviductin (human oviduct specific glycoprotein), human cartilage glycoprotein 39 (HCgp-39), and YKL39 (8Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol.

In contrast to chitotriosidase, these proteins have no known enzymatic activity, and their function is so far not precisely understood. Chitotriosidase in human tissue is heterogeneous with respect to its isoelectric point and molecular mass. The major isoform shows a molecular mass of 50 kDa and a heterogeneous pI of 5.0–7.2. The minor isoform has a mass of 39 kDa and a discrete pI of 8.1 (2Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The amino termini of both isoforms are identical and exactly as predicted by the cloned chitotriosidase cDNA that codes for a 50-kDa protein. Metabolic labeling experiments with cultured macrophages have revealed that a 50-kDa chitotriosidase is initially synthesized and subsequently undergoes posttranslational modification. First, O-linked glycosylation of the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein generates the heterogeneity in charge. Second, whereas most 50-kDa enzyme is secreted, part of it is intracellularly converted by carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing into the 39-kDa isoform that accumulates in lysosomes (11Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. Van Den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has recently been noted that the carboxyl-terminal domain of 50-kDa chitotriosidase mediates the strong binding of this enzyme to chitin, a feature that is not shown by the 39-kDa enzyme (11Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. Van Den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A recessively inherited deficiency in chitotriosidase activity is frequently encountered (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). For example, in The Netherlands about 1 in 20 individuals is completely deficient in enzymatically active chitotriosidase in all materials tested, including plasma, urine, cultured macrophages, leukocytes, and tissues (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J.

Galjaard H. Van Diggelen O.P. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because there are no indications for the presence of enzyme inhibitors in these individuals, it is most likely that some mutation in the chitotriosidase gene underlies the enzyme deficiency. To obtain further insight in the molecular basis of the chitotriosidase deficiency, we have investigated the composition of the chitotriosidase gene and the corresponding mRNA of control and enzyme-deficient individuals. The results of this study are here described and discussed. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated and cultured for a prolonged time in the presence of human AB serum during which process spontaneous differentiation into macrophages occurs (1Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). After 7–14 days of culture, cells were used in experiments. Cultured macrophages or transfected COS cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of radioactive methionine and subsequently chased in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acid. Radiolabeled chitotriosidase was specifically visualized using a rabbit anti-(chitotriosidase) antiserum exactly as described before (2Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E.

Binding of chitotriosidase to chitin was analyzed by incubation of enzyme containing samples with chitin particles (Sigma), followed by centrifugation. A macrophage cDNA library, was screened using the partial chitotriosidase cDNA probe (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol.

Total macrophage RNA was isolated using the RNAzol B RNA isolation kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Biosolve, Barneveld, The Netherlands). For Northern blot analysis, 15-μg samples of total RNA were electrophoresed in 10 mm Hepes, 6% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham, UK) by the capillary method and immobilized by UV cross-linking. The following probes were used: total chitotriosidase cDNA and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an RNA control. The probes were radiolabeled with 32P using the random priming method (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Duplicate filters were used in the screening procedure to avoid false results. The hybridization conditions were exactly as described before (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J.

The coordinates of the positive spots on the filters were determined, and the genomic clone (ICRFP700O0516) containing the chitotriosidase gene was obtained from the ICRF. The genomic clone was digested with different restriction enzymes, and the smaller fragments, containing exons, were subcloned in the plasmid vectors pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) or pUC19 (New England Biolabs Inc.). Sequence analysis on the plasmid subclones was performed as described above, using several primers specific for the chitotriosidase cDNA. The obtained genomic chitotriosidase clone of about 110 kb was biotinylated by nick translation according to the specifications of the manufacturers (Life Technologies, Inc.). High resolution chromosomes from peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained according to standard techniques. Fluorescentin situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using the biotinylated genomic clone and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin, exactly as described before (16Hoovers J.M.N. Mannens M.M.A.M. John R. Bliek J. van Heyningen V. Porteous D.J. Leschot N.J. Westerveld A. Little P.F.R. Genomics. 1992; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For chromosome identification and probe localization, metaphases were simultaneously Q-banded using DAPI1/actinomycin D, as described (17Wiegant J. Galjart N.J. Raap A.K. D'Azzo A. Genomics. 1991; 10: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To generate the desired RNase protection probe, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment of chitotriosidase (216 bp), was ligated into the EcoRV site of pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega). To determine the orientation and to exclude the existence of PCR artifacts, this construct was sequenced. The plasmid was then linearized with NdeI and size fractionated on an agarose gel, and the appropriate fragment was isolated. The protection riboprobe (298 nucleotides) was generated using this DNA template, T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene), and [32P]UTP. After in vitro transcription, the RNA was purified by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, TBE (0.09 m Tris borate, 0.002 m EDTA, pH 8.0) gel, and the appropriate band was isolated (13Sambrook J.

For RNase protection, 5 μg of total macrophage RNA was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 105 cpm of labeled probe in 20 μl of 80% formamide, 400 mm NaCl, 40 mmPIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA. Following hybridization, single-stranded RNA was digested in 350 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml RNase T1 (1300 units/μg, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 60 min at 37 °C. Next, RNA was purified by Proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Finally, RNA was visualized by autoradiography after electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, TBE gel (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Sequence analysis of cDNA clones, genomic clone and subclones, was performed using Mac Vector 4.1.1 and the Genetics Computing Group package (version 7.0). Sequence comparisons and multiple sequence alignments were performed using the sequence alignment programs PILEUP, BESTFIT, and GAP. Transient transfection of COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method was performed essentially as described in Ref. 19Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B.

This antiserum is able to inhibit human chitotriosidase in enzymatic activity (2Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Muijsers A.O. Donker-Koopman W.E. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2198-2202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Immunotitrations were carried out as follows. Enzyme-containing samples were preincubated for 30 min with different amounts of antiserum, and subsequently enzyme activity was determined in the samples. For these experiments, medium from transfected COS cells was collected and cells were harvested by trypsinization. Cells were homogenized by sonication in 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant collected. As a control enzyme preparation, an extract of Gaucher spleen was prepared by addition of 5 volumes of H2O and homogenization with an Ultraturrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was collected. From harvested macrophages, total RNA was isolated and single-stranded cDNA was prepared from the total macrophage RNA using reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) as described before (3Boot R.G.

To obtain the complete open reading frame of chitotriosidase, PCR was carried out using the single-stranded cDNA as template as described before (3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H.

The primers used are: Chs1, 5′-CTGCATCATGGTGCGGTC-3′; and Chas1, 5′-GAAGGCAAGGCTGAGAGC-3′ (see Fig. 3 B). The PCR products were subsequently cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products was performed exactly as described above. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes, and 300 ng of this genomic DNA was used as template in subsequent PCR reactions. The following primers were employed: Chs8, 5′-TACATCTTCCGGGACAAC-3′; and Chas9, 5′-TCAGTTCCTGCCGTAGCGTC-3′. PCR fragments were cloned in the pGEM-T vector and sequenced as described above. Using specific primers (Chs9, 5′-AGCTATCTGAAGCAGAAG-3′; and Chas8, 5′-GGAGAAGCCGGCAAAGTC-3′, see Fig. 4) fragments of 75 and 99 bp are amplified from the normal and mutant chitotriosidase gene, respectively, when present in genomic DNA. Electrophoresis in a native 10% acrylamide gel allows the detection of both fragments. In the case of carriers for the duplication, a mixture of both fragments is detected. A genomic clone containing the chitotriosidase gene was isolated (clone ICRFP700O0516 of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Reference Library (15Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel J. Larin Z. Lennon G. Monaco A.P. Nizetic D. Zehetner G. Poustka A. Genome Analysis Volume 1: Genetic and Physical Mapping. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 39-81Google Scholar)), as described under “Materials and Methods.” To allow sequence analysis, the genomic clone of about 110 kb was subcloned into smaller fragments using HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes. The exon/intron composition of the chitotriosidase gene was determined by sequencing of genomic plasmid subclones and comparison of the information with the sequence of the chitotriosidase cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1, the gene was found to be composed of 12 exons and spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 was defined as containing the first nucleotide of the longest chitotriosidase cDNA; the exact transcription start site has not been accurately mapped. The sizes of the exons range from 30 to 461 bp. The sizes of the smaller introns were determined by sequencing, and those of the larger ones were estimated by electrophoresis of fragments generated either by PCR or restriction enzyme digestion (Table I). In all cases, the sequences of the intron/exon borders are compatible with consensus splice site sequences (20Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev.

This exon is usually skipped in the splicing process, generating the predominant mRNA species encoding the 50-kDa protein. In macrophages also, a distinct mRNA is rarely formed as the result of a lack of exon 11 skipping. Since exon 11 introduces a premature stop codon, the alternatively spliced mRNA encodes a 40-kDa chitotriosidase that is almost identical to the 39-kDa isoform generated by proteolytic processing of the 50-kDa chitotriosidase (11Renkema G.H. Boot R.G. Strijland A. Donker-Koopman W.E. Van Den Berg M. Muijsers A.O. Aerts J.M.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fluorescent in situ hybridization with the genomic clone as probe was used to assign the chromosomal locus for the chitotriosidase gene, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 shows that the chitotriosidase gene is located on chromosome 1q31–1q32. Cultured macrophages of enzyme-deficient individuals do not produce enzymatically active chitotriosidase. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that only minor amounts of a short-lived 47-kDa chitotriosidase are synthesized (not shown). Northern blot analysis revealed that these macrophages do contain some chitotriosidase RNA although in markedly reduced amounts (Fig. 3 A). From macrophage RNA of two control subjects and two unrelated chitotriosidase-deficient individuals, chitotriosidase cDNAs containing the complete open reading frame were generated using reverse transcription-PCR. Sequencing showed that these cDNAs were completely identical with the exception of a deletion of 87 nucleotides in exon 10 of the mutant RNA (Fig. 3 B). The abnormal mRNA codes for a protein that lacks amino acids 344–372, a highly conserved region in members of the chitinase protein family (Fig. 3 B, and Ref. 3Boot R.G. Renkema G.H.

Transfection of COS-1 cells with wild-type chitotriosidase cDNA resulted in secretion of enzymatically active 50-kDa chitotriosidase, whereas parallel transfection with mutant cDNA led to modest synthesis of a 47-kDa protein that was largely intracellularly degraded, as was seen for cultured macrophages. The recombinant protein that could be isolated showed no capacity to degrade chitin or artificial substrates. It was, however, still able to bind to chitin particles. To establish the precise molecular defect, genomic DNA of control subjects and chitotriosidase-deficient individuals was studied. Relevant parts of the mutant gene were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers (Fig. 4 A, and under “Material and Methods”). Sequence analysis revealed that in exon 10 of the mutant gene a 24-nucleotide duplication is present (Fig. 4 A). Apparently, this duplication leads to the selection of a cryptic 3′ splice site downstream in the exon, although the authentic splice site is still intact in the mutant chitotriosidase gene. Consistent with the findings made for macrophages of control subjects and chitotriosidase-deficient individuals (shown in Fig. 3 A), RNase protection assays revealed that macrophages of heterozygotes contain only a very small amount of mutant mRNA as compared with wild-type mRNA. These reduced levels of steady state chitotriosidase mRNA could be due to two different reasons: (i) reduced transcription of the mutant gene, and/or (ii) production of mRNA that is unstable relative to wild-type chitotriosidase mRNA. Attempts to determine half-life of mRNA following actinomycin-D treatment were so far unsuccessful because of its apparent lability. The presence of the 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene can be detected by PCR of genomic DNA with specific primers (Fig. 4 B, and “Material and Methods”). Fragments of 75 and 99 bp are amplified from the normal and mutant gene, respectively. All chitotriosidase-deficient individuals examined so far (n = 26) were homozygous for the 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene. Table II shows the results of the analysis of chitotriosidase genotype of Ashkenazi Jewish and Dutch individuals. It can be seen that the incidence of homozygotes and heterozygotes for the duplication was about 6 and 35%, respectively, in both populations. The same mutation has presently been detected in individuals with European (including Dutch) (n = 326), Jewish (n = 68), African (n = 10), and Asian (n = 20) ancestry. A study on Indonesian individuals has indicated that the incidence of enzyme deficiency is also about 6% in this ethnic group. Genotyping of Indonesian subjects showed that again about one in every three individuals is a carrier for 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene.Table IIChitotriosidase genotype distributionPopulationGenotypeWild-typeHeterozygote mutantHomozygote mutant%Dutch (n = 171)58.535.16.4Ashkenazi Jewish (n = 68)60.333.85.9The chitotriosidase genotype of unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and Dutch subjects was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The chitotriosidase genotype of unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish and Dutch subjects was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Our investigation of the features of the chitotriosidase gene and its RNA has been informative in a number of respects. First, the established exon composition of the chitotriosidase gene points out the striking similarity of the organization of this gene with that of other human genes coding for members of the chitinase protein family. The exon/intron boundaries in the genes of the human oviduct glycoproteins YKL-39 and of HCgp-39 are very similarly located (Refs.8Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Hu B. Trinh K. Figueira W.F. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19415-19420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, and 21Rehli M. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Genomics. 1997; 43: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, and GenBank accession numbers U58001–U58010, U58514,U58515, and U49835). This suggests that these genes have evolved by duplication events. The locus of the chitotriosidase gene was assigned to 1q31–32 using fluorescent in situ hybridization with the genomic clone as probe. During the preparation of the manuscript, Eiberg and Den Tandt (22Eiberg H. Den Tandt W.R. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) independently mapped the gene to 1q31-qter by linkage analysis. The genes of all the human members of the chitinase protein family known so far are located on chromosome 1. According to the data deposited in Human Gene Map of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the genes of YKL-39 and the human oviduct specific glycoprotein are located on 1p13 and that of HCgp-39, like the chitotriosidase gene, is on 1q31–1q32. The nature of the common deficiency in chitotriosidase activity was elucidated in this study. The defect was found to be a 24-bp duplication that activates a cryptic 3′ splice site in the same exon, causing the formation of mRNA with an in-frame internal deletion of 87 nucleotides. Similar mutations affecting splice site selection have been reported earlier for two lysosomal hydrolases, the β-subunit of β-hexosaminidase and arylsulfatase A, and for episialin (23Wakamatsu N. Kobayashi H. Miyatake T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2406-2413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hasegawa Y. Kawame H. Ida H. Ohashi T. Eto Y. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Lightenberg J.L. Gennissen A.M.C. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the incidence of deficiency of chitotriosidase activity in The Netherlands and among Ashkenazim of about 6%, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium predicts that 37% of the population will be carriers of a mutant chitotriosidase gene. This prediction corresponds very well with the observed frequency of carriers of the 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene. This and the finding that all chitotriosidase-deficient individuals so far are homozygous for the duplication indicate that this mutation must be the predominant cause of chitotriosidase deficiency. The multi-ethnic occurrence and prevalence of the 24-bp duplication in the chitotriosidase gene suggests that it probably originated before the radiation of tribal populations that have formed the present ethnic groups. Cultured macrophages of chitotriosidase-deficient individuals contain very little mRNA and secrete almost no chitotriosidase protein. We have not been able to detect the mutant protein in plasma of chitotriosidase-deficient individuals, including Gaucher patients. Analysis of recombinant-produced mutant chitotriosidase indicated that the protein is enzymatically inactive. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack amino acids 344–372. For several homologous chitinases, the three-dimensional structure has been resolved by crystallographic analysis (26Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Kalk K.H. Beintema J.J. Dijkstra B.W.

Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1169-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The catalytic core structure of these hydrolases is thought to be an 8-stranded α/β (TIM) barrel (26Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Kalk K.H. Beintema J.J. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Perrakis A. Tews I. Dauter Z. Oppenheim A.B. Chet I. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E.

On the basis of its homology with these chitinases, it can be predicted that the internal deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase will prevent the formation of a proper TIM-barrel conformation. In view of this, it is not surprising that the recombinant produced mutant protein shows no chitinolytic activity. On the basis of all our findings, it seems extremely unlikely that the mutant chitotriosidase allele renders a functional protein. Given the high incidence of chitotriosidase deficiency, it could be argued that the enzyme is redundant in man. However, it is unattractive to assume that the enzyme does no longer fulfill any function. The role of the homologous chitinases in plants in defense against fungal pathogens has been demonstrated convincingly (6Collinge D.B. Kragh K.M. Mikkelsen J.D. Nielsen K.K. Rasmussen U. Vad K.

The structural features of chitinases have been extremely well conserved in chitotriosidase. Furthermore, the expression of the enzyme in phagocytes is regulated in a remarkable manner. It seems therefore likely that chitotriosidase still fulfills a role, but that a deficiency can be somehow compensated. A comparison with the closely related lysozyme is of interest. The bactericidal function of this hydrolase is well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for susceptibility to infections (35Camara V.M. Harding J.W. Prieur D.J. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 544-550PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse array of defense mechanisms of the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase. In this connection, it will be of interest to determine whether the chitotriosidase genotype of immunocompressed individuals is predictive for their risk on infections with fungal pathogens. It is intriguing to understand why the mutation in the chitotriosidase gene occurs with such high incidence in different ethnic groups. This could point to some selective advantage for carriers, but at present there are no clues for the nature of such a selective factor. In this connection, it will be essential to obtain detailed insight in the physiological role(s) of chitotriosidase and the mechanism(s) that can compensate for its absence.

https://openalex.org/W1971999946,"Membrane physiology, plasma lipid levels, and intracellular sterol homeostasis are regulated by both fatty acids and cholesterol. Sterols regulate gene expression of key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism through proteolysis of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), which binds to sterol regulatory elements (SRE) contained in promoters of these genes. We investigated the effect of fatty acids on SRE-dependent gene expression and SREBP. Consistent results were obtained in three different cell lines (HepG2, Chinese hamster ovary, and CV-1) transfected with SRE-containing promoters linked to the luciferase expression vector. We show that micromolar concentrations of oleate and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2-C22:6) dose-dependently (0.075-0.6 mmol) decreased transcription of SRE-regulated genes by 20-75%. Few or no effects were seen with saturated free fatty acids. Fatty acid effects on SRE-dependent gene expression were independent and additive to those of exogenous sterols. Oleate decreased levels of the mature sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP-1 and -2 and HMG-CoA synthase mRNA. Oleate had no effect in sterol regulation defective Chinese hamster ovary cells or in cells transfected with mutant SRE-containing promoters. We hypothesize that unsaturated fatty acids increase intracellular regulatory pools of cholesterol and thus affect mature SREBP levels and expression of SRE-dependent genes."

Fibrates are a class of drugs used in the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia (1Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1997; 3: 1-14Google Scholar). Fibrates are ligands for transcription factors belonging to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)1 subfamily of nuclear receptors (2Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 3Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After ligand activation and heterodimerization to the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor RXR, PPARs bind to specific response elements, termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs), in the regulatory regions of target genes. PPREs consist of a direct repeat of the degenerated hexamer AGGTCA sequence separated by 1 nucleotide (DR-1). Fibrates exert their effects on plasma lipids by altering the transcription of genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism (1Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1997; 3: 1-14Google Scholar). Direct evidence that fibrate action on lipoprotein metabolism is mediated by PPARα, the principal PPAR form in liver, came from studies in mice rendered deficient for PPARα by homologous recombination (4Peters J.M.

Whereas both in man and rodents fibrates efficiently decrease plasma triglycerides, their effects on HDL occur in an opposite manner in these species. Whereas in man plasma HDL cholesterol consistently increases upon fibrate treatment (9Tikkanen M.J. Curr. Opin.

Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that these species differences in HDL response to fibrates are associated with opposite changes of apoA-I expression, the major HDL apolipoprotein. In rats, fibrate treatment lowers hepatic, but not intestinal, apoA-I mRNA levels, due to a decreased transcription rate of the apoA-I gene in liver (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the transcription rate of the human apoA-I gene is induced by PPARα, which interacts with a positive PPRE located in the A site of the human apoA-I gene promoter liver-specific enhancer (7Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, fibrates enhance apoA-I expression and production both in vivo in man and in vitro in human hepatoma cells (11Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Jin F.-Y. Kamanna V.S. Chuang M.-Y. Morgan K. Kashyap M.L. Arterioscler. Throm. Vasc.

The observation that fibrates regulate human and mouse apoA-I gene transcription in an opposite manner in livers of transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoA-I gene driven by its homologous promoter including the PPRE sequence (15Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) suggested that the species-specific differences in fibrate response are due tocis-element sequence differences between the rodent and human apoA-I genes. However, the exact molecular mechanisms implicated have not been determined yet. In addition, although the mechanisms of positive regulation of gene expression by fibrates via PPAR interacting with positive PPRE sequences are well understood (for review, see Schoonjans et al. (16Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar)), little is known on the mechanisms of negative gene regulation by fibrates and PPARs. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms behind the differential regulation of rat versus human apoA-I gene expression by fibrates. Our results demonstrate that this opposite regulation is due to sequence differences of two distinct enhancer regions in the rat and human apoA-I genes. On the one hand, the human apoA-I gene promoter A site contains a positive PPRE to which PPARα binds. The lack of induction of apoA-I gene transcription by fibrates in rats is due to 3 nucleotide differences between the rat and the human apoA-I gene promoter A sites, resulting in the transformation of the positive PPRE in the human apoA-I promoter in a nonfunctional site in rats. On the other hand, rat, but not human, apoA-I gene transcription is repressed via an element overlapping the TATA box to which the nuclear orphan receptor Rev-erbα binds. Furthermore, fibrates induce Rev-erbα and repress apoA-I gene expression only in rat liver, but not in intestine. Interestingly, the rat apoA-I promoter Rev-erbα response element (RevRE) is not conserved in the human apoA-I gene promoter. Fenofibric acid and fenofibrate, and ciprofibrate were kind gifts of Dr. Alan Edgar (Laboratoires Fournier, Daix, France) and Dr. Herbert (Sanofi, Toulouse, France) respectively. Bezafibrate and hematoxylin were from Sigma. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old) were treated for 14 days with the specified fibrates at the indicated concentrations (w/w) mixed in chow. At the end of the treatment period all animals were fasted overnight, weighed, and sacrificed by exsanguination under ether anesthesia between 9 and 11 a.m. Livers were frozen in liquid N2 or stored in phosphate-buffered saline until RNA or in situ hybridization analysis. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells (E.C.A.C.C., Porton Down, Salisbury, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Medium was changed every other day. Human and rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and cultured as described previously (17Li A.P. Roque M.A. Beck D.J. Kaminski D.L. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1992; 14: 139-146Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At the end of the treatment period with fenofibric acid (in Me2SO), cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, and used for RNA analysis. RNA preparation, Northern blot hybridizations, and quantifications were performed as described previously (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat apoA-I (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), and human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 cDNAs (20Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch J. Gannon F. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) were used as probes. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning of the rat apoA-I promoter into the pBLCAT5 promoterless expression vector was described previously (21Saladin R. Vu-Dac N. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the apoA-I RevRE was accomplished using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAC ACA TAT ATA GGC AGG GAA GAA GA-3′ as a mutagenic primer on single-stranded DNA templates according to Kunkel (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The rat wild-type (5′-GAT CCA CAC ATA TAT AGG TCA GGG AAG AAG A-3′) and mutant apoA-I RevRE (5′-GAT CCA CAC ATA TAT AGG CAG GGA AGA AGA-3′) and the rat (5′-GAT CCA CTG AAC CCT TGA TCC CAG CTC TG-3′) and human wild type (5′-GAT CCA CTG AAC CCT TGA CCC CTG CCC TA-3′) and mutant (5′-GAT CCA CTG ATC CCT TGT CCC CTG CCC TA-3′) apoA-I A-site oligonucleotides were cloned into the BamHI/BglII sites of pIC20H (23Marsch J.L. Erfle M. Wykes E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), digested with HindIII, and subcloned upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter of pBLCAT4 (24Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) to generate, respectively, rAI-TATAwt-TKCAT, rAI-TATAmt-TKCAT, rAIAwt-TKCAT, hAIAwt-TKCAT, and hAIAmt-TKCAT. Identity of all clones was verified by sequence analysis. Transfections in HepG2 cells were performed at 50–60% confluency by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure with a mixture of plasmids that contained in addition to the reporter (1–5 μg/60 mm culture dish) and expression vector(s) (100–1000 ng), 0.35 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase expression vector as a control for transfection efficiency. All samples were complemented to an equal total amount of DNA. After 4 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for another 16 h with the indicated stimuli in fresh medium containing 5% calf serum delipoproteinized by ultracentrifugation in KBr (1.21 g/ml) and subsequently treated with AG-1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) plus activated charcoal. Stimuli were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and periods of time. Control cells received vehicle only. CAT activity was determined on cell extracts as described by Gorman et al. (25Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantified by liquid scintillation counting and results were normalized for transfection efficiency. Transfection experiments were performed at least three times. hPPARα, mRXRα, and hReverbα proteins were synthesized in vitrousing the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). EMSAs with Rev-erbα, PPAR and/or RXR were performed as described previously (7Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Vanacker J.M. Laudet V. Adelmant G. Stéhelin D. Rommelaere J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, increasing amounts of the indicated cold oligonucleotides were included just before adding labeled oligonucleotide. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. To study whether the species differences in response to fibrates are due to a distinct regulation of apoA-I expression in liver, the effects of fenofibric acid, the active form of fenofibrate, on apoA-I gene expression were compared between primary cultures of human versus rat hepatocytes. Addition of fenofibric acid to primary human hepatocytes, at a concentration (100 μm) within the range of plasma concentrations attained in fenofibrate-treated patients, resulted in a >2-fold increase of apoA-I mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, in rat hepatocytes fenofibric acid decreased apoA-I mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). As a control, mRNA levels of the ribosomal protein 36B4 did not change upon treatment of either human or rat hepatocytes with fenofibric acid (Fig. 1). These data indicate that the species-distinct regulation of the apoA-I gene is due to a direct effect of fenofibrate on the hepatocyte. Since previously a positive PPRE has been identified in the human apoA-I promoter A site (7Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether the lack of induction of apoA-I gene expression by fibrates in rats could be due to the absence of a functional PPRE in the rat apoA-I promoter. Interestingly, when the human and rat apoA-I A sites, which are composed of 3 degenerated hexameric half-sites separated by 2 and 1 nucleotides, respectively (DR-2 and DR-1), were aligned, 3 nucleotide differences were observed (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether these nucleotide differences conferred a different PPAR binding potential to the rat and human apoA-I A sites, EMSA experiments were performed. Incubation of radiolabeled human A site oligonucleotide within vitro produced PPAR protein, in the presence of its heterodimeric partner RXR, resulted in the formation of a retarded complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). This complex was specific since it could be competed out by adding excess unlabeled human A site oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, B, lane 4, and C, lanes 7–10). In contrast, unlabeled rat A site oligonucleotide did not compete for binding to the human A site (Fig. 2, B, lane 5, and C, lanes 11–14). Next, the human and rat A sites were cloned in front of a heterologous promoter, and transient co-transfection experiments were performed in HepG2 cells. PPAR co-transfection resulted in a significant increase of human A site driven CAT activity (Fig. 3). Due to the high basal activity of PPAR in HepG2 cells, possibly due to the activation by endogenous PPAR ligands, no further activation was observed in the presence of fenofibric acid (Fig. 3). However, activation by fibrates was observed when the same experiments were performed in other cells, such as in HeLa or CV-1 cells (not shown). In contrast, rat apoA-I A site-driven CAT activity was not increased by PPAR, fenofibric acid, or both together (Fig. 3). These data clearly indicate that only the human, but not the rat, apoA-I A site functions as a PPRE. In a previous report, the nuclear receptor RORα1 was identified as a positive regulator of apoA-I expression in the intestine (28Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Grötzinger T. De Vos P. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22401-22404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nuclear receptors of the ROR and Rev-erb groups regulate transcription through identical response elements, leading to cross-talk between the positive ROR and the negative Rev-erb nuclear receptors (29Retnakaran R. Flock G. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Dussault I. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tested whether Rev-erbα, which is expressed in liver (18Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1128-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 33Miyajima N. Horiuchi R. Shibuya Y. Fukushige S.-i. Matsubara K.-i. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Cell. 1989; 57: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), could act as a repressor of rat apoA-I transcription. Co-transfection of CAT reporter constructs driven by the rat apoA-I promoter with a Rev-erbα expression vector resulted in dose-dependent repression of CAT activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4,A and B). Interestingly, human apoA-I promoter activity was not repressed by Rev-erbα co-transfection (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that the rat, but not the human, apoA-I gene is a Rev-erbα target gene. To determine whether this repression of apoA-I promoter activity is mediated by the previously identified response element for RORα1 (28Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Grötzinger T. De Vos P. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22401-22404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) located adjacent to the TATA box, the activity of Rev-erbα was analyzed on an apoA-I promoter construct carrying a mutation in the RORα1 response element (see Fig. 6 A). Whereas wild-type apoA-I promoter activity was significantly repressed in a dose-dependent manner, Rev-erbα failed to repress the activity of the mutated construct (Fig. 4 C), thereby indicating that the Rev-erbα and RORα response elements coincide. Since Rev-erbα may repress transcription either actively, by recruiting nuclear co-repressors of the N-CoR family (34Zamir I. Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Hörlein A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Downes M. Burke L.J. Bailey P.J. Muscat G.E.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4379-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or passively, by competing for binding with other, positive factors, such as the proteins binding to the TATA box, the activity of a C terminus-truncated Rev-erbα236, which can still bind to DNA, but does not actively repress transcription (36Adelmant G. Bègue A. Stéhelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), was tested on rat apoA-I promoter transcription. In contrast to wild-type Rev-erbα, which repressed transcription already at low concentrations, Rev-erbα236 started to repress apoA-I transcription only at higher amounts of expression vector (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether Rev-erbα could repress transcription from a heterologous promoter, the rat apoA-I TATA site (AI-TATA) was cloned in front of the TK promoter, and transient transfection assays were performed. Compared with the empty expression vector, co-transfection of Rev-erbα resulted in a significant decrease of wild-type rat AI-TATA driven CAT activity (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, neither mutated AI-TATA nor TK promoter alone driven CAT activity were repressed by Rev-erbα co-transfection (Fig. 5 B). Altogether, these observations suggest that the repression of rat apoA-I transcription by Rev-erbα is likely due to a combination of active and passive transcriptional repression mechanisms. EMSAs were performed to determine whether Rev-erbα could bind to the rat AI-TATA site. Incubation of labeled rat wild-type AI-TATA oligonucleotide with Rev-erbα resulted in the formation of a retarded complex (Fig. 6, Aand B, lane 2). The binding was specific since it could be competed out by excess amounts of either unlabeled consensus monomeric RevRE (30Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3113-3121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or rAI-TATAwt oligonucleotides (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3–6). In contrast, neither rAI-TATAmt nor human AI-TATA oligonucleotides could compete for binding of Rev-erbα to rAI-TATAwt (Fig. 6,lanes 7–10). Similar results were obtained using the consensus RevRE oligonucleotide as a probe (Fig. 6 C). Similar as cold RevRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 C, lanes 12–14), cold rAI-TATAwt oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 C, lanes 15–17) competed efficiently for binding of Rev-erbα to RevRE, whereas the human hAI-TATAwt (Fig. 6 C, lanes 18–20) oligonucleotide failed to compete. Altogether, these data indicate that whereas the rat apoA-I promoter contains a functional Rev-erbα response element, the human AI-TATA site does not bind Rev-erbα. To determine whether the negative regulation of rat apoA-I gene expression by fibrates is mediated via Rev-erbα, adult rats were treated for 14 days with different doses of fenofibrate, and Rev-erbα mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis in livers and intestines, the major sites of apoA-I production. Administration of fenofibrate resulted in a pronounced induction of Rev-erbα gene expression (Fig. 7 A). This induction of Rev-erbα mRNA was dose-dependent, being evident at a dose level of 0.05% (w/w) of fenofibrate and further enhanced at 0.5%. Interestingly, the induction of Rev-erbα mRNA levels was inversely proportional to the decrease of apoA-I mRNA levels in liver (Fig. 7 A). In contrast to liver, intestinal Rev-erbα mRNA levels did not change significantly after fenofibrate treatment (control, 100 ± 19%; fenofibrate 0.005%, 90 ± 3%; fenofibrate 0.05%, 110 ± 10%; fenofibrate 0.5%, 144 ± 5%), which correlates well with the absence of effects of fibrates on intestinal apoA-I mRNA levels (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the induction of liver Rev-erbα gene expression is a general property of fibrates, rats were treated for 14 days with different fibrates. All fibrates tested significantly increased Rev-erbα mRNA levels, which was most pronounced for ciprofibrate (>30-fold), followed by fenofibrate (>25-fold) and bezafibrate (±15-fold) (Fig. 7 B). All fibrates also repressed liver apoA-I mRNA levels (Fig. 7 B). As a control mRNA levels of apoE, whose expression has been shown not to be controlled by fibrates (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not change significantly upon fibrate treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). Interestingly, hepatic mRNA levels of the nuclear receptor HNF-4, which is a major regulator of liver apolipoprotein gene transcription and whose expression has been shown to be repressed by fibrates (5Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), did not change significantly in either experiment (Fig. 7, A and B). Finally, the induction of Rev-erbα gene expression by fibrates was also observed by in situ hybridization experiments using liver slices from rats treated with different fibrates (data not shown). Compared with controls, hybridization with an antisense Rev-erbα riboprobe resulted in an enhanced signal intensity in livers from fibrate-treated rats, which was evenly distributed throughout the liver, indicating that Rev-erbα mRNA levels increase after fibrate treatment in the apoA-I-producing parenchymal cells of the liver. Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs, which have been discovered by virtue of their cholesterol-lowering activity in rats (for review, see Staels and Auwerx (1Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1997; 3: 1-14Google Scholar)). Ironically, this cholesterol lowering is entirely due to a decrease of plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations and its major apolipoprotein, apoA-I (10Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect nowadays considered to be negative, due to the protective activities of HDL and apoA-I against atherosclerosis (38Miller N.E. Forde O.H. Thelle D.S. Lancet. 1977; 1: 965-968Abstract PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 39Rubin E.M. Krauss R.M. Spangler E.A. Verstuyft J.G. Clift S.M. Nature. 1991; 353: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In contrast, in man fibrates consistently elevate plasma HDL and apoA-I and increase the production rate of its major apolipoproteins, apoA-I and apoA-II (8Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V.

In the present study, we addressed the mechanisms of the differential response of apoA-I expression to fibrates in man and rat. Using primary human and rat hepatocytes we demonstrate that the opposite action of fenofibrate is due to a direct effect on the hepatocyte. These data are in line with a previous report showing opposite regulation of human (increase)versus mouse (decrease) apoA-I gene expression by fibrates in livers of transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoA-I gene under control of its homologous promoter (15Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The experiments in these mice also indicated that this species-specific opposite regulation between human versus mouse is due to differences in cis-, but not in trans-acting elements (15Berthou L.

https://openalex.org/W2074582828,"A novel family of cofactors that differentially interact with homeoproteins have been identified via a yeast two-hybrid screen. The proteins contain a conserved protein kinase domain that is separated from a domain that interacts with homeoproteins and hence are termed homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs): HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3. We show that HIPKs are nuclear kinases using GFP-HIPK fusion constructs. The DNA binding activity of the NK-3 homeoprotein is greatly enhanced by HIPK2, but this effect is independent of its phosphorylation by HIPK2. In cultured cells, HIPKs localize to nuclear speckles and potentiate the repressor activities of NK homeoproteins. The co-repressor activity of HIPKs depends on both its homeodomain interaction domain and a co-repressor domain that maps to the N terminus.

These homeobox genes encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that act as both transcriptional activators and repressors that control the expression of target genes in a temporally and spatially regulated manner (1McGinnis W.

To date a cofactor for a homeoprotein that shows enzymatic activity has not been reported. The NK homeobox genes (10Kim Y. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 27-71Google Scholar), especially the NK-2 family of homeobox genes, were shown to have important functions during embryonic development and organogenesis including development of the heart (reviewed in Ref. 12Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that mutations in the gene encoding the NKX2-5 homeodomain transcription factor were found to cause nonsyndromic, human congenital heart disease provides the first evidence that NKX2-5, a member of the NK-2 family of homeobox genes, is also involved in human disease (13Schott J-J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Cofactors for NK homeoproteins are totally unknown. In an effort to identify genes encoding proteins that interact with NK homeodomain transcription factors and to evaluate their contribution to the functional specificity of the NK homeoproteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen of mouse embryonic matchmaker cDNA libraries (days 7 and 11) was performed using a portion of the mouse Nkx-1.2 homeoprotein as bait. Here, we report the cloning of potential cofactors that differentially interact with homeoproteins. Further, we show that these HIPKs1 constitute a novel family of nuclear protein kinases that potentiate the transcriptional activities of homeoproteins. The two-hybrid screen was performed essentially as described (14Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). For bait construction, a DNA fragment (0.6 kb, a.a 110–305) from Nkx-1.2, which is one of the two mouse homologues of Drosophila NK-1 (15Schubert F.R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,16Hong S.B. Kim S.J. Noh M.J. Lee Y.M. Kim Y. Yoo O.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 373-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). Approximately 1.2 × 107 transformants from mouse embryonic days 7 and 11 matchmaker cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) were screened in the HF7C yeast strain containing the bait plasmid. β-Galactosidase activity was measured with liquid culture assays and filter lift assays. For deletion analysis of the Nkx-1.2 interaction domain in yeast, DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with specific primers and were fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of pGBT9. For cDNA cloning, mouse brain and heart cDNA libraries (Stratagene) were screened with 32P-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen (clone 7 forHipk1, 0.94 kb, and clone 41 for Hipk2, 1.0 kb). A total of 36 overlapping clones were sequenced and classified (16 clones for Hipk1, 14 clones for Hipk2, and 6 clones for Hipk3). The longest cDNA fragment obtained is a 4.0-kb Hipk2 cDNA, which covers nearly the full open reading frame for HIPK2. For cloning of the 5′ end of the cDNA, reverse transcription-PCR was used using selected primers for HIPKs and mouse heart mRNA. The GST-NK homeodomain fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pGEX-5X-1 vector and purified as described (17Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the expression of HIPK2, an EcoRI DNA fragment (4.0 kb, amino acids 25–1189) was cloned into the pFastBac expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant Bacimid DNAs were recovered as per the manufacturer's protocol. His-tagged HIPK2 proteins were purified using a nickel-charged Sepharose column (ProBond, Invitrogen). For pull-down assays, Hipk1 and Hipk2 clones (clone 7 and 41, respectively) obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen were subcloned into a pSPUTK vector and subjected to in vitro translation using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST-Nkx-1.2, immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, with in vitro translated HIPK1 and HIPK2 proteins diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixtures were placed on ice for 2 h and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted, separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. For testing the phosphorylation of NK homeodomain proteins, GST-NK fusion proteins (300 ng each) were incubated with HIPK2 (300 ng) at 30 °C for 2 h in kinase buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP to a final specificity of 100 μCi/μmol. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. Gel shift assays were performed as described (17Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled DNA probe (5′-TCTGCACTTAAGCGCCACTTAACAAC-3′) that contains two copies of the NK-3 target sequence. To see whether phosphorylation can affect the DNA binding activity of NK-3, GST-NK-3 (300 ng) was preincubated with HIPK2 (300 ng) in kinase buffer A in the presence or in the absence of 0.1 mm ATP for 2 h at 30 °C, and aliquots (one-tenth) of the reaction mixture were used for gel shift assays. Transfections into CV-1 cells with the indicated plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, normalization of transfection efficiency, and CAT assays were performed as described (17Lee Y.M. Park T. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17531-17541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The G5EnXCAT reporter, which contains the SV40 enhancer between the GAL4 DNA-binding sites and the TATA box of G5BCAT reporter, produced high CAT activity in transfected cells, so that it was easier to measure the repression activity of GAL4-NK-3 or GAL4-NK-1. For the construction of HIPK2-K221R (Lys at position 221 was changed to Arg), a PCR-based method was used to generate mutations (AAG to AGA) with specific primers (primer 2558, 5′-AATGAAATTGTGGCCATTAGAATCCTCAAGAACCACCCC-3′ and primer 2559, 5′-GGGGTGGTTCTTGAGGATTCTAATGGCCACAATTTCATT-3′). The DNA fragments (1.0 kb, coding region for a.a. 1–328) of the corresponding kinase domain of the wild type HIPK2 was replaced by the same DNA fragments containing the mutation (K221R) that was obtained by PCR. Various GAL4-HIPK2 constructs were generated from the full-length GAL4-HIPK2 by deletions of specific regions (indicated as a.a. numbers) using restriction sites. 1 μg of reporter plasmid (G5EnXCAT) and 2 μg of CMV-HIPK2 were used for each transfection. The amounts of effector plasmids used for each transfection were 40 ng (GAL4-NK-3 or GAL4-NK-1) and 500 ng (GAL4-HIPK fusion constructs), respectively. Among the thirty-eight positive clones that were identified from the two-hybrid screen and sequenced, two clones (clones 7 and 41) showed significant identities in amino acid residues to each other and were further characterized. These two clones (HIPK1 and HIPK2, see below) showed a strong interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 5). Interactions of HIPK1 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4) and HIPK2 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8) with Nkx-1.2 were also confirmed by pull-down assays with in vitro translated 35S-labeled HIPK1 (lane 2) and HIPK2 (lane 6). Both HIPK1 (lane 4) and HIPK2 (lane 8) showed strong interactions with the GST-Nkx-1.2 protein, whereas they did not interact with the GST control protein (lanes 3 and 7). Deletion analysis of Nkx-1.2 (Fig. 1 C) revealed that the homeodomain is required (Fig. 1 C, constructs D9 and D10) but is not sufficient (Fig. 1 C, construct D4) for the interaction with HIPK1 and HIPK2. Using clones 7 and 41 as probes, cDNAs from mouse brain and heart cDNA libraries were cloned, and the nucleotide sequences were determined. Surprisingly, sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein kinase motif (Fig. 2 A). Because both genes can encode the catalytic domain of a protein kinase, we named these genesHipk1 and Hipk2(homeodomain-interacting proteinkinases 1 and 2). From this screening we also cloned Hipk3, a third member of the HIPK family. Comparison of the deduced amino acids sequences revealed strong similarity in the protein kinase domains (Fig. 2, A and B). A search of the GenBankTM revealed strong similarities with human expressed sequence tags and a genomic DNA sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans (F20B6.8) that contains a hypothetical open reading frame for a protein kinase, suggesting that HIPKs are well conserved in other species. In fact, a dendrogram analysis indicated that HIPKs constitute an unique family of protein kinases that show the closest similarity to the yeast YAK1 (43% identity in the catalytic domain) that belongs to the CMGC group (Ref.18Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Hardie G Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 7-47Google Scholar and data not shown). The homeoprotein interaction domains, which were deduced from the original yeast clones, also show significant amino acid identities (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, an additional amino acid sequence in the interaction domain of HIPK1 was found (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Table I, HIPKs interact with other NK homeoproteins such as Drosophila NK-1, NK-3, and mouse Nkx-2.5 as well as with HoxD4 and HoxC4. Interestingly, HIPKs showed differential interactions with different homeoproteins, although the interaction domains show significant amino acid identities. Because the baits that showed interaction with HIPKs contain the homeodomain and the C terminus of the proteins (Table I), these results suggest that the homeodomains may be important for specific interactions with HIPKs. HIPKs contain a PEST sequence (19Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) following the interaction domain (Fig. 2, A and B). A C-terminal region enriched in tyrosine and histidine residues (Fig. 2 B, the YH domain) with unknown function is also conserved among the HIPKs.Table IInteractions of HIPKs with homeodomain proteinsBaitInteractionPhosphorylationHIPK1HIPK2HIPK3HIPK2pGBT9−−−NDNKx-1.2 (110–305)+++++++NK-1 (1–661)+++++++NK-1 (1–304)−−−NDNK-1 (474–661)+++++++NK-3 (1–382)+++−+NK-4 (267–416)−−−−NKx-2.5 (19–318)+++−NDHoxC4 (124–262)−+−NDHoxD4 (122–250)++−NDVarious coding regions (amino acid numbers) of homeobox genes were subcloned into pGBT9 vector, and interactions were determined by β-galactosidase assays in yeast.

To explore the possibility that HIPKs are nuclear kinases, the subcellular localization of HIPKs using green fluorescence protein (GFP) was determined in living cells. When CV-1 cells were transfected with GFP-HIPK2 (Fig. 2 C), the fluorescence derived from GFP was preferentially detected in nuclear speckles (dots) (20Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), suggesting that HIPKs are nuclear protein kinases. Consistent with these results, further deletion analysis of HIPK2 revealed multiple nuclear localization signals and a nuclear speckle retention signal (SRS, a.a. 860–967) (21Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that follows the interaction domain and overlaps with a PEST sequence. 2Y. H. Kim, C. Y. Choi, and Y. Kim, manuscript in preparation. Homeoproteins are highly phosphorylated during development (22Krause H.M. Gehring W.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The function of phosphorylation as well as the identity of the protein kinases are unknown. HIPKs may be a group of kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation of homeodomain transcription factors, because they interact with a subset of NK homeodomain transcription factors. Indeed, when HIPK2 was purified following baculovirus expression, it was capable of phosphorylating NK homeoproteins in vitro (Table I). However, the function of this phosphorylation is still not entirely clear (see below). To gain insight into the function of the interaction between NK homeoproteins and HIPKs, we tested whether HIPKs can affect the DNA binding activity of NK homeoproteins using gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 3, HIPK2 greatly enhanced the DNA binding activity of NK-3 (lanes 5 and 6) compared with that of NK-3 without HIPK2 (lanes 3 and 4). HIPK2 itself does not show any DNA binding activity (lane 2). Prior incubation of NK-3 with HIPK2 in the presence of ATP did not change this effect (lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that phosphorylation does not affect DNA binding activity of the NK-3 homeodomain. Next, we investigated the effect of HIPK2 on the transcriptional activity of NK homeoproteins using NK-3. NK-3 showed autorepression of its own promoter, and this autorepression was enhanced by cotransfection with HIPK2. 3C. Y. Choi, Y. M. Lee, Y. H. Kim, and Y. Kim, unpublished results. This effect may simply result from the enhancement of NK-3 DNA binding activity by HIPK2 that was seen in the in vitro binding assays (Fig. 3). The other possibility is that HIPK2 itself can act as a co-repressor of NK-3, for which recruitment of HIPK2 is required. To see whether NK-3 can show an enhanced repressor activity without its own binding to target DNA, we used the GAL4-NK-3 fusion construct in which NK-3 is fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and we used the reporter plasmid (G5EnXCAT) for cotransfections with HIPK2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, HIPK2 greatly potentiated the repressor activity of GAL4-NK-3 (lane 4). These results strongly suggest that interaction between the homeoprotein and HIPK2 is required for enhancement of NK-3 repressor activity and that HIPK2 can act as a co-repressor for NK-3. Consistent with this idea, HIPK2 also enhanced the repressor activity of GAL4-NK-1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 6). Conversely, deletion of the C-terminal half of HIPK2, including the homeoprotein interaction domain (construct HIPK2-N, a.a 1–629) abolished this effect (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), indicating that interactions between HIPK2 and homeoproteins are important for enhancing the repressor activities of homeoproteins. A truncated form of HIPK2 (construct HIPK2-C, a.a. 503–1189), which has a deletion of the N-terminal half including the protein kinase domain, did not enhance the repressor activity of NK-3 either (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). These results imply that the enhancement of repressor activity of homeoproteins by HIPK2 is also conferred by domains within the N-terminal half of the HIPK2 (co-repressor domain, see below) in addition to the homeoprotein interaction domain in the C-terminal half. To investigate the possible role of the protein kinase activity of HIPK2 in enhancing the repressor activity of NK-3, we generated a kinase inactive mutant form of HIPK2 (construct HIPK2-K221R) that has a mutation in an invariant amino acid (Lys to Arg at position 221) in the active site of the protein kinase domain (subdomain II) and blocks catalytic activity based on studies of other protein kinases including mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases (18Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Hardie G Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 7-47Google Scholar, 23Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In fact, the repressor activity of NK-3 was reduced in cells cotransfected with this mutant, HIPK2-K221R, when compared with that of the wild type HIPK2 (50% reduction; Fig. 4 B, lane 4). These results suggest that the protein kinase activity is at least partly required for the full co-repressor activity of HIPK2. If HIPKs can act as co-repressors, then they should have co-repressor domain(s) that show repressor activity when tethered to DNA. To assess this possibility, GAL4-HIPK2 fusion constructs were generated, and their repressor activities were measured (Fig. 4 C). As expected from the results described above (Fig. 4, A and B), reporter gene (G5EnXCAT) activity was decreased by GAL4-HIPK2 (Fig. 4 C, construct B; 9-fold repression). Further deletion analysis revealed that HIPK2 contains a strong co-repressor domain (CRD, a.a. 97–230) at the N terminus (Fig. 4 C, constructs F–M). These results strongly support the idea that HIPKs function as co-repressors for homeoproteins. Thus, as a co-repressor for homeoproteins, the interaction domain of HIPK2 is indispensable for interacting with homeoproteins (Fig. 4 B). At the same time, the CRD is required for its co-repressor activity (Fig. 4 C, constructK), presumably by serving as a protein-binding interface with a co-repressor complex or with the basal transcription machinery. Other domains such as the SRS and the YH domain showed a positive and a negative effect on co-repressor activity, respectively (Fig. 4 C, constructs B–D and N–P). The GAL4-HIPK2(K221R) construct that contains a kinase inactive HIPK2-K221R fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain showed decreased repressor activity (Fig. 4 C, construct Q; 40% reduction compared with that of the wild type GAL4-HIPK2), which is similar to the results obtained with the HIPK2-K221R mutant construct (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). Because this effect is independent of interaction with homeoproteins, it is likely that for the full co-repressor activity of HIPK2, other unknown molecules such as components of a co-repressor complex or the basal transcriptional machinery may serve as substrate(s). HIPK1, which also localizes to nuclear speckles, showed co-repressor activity under the same experimental conditions.2 In summary, we have discovered a novel family of HIPKs that localize to nuclear speckles and provide the first evidence that HIPKs can act as transcriptional co-repressors for NK homeodomain transcription factors. Other co-repressors (N-CoR and SMRT) for a family of nuclear receptors were previously cloned and characterized (24Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). However, HIPKs constitute a novel class of co-repressors in the sense that they have protein kinase activity. Because HIPKs also interact with HOX proteins (Table I), HIPKs provide important tools with which to study the mechanisms that control the functional specificity of homeoproteinsin vivo and may help to decipher the HOX code (2Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Drs. Robert Adelstein and Marshall Nirenberg for helpful suggestions and for continuous support during this study. We also thank Dr. Adelstein for reading the manuscript and for discussions."

Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). In higher vertebrates, the cytokine interferon-γ induces the expression of three additional active proteasomal subunits, LMP7, LMP2, and MECL1, which replace their constitutive counterparts MB1, δ, and Z, respectively (17Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Angliker H. Shaw E. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Reidlinger J. Pike A.M. Savory P.J. Murray R.Z. Rivett A.J. J. Biol.

However, how these exchanges modulate proteasome function and specificity is still poorly understood. Biochemical studies on the specificity of the 20 S proteasome led to the description of three distinct proteolytic components, designated as the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolyzing (PGPH) activities. Recent studies confirmed that the yeast homologues of MB1, Z, and δ are the only active subunits with a functional N-terminal Thr nucleophile (15Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U.

A. 1997; 94: 7156-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and represent the above-mentioned three classical activities, as defined with certain fluorogenic model substrates. However, some biochemical studies also pointed toward the existence of additional proteolytic components within the proteasome (20Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); one of those, the so-called “branched chain amino acid-preferring” (BrAAP) component, cleaving after Leu in certain model substrates, was also assumed to represent the major protein degrading activity of the proteasome (21Pereira M.E. Nguyen T. Wagner B.J. Margolis J.W., Yu, B. Wilk S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of such additional activities was concluded from inhibitory studies. Whereas the cleavage of fluorogenic substrates representing the three classical activities could be inhibited with the general serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), the same treatment led to an increased turnover of certain other substrates, defined to represent the BrAAP component (20Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Cardozo C. Vinitsky A. Hidalgo M.C. Michaud C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7373-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using more specific inhibitors, evidence was provided that the BrAAP and PGPH activities might be related to each other (23Cardozo C. Chen W.E. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Vinitsky A. Cardozo C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Michaud C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29860-29866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the arrangement of the intermediately processed β7/Pre4 and β6/C5 propeptides in the crystal structure of the yeast 20 S proteasome led to the postulation of an additional catalytic activity, not related to the Thr sites and possibly involved in the processing of the β-subunit propeptides (14Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether the specificities defined with small fluorogenic substrates do reflect truly distinct catalytic sites and how these specificities relate to the cleavages that can be observed in peptide substrates containing known MHC class I ligands. In addition, we addressed the question of additional proteolytically active sites associated with the yeast 20 S proteasome by analysis of the BrAAP component. Using highly purified wild-type and mutant yeast proteasomes and several inhibitors of the proteasomal activities, we examined the cleavage specificity of the three active subunits for short fluorogenic peptides as well as peptide substrates derived from the murine JAK1 tyrosine kinase, the pp89 protein from murine cytomegalovirus, and the nucleoprotein from influenza A/PR/8/34. We found that all observed cleavages could be correlated to the three known active sites, showing that no additional proteolytic activity exists within the yeast 20 S proteasome for the given set of substrates. Furthermore, we found that the specificities of the different subunits for fluorogenic substrates are mainly identical to those observed for peptide substrates, with few, but notable exceptions. This allows now the clear association of certain cleavage events within peptide substrates with certain β-subunits and therefore an assessment of the contribution of the different β-subunits to the generation of proteasomal degradation products. The 20 S proteasomes from yeast and higher eukaryotes are highly homologous. As shown in this paper and recently by Niedermann et al. (25Niedermann G. Grimm R. Geier E. Maurer M. Realini C. Gartmann C. Soll J. Omura S. Rechsteiner M.C. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), most cleavage sites in peptides are conserved between yeast and man. It is therefore very likely that results obtained with the yeast proteasome will improve our understanding of vertebrate proteasome function and specificity and consequently of its role in the generation of CTL epitopes. The generation of mutant strains YUS4 (pup1-T1A), YUS1 (pre3-T1A), YUS5 (pup1-T1A pre3-T1A), and YWH23 (pre2-K33A) (numbering refers to amino acid positions in mature subunits) has been described recently (15Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Wild-type yeast cells were as described (14Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The purification of 20 S proteasomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been described recently (14Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The same procedure was applied to the purification of the various mutant proteasomes. The fluorogenic substrates benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-GGL-AMC), succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC), benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Arg-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-ARR-AMC), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide (Z-LLE-β-NA) (all purchased from Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) were prepared from 10 mm stocks in Me2SO. Typically, 1 μg of proteasome (with and without inhibitors) was incubated in a 100 μm substrate solution. Fluorescence of the leaving group was determined after incubation times of 1–5 h with a Millipore spectrophotometer at 380 nm excitation and 440 nm emission for AMC and at 330 nm excitation and 410 nm emission for β-NA. Lactacystin was purchased from E. J. Corey (Harvard University); DCI and calpain inhibitor I (LLnL) were from Sigma. The BrAAP substrate Z-GPALA-p-aminobenzoic acid (Z-GPALA-pAB) was a gift from Dr. M. Orlowski (Mount Sinai, New York). It was incubated in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) at a final concentration of 1 mm together with 1 μg of proteasome, in the presence or absence of 0.01 unit of aminopeptidase M (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 reaction volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid and developed by the sequential addition of 2 volumes of 0.1% NaNO2 (in 1 n HCl), 2 volumes of 0.5% ammonium sulfamate (in 1 n HCl), and 4 volumes of 0.05% N-naphthylethylendiamine (in 95% ethanol). In the course of the development reaction, an azo dye was generated from freep-aminobenzoic acid. The extinction of the dye was measured at 545 nm. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 432A automated peptide synthesizer applying Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Beckman Instruments, System Gold). Incubations of 1 μg of proteasome with peptide substrates at a final concentration of 50 μm were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.8), 2 mm MgAc2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Proteasomal digests were analyzed with two different LC-MS systems. In the case of the first system, aliquots of 40 μl were loaded by autosampler (CTC A200S) and separated by a HPLC apparatus (Sykam, Gilching, Germany) equipped with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Eluent A consisted of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; eluent B consisted of 80% acetonitrile containing 0.055% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient was 23–63% eluent B in 20 min; the flow rate was 50 μl/min, with the gradient started 5 min after sample injection. Analysis was performed on-line by a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ 700, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ESI-F electrospray ion source. Each scan was acquired in centroid mode over the range m/z300–2200 in 3 s. In the case of the second LC-MS system, aliquots of 5 μl were separated by a HPLC apparatus (Applied Biosystems 140D solvent delivery system) equipped with a 300-μm C18 RP column (Gromsil, Grom, Herrenberg, Germany). Eluent A contained 4 mmNH4Ac, adjusted to pH 3 with formic acid; eluent B contained 2 mm NH4Ac in 70% acetonitrile, adjusted to pH 3 with formic acid. The gradient was 20–75% eluent B in 25 min; the flow rate after the pre-column split was 6 μl/min. Analysis was performed on-line by a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Each scan was acquired over the range m/z400–1500 in 3 s. Peptides were identified by their molecular mass. Additionally, the identity of main cleavage products was confirmed by fragmentation with argon atoms in MS-MS experiments. For relative quantitation of single molecular species, integrated ion currents were calculated and compared. Cleavage of the standard fluorogenic substrates GGL, ARR, and LLE has been shown recently to be subunit-specific (15Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Using for the first time yeast proteasome preparations, we repeated the cleavage of fluorogenic peptides to test the reproducibility of the results in our experimental setup. As expected, the GGL cleaving activity, defined to represent the chymotrypsin-like activity, is clearly correlated with the β5/Pre2 site: cleavage of the Z-GGL-AMC substrate was only present in those mutants that retain a functional β5/Pre2 subunit and was absent in pre2-K33A mutant proteasomes (Fig. 1 A). Identical results were obtained with the Suc-LLVY-AMC substrate (data not shown). The ARR cleaving activity, defined to represent the trypsin-like activity, depends on a functional β2/Pup1 site: the cleavage of Z-ARR-AMC was not observed in the β2/Pup1-mutated proteasomes from thepup1-T1A and pup1-T1A pre3-T1A strains, but was observed in all other mutants (Fig. 1 B). Correspondingly, β1/Pre3 is responsible for the PGPH-like activity: the Z-LLE-β-NA substrate was not cleaved in the double mutant pup1-T1A pre3-T1A and was only cleaved weakly in the pre3-T1Asingle mutant (Fig. 1 C). The increased activities of some mutant proteasomes compared with wild-type particles are hard to explain, but might be caused by the lack of competition from inactivated subunits for substrate molecules or by an allosteric activation of the remaining active β-subunits by the presence of propeptide remnants still associated with the inactivated β-subunits. In conclusion, the three standard fluorogenic substrates can be used as subunit-specific functional markers. We therefore decided to test the influence of several inhibitors on the proteolytic activity of wild-type and mutant yeast 20 S proteasomes. It has been reported previously that the bovine proteasomal subunits corresponding to yeast β5/Pre2 and β2/Pup1 (13Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) or all six human active β-subunits (26Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) are inhibited by lactacystin due to covalent binding to the N-terminal threonine. Soaking of yeast 20 S proteasome crystals resulted only in a covalent modification of the β5/Pre2 subunit (14Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). In our hands, pretreatment of proteasomes with 1 mm lactacystin for 45 min led to absolute inhibition of GGL and ARR cleaving activity (Fig. 1,D and E), but did not have an inhibitory influence on the LLE cleaving activity (Fig. 1 F). Preincubation of proteasomes with 1 mm LLnL for 45 min reduced GGL cleavage by ∼90% (Fig. 1 G), but to our surprise, did not significantly influence cleavage of the ARR and LLE substrates (Fig. 1, H and I), despite the fact that the same concentration covalently modified β5/Pre2, β1/Pre3, and β2/Pup1 in wild-type yeast 20 S proteasome crystals (14Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Given the established specificities of the different subunits for the fluorogenic substrates, this finding shows that in our setup the β5/Pre2 catalytic site can be inhibited by both lactacystin and LLnL, β2/Pup1 by only lactacystin, and β1/Pre3 by neither lactacystin nor LLnL. The vastly different sensitivity of the proteasomal activities for lactacystin and LLnL was also observed in inhibitor titration experiments (data not shown). Possible explanations for the apparent difference from the crystal structure data, which showed occupation of all active sites by LLnL and occupation of only β5/Pre2 by lactacystin, will be discussed. The third inhibitor tested in our study was DCI. Whereas yeast β5/Pre2 was clearly sensitive to inactivation by DCI after a 45-min incubation, β1/Pre3 was only weakly affected by DCI concentrations of 1 mm, and β1/Pup1 was not affected at all (Fig. 2). This result is in line with the observation that the three activities in the bovine pituitary proteasome are inactivated with widely differing rate constants (chymotrypsin-like > PGPH-like > trypsin-like) (27Orlowski M. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9270-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported for the bovine pituitary proteasome that all three classical activities can be inactivated with micromolar concentrations of DCI and short incubation times (20Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This cannot be confirmed in our experiments with wild-type and mutant yeast proteasomes. To inhibit β1/Pre3 by 50%, the yeast proteasomes had to be preincubated in 100 μm DCI for 90 min. Lower DCI concentrations or shorter preincubation times did not significantly affect the β1/Pre3 activity (data not shown). Micromolar concentrations of DCI have been shown to activate an additional proteolytic component of bovine 20 S proteasomes, the BrAAP component (20Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this activity is also present in yeast 20 S proteasomes. The existence of mutant yeast proteasomes gave us the unique possibility to test whether or not this component, if present, can be associated with one of the three active β-subunits or whether it represents an additional, so far unrecognized, active site. Using the assay introduced by Orlowski et al. (20Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) to measure the BrAAP activity of the proteasome, the Z-GPALA-pAB substrate was incubated with the different yeast proteasome preparations. Generation of the leaving group (pAB) in the absence of aminopeptidase M reflects direct cleavage after the C-terminal alanine, whereas the liberation of additional pAB in the presence of aminopeptidase M is described as cleavage after the penultimate leucine residue, generating Ala-pAB in the first place. The cleavage after Leu is thought to represent the so-called BrAAP activity. Significant BrAAP activity was found in all proteasome preparations, except the one with an inactivated β1/Pre3 subunit. Here, the addition of aminopeptidase M did not lead to release of additional pAB (Fig. 3 C), indicating that cleavage after leucine in the GPALA substrate is catalyzed by the β1/Pre3 subunit. On the other hand, cleavage after alanine was clearly independent of β1/Pre3 (Fig. 3 C) and could be attributed to β5/Pre2 or β2/Pup1. The finding that the BrAAP activity was performed by β1/Pre3 was also supported by the fact that this activity could not be inhibited by lactacystin, found previously not to influence β1/Pre3 activity against LLE (Figs. 1 F and 3,A, B, and D (+aminopeptidase M (APM), +lactacystin (LC))). Most cleavages in long peptide substrates occur after hydrophobic (Phe, Tyr, Ile, Leu), basic (Arg, Lys), and acidic (Asp, Glu) residues (see below), a situation similar to the cleavage of fluorogenic substrates, which have been related to chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH-like activities in the proteasome. To investigate whether these cleavages are catalyzed by three non-overlapping and separate activities, we digested three different peptides with wild-type yeast proteasomes and the four different mutant yeast proteasome preparations containing the inactivated β-subunits β2/Pup1−, β1/Pre3−, β2/Pup1−β1/Pre3−, and β5/Pre2−. Products were separated and analyzed by LC-MS. Three typical sets of HPLC profiles displaying integrated ion currents for the masses of particular degradation products are shown in Fig. 4. We limited ourselves to the interpretation of only those cleavages showing a dramatic reduction or complete absence in digestions using mutant proteasomes and avoided to compare relative amounts of fragments generated under the influence of different proteasome mutants. The reason for this is that many peptide fragments generated are intermediate products and subject to further degradation. For quantitative analysis, one would have to consider consecutive cleavages, stabilizing or destabilizing the fragment under consideration. This kind of analysis would go far beyond the aim of this study. However, it is possible to recognize a strong requirement for a certain subunit in those cases where corresponding mutants exhibit no or greatly reduced product formation (compare Fig. 4). The JAK1 21-mer peptide is part of JAK1 tyrosine kinase and contains the MHC class I ligand SYFPEITHI (28Harpur A.G. Zimiecki A. Wilks A.F. Falk K. Rötzschke O. Rammensee H.-G. Immunol. Lett. 1993; 35: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Incubation of this peptide with mammalian proteasomes leads to efficient generation of the MHC I ligand (10Dick T.P. Ruppert T.

Baumeister W. Eichmann K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is flanked by two dominant cleavage sites after Phe7and Ile16, respectively. The same two cleavages are efficiently catalyzed by the yeast proteasome, in addition to minor cleavages that are also conserved between the mammalian and yeast systems. However, the yeast enzyme additionally cleaves after His15, a cleavage not observed in digests with the mammalian proteasome (Fig. 5). Cleavage after Phe7 is β5/Pre2-dependent since generation of fragments 1–7 and 8–21 was nearly absent in β5/Pre2-defective proteasomes (Fig. 5, A and B). Cleavage after Ile16 was also catalyzed by the β5/Pre2 subunit: generation of fragment 17–21 was nearly missing in digests with β5/Pre2-deficient proteasomes (Fig. 5 C). Correspondingly, a functional β5/Pre2 subunit was necessary and sufficient for the generation of SYFPEITHI (positions 8–16): β2/Pup1−β1/Pre3− double mutants (which carry only functional β5/Pre2 subunits) efficiently generated SYFPEITHI, whereas β5/Pre2− mutants did not generate any detectable amount (Fig. 5 D). The observation that the formation of fragments 1–7, 8–16, and 8–21 can be completely inhibited with lactacystin (Fig. 5, G–I) is in agreement with an essential role of β5/Pre2 and indicates that β1/Pre3 does not perform this cleavage. Cleavage after His15 was detected only in mutants with a functional β2/Pup1 subunit, as demonstrated for fragment 16–21 (Fig. 5 E). Cleavage after Tyr9, leading to FPEITHI (positions 10–16) in the mammalian system (10Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.-G. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), also took place in the yeast system, albeit much more weakly. The minor product FPEITH (positions 10–15) is an example of a fragment that depends on two different functional subunits: β5/Pre2 for the N-terminal cleavage and β2/Pup1 for the C-terminal cleavage. Correspondingly, fragment 10–15 was only formed in digests with proteasomes that contain both β5/Pre2 and β2/Pup1 (Fig. 5 F). The pp89 25-mer peptide is derived from the murine cytomegalovirus pp89 IE-protein and contains the Ld-presented CTL epitope YPHFMPTNL (29del Val M. Schlicht H.J. Ruppert T. Reddehase M.J.

We have previously shown that either of two related regulatory proteins, E3KARP or NHERF, is necessary for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3. In the present study, we characterized the interaction between NHE3 and E3KARP using in vitro binding assays. We found that NHE3 directly binds to E3KARP and that the entirety of the second PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain plus the carboxyl-terminal domain of E3KARP are required to bind NHE3. E3KARP binds an internal region within the NHE3 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, defining a new mode of PDZ domain interaction. Analyses of cellular distribution of NHE3 and E3KARP expressed in PS120 fibroblasts show that NHE3 and E3KARP are co-localized on the plasma membrane, but not in a distinct juxtanuclear compartment in which NHE3 is predominantly expressed. The distributions of NHE3 and E3KARP were not affected by treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP. As shown earlier for the human homolog of NHERF, we also found that the cytoskeletal protein ezrin binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain of E3KARP. These results are consistent with the possibility that E3KARP and NHERF may function as scaffold proteins that bind to both NHE3 and ezrin. Since ezrin is a protein kinase A anchoring protein, we suggest that the scaffolding function of E3KARP binding to both ezrin and NHE3 localizes cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3, which is phosphorylated by elevated cAMP.

Currently, two major mechanisms have been suggested for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. The first involves an increase in NHE3 phosphorylation level by PKA,1 and the second requires the presence of a regulatory factor. NHE3 phosphorylation by PKA was initially demonstrated by Moe et al. (3Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), who showed that in AP-1 cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, the cAMP-elicited inhibition of NHE3 activity was accompanied by an increase in NHE3 phosphorylation level. More recently, Kurashima et al. (4Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) identified the sites of phosphorylation in NHE3 by PKA in AP-1 cells. In contrast, we previously reconstituted the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 by transfecting one of two regulatory proteins, E3KARP (NHE3kinase Aregulatoryprotein 2The corrected sequence is found under accession number AF004900 in the GenBankTM Data Bank. ; also named TKA-1) or NHERF (NHEregulatory factor), in the PS120 fibroblast cell line, which lacks these regulatory proteins, and consequently, cAMP does not affect NHE3 activity (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 6Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This demonstrates the necessity of a regulatory protein in cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3. E3KARP was cloned from a human lung library by yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3 as bait (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). NHERF was identified by limited trypsinization and cellular fractionation of rabbit renal brush border vesicles (6Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). E3KARP and NHERF are closely related proteins of 337 and 358 aa, respectively. These proteins share 52% identity, and both contain two tandem protein interaction module PDZ domains (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). How these regulatory proteins mediate the inhibitory effect of cAMP is not clear. Protein-protein interactions are intrinsic to virtually every cellular process. Many of these interactions are mediated by modular domains such as the Src homology SH2 and SH3, pleckstrin homology, and PDZ domains (9Couture C. Deckert M. Williams S. Russo F.O. Altman A.

We have shown previously that NHE3 and E3KARP directly interact with each other (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this present report, we analyzed the interaction between NHE3 and E3KARP to determine minimal domains necessary for the interaction. We found that the interaction of NHE3 with E3KARP represents a new mode of PDZ binding and that it requires a PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain of E3KARP. We also found that E3KARP binds to an internal domain within the NHE3 cytoplasmic tail, which has previously been shown to be essential for PKA-dependent inhibition of NHE3 (13Cabado A.G., Yu, F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that E3KARP binds to the cytoskeletal protein ezrin, which was previously shown to bind to PKA. These findings suggest a potential model for E3KARP in the inhibition of NHE3 activity by PKA. PS120 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. Where appropriate, G418 (800 μg/ml) or hygromycin (600 units/ml) was used to maintain selection pressure. Various domains of E3KARP were generated by PCR and were expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. These domains include the first PDZ domain (P1) and the second PDZ domain (P2), expressed individually (P1 or P2) or together as a unit (P1–2); the C-terminal domain (C); and the second PDZ domain and the C-terminal domain as a single unit (P2-C) (Fig. 1). We also expressed clone 42 (C42), which extends from aa 130 to 314 of E3KARP and was one of the partial clones initially obtained from yeast two-hybrid screening (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Fidelity of the PCR products was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The PCR products were cloned into pET30a (Novagen), expressed as hexahistidine (His6)-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli, and affinity-purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin as suggested by the manufacturer (QIAGEN Inc.). The above constructs were also expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins by cloning into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). The entire rabbit NHE3 carboxyl-terminal construct extends from aa 475 to 832 (C3-832), and NHE3 C-terminal truncation constructs terminating at aa 711 (C3-711), 660 (C3-660), and 585 (C3-585) were generated by PCR and cloned into pET30a. The C-terminal 88 aa of NHE3 (C3-ter88) were generated by excising the NHE3 cDNA with StyI, followed by blunt-ending with Klenow fragment, digestion with XhoI, and subcloning into pET30b linearized with EcoRV and SalI. Polyclonal antibody Ab2570 was raised in rabbit against the carboxyl-terminal 106 aa of E3KARP expressed as His6-tagged protein. Ab2570 was purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, followed by affinity gel purification through Affi-gel Blue (Bio-Rad). E3KARP was initially cloned into pET30a plasmid. The entire construct of the N-terminal His6 and S-protein tags fused in frame with E3KARP was subcloned into pMT3 vector (Genetics Institute), resulting in pMT-e3karpHS. PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts were then stably transfected with pMT-e3karpHS, resulting in PS120/E3KARP-HS. To coexpress E3KARP and NHE3V, PS120/E3KARP-HS was transfected with pECE:NHE3V, and expression of NHE3V was selected by acid-loading. NHE3V is rabbit NHE3 tagged at its carboxyl terminus with a VSVG epitope, as previously described (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Transfected PS120 fibroblasts were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mmiodoacetamide, and 1% Triton X-100), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was incubated overnight with Ab2570. Immunocomplexes were separated by binding to protein A-Sepharose resin and were washed three times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The presence of immunoprecipitated recombinant E3KARP-HS was detected with S-protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as recommended by Novagen. The presence of co-immunoprecipitated NHE3V was detected with monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody mP5D4 (14Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The entire NHE3 C terminus and the truncated mutants described above were labeled with [35S]methionine using the TNT in vitrotranscription-translation system (Promega). Prior to gel overlay assay, the relative yields of the in vitro translation products were estimated by resolving the labeled products on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Domains of E3KARP were generated as described above. Three μg of each recombinant protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried milk, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl and then were incubated with comparable amounts (typically 3–5 μl/ml) of the 35S-labeled entire NHE3 C terminus or truncated NHE3 C termini in 5% nonfat dried milk, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed four times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100, and bound 35S-labeled NHE3 C terminus was detected by autoradiography. The N-terminal 302 aa of human ezrin (N-ezrin) were generated by PCR, and the PCR product was subcloned into pET30a. The N-ezrin was labeled with 35S by in vitro transcription-translation and was used in gel overlay assay as described above. PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts were lysed in lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of recombinant E3KARP or various domains of E3KARP immobilized on Ni2+-NTA beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with lysis buffer without Triton X-100, followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were immunoblotted with the mP5D4 antibody. PS120 fibroblasts were grown on tissue culture coverslips. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and when necessary, cells were treated with 0.1 mm 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) for 20 min before washing with PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 15% goat serum, PBS, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10% goat serum, PBS, and 1% bovine serum albumin at the following dilutions: 1:300 for polyclonal antibody Ab2570 (anti-E3KARP antibody), 1:50 for monoclonal antibody mP5D4 (anti-VSVG antibody), and 1:500 for monoclonal antibody 3C12 (anti-ezrin antibody; Sigma). Cells were then washed three times with PBS, bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with PBS, bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 and mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were examined with an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) coupled to a confocal laser scanning unit (Bio-Rad MRC-600). The Na+/H+ exchanger activities of stably transfected PS120 cells were measured using the ratio fluorometric pH-sensitive dye 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein as described previously (15Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 8-Br-cAMP was used, cells were pretreated with 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP for 15 min during the dye loading and during the prepulse period. To demonstrate that E3KARP and NHE3 interact in vivo, we stably expressed E3KARP as a His6- and S-protein-tagged fusion protein, E3KARP-HS, in PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts. To ensure that the tagging of E3KARP protein with His6 and S-protein did not alter its function in cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3, we studied the activity of NHE3V in response to 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP. Fig. 2 shows that the sodium-dependent alkalinization due to NHE3V activity is significantly inhibited in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP in PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP-HS cells. The mean intracellular pH value of PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP-HS in the absence or presence of 8-Br-cAMP was 7.38 ± 0.036 and 7.28 ± 0.027, respectively (p < 0.05 by unpaired t test;n = 5). We then determined if there was any interaction between NHE3V and E3KARP-HS in vivo. The antibody against the C-terminal 106 aa of E3KARP, Ab2570, recognized E3KARP-HS expressed in PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A). The C-terminal 106 aa of E3KARP used in preparation of Ab2570 show limited homology to the similar C-terminal domain of NHERF (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ab2570 exhibited minimal cross-reactivity with NHERF (Fig. 3 A). E3KARP-HS was immunoprecipitated with Ab2570 against E3KARP, and the success of immunoprecipitation was detected with S-protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Fig. 3 B). Coprecipitated NHE3V was then detected with mouse monoclonal antibody mP5D4 against the VSVG epitope tag. As shown in Fig. 3 B, NHE3V specifically co-immunoprecipitated with E3KARP-HS, demonstrating the interaction in vivo between NHE3 and E3KARP, consistent with our earlier finding (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine which parts of E3KARP interact with the NHE3 C terminus, we expressed and purified the entire E3KARP and various subdomains of E3KARP as His6-tagged recombinant proteins. The entire NHE3 C terminus (C3-832) labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitrotranscription-translation was used as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4 A, C3-832 bound to the full-length E3KARP protein, but not to PDZ domains expressed individually (P1 or P2) or as one unit (P1–2). We occasionally observed weak binding of C3-832 to the P1 and P1–2 domains, but this interaction did not occur consistently. The C3-832 probe did not bind to the C-terminal domain of E3KARP, but when the P2 and C-terminal domains were expressed as one unit (P2-C), C3-832 bound to the P2-C domain consistently. C3-832 also bound to the C42 construct, consistent with the interaction of clone C42 with NHE3C in the yeast two-hybrid system (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To confirm the above findings, we performed a “pull-down assay” on lysate prepared from PS120/NHE3V fibroblasts using bacterial recombinant E3KARP and its subdomains immobilized on Ni2+-NTA beads. The presence of NHE3V bound to the recombinant proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting using the mP5D4 antibody against the VSVG tag. As shown in Fig. 4 B, NHE3V bound specifically to E3KARP and the P2-C and C42 constructs, but did not bind to the P1, P2, and C-terminal domains or to Ni2+-NTA itself. To test the specificity of the binding of C3-832 to the P2-C domain, we expressed the domains of E3KARP as MBP fusion proteins. These were then overlaid with 35S-labeled NHE3C. As shown in Fig. 5 A, C3-832 bound to MBP/E3KARP and MBP/P2-C, but not MBP/P1, MBP/P2, MBP/C, or MBP, confirming the results shown in Fig. 3 A. Subsequently the specificity of interaction was tested by incubating the blots with labeled C3-832 and competing peptides expressed as His6-tagged proteins (20 μg/ml) as inhibitors. Fig. 5 B shows that in the presence of E3KARP-His6 protein, 35S-labeled NHE3C binding was significantly reduced. Similarly, the P2-C domain effectively blocked NHE3C binding to E3KARP and the P2-C domain. In contrast, the P1 domain showed no effect on the binding, consistent with the weak binding observed in the gel overlays. We next determined which part of the NHE3 C terminus interacts with E3KARP. Gel overlay assays were performed on E3KARP using the35S-labeled truncated NHE3 C-terminal constructs. As shown in Fig. 6, the entire NHE3 C terminus (C3-832) and C3-711, which ranges from aa 475 to 711, bound to E3KARP. Similarly, C3-660, corresponding to aa 475–660, bound to E3KARP, although the binding of C3-660 to E3KARP was always significantly lower than that of C3-711. However, C3-585 did not interact with E3KARP. Because many PDZ domains specifically interact with the carboxyl termini of protein targets (12Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 16Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal 88 aa of NHE3 (C3-ter88) were expressed and used as a probe for a gel overlay to determine whether this part of NHE3 contributed to the interaction with E3KARP. However, C3-ter88 did not interact with E3KARP. This lack of binding of the C-terminal 88 aa of NHE3 to the regulatory proteins is consistent with the fact that E3KARP interacts with NHE3V even though the C terminus of NHE3 is blocked by a VSVG epitope (Fig. 3 B). We determined the distribution of E3KARP and NHE3V exogenously expressed in PS120 fibroblasts. We first determined the distribution of E3KARP in PS120 fibroblasts in the absence of NHE3. PS120 fibroblasts were transfected with pMT-e3karpHS and selected by 600 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP for 15 min prior to fixation. Fig. 7 A shows that E3KARP is diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol, with some staining at or near the plasma membrane. Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP did not affect the distribution of E3KARP. In contrast to a previous report that SIP-1, a probable splice variant of E3KARP, was exclusively present in nuclei (17Poulat F. de Santa Barbara P. Desclozeaux M. Soullier S. Moniot B. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Berta P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), E3KARP was not present in nuclei since the labeling of E3KARP did not overlap with that of nuclei, which were stained with Hoechst 33342. E3KARP distribution was also studied in the presence of NHE3V. Fig. 7 B reveals that NHE3V showed predominant staining in juxtanuclear regions, consistent with an earlier report suggesting that NHE3 is located in recycling endocytic vesicles (18D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.-P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to the juxtanuclear staining, localization of NHE3V at or near the plasma membrane was seen. In contrast, E3KARP again was predominantly present in the cytosol, with distinct staining at the plasma membrane as in Fig. 7 A. With NHE3V coexpressed, we often observed more membrane staining of E3KARP than in the absence of NHE3V (Fig. 7, compare A (panel a) and B(panels b and e)). However, this requires further studies that enable quantification of surface membrane-associated E3KARP. Unlike NHE3V, predominant staining at the perinuclear region was not observed for E3KARP. Double staining showed that NHE3 and E3KARP did not overlap throughout the cells, but co-localized at the plasma membrane as well as some areas within the cytosol, but not in the juxtanuclear regions. When treated with 8-Br-cAMP, the co-localization of NHE3V and E3KARP did not differ significantly compared with the basal condition. Thus, neither NHE3V nor E3KARP appears to move in response to cAMP. Recent studies by Reczek et al. (19Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and Murthyet al. (20Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have shown that the human homolog of NHERF, EBP50, binds to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family. Since both E3KARP and NHERF interact with NHE3 and seemingly have the same function in the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3, we determined if ezrin can also interact with E3KARP. The N-ezrin was labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitrotranscription-translation and was used as a probe for gel overlay. NHERF (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 6Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein was used as a positive control for the N-ezrin binding. Fig. 8 A shows that the N-ezrin bound to MBP/E3KARP, but not MBP itself, indicating specific interaction between the N terminus of ezrin and E3KARP. The interaction of the N-ezrin with E3KARP was as strong as that with NHERF. To determine which part of E3KARP binds to the N-ezrin, interaction between the N-ezrin and the subdomains of E3KARP expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins was studied by gel overlay assay. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the N-ezrin did not bind to the individual PDZ domains (P1 and P2) or to P1–2 as one unit. However, the N-ezrin bound to the C-terminal and P2-C domains of E3KARP. Interestingly, the N-ezrin did not interact with the C42 construct, which is essentially P2-C lacking the carboxyl-terminal 23 aa residues. The lack of N-ezrin binding to the C42 construct suggests that the ezrin-binding motif is located within the carboxyl-terminal 23 aa residues of E3KARP (Fig. 8 C). Fig. 8 D shows the distribution of E3KARP and ezrin in PS120/NHE3V/E3KARP-HS cells. Although both proteins were largely expressed in the cytoplasm as expected, some membrane staining was also evident. Double staining of endogenous ezrin and exogenous E3KARP revealed that ezrin and E3KARP are co-localized in some areas along the plasma membrane. Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP for 20 min did not alter the distribution of E3KARP or ezrin or the co-localization of these two proteins. In this study, we determined the interaction between NHE3 and E3KARP. We specifically wanted to address whether the PDZ domains in E3KARP contribute to the interaction with NHE3. This was not only because PDZ domains were recently shown to be the basis for protein-protein interaction, but also because one of the clones obtained in our initial two-hybrid screen encompassed the second PDZ domain and a large part of the C terminus of E3KARP (5Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Based on this, we anticipated that NHE3 might interact with E3KARP through the second PDZ domain. Studies on protein-protein interaction via PDZ domains showed that distinct PDZ domains interact with specific carboxyl termini with a consensus sequence of E(S/T)X(V/I) (11Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 12Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). However, certain PDZ domains can bind other PDZ domains. For example, the PDZ domain of nNOS can bind to the second PDZ domain of α-syntrophin in skeletal muscle (21Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Interaction of E3KARP with NHE3 represents a new mode of binding for a PDZ domain. In this study, we found that the second PDZ domain was a major constituent in the interaction with the NHE3 C terminus, but the second PDZ domain alone was not sufficient for the interaction. Instead, the P2 domain and the C terminus of E3KARP formed a unit that interacted with NHE3. This is not the first case where a PDZ domain does not work in isolation. In other cases, paired PDZ domains were required for interaction (22Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Band 4.1 binds to the first and second PDZ domains of hDlg, a human homolog of theDrosophila tumor suppressor, as a unit, but not to individual PDZ domains (22Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similarly, binding of syndecan, a major cell-surface heparan sulfate, to the PDZ domain-containing protein syntenin requires two PDZ domains of syntenin (23Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, in this study, the P1–2 domain and also the P1 domain of E3KARP displayed weak binding characteristics that were not observed consistently, and we thus dismissed this as a possible artifact of the in vitroconditions. The interaction of the NHE3 C terminus with E3KARP differs from previously defined cases in that it required the second PDZ domain and a non-PDZ region, the C-terminal portion. Why the second PDZ domain of E3KARP does not work in isolation is not clear. The P2-C domain of E3KARP is shown to interact with an internal domain of NHE3 between aa 585 and 660 of the NHE3 C-terminal tail. Since the relative E3KARP binding to C3-660 was significantly lower than that to C3-711, it is conceivable that the domain between aa 660 and 711 may also take part in binding to E3KARP. Concerning the mapping of the E3KARP-binding domain within the NHE3 C terminus, our analysis was limited to the gel overlay assays since we were not able to express the rabbit NHE3 C-terminal constructs as recombinant proteins. We attempted to express them as MBP, His6-tagged, and glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli, but these were all unsuccessful, resulting in either the formation of inclusion bodies or total absence of expression. Therefore, identification of the exact locations and thus amino acid residues of NHE3 that are involved in the interaction with E3KARP requires further investigation. Regardless, it is noteworthy that deletion of the domain between aa 579 and 684 obliterated the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 (13Cabado A.G., Yu, F.H. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, Kurashima et al. (4Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) identified Ser-605 of rat NHE3 as the sole site of phosphorylation in NHE3 by PKA. However, mutation of Ser-605 (S605A) did not completely abolish the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity, but decreased the extent of the inhibition by ∼50%. In fact, to completely abolish the inhibition of NHE3 by cAMP, simultaneous mutations of Ser-605 and Ser-634 were needed, although Ser-634 is not phosphorylated by PKA. The functional role of Ser-634 remains unknown, but it is enticing to think that Ser-634 may participate in the interaction with the regulatory proteins. Preliminary experiments indicate that NHERF also binds to the same region in NHE3 as E3KARP. 3G. Lamprecht and C.-H. C. Yun, unpublished results. Of note, this is not the only case in which a PDZ domain interacts with an internal domain. For example, the second PDZ domain of the retinal protein Inad binds an internal motif near the C terminus of the transient receptor potential-activated Ca2+ channel (24Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). PDZ domain-containing proteins often function as scaffold proteins, resulting in clustering of proteins that interact with PDZ domains. For example, Shaker subfamily K+ channels and theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in central neurons cluster at specific subcellular sites via interactions with the PDZ domains in the prominent postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 (11Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar,12Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence studies of PS120 fibroblasts revealed that E3KARP is largely distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 7). In addition, there was distinct membrane staining associated with E3KARP. How E3KARP (and NHERF) transduces the cAMP effect on NHE3 is not known. However, it may involve redistribution of E3KARP in response to phosphorylation by PKA. However, we found in this work that distribution of E3KARP was not changed in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP. We also observed that NHERF distribution, which is similar to E3KARP distribution, was not affected by 8-Br-cAMP.3 The lack of redistribution of E3KARP (and NHERF) is perhaps consistent with the fact that the phosphorylation level of neither protein was changed in response to 8-Br-cAMP. 4G. Lamprecht, E. J. Weinman, and C.-H. C. Yun, manuscript in preparation. This study showed that NHE3V and E3KARP are co-localized at the plasma membrane, consistent with the interaction between NHE3V and E3KARPin vivo and the E3KARP-dependent regulation of NHE3 by cAMP. However, the distribution of NHE3V in PS120 fibroblasts is largely distinct from that of E3KARP, with NHE3V localized at perinuclear regions and on the surface membrane. The perinuclear staining is thought to represent NHE3 proteins present in recycling endosomes (18D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.-P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Distribution of NHE3V was not changed by the presence of 8-Br-cAMP or coexpression of E3KARP. These data show that the inhibition of NHE3 in response to an elevated cAMP level may not involve redistribution of either NHE3 or E3KARP within the resolution of confocal microscopy. However, we cannot rule out a small change in E3KARP or NHE3 distribution undetectable by confocal microscopy, and this requires other quantitative analyses. Since PDZ domain-containing proteins function as scaffold proteins, we have recently been contemplating a model in which E3KARP and/or NHERF functions as a scaffold. We examined if E3KARP and NHERF might beAkinase anchoringproteins (AKAPs) (25Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but found that these regulatory proteins are not (26Lamprecht G. Bretscher A. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114 (abstr.): G1593Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recently, NHERF/EBP50 was shown to bind to ezrin and other ezrin-radixin-moesin family proteins (19Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 20Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Since ezrin has been shown to directly bind PKA (27Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the binding of NHERF to ezrin suggested that the NHERF-ezrin complex may be a linker between NHE3 and PKA (19Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 20Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). E3KARP and NHERF share a significant homology, and therefore, we determined if E3KARP is an ezrin-binding protein. Gel overlay study showed that the N-terminal 302 aa of human ezrin bind to both NHERF and E3KARP with comparable affinity. We found that the interaction with ezrin occurs through the C-terminal portion of E3KARP. Our current study further localized the ezrin-binding motif to the C-terminal 23 aa residues (Fig. 8 C). Similarly, a recent report showed that ezrin also binds to the carboxyl-terminal 30 aa of human EBP50 (28Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A search for proteins with a similar motif did not identify proteins other than NHERF and its homologs, suggesting that this domain of E3KARP may represent a unique ezrin-binding motif. The mechanistic nature of the PKA-dependent inhibition of NHE3 is yet to be determined. The current interpretation of data indicates that the increase in phosphorylation of NHE3 is essential for this inhibition (4Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Concurrently, the presence of a regulatory protein, either E3KARP or NHERF, is also necessary. Since ezrin is an AKAP that binds to the regulatory subunit of type II PKA (27Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the binding of ezrin to NHERF suggested a model in which NHERF may scaffold NHE3 and ezrin, which in turn recruit PKA into the vicinity of NHE3, allowing PKA to phosphorylate NHE3. Whether the phosphorylation of NHE3 by PKA and the presence of the regulatory proteins are dependent processes needs further investigation. We are grateful to Dr. Mark Donowitz for helpful discussion and to Dr. Anthony Bretscher for providing the human ezrin cDNA."

We have previously demonstrated that the filamentous actin cross-linking activity of cortactin is attenuated by Src (Huang, C., Ni, Y., Gao, Y., Haudenschild, C. C., and Zhan, X. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13911–13915). In vitro, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs specifically within the region between the proline-rich sequence and the Src homology 3 domain. Among the nine tyrosine residues in this region, mutations at Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482significantly reduced Src-meditated tyrosine phosphorylation bothin vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of wild-type cortactin in ECV304, a spontaneously transformed human umbilical endothelial cell line, resulted in an enhanced cell migration. In contrast, overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation impaired the migration of endothelial cells. These findings reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism whereby the motility of endothelial cells is regulated by a Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Cortactin, a filamentous actin cross-linking protein and a substrate of Src protein tyrosine kinase, is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues upon stimulation by extracellular signals.

Endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, are versatile in morphology and undergo a rapid remodeling during vascularization. Whereas the mechanism for remodeling endothelial cells is not fully understood, the stimulation of the cytoskeletal reorganization that begins underneath the plasma membrane by extracellular signals, especially angiogenic factors, is likely to play an important role in physiological and pathological functions of endothelial cells such as angiogenesis (1Ingber D.E. Prusty D. Sun Z. Betensky H. Wang N. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).In a previous effort to characterize signaling molecules of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1),1 a potent endothelial cell growth factor, we identified a phosphotyrosyl protein as cortactin, a substrate of Src protein tyrosine kinase (2Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1 is elevated during the late G1 phase (4–6 h) in Balb 3T3 fibroblasts. The stimulation with FGF-1 also results in a transient association of Src with cortactin as well as in an association of FGF receptor 1 with Src (3Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation of Src is a mechanism for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1. In addition to FGF-1, various other extracellular stimuli, which often result in a cell motility response, also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. These signals include epidermal growth factor (4Maa M. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin (5Wong S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The protein sequence of cortactin features a unique structure characterized by six and a half 37-amino acid tandem repeats and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Between the SH3 and the repeat domains are an α-helical structure and a sequence rich in proline residues. This structural feature containing a repeat domain and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain resembles neufectin, a F-actin-associated protein (11Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.Q. van Heerden A. Hsu L.C. Gutierrez G. Quian X.L. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, cortactin localizes within F-actin-enriched peripheral structures such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffle (12Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and is found as a potent F-actin-binding proteinin vitro (13Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Whereas these data suggest that cortactin may function as a modulator for the actin cytoskeleton, its biological significance for the cellular response to growth factors and the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in this process remains unclear.In a recent study, we described that cortactin acts as a F-actin cross-linker. Importantly, the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin is attenuated in vitro upon tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src (14Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterize the tyrosine residues targeted by Src and demonstrate that these residues are important for the Src-mediated attenuation of the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin. In addition, we examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin within endothelial cells by analyzing endothelial cell transfectants expressing a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation. We show here that overexpression of wild-type cortactin results in a significant increase in endothelial cell migration. In contrast, expression of the cortactin mutant impairs cell migration. Our data provide evidence for the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the migration of endothelial cell.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMurine cortactin contains a total of 27 tyrosine residues that localize mostly in the six repeats and the region between the repeat and the SH3 domains. To obtain a location of tyrosine residues targeted by Src, we initially analyzed several cortactin deletion and truncation mutants in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, mutants CortΔD375–546and Cort82–325 could not be phosphorylated by Src in vitro. However, cortactin fragment Cort323–496, which contains the region between the repeat and the SH3 domains, and deletion mutant CortΔD496–546, which lacks the SH3 domain, were efficiently phosphorylated by Src exclusively at tyrosine residues, as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1). Whereas the SH3 domain also contains two tyrosine residues, a peptide fragment containing the SH3 domain alone is unable to be phosphorylated by Src (data not shown). Therefore, these data indicate that tyrosine residues located between the repeat and the SH3 domains are responsible for the Src-mediated phosphorylation.The exact residues targeted by Src were determined by site-directed mutagenesis at the nine tyrosine residues located between the repeat and the SH3 domains (Fig. 2 A). Whereas substitution of tyrosine with phenylalanine at Tyr334, Tyr433, Tyr442, Tyr460, and Tyr475 did not significantly impair the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown), mutations at single amino acids Tyr421 or Tyr466 reduced the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation by 40 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 2 B). However, a mutant at both Tyr421and Tyr466 did not totally abolish the response to Src, with the remaining levels of tyrosine phosphorylation about 50% of that of wild-type cortactin (Fig. 2 B). This indicated the presence of additional tyrosine residue(s) that can be phosphorylated by Src. Indeed, a mutant at Tyr466 and Tyr482 showed only 33% tyrosine phosphorylation levels of wild-type cortactin (data not shown). A mutant with triple mutations at Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482 had a poorer response to Src compared with wild-type cortactin (14%), whereas the mutant at Tyr421, Tyr466, Tyr482, and Tyr485 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation slightly further (Fig. 2 B). To further verify those phosphotyrosine residues, phosphorylated wild-type cortactin and mutants by Src were subjected to phosphopeptide analysis by proteolysis with V8 Glu-C endoproteinase followed by fractionation with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a total of three phosphopeptide-containing elutes were detected from wild-type cortactin, whereas less phosphopeptide elutes were found from mutants. Mutant CortF421 generated two phosphopeptide elutes, mutant CortF421F466 generated only one phosphopeptide elute, and mutant CortF421F466F482 did not generate any apparent elute containing phosphopeptides.Figure 2Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation sites of cortactin. A, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the region between the repeat and the SH3 domains is shown. Each tyrosine residue within the region is indicated with a number according to its position in the original amino acid sequence. B, tyrosine phosphorylation analysis of cortactin mutants. The purified cortactin and its mutants were phosphorylated with recombinant Src in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The relative amounts of protein were measured by densitometry analysis. The tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The gel fragments corresponding to cortactin and its mutants were excised, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity of each sample was plotted data versus the amounts of protein based on three independent experiments.C, phosphopeptide analysis of cortactin mutants. Cortactin and its mutants were phosphorylated, digested, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactivity of elutes from high-performance liquid chromatography was recorded and plotted against the elution time. D, immunoblotting analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of myc-cortactin mutants transiently transfected in 3T3/v-Src cells. 3T3/v-Src cells were transiently transfected with myc-cortactin and its mutants. The transfectants were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody 9E10. The immunoprecipitates were separated from 9E10 antibody and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-cortactin C001-conjugated beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The precipitates were finally analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (top panel) and with cortactin monoclonal antibody 4F11 (bottom panel). The upper bands of about 90 kDa represent ectopic myc-cortactin proteins. The lower bands of 85 kDa represent the contaminated endogenous cortactin. The protein loading in lanes 2 and 6 was about one-third that of the rest of the samples in an attempt to normalize myc-cortactin levels. Lane 1, mock transfectant; lane 2, myc-cortactin transfectants; lane 3, myc-CortF421 transfectants; lane 4, myc-CortF421F466 transfectants; lanes 5 and 6, myc-CortF421F482 transfectants; lane 7, myc-CortF421F466F482 transfectants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482 can be also targeted by Src in vivo, the corresponding mutants were tagged by a myc epitope (19Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar) in pMEXneo, a mammalian expression vector (20Martin-Zanca D. Mitra G. Long L.K. Barbacid M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 983-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transfected into 3T3/v-Src. The lysates from the resulting transient transfectants were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis using monoclonal 4G10 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the myc-tagged wild-type cortactin (myc-cortactin), shown as a 90-kDa band, was efficiently phosphorylated. In contrast, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of myc-CortF421 and myc-CortF421F482 mutants were dramatically reduced, and no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with myc-CortF421F466and myc-CortF421F466F482 mutants. The assay also displayed a band of 85 kDa, which was likely due to contamination from the endogenous cortactin during the purification procedure, as indicated by its co-migration with the cortactin band shown in the control sample (Fig. 2 D, lane 1). These results indicate that Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482 are the major sites phosphorylated by Src both in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, there are several acidic residues in the proximity of these residues that agree with the consensus sequences ((I/V)YEE) for Src-related tyrosine kinases (21Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all of these three sites are conserved among chicken, mouse, and human. It is noteworthy that Tyr421 matches the consensus sequence (Tyr + two acidic amino acids) for the association with SH2 domains of Src tyrosine kinases (22Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and may be responsible for its interaction with Src upon phosphorylation (3Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our previous study has demonstrated that Src inhibits the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin in vitro (14Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To verify that this inhibition requires phosphorylation of these characterized tyrosine residues, we examined the effects of Src on the F-actin cross-linking activities of various mutants with substitution at those tyrosine residues. The inhibitory activity of Src on the mutants apparently depended on the numbers of tyrosine residues in the region between the repeat and the SH3 domains (Fig. 3). Whereas Src was able to inhibit the cross-linking activity of wild-type cortactin by 80%, as reported previously (14Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), it only inhibited CortF421F466F482 and CortF421F466F482F485 mutants by 36 and 18%, respectively. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues is necessary for the Src-mediated attenuation of the activity of cortactin. Furthermore, the result confirms our previous conclusion that it is tyrosine phosphorylation that is responsible for the inhibition of the F-actin cross-linking activity (14Huang C. Ni Y. Gao Y. Wang T. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Figure 3Inhibition of F-actin cross-linking activity requires the presence of tyrosine residues targeted by Src.Purified recombinant cortactin and its mutants (3 μg) were incubated with or without recombinant Src (250 nm) in kinase buffer for 1 h. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed for the association with pyrene-labeled F-actin. The F-actin cross-linking activity was determined by co-sedimentation analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the F-actin cross-linking activity (efficiency of sedimentation) was plotted for each mutant. The data represent three independent experiments. B, the relative inhibitory activity of Src on each cortactin mutant.

Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Several stable transfectants were isolated. The expression of myc-cortactin proteins in the resulting stable transfectants was verified by immunoblotting analysis, and a typical result is shown in Fig. 5 A. The slightly lower molecular weight of CortF421F466F482 mutant (lane 1) as compared with that of myc-cortactin (lane 2) was expected because of the change from tyrosine to phenylalanine. The subcellular distribution of cortactin derivatives in the transfectants was examined by immunofluorescent staining using the polyclonal cortactin antibody C001, which specifically recognizes the murine cortactin, as demonstrated by its exclusive staining of transfected cells in a transient transfection assay (Fig. 4,a and b). Both wild-type (Fig. 4 c) and mutant proteins (Fig. 4 e) are found within the cytoplasm and perinuclear area in a pattern similar to that of the endogenous cortactin of Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 4 g). In addition, both proteins co-localize with F-actin along the cell periphery, showing punctate patterns (Fig. 4, d and f). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is required neither for the distribution of cortactin into membrane structures nor for F-actin association. However, the overall morphology of cells expressing wild-type cortactin is different from that of cells expressing the mutant. Cells expressing myc-cortactin tend to be spindle-shaped and have elongated membrane protrusions at the edge of the cell (Fig. 4, c and d). In contrast, the cells expressing the mutant have a more circular shape and display visible stress fibers within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, e and f).Figure 5The effect of myc-cortactin and myc-CortF421F466F482 on the migration of ECV304 cells.

Fu C. Bhattacharya J. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16781-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report also described a correlation of the impairment of FGF-1-induced migratory response in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells with the inert Src tyrosine kinase and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (25Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that ectopic expression of cortactin mutants may affect the locomotion of endothelial cells. The motility of ECV304 transfectants was evaluated using a wound healing assay. Within 20 h, ECV304 cells overexpressing myc-cortactin healed nearly 100% of a wound of 0.75 mm (Fig. 5 B, b). In contrast, cells expressing the mutant filled less than 50% of the wound, and nontransfected cells filled nearly 60% of the wound. The difference in the motility of these cells was more apparent when the assay was performed on a larger wound of 2 mm. In this case, cells expressing the mutant showed much less migration into the wound compared with that of either wild-type transfectants or control cells, even after 4 days (Fig. 5 C). Inhibition of cell migration by overexpression of the mutant CortF421F466F482 indicates that the mutant acts in a dominant negative manner. Indeed, the inhibitory activity is also correlated with the levels of expression of the mutant, because transfectants expressing lower levels of the mutant protein did not show significant deficiency in cell migration (data not shown).The differential motility exhibited by ECV304 cells overexpressing the wild-type cortactin and its mutant is not likely to be due to their effects on cell proliferation because neither of the transfectants showed altered growth rates compared with that of control cells (data not shown). Because cortactin does not affect the formation of actin filaments in vitro, 2C. Huang, unpublished observations. it is unlikely that the regulation of actin assembly is the direct cause for the observed increase in cell motility manifested by the overexpression of myc-cortactin. On the other hand, the dominant negative cortactin mutant that lacks tyrosine phosphorylation sites is unable to be phosphorylated by Src, which attenuates the F-actin cross-linking activity of wild-type cortactin. Thus, we propose that endothelial cell motility can be either up- or down-regulated by a novel mechanism that alters the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin through Src-mediated phosphorylation.Tyrosine phosphorylation that occurs with the region between the repeat and the SH3 domain seems to be conservative in the cortactin family. It has been reported that HS1, a protein closely related to cortactin that is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells (26Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar), utilizes the same domain as the target for Src-related protein tyrosine kinases (27Brunati A.M. Ruzzene M. James P. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,28Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the counterpart of HS1 is important for B-cell antigen receptor-mediated apoptosis and its nuclear localization (28Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr378 and Tyr397 of HS1 involves a sequential phosphorylation event, initially requiring Syk and later requiring Lyn or Fgr (29Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas the association of cortactin with Syk in phorbol ester-stimulated K562 leukemic cells has been described previously (30Maruyama S. Kurosaki T. Sada K. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6631-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cortactin is expressed mainly in adherent cells (31Zhan X. Haudenschild C.C. Ni Y. Smith E. Huang C. Blood. 1997; 89: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where Syk is less abundant. Therefore, it is less likely that Syk is the primary kinase for cortactin in endothelial cells. However, it is still of interest to determine whether cortactin also undergoes a similar sequential phosphorylation by other intracellular kinases that function in concert with Src. In addition, the existence of three primary sites for tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that there may be also cooperative interactions among these residues. Endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, are versatile in morphology and undergo a rapid remodeling during vascularization. Whereas the mechanism for remodeling endothelial cells is not fully understood, the stimulation of the cytoskeletal reorganization that begins underneath the plasma membrane by extracellular signals, especially angiogenic factors, is likely to play an important role in physiological and pathological functions of endothelial cells such as angiogenesis (1Ingber D.E. Prusty D. Sun Z. Betensky H. Wang N. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In a previous effort to characterize signaling molecules of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1),1 a potent endothelial cell growth factor, we identified a phosphotyrosyl protein as cortactin, a substrate of Src protein tyrosine kinase (2Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1 is elevated during the late G1 phase (4–6 h) in Balb 3T3 fibroblasts. The stimulation with FGF-1 also results in a transient association of Src with cortactin as well as in an association of FGF receptor 1 with Src (3Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation of Src is a mechanism for the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin induced by FGF-1. In addition to FGF-1, various other extracellular stimuli, which often result in a cell motility response, also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. These signals include epidermal growth factor (4Maa M. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin (5Wong S.

https://openalex.org/W2142700343,"We have investigated the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) by ubiquinone analogues. We found that the Ca2+-dependent PTP opening was inhibited by ubiquinone 0 and decylubiquinone, whereas all other tested quinones (ubiquinone 5, 1,4-benzoquinone, 2-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone, and 2,3-dimethoxy-5,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone) were ineffective. Pore inhibition was observed irrespective of the method used to induce the permeability transition (addition of Pi or atractylate, membrane depolarization, or dithiol cross-linking). Inhibition of PTP opening by decylubiquinone was comparable with that exerted by cyclosporin A, whereas ubiquinone 0 was more potent. Ubiquinone 5, which did not inhibit the PTP per se, specifically counteracted the inhibitory effect of ubiquinone 0 or decylubiquinone but not that of cyclosporin A. These findings define a ubiquinone-binding site directly involved in PTP regulation and indicate that different quinone structural features are required for binding and for stabilizing the pore in the closed conformation. At variance from all other quinones tested, decylubiquinone did not inhibit respiration. Our results define a new structural class of pore inhibitors and may open new perspectives for the pharmacological modulation of the PTP in vivo."

Using Tβ4 as an indicator of the concentration of ATP-G-actin, we show that ADF increases the concentration of ATP-G-actin at steady state. The measured higher concentration of ATP-G-actin is quantitatively consistent with the increase in treadmilling, caused by the large increase in the rate of depolymerization from the pointed ends induced by ADF (Carlier, M.-F., Laurent, V., Santolini, J., Didry, D., Melki, R., Xia, G.-X., Hong, Y., Chua, N.-H., and Pantaloni, D. (1997)J. Cell Biol. 136, 1307–1322). Experiments demonstrate that profilin synergizes with ADF to further enhance the turnover of actin filaments up to a value 125-fold higher than in pure F-actin solutions. Profilin and ADF act at the two ends of filaments in a complementary fashion to increase the processivity of treadmilling. Using the capping protein CapZ, we show that ADF increases the number of filaments at steady state by 1.3-fold, which cannot account for the 25-fold increase in turnover rate. Computer modeling of the combined actions of ADF and profilin on the dynamics of actin filaments using experimentally determined rate constants generates a distribution of the different actin species at steady state, which is in quantitative agreement with the data. The mechanism of control of the steady state of actin assembly by actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin and profilin has been investigated.

Profilin and actin depolymerizing factor (ADF1/cofilin) are essential actin-binding proteins that play a key role in the control of actin dynamics and actin-based motility processes. These two proteins fulfill their functions by interacting with actin in different ways. Profilin binds ATP-G-actin specifically. Although profilin does not bind F-actin, the profilin-ATP-G-actin complex contributes to filament assembly, at the barbed end exclusively (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 2Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Pantaloni D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When filaments are assembled at steady state in the presence of profilin, ATP-G-actin and profilin-ATP-G-actin can both be considered as polymerizable actin monomers undergoing monomer-polymer exchange at the barbed ends, therefore profilin lowers the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin (3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). When all barbed ends are blocked by capping proteins, profilin only sequesters G-actin. ADF/cofilin, on the other hand, specifically recognizes the ADP-bound form of both G- and F-actin. Hence, ADF too participates in filament assembly, but in a manner different from profilin; ADF-bound F-actin dissociates much faster than F-actin from the pointed ends of actin filaments, which results in a large enhancement of filament treadmilling (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Actin-based motility of Listeria monocytogenes in the cytoplasm of infected cells, or the forward movement of the leading edge, which are supported by the treadmilling of actin filaments, are therefore enhanced by ADF (6Carlier M.-F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The effect of ADF on filament turnover is accompanied by the partial depolymerization of F-actin. The mechanistic Scheme I (see Fig. 1), which was proposed (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) to account for the effects of ADF on actin dynamics, implies the following. First, the steady-state pool of unassembled actin consists of ADP-G-actin and ATP-G-actin both in the free and ADF-bound states. Since ADF has a 100-fold higher affinity for ADP-G-actin than for ATP-G-actin under physiological ionic conditions (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 7Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), a large proportion of ADP-G-actin is thought to be in complex with ADF, while ATP-G-actin is thought to be essentially free. Next, ADF is in rapid equilibrium with G-actin (7Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), so that nucleotide exchange, which is strongly inhibited on ADF-ADP-G-actin complex, occurs on free ADP-G-actin so as to regenerate ATP-G-actin which polymerizes better than ADP-G-actin. Finally, the establishment of a faster treadmilling by ADF implies that the steady-state concentrations of ADP-G-actin and ATP-G-actin increase until the fluxes of nucleotide exchange and polymerization onto barbed ends become equal to the large dissociation flux of ADF-ADP-actin from the pointed ends. To assess the validity of Scheme I (shown in Fig. 1) and to model the effects of ADF on actin dynamics, it is necessary to elaborate methods allowing to measure the concentrations of the different G-actin species at steady state in the presence of ADF. In particular, the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin, [GT], is an important parameter, since it directly controls the treadmilling flux,i.e. the rate of subunit addition to barbed ends at steady state, which equalsk +B·[B]·([GT] − CCB), wherek+ B is the rate constant for association of ATP-G-actin to barbed ends, [B] is the concentration of non-capped barbed ends, and CCB is the critical concentration for actin assembly at the barbed ends. Once the steady-state parameters for actin assembly in the presence of ADF alone are known, the complexity of the system can be increased by adding profilin in addition to ADF, and using the same methods, to determine how the dynamics of actin filaments are affected by the presence of the two proteins, and discover which new regulatory properties arise from the cumulated effects of the two proteins. The present work focuses on the above issues. We show that ADF causes a 3-fold increase in the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin, which accounts for the enhancement of treadmilling within Scheme I (see Fig. 1). We find that profilin synergizes with ADF to increase the turnover of filaments. In the presence of both ADF and profilin, the rate of treadmilling is increased 125-fold. The ADF and profilin dependence values of the rate of treadmilling are quantitatively reproduced by computer modeling of Scheme II (shown in Fig. 9), using the experimental values (4Perelroizen I.

Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the following values of the extinction coefficients: ε2900.1% = 0.617 cm−1for actin; ε277 = 0.015 μm−1.cm−1 for profilin; ε2770.1% = 0.89 cm−1 for ADF1, ε2770.1% = 0.64 cm−1 for human ADF. The concentration of Tβ4was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of unassembled actin was determined by a sedimentation assay. Actin was polymerized at pH 7.5 in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 m KCl, and supplemented with ADF, profilin, or Tβ4 as indicated. Samples containing no ADF were centrifuged at 400,000 ×g, 20 °C, for 30 min, after a 16-h incubation. Samples containing ADF were centrifuged similarly except within 15–30 min following addition of ADF, since the steady state is reached rapidly in the presence of ADF and the consumption of ATP is high (5Carlier M.-F.

It was verified that results identical to those presented here were obtained in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (5 mm creatine phosphate, creatine kinase). The concentration of unassembled actin in the supernatants was determined by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels of electrophoresed samples (Arcus II, Agfa Corp., Orangeburg, NY) and comparing to actin standards electrophoresed on the same gel. The NIH Image analysis program was used. Alternatively, the concentration of unassembled actin was determined using NBD-labeled actin and reading the fluorescence of NBD-G-actin in the supernatant and comparing with standards. This method can be used even in the presence of ADF, because once separated from F-actin by sedimentation, unassembled actin is essentially ATP-G-actin, which has a low affinity for ADF. Therefore, the possibility of quenching of NBD-G-actin fluorescence by ADF (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J.

First, measurement of the rate of ATP hydrolysis that accompanies the association of ATP-G-actin subunits to the barbed ends at steady state yields the treadmilling rate. G-actin (15 μm) was equilibrated in G buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and polymerized. When steady state was reached, the solution was split into several samples supplemented with the desired concentrations of ADF and profilin. The steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured by removing 50-μl aliquots from the solution at intervals, for periods of up to 6 h, quenching the reaction in 10 mmmolybdate, 1 n HCl and processing for extraction of the γ-32P-labeled phosphomolybdate complex (5Carlier M.-F.

Second, the turnover of filaments was estimated by measuring the rate at which fluorescently labeled ε-ADP-F-actin filaments assembled from ε-ATP-G-actin subunits became non-fluorescent ADP-F-actin filaments following addition of ATP in the medium, via the consecutive steps of dissociation of ε-ADP-actin from the pointed end, exchange of ATP for bound ε-ADP on G-actin in the medium (the fluorescence of ε-ADP is 5-fold lower in the free than in the actin-bound state), and association of ATP-G-actin to barbed ends. The experiments were carried out at a concentration of 15 μm ε-ADP-F-actin polymerized under physiological ionic conditions in the presence of 50 μm ε-ATP, and supplemented with ADF and/or profilin, as indicated, 10 min before the addition of 0.5 mm ATP in the medium. The fluorescence of ε-ADP was monitored at 20 °C in a Spex spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 410 nm, respectively. The property of CapZ to cap the barbed ends with a 1010m−1 affinity (11Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) was used to count the number of filaments in an F-actin solution, using immunodetection of CapZ in the pellets of sedimented F-actin. Mg-ATP-actin (25 μm) was polymerized to steady state at pH 8.0 in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1m KCl. The solution was split in two samples, one of which was supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 50 nm gelsolin. The drop in viscosity due to the severing activity of gelsolin was checked to occur. When steady state was reached (30–60 min following the onset of polymerization), CapZ (25 to 50 nm) was added to the two F-actin samples. Gentle mixing was provided by either overturning the tubes or slowly pipetting the samples using the truncated tip of a 1000-μl Eppendorf pipette. The two F-actin solutions were then split into several samples containing or not Arabidopsis or human ADF (10 μm). 15 min later, the samples (400 μl) were centrifuged at 400,000 ×g for 40 min at 20 °C in a Beckman TL 100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were removed, the walls of the tubes were thoroughly washed with G-buffer and the pellets of F-actin were resuspended in 80–120 μl of SDS-containing denaturing buffer, boiled and submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting using the 5B12 anti-CapZ mouse monoclonal antibody (11Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) raised against the α subunit of muscle CapZ (this antibody recognizes both α1 and α2 isoforms of CapZ). A horseradish peroxidase-derivatized anti-mouse IgG raised in sheep was used as a second antibody. The amount of CapZ bound to F-actin in each sample was derived from the ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chemiluminescence detection patterns of CapZ, with quantitative comparison with standards of pure CapZ in the appropriate concentration range. The concentrations of the different G-actin species coexisting with actin filaments at steady state in the presence of ADF and profilin can be determined by computer modeling of the establishment of steady state through the following set of kinetic steps, which describe Scheme I. ADF and profilin are considered in rapid equilibrium binding with ATP-G-actin and ADP-G-actin. The concentration of barbed ends, Fb, is constant and is not affected by ADF or profilin. On the other hand, pointed ends can be unliganded (Fp) or ADF-bound (Fp-ADF), with different dissociation rate constants and Fp + Fp-ADF = Fb = constant. The concentrations of total actin (polymerized and non-polymerized) and of free ADF were initially set. The total concentration of ADF at steady state was derived as the sum of the concentrations of free and ADF-bound species. The concentration of polymerized actin was derived as the difference between total actin and the sum of all forms of G-actin at steady state. The molar fraction of ADF-bound F-actin was equal to the fraction of ADF-bound pointed ends, [Fp-ADF]/([Fp] + [Fp-ADF]).The following set of rapid equilibria and kinetic steps were used in the modeling, where T, D, and P represent ATP-G-actin, ADP-G-actin, and profilin, respectively.

Hence, for simplicity, the interaction of D with barbed ends could be omitted because D polymerizes with the same critical concentration at the two ends. Similarly, the interaction of T with pointed ends could be omitted because essentially the barbed ends contribute to the steady-state value of T. The simulated curves (Fig. 10) have been checked not to be significantly different when those reactions were omitted. However, the effect of profilin is accounted for in a more realistic fashion by considering the latter reaction. It has been established that the addition of ADF to an F-actin solution results in binding of ADF to F-actin, followed by partial depolymerization of F-actin (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J.

The steady-state concentration of unassembled actin varies between 0.5 and 2.5 μm (for Arabidopsis ADF1) and between 1 and 6 μm (for human ADF) as pH is increased from 6.8 to 8.2 (7Ressad F. Didry D.

To quantitate the concentration of ATP-G-actin, which actively participates in barbed end growth at steady state, use was made of thymosin β4 as a G-actin sequestering protein that selectively binds ATP-G-actin (13Carlier M.-F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of Tβ4 to F-actin results in depolymerization of F-actin as the Tβ4-ATP-G-actin (TA) complex is formed. The increase in [TA] was quantitated by analysis of the gel patterns of unassembled actin present in the supernatants of sedimented samples of F-actin assembled in the presence of ADF and Tβ4 (see “Materials and Methods”). The concentration of TA is determined by the concentration of ATP-G-actin, as described by the following equation. [TA]=[T]tot·[GT]([GT]+KT)(Eq. 1) [T]tot is the total concentration of Tβ4, K T is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding Tβ4 to ATP-G-actin and [GT] is the steady-state concentration of ATP-G-actin. According to Equation 1, [TA] increases linearly with [T]tot. The value of [GT] at a given concentration of ADF is derived from the slope of the plot of [TA]versus [T]tot, as described by Equation 2below. [GT]=KT·m1−m(Eq. 2) In the absence of ADF, the value of the slope wasm 0 and the value of [GT], [GT0], was derived from the conventional pyrenyl-actin fluorescence critical concentration plots carried out in parallel using the same actin solution. Equation 2 then can be rewritten as follows. [GT]=[GT0]·1−m0m0·m(1−m)(Eq. 3) Data displayed in Fig. 2 Ashow that upon increasing ADF concentration, the slope m of the plot of [TA] versus [T]tot increased, consistent with an increase in [GT] from 0.12 μm in the absence of ADF to a maximum of 0.27 to 0.35 μm. The increase was followed by a decrease at higher ADF concentrations. Similar results were obtained with ArabidopsisADF1 and human ADF. The bell-shaped curve representing the change in [GT] versus ADF concentration (Fig. 2 B) was strikingly similar to the curve representing the change in treadmilling rate (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), as expected within Scheme I. Identical results (within 10%) were obtained when the concentration of unassembled actin in the supernatants was derived from fluorescence measurements of NBD-labeled actin (see “Materials and Methods”). In conclusion, the enhancement of the treadmilling cycle of F-actin by ADF is linked to an increase in both pools of ADP-G-actin and of ATP-G-actin. At pH 7.5, in the presence of ADF1, the total amount of unassembled actin is 1.7 μm (5Carlier M.-F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Didry D. Melki R. Xia G.-X. Hong Y. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), among which 0.27 μm is ATP-G-actin. Given the very high affinity (12.5 μm−1) of ADF for ADP-G-actin (5Carlier M.-F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), most of the remaining 1.4 μm G-actin consists of ADF-ADP-G-actin. The rate of treadmilling,k +B([GT] − CCB), increases from a value of k +B(0.12 − CCB) in the absence of ADF to a maximum value of k +B(0.3 − CCB) in the presence of ADF, where CCB is the critical concentration for actin assem"

The major components of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 brain are Aβ peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, that are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is metabolized at or near the cell surface by an α-secretase that results in soluble APP (APPsα) secretion and precludes Aβ formation. APP is also metabolized by an endosomal/lysosomal (endocytic) pathway that results in Aβ secretion (1Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Newly translocated proteins are folded and assembled by a group of proteins, which include immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), glucose-regulated protein, 94 kDa (GRP94), peptidyl prolyl isomerase, calnexin, and protein disulfide isomerase. Paramount among these ER residents is the highly conserved ATP-binding protein GRP78, which associates transiently with many polypeptides and more stably with misfolded or incompletely assembled proteins (18Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Association with GRP78 is hypothesized to prevent misfolding and aggregation of nascent polypeptides during synthesis and assembly in the ER. Misfolded proteins in the ER remain bound to GRP78 and are destined for degradation. In mammalian cells, GRP78 is detected noncovalently bound to a variety of proteins, including immunoglobulin heavy chain, nicotinic receptor, HIV-1 envelope protein, T cell receptor α chain variants, influenza hemagglutinin, and type I procollagen proα chain (for reviews, see Refs. 19Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar and 20Haas I.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This wide variety of substrates of GRP78 suggests that the correct folding of APP may also require transient binding to GRP78 in the ER.As is true for all Hsp70 proteins, the amino-terminal two-thirds of GRP78 comprise an ATP binding domain, and the carboxyl-terminal third contains a peptide binding domain. GRP78 binds ATP and has weak ATPase activity. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of this domain led to the development of mutants such as GRP78 T37G with impaired ATP-induced release of bound protein (21Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wei J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26677-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This ATPase mutant also blocks assembly and folding of immunoglobulin heavy chains (23Hendershot L. Wei J. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus the GRP78 T37G mutant functions as a molecular trap by stabilizing the normally transient interaction of newly synthesized polypeptide with GRP78. ATPase-defective GRP78 does not bind to and retard all secreted proteins. For example, Factor VIII secretion is reduced by ATPase-defective GRP78 co-expression, but monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor is not (24Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that: 1) GRP78 binds to APP in the ER, 2) this interaction has functional consequences on APP metabolism, and 3) the transient interaction of GRP78 with APP may be captured by co-expression with GRP78 T37G.RESULTSTo determine whether GRP78 was capable of binding to APP within the ER, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with APP and either empty vector (pcDNA3), GRP78, or GRP78 T37G. Processing of the Swedish mutant APP (APP Swe; K670N/M671L) in HEK 293 cells results in elevated levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared with wild type APP (27Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 28Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Therefore, similar co-transfections were also performed with APP Swe and GRP78. Following the co-transfections, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and subsequently, proteins from cell lysates or conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated with the anti-APP antiserum Karen (Fig. 1, A and C) or anti-GRP78 (Fig. 1 B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both mature (top band) and immature (indicated by arrow) forms of APP and APP Swe were detected in the lysates of transfected 293 cells (Fig. 1 A). When APP or APP Swe were immunoprecipitated with anti-APP antibody, an additional 78-kDa protein was faintly detected in samples co-transfected with GRP78 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). This 78-kDa protein was not detected in co-transfections of APP or APP Swe with empty vector (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 4, respectively). As predicted, when the ATPase-defective mutant, GRP78 T37G, was co-transfected with either APP or APP Swe, a much greater amount of the 78-kDa protein co-precipitated from cell lysates with anti-APP antibody (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). Additionally, a decrease in the amount of mature APP and APP Swe was consistently detected in lysates of cells co-transfected with GRP78 T37G.We next sought to determine which forms (mature and/or immature) of APP and APP Swe were bound by BiP. Therefore, the same experiment as above was performed, but lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GRP78. A small but reproducible amount of 95-kDa APP or APP Swe co-transfected with GRP78 was precipitated by anti-GRP78 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 5). Again, this transient interaction was stabilized by co-transfection of APP or APP Swe (lanes 3and 6) with GRP78 T37G. A single protein corresponding in molecular weight to immature APP or APP Swe was detected. No larger molecular weight protein equivalent to mature APP was detected in these lanes, suggesting that GRP78 and GRP78 T37G bound only to immature APP.We hypothesized that the association of APP with GRP78 in the ER may impede the secretion of APPs into conditioned medium. To test this hypothesis, radiolabeled APPs in conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated with Karen antibody (Fig. 1 C). A moderate but reproducible decrease in APPs was detected in the media of cells co-transfected with GRP78 (lanes 2 and 5) compared with empty vector (lanes 1 and 4). A more significant reduction of APPs recovery was observed for cells co-transfected with GRP78 T37G and either APP or APP Swe (lanes 3 and 6).The radiolabeled protein migrating above immature APP (Fig. 1 A) may be either mature, fully glycosylated APP, or an unrelated co-precipitating protein. To distinguish between these possibilities, similar experiments were conducted and proteins in conditioned medium or cell lysates detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot (Fig. 2). The larger molecular weight protein above immature APP was recognized by the mouse monoclonal anti-APP antibody (22C11), verifying that it is mature, glycosylated APP (labeled M, Fig. 2 A). Co-transfection of APP or APP Swe with GRP78 or GRP78 T37G impaired APP maturation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). In addition, transfection with GRP78 T37G consistently resulted in accumulation of immature endogenously expressed APP in cell lysates (labeled I, Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Recovery of APPs in conditioned medium was reduced by co-transfection with GRP78, and this inhibitory effect was more pronounced with the GRP78 T37G mutation (Fig. 2 C), despite equivalent levels of GRP78 or GRP78 T37G expression (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2GRP78 and GRP78 T37G retard APP maturation and inhibit APPs secretion. Cells were transiently transfected with the constructs indicated. GRP78 in cell lysates was detected by immunoblot with anti-GRP78 (B). APP in cell lysates and APPs in conditioned medium were detected by immunoprecipitation with Karen followed by immunoblot with 22C11 (A and C). Immature APP is indicated by I and mature glycosylated APP by M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next hypothesized that the binding and retention of APP in the ER by GRP78 would modulate Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. HEK 293 cells were transfected with vector (pRK5), APP, or APP Swe in the absence or presence of vector (pcDNA3), GRP78, or GRP78 T37G. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured by ELISA (Fig. 3). Transfection with APP resulted in measurable and reproducible levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in conditioned medium. Analogous to results with APPs (Figs. 1 C and 2 C), the secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were reduced by co-transfection of APP with GRP78 and more strongly diminished with GRP78 T37G. The levels of total APP expression from all these cell lysates were equivalent (not shown). Thus, the decreases in secreted Aβ peptides appear due to an effect of GRP78 on the catabolism of APP and not on APP synthesis. This conclusion is further supported by transfections with APP Swe, which results in greater concentrations of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared with normal APP (27Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 28Cai X.-D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with APP Swe, the inhibitory effects of GRP78 and GRP78 T37G on Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion were magnified.Figure 3GRP78 and GRP78 T37G inhibit Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. After transient transfection with the indicated constructs, concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in conditioned medium were determined by ELISA.

Specifically, the maturation of cellular APP was impaired, and APPs, Aβ40, and Aβ42 recovery in conditioned medium was reduced. The binding of GRP78 to proteins is ordinarily transient and may be difficult to detect. Thus, co-precipitation and functional effects obtained with GRP78 and APP were magnified by the GRP78 T37G ATPase mutation, which fails to release transiently bound protein, and by the APP Swe mutation that results in greater Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. The APP detected bound to GRP78 was of a single molecular weight corresponding to the immature form. The mature or intermediate forms of APP did not co-precipitate even with the mutant GRP78 T37G. Thus, the transfected APP bound to BiP was not saturating the system retaining it in the ER. These results also suggest that the membrane-spanning APP is normally transiently bound to and retained in the ER as a nascent polypeptide by the chaperone GRP78. GRP78 may subsequently interact with the KDEL receptor causing a net retention of the GRP78·APP complex in the ER lumen. Alternatively, because GRP78 binding impedes APP maturation in the ER, it may be retained via interaction with other chaperones such as calnexin (for review, see Ref. 29Helenius A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Future experiments will distinguish between these possibilities.Levels of APPs, Aβ40, and Aβ42 secretion were reduced by interaction of APP with GRP78. This transient interaction may impair access of APP to β-/γ-secretases within the ER/Golgi or may influence APP metabolism by facilitating its correct folding. Because secreted Aβ42 is generated primarily in the ER, these data suggest that GRP78 binding to APP may directly or indirectly confer protection from β-/γ-secretases within this cell compartment. One may speculate that immediate processing of nascent APP is exclusive to misfolded APP. However, the possibility remains that less Aβ42 is secreted, because it is bound to GRP78 or other proteins in the ER, such as ERAB (endoplasmic reticulum-associated binding protein) (30Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,31He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to Aβ42, secreted Aβ40 is derived primarily from a post-Golgi compartment. The decrease observed in APPs and Aβ40 secretion may, therefore, result from APP retention in the ER and thus substrate depletion. HEK 293 cells stably expressing APP V717G produce intracellular Aβ42 even in the presence of brefeldin A (32Wild-bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16085-16088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), suggesting that APP cleavage occurs in the ER or cis Golgi of these non-neuronal cells. The effects of GRP78 co-expression with APP V717G or other carboxyl-terminal APP mutations found in some pedigrees of familial AD on its metabolism are as yet unknown.Because amyloid in the aged or AD brain is thought to be generated primarily by neurons, and metabolism of APP is more amyloidogenic in neuronal than in non-neuronal cells, it will be of interest to examine the effects of GRP78 overexpression on APP metabolism in a neuronal cell line. Furthermore, intracellular Aβ is more readily detectable in neuronal cells (4Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8091-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As described above for HEK 293 cells, intracellular Aβ42 is detected in NT2 neurons even in the presence of brefeldin A, suggesting that Aβ42 is generated in the ER or intermediate compartment (6Chyung A.S.C.

Lee V.M.-Y. Doms R.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Some intracellular Aβ42 exists in a detergent-insoluble form and thus is detected by ELISA only after formic acid extraction, suggesting Aβ42 aggregates intracellularly (11Scovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 14: 1031-1039Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, in view of recent hypotheses concerning a seminal role for Aβ42 generation and aggregation in the ER in AD pathogenesis, GRP78 binding to APP in neurons may have even greater functional consequences than in non-neuronal cells. The major components of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 brain are Aβ peptides, including Aβ40 and Aβ42, that are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is metabolized at or near the cell surface by an α-secretase that results in soluble APP (APPsα) secretion and precludes Aβ formation. APP is also metabolized by an endosomal/lysosomal (endocytic) pathway that results in Aβ secretion (1Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 2Selkoe D.J. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Hardy J. Proc.

Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, a β-/γ-secretase pathway of APP metabolism resident to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi of neurons was identified, resulting in intracellular APPsβ and Aβ42 generation (6Chyung A.S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2109721022,"The metabolism of valine to isobutyl alcohol in yeast was examined by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The product of valine transamination, α-ketoisovalerate, had four potential routes to isobutyl alcohol. The first, via branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase to isobutyryl-CoA is not required for the synthesis of isobutyl alcohol because abolition of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase activity in an lpd1 disruption mutant did not prevent the formation of isobutyl alcohol. The second route, via pyruvate decarboxylase, is the one that is used because elimination of pyruvate decarboxylase activity in a pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutant virtually abolished isobutyl alcohol production. A third potential route involved α-ketoisovalerate reductase, but this had no role in the formation of isobutyl alcohol from α-hydroxyisovalerate because cell homogenates could not convert α-hydroxyisovalerate to isobutyl alcohol. The final possibility, use of the pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme encoded byYDL080c, seemed to be irrelevant, because a strain with a disruption in this gene produced wild-type levels of isobutyl alcohol. Thus there are major differences in the catabolism of leucine and valine to their respective “fusel” alcohols. Whereas in the catabolism of leucine to isoamyl alcohol the major route is via the decarboxylase encoded by YDL080c, any single isozyme of pyruvate decarboxylase is sufficient for the formation of isobutyl alcohol from valine. Finally, analysis of the 13C-labeled products revealed that the pathways of valine catabolism and leucine biosynthesis share a common pool of α-ketoisovalerate.

We recently reported on the catabolism of leucine bySaccharomyces cerevisiae, showing that this proceeds by transamination to α-ketoisocaproate and then to isoamyl alcohol using a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme encoded by YDL080c (1Dickinson J.R.

This route in yeast differs from that used in other eukaryotes for catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine and that has been well understood for many years (2Bender D.A. Amino Acid Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1975Google Scholar). In most eukaryotes the first step is a transamination in which α-ketoglutarate accepts the amino group (from leucine, isoleucine, and valine) producing glutamate and α-ketoisocaproic acid, α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, and α-ketoisovaleric acid (respectively). The next step involves oxidative decarboxylation of the keto acids by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives. Further steps yield, ultimately, metabolites, all of which can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (2Bender D.A. Amino Acid Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1975Google Scholar). In yeasts branched-chain amino acids can serve as sole source of nitrogen but not carbon (3Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar, 4Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The predominant view, until our recent work on leucine catabolism (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), has been that yeasts first use transamination, but that decarboxylation of the keto acids proceeds via a “carboxylase” to an aldehyde that is then reduced in an NADH-linked reaction producing the appropriate “fusel” alcohol (3Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar, 4Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This explanation, sometimes called the “Ehrlich pathway” to honor the originator of the ideas (6Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1907; 40: 1027-1047Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which were slightly modified later (7Neubauer O. Fromherz K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1911; 70: 326-350Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), has numerous problems. The Ehrlich pathway has never been properly proven as the route by which the branched-chain amino acids are catabolized in yeasts. Crucially, the wrongly named carboxylase (which should at least be called a “decarboxylase”) has never been identified. A few authors have assumed that pyruvate decarboxylase is responsible (5Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), without proof. Some metabolic schemes even envisage a blending of catabolic and biosynthetic pathways (8Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These and other considerations have led us to undertake a thorough re-examination of the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids in S. cerevisiae which has confirmed that the first step is transamination (9Dickinson J.R. Norte V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two distinct aminotransferases have been shown to function both in amino acid biosynthesis and catabolism. One is mitochondrial (TWT1 gene product) and one is cytosolic (TWT2 gene product) (10Eden A. Simchen G. Benvenisty N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24458-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The genetic nomenclature here is somewhat confusing: TWT1 (open reading frameYHR208w) and TWT2 (YJR148w) have been referred to as BAT1 and BAT2 forbranched-chain amino acidtransaminase, respectively, (11Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24458-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) although the acronym“BAT” had already been coined. The two genes have also been referred to as ECA39 and ECA40, respectively, because they are homologous to similarly named genes in several other eukaryotic systems (10Eden A. Simchen G. Benvenisty N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial isozyme is highly expressed during logarithmic phase and is repressed during stationary phase whereas the cytosolic isozyme has the opposite pattern of expression (11Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24458-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, twt1Δ twt2Δ double mutants still possess high levels of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase activity in the cytosol (11Kispal G. Steiner H. Court D.A. Rolinski B. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24458-24464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) indicating that other enzyme(s) exist with this activity. At present it is not clear what these enzymes are. Branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase has also been demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (12Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been purified from this yeast, and a number of its properties have been characterized (13Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 911-922PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of the metabolism of leucine to isoamyl alcohol using13C NMR spectroscopy showed that pyruvate decarboxylase was not required for this conversion because the complete elimination of pyruvate decarboxylase activity in a pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutant did not reduce the levels of isoamyl alcohol produced. Instead, a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme encoded by YDL080cappears to be the major route from α-ketoisocaproate to isoamyl alcohol (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Quite recently ter Schure et al. (14ter Schure E.G. Flikweert M.T. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Verrips C.T Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1303-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed part of our conclusions by showing that pyruvate decarboxylase was capable of decarboxylating α-ketoisocaproic acid, α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, and α-ketoisovaleric acid in vitro, but that a pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 homozygous diploid still produced the fusel alcohols when grown in a medium containing a mixture of all three of the branched-chain amino acids. It was with this background that we started to determine the metabolic pathways used in the catabolism of valine to isobutyl alcohol. The strains used are shown in Table I. Strains 52.1.1 and 52.3.3 were constructed by mating YSH5.127.-17C to JRD719 and sporulation of the resultant diploid. Standard genetic techniques were used in the strain construction (15Sherman F. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Mortimer R.K. Hawthorn D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because both parental strains in this cross carried ura3 and trp1 mutations, haploid progeny segregating either a singlepdc5Δ::URA3 orpdc6Δ::TRP1 mutation were identified by the ability to grow on glucose minimal medium lacking uracil or tryptophan, respectively. Strain 53.2.1 was constructed by mating MML22 to JRD719. Because both parents in this cross carried ura3 mutations, haploid progeny segregating the lpd1::URA3mutation were recognized by the ability to grow on glucose minimal medium lacking uracil and the inability to grow on any medium in which glycerol was the carbon source (17Dickinson J.R.

Starter cultures were grown in a medium comprising 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% carbon source. For studies of valine catabolism cells were grown in minimal medium containing (per liter) 1.67 g of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 20 g of valine, and either 20 ml of ethanol or 20 g of glucose for the carbon source. Experiments involving 13C labeling used [2-13C]valine (99.9 atom %) from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Auxotrophic requirements were supplied as required at 20 μg/ml. Liquid cultures were grown in conical flasks filled to 40% nominal capacity in a gyrorotatory shaker. Agar (2%) was used to solidify media.

Chemical shifts (δ, ppm) are reported relative to external tetramethylsilane in C2HCl3; addition of sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate gave a methyl signal at −2.6 ppm under the conditions used here. Isobutyl alcohol levels were determined in culture filtrates by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a 30-m (0.32-mm internal diameter) fused silica capillary column with a 0.25-μm film of Supelcowax 10 (Supelco) in a Voyager GC-MS (Finnigan, Manchester, United Kingdom) The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the samples were chromatographed isothermally at 60 °C; helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. Standard solutions of isobutyl alcohol gave a linear calibration over the range 0–500 μg/ml. Cell extracts were examined for the ability to convert α-hydroxyisovaleric acid or isobutyric acid into isobutyl alcohol in vitro as described previously (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of a wild-type strain that had been cultured for 23 h in a minimal medium in which glucose was the carbon source and [2-13C]valine the sole nitrogen source. The largest signal was C-2 of valine at 60.6 ppm (the13C-labeled substrate). A number of resonances were observed due to natural abundance in the valine substrate: C-1 (at 174.3 ppm appearing as a doublet J = 53 Hz due to the adjacent labeled C-2), C-3 (at 29.1 ppm as a doublet J= 33 Hz due to the adjacent labeled C-2), C-4 (18.0 ppm), and C-5 (16.6 ppm). A small signal at 41.6 ppm was due to an unidentified impurity in the [2-13C]valine. There were no signals due to residual glucose, while the presence of signals at 57.5 ppm and 16.9 ppm confirmed the production of ethanol. Additional resonances were identified as C-2 of α-ketoisovalerate (211.4 ppm), C-1 of isobutyrate (186.7 ppm), C-2 of α-hydroxyisovalerate (77.3 ppm), and C-1 of isobutyl alcohol (69.0 ppm). The small signal due to C-2 of isoamyl alcohol (40.4 ppm) was the result of secondary reactions which are described below but are not relevant to the primary route used in the metabolism of valine to isobutyl alcohol. The resonance at 69.2 ppm (Y in Fig. 1) could not be identified. DEPT analysis showed that it was a carbon atom joined to only one hydrogen. This suggests the carbon atom attached to the OH group in a hydroxy acid or, possibly, a secondary alcohol or diol. The resonances due to C-2 of α-hydroxyisocaproate, C-2 of lactate, C-2 of malate, C-3 of β-hydroxybutyrate, C-2 of 2-butanol, C-3 of 1,3-butanediol, and also C-3 of α-isopropylmalate were all very close in standards, but spiking experiments showed that these were not identical with resonance Y in Fig. 1. The metabolites identified and the positions that were labeled with13C suggested the metabolic pathways shown in Fig. 2, all of which involved initial transamination to α-ketoisovalerate. The first was via branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (route A in Fig. 2) to yield isobutyryl-CoA, which would then be converted by acyl-CoA hydrolase to isobutyrate and hence isobutyl alcohol. The second possibility was via pyruvate decarboxylase (route B). The occurrence of α-hydroxyisovalerate could be explained by the existence of route C involving α-ketoisovalerate reductase (data not shown) analogous to the conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to α-hydroxyisocaproate seen previously (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). Route D envisaged a pyruvate decarboxylase-like enzyme such as that encoded by YDL080cthat is involved in the formation of isoamyl alcohol from α-ketoisocaproate (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Just as in the previous study (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) we could not conceive a metabolic route between α-ketoisocaproate and isovalerate using known or potential enzymes, neither could we for the analogous conversion of α-ketoisovalerate to isobutyrate (theoreticalroute E in Fig. 2). Thus, this last possibility was discarded and the subsequent experiments were devised in order to distinguish between the four remaining possibilities. The wild-type strain IWD72, mutant strain YSH5.127.-17C, which completely lacks pyruvate decarboxylase activity due to disruptions in all three genes for pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1, PDC5, PDC6) (20Hohmann S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7963-7969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FY1679-YDL080c(a), which is disrupted in open reading frame YDL080c (which we have called KID1(1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M.

Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Human Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were all capable of growth in minimal medium with valine as sole nitrogen source (Fig. 3). The strain lacking all three isoenzymes of pyruvate decarboxylase produced very little isobutyl alcohol (Table II). Strain JRD815-6.1, which lacked the YDL080c-encoded decarboxylase in addition to lacking all three isoenzymes of pyruvate decarboxylase, produced a similarly low level of isobutyl alcohol to strain YSH5.127.-17C, which lacked all three pyruvate decarboxylases; whereas the strain that lacked only the YDL080c-encoded decarboxylase produced wild-type levels of isobutyl alcohol (Table II). This leads immediately to the conclusion that the catabolism of valine to isobutyl alcohol requires pyruvate decarboxylase but not branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase nor the YDL080c-encoded decarboxylase.Table IIAmount of isobutyl alcohol produced by various strains growing in minimal medium with valine as sole source of nitrogenStrainRelevant genotypeCarbon sourceIsobutyl alcoholIsobutyl alcoholμg/mlμg/10 cellsIWD72Wild-typeGlucose302041FY1679-YDL080c(a)ydl080c::KanGlucose308040.2YSH5.127.-17Cpdc1 pdc5 pdc6Ethanol180.3JRD815–6.1pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c::KanEthanol570.6YSH56–1-4Apdc1Glucose378452.1.1pdc6Ethanol2743.152.3.3pdc5Ethanol3006.453.2.1lpd1Glucose4007.7Isobutyl alcohol content was determined in the deceleration phase when it was maximal (see Fig. 4).

Open table in a new tab Isobutyl alcohol content was determined in the deceleration phase when it was maximal (see Fig. 4). Values are the means of duplicate determinations. Differences between samples were <5%. The mutant strain 53.2.1, which lacked lipoamide dehydrogenase and as a consequence of this defect lacks pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, glycine decarboxylase, and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (17Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Lanterman M.M. Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Human Mol.

Genetics. 1995; 140: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produced isobutyl alcohol levels that were not as high as the wild-type orydl080c mutant but were much higher than those of the pyruvate decarboxylase-less mutant. This implies that a lipoamide dehydrogenase-dependent activity plays some part in setting isobutyl alcohol levels but that lipoamide dehydrogenase is not essential for isobutyl alcohol formation. A direct role of lipoamide dehydrogenase could be as an essential component of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase. However, this can be discounted because neither isobutyric acid nor α-hydroxyisovaleric acid was converted into isobutyl alcohol in cell-free extracts from wild-type strains that had been grown on valine as sole source of nitrogen (data not shown). Hence, the lack of lipoamide dehydrogenase must cause the lower level of isobutyl alcohol in the lpd1 mutant by an indirect effect probably due to reduced energy production and consequent reduced growth arising from lack of both pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity. In addition, the absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase means that acetate units do not enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in a shortage of α-ketoglutarate to act as amino group receiver from valine in the initial aminotransferase reaction. Strains YSH56-1-4A (pdc1), 52.3.3 (pdc5), and 52.1.1 (pdc6) all grew well on minimal medium in which valine was the sole source of nitrogen, and all produced similar amounts of isobutyl alcohol (Fig. 4 and Table II). Hence, disruption of any single pyruvate decarboxylase gene resulted in a yeast cell that was able to produce isobutyl alcohol from valine. ThePDC1-encoded isoenzyme (Pdc1) is the major pyruvate decarboxylase responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. Only PDC1 is expressed on glucose with autoregulation of PDC1 and PDC5.Thus, when PDC1 is deleted, PDC5 is expressed on glucose to about 80% of the level of PDC1 in a wild type strain. The expression of PDC1 is 10- to 20-fold lower when glucose levels are low or when ethanol is the carbon source.PDC6 expression is weak and seems to occur only during growth on ethanol. It is especially required for proper growth initiation of spores germinating on ethanol (20Hohmann S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7963-7969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this knowledge one can deduce that the pdc1 strain grew on glucose using Pdc5, the pdc5 mutant growing on ethanol had an active Pdc6, and the pdc6 mutant growing on ethanol had low pyruvate decarboxylase activity due to Pdc1. Thus, in each of these mutants there was only a single pyruvate decarboxylase isozyme operating and in each case the level of pyruvate decarboxylase activity was less than normally present in a wild-type cell. Nevertheless, all of the mutants made moderate amounts of isobutyl alcohol showing that a single pyruvate decarboxylase isozyme is all that is required for isobutyl alcohol formation from valine. The occurrence of isoamyl alcohol labeled at C-2 (Fig. 1) is readily explained by the pathway of leucine biosynthesis (Fig. 5). α-Ketoisovaleric acid labeled at C-2 is converted to α-isopropylmalate labeled at C-3 by α-isopropylmalate synthase. This is then converted by β-isopropylmalate dehydratase to β-isopropylmalate labeled at C-3 which is, in turn, converted to α-ketoisocaproic acid by β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. The next step in the leucine biosynthetic pathway is the formation of leucine, which would be labeled at C-3. No signal due to C-3 of leucine was observed, however isoamyl alcohol labeled at C-2 was present (Fig. 1). This explanation is confirmed by the fact that strain FY1679-YDL080c(a), which lacks theYDL080c-encoded α-ketoisocaproate decarboxylase, makes plenty of isobutyl alcohol but no isoamyl alcohol when valine is the sole nitrogen source (data not shown). Analysis of the metabolism of [2-13C]valine by the wild type strain suggested four credible routes from α-ketoisovalerate to isobutyl alcohol (Fig. 2). Experiments using a range of different mutants led to the conclusion that pyruvate decarboxylase is used in the decarboxylation of α-ketoisovaleric acid. Indeed, any single isozyme of pyruvate decarboxylase is sufficient. This corresponds to the modern view of the Ehrlich pathway (4Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Derrick S. Large P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem.

Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and is completely different from the catabolism of leucine in yeast which uses the unique decarboxylase encoded by YDL080cto catalyze the decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate (1Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is now clear that neither the catabolism of leucine nor the catabolism of valine to the associated fusel alcohols requires branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase. This makes the physiological role of this enzyme in yeast even more mysterious. However, it is known that the activity of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase is greater in complex medium when glycerol is the carbon source than in minimal media containing a branched-chain amino acid (12Dickinson J.R. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present study involved neither the use of glycerol nor complex media, but was confined to the metabolic routes involved in the catabolism of valine in minimal media. An explanation for all currently known facts is that branched-chain amino acid catabolism utilizes predominantly branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase in complex media, but not at all in minimal media. Growth on valine as sole nitrogen source and the ability to form isobutyl alcohol from it are separate. This was demonstrated by thepdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutant, which grew on minimal medium with valine as the sole nitrogen source but made no isobutyl alcohol. Hence the valine was used solely as a source of amino group nitrogen to permit the whole of cellular nitrogen metabolism and growth. The formation of [2-13C]isoamyl alcohol from the [2-13C]α-ketoisovaleric acid produced by the deamination of valine is explained by utilization of the [2-13C]α-ketoisovaleric acid in the leucine biosynthetic pathway. Hence, a mixing of catabolic and biosynthetic pathways accounts for the formation of isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol, respectively, from valine. Webb and Ingraham (8Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv.

The bulk of the protein consists of two repeats of a unit that includes a hydrophobic membrane-associated domain (modeled to contain six transmembrane spans) and a cytoplasmic domain. The pseudosymmetry results from the fact that the two cytoplasmic domains (C1and C2) each contain a region of approximately 230 amino acid residues that are roughly 40% identical (C1a and C2a). The most striking interaction between Gsα and adenylyl cyclase is the insertion of the Gsα switch II helix into the groove formed by the α2′ helix and the α3′-β4′ loop of the C2a domain of adenylyl cyclase (15Tesmer J.J.G.

We have now developed a soluble enzyme system composed of the C1 and C2 domains from type V adenylyl cyclase and have used these proteins, in conjunction with the full-length type V enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells, to identify sites of interaction between adenylyl cyclase and Giα.DISCUSSIONThe inability of myristoylated Giα to inhibit effectively Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated type V adenylyl cyclase activity suggests that the binding site for Giαis highly sensitive to the conformational changes imposed on the enzyme by stimulators of catalysis. Hints of this phenomenon were revealed previously by Taussig et al. (17Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the capacity of myristoylated Giα to inhibit type V adenylyl cyclase decreased as the concentration of Gsα used to activate the enzyme increased (although the IC50 seemed largely unchanged). The simplest explanation of these results is that Gsα and Giα can bind simultaneously to adenylyl cyclase. However, given sufficient concentrations of Gsα or addition of another activator such as forskolin, the enzyme can largely overcome the inhibitory effect of Giα, despite apparent binding of the inhibitory G protein α subunit. These studies also indicate that the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the forskolin- and Gsα-bound VC1·IIC2 complex may not be the optimal state of adenylyl cyclase to model its inhibitory interactions with Giα.Previous work by Taussig et al. (17Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested separate binding sites for Giα and Gsα. Considering the pseudosymmetry of adenylyl cyclase, Sunahara et al. (23Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and Tesmer et al. (15Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) suggested that Giα may bind to the C1 domain of the enzyme in a location analogous to that for interaction of Gsα with the C2domain. We have expressed and purified fragments of the C1and C2 domains of type V adenylyl cyclase and demonstrate herein the interaction of the C1 domain of type V adenylyl cyclase with Giα by two independent methods. Both gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium indicate formation of a 1:1 complex between VC1 and Giα1, as was observed previously with Gsα and IIC2 (23Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect interactions between VC2 and myristoylated Giα1. We have to date been unable to detect formation of the tetrameric complex containing VC1, VC2, Gsα, and Giα1. Nevertheless, we believe that Gsα and Giα can bind simultaneously to adenylyl cyclase, as stated above. Binding of Giαto a complex of Gsα, VC1, and VC2may weaken interactions between the cytosolic domains of the enzyme. Detection of simultaneous binding of Gsα and Giα to adenylyl cyclase may thus require covalent linkage of C1 and C2.A series of mutations was created in the C1 domain of type V adenylyl cyclase that specifically targeted the α1-α2 and α3-β4 cleft, the site analogous to that for binding of Gsα to IIC2. Several mutations within the α2 and α3 helices led to either increased or decreased IC50 levels for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by Giα. Mutations in other regions of the enzyme had no effect on this parameter. The point mutations E411A, L472A, and M476A and the double mutation M414A,T415A increased the IC50 for Giα-mediated inhibition of these enzymes by 25–75-fold, whereas the mutations E418A, M476V, and V479I decreased the IC50 for Giα inhibition by 4–6-fold. All of the side chains at these positions point into the cavity created by the flanking helices, α2 and α3, except for Leu-472 (Fig. 5 B). This side chain might participate in contacts with the α3-β5 loop of Giα, as do residues in the C2 domain with Gsα or even with the C1b domain of adenylyl cyclase.Residues within the Gsα binding pocket are conserved among the different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase as expected, as all isoforms respond to this activator. However, only type I, V, and VI adenylyl cyclases are inhibited by Giα, and we expected to find the greatest effect of mutation of residues that are conserved among only these isoforms. However, residues Glu-411 and Glu-418 are conserved in nearly all isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, and Val-479 is conserved in about half of these, including several that are not inhibited by Giα. Residues Leu-472, Met-476, Met-414, and Thr-415 are not conserved among other isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, but they also differ significantly in the type I enzyme. A residue such as Gln-406, located at the entrance of the α2/α3 cleft and conserved between type V, VI, and I adenylyl cyclases, had no significant effect on inhibition by Giα when mutated to either alanine or glutamate. It is thus unclear how specificity for interaction with Giα is achieved.The main structural difference between the Gsα binding pocket and that proposed for Giα is the size of the cleft, which is largely dictated by the angle between the α2 and α3 helices and the insertion of four residues in C2 in the loop between α1′ and α2′. This provides a wider entrance to this cleft for contact with switch II of Gsα. There are significant conformational differences in the Gsα binding pocket when one compares the IIC2 homodimeric structure (14Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), proposed to mimic an inactive ground state, with that of the Gsα·Fsk·VC1·IIC2 complex (15Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It is unknown what changes may occur in the C1 domain and the Giα binding pocket as the enzyme is converted from a low to a high activity state. However, this cleft undergoes conformational changes upon P-site inhibitor and pyrophosphate binding.Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by Giα was also detected using the purified C1 and C2 domains of the type V enzyme. The IC50 for inhibition was only 2-fold greater than that observed with full-length, membrane-bound type V adenylyl cyclase (0.3 versus 0.15 μm). This is a small difference compared with the 10-fold or more loss of apparent affinity for Gsα when the purified soluble VC1/IIC2 system was compared with the holoprotein. Full inhibition by Giα required both activation of the protein with GTPγS and myristoylation. Myristoylation was also required for binding of Giα to VC1 as measured by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium. Modeling of Giα in the binding pocket identified by mutagenesis (Fig. 9) places its N terminus and attached myristate near the presumed location of the plasma membrane. The requirement for myristoylation of Giα for inhibition of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases is not understood. However, insertion of myristate in the plasma membrane would increase the local concentration and apparent affinity of Giα for adenylyl cyclase, and there are also several examples of intermolecular and intramolecular protein-lipid interactions. Recoverin and Arf contain myristate groups that are sensitive to the conformational states of these proteins (40Zozuya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 41Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.-K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B.

Lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions are prevalent in binding of regulatory molecules to Ras-related G proteins (43Magee T. Newman C. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The requirement for myristate in a completely soluble system suggests that myristate does not serve simply to concentrate Giα at the membrane but rather interacts directly with either the protein moiety of Giα, adenylyl cyclase, or both to increase the affinity of their interaction.The inhibitory effect of Giα on reconstituted adenylyl cyclase activity was largely unchanged when the C2 domain of the type II enzyme replaced VC2, suggesting that C2 does not play a significant role in binding Giα and thereby dictating isoform-specific recognition of the regulatory protein. However, inhibition by Giα was enhanced when the full C1 domain (VC1(670)) was included compared with C1a alone (VC1(591)). Isoform specificity may be partially dictated by C1b. This region is highly variable among the different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase. The difference in inhibition by Giα between VC1a and VC1(670) was not observed when the C1 and C2 domains were linked covalently (30Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is not clear why this should make a difference. However, mutations in VC1(670) do faithfully mimic the phenotypes of those made in the full-length protein.Tesmer et al.(15) and Sunahara et al. (44Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) suggested that the specificity for recognition of Gsα at its binding site was dictated primarily by the backbone conformation of the α subunit and not its primary sequence. There are only two conservative changes between Gsα and Giα in the switch region that interacts with adenylyl cyclase. However, the α3-β5 and α4-β6 loops of Gsα and Giα, proposed by mutagenesis studies to interact with adenylyl cyclase, do have differences in their primary amino acid sequences and structural conformations. Crystallographic data suggest that the α4-β6 loop of Gsα does not contact the conserved cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclase. Based on the location of this loop in Giα relative to that of the C terminus of C1a, it is possible that the C1bdomain of adenylyl cyclase could interact with this region of Giα, adding additional stability to this complex.The mechanism of activation of adenylyl cyclase by Gsα is not completely understood, and discussion of the mechanism of inhibition by Giα can thus be only speculative. However, the close proximity of the Giα binding site to the active site of the enzyme certainly poises Giα to affect catalysis by a number of mechanisms. A simple model of binding of Giα to adenylyl cyclase based on the enzyme's interactions with Gsα (Fig. 9) does not explain all of the effects of the mutations in adenylyl cyclase described above or those in Giα reported previously (45Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20619-20626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this model is consistent with the general location of the binding site for Giα that is indicated by the mutations. Therefore, much in the same way that binding of Gsα is proposed to widen the binding cleft in C2, inducing a domain rotation that reorients residues within the active site (15Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), Giα may widen its binding pocket in C1 and generate a movement of the α1-α2 loop toward the catalytic site to disrupt or block the active site. The addition of forskolin to the Gsα-bound enzyme increases the affinity of the two domains for one another and may serve to lock the enzyme in a highly activated state that does not favor Giα binding to C1. However, we suggest that Gsα and Giα do bind simultaneously to adenylyl cyclase, forming a large complex (200 kDa with the native enzyme) whose pseudosymmetry extends from the duplicated structure of adenylyl cyclase to these two regulatory proteins. The pseudosymmetry of adenylyl cyclase is a clear structural correlate of bidirectional regulation of the enzyme by homologous G protein α subunits. The hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system is a well studied paradigm of G protein-mediated signal transduction. All isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase are stimulated by the heterotrimeric G protein Gs. Appropriate agonist-bound, heptahelical receptors activate Gs by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. The GTP-bound α subunit of Gs in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the rate of synthesis of cyclic AMP from ATP (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Mammalian adenylyl cyclases are pseudosymmetrical, membrane-bound enzymes. The bulk of the protein consists of two repeats of a unit that includes a hydrophobic membrane-associated domain (modeled to contain six transmembrane spans) and a cytoplasmic domain. The pseudosymmetry results from the fact that the two cytoplasmic domains (C1and C2) each contain a region of approximately 230 amino acid residues that are roughly 40% identical (C1a and C2a). The most striking interaction between Gsα and adenylyl cyclase is the insertion of the Gsα switch II helix into the groove formed by the α2′ helix and the α3′-β4′ loop of the C2a domain of adenylyl cyclase (15Tesmer J.J.G.

During the course of a scrapie infection, PrPC undergoes a post-translational modification to a disease-specific isoform (PrPSc) that has increased resistance to limited PK digestion.

Inhibition of the migration of PrPC to the cell surface blocks the formation of PrPSc, confirming that PrPSc arises via alternate or misprocessing of PrPSc (8Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D.

Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The loss of PK resistance correlates well with loss of infectivity of the PrPSc-enriched preparation. In this study, we examined the ability of GdnHCl-denatured, PrPSc-enriched preparations to renature. Renaturation was monitored by Western blot analysis for the presence of PK-resistant PrP and animal bioassay for infectivity. The capacity of PrP to bind copper led us to determine the effect of this transition metal on the renaturation process. Brains were removed from clinically affected hamsters infected with the 263K strain of hamster-adapted scrapie agent, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C. PrPSc-enriched fractions were prepared to the P4 pellet step following a modification of Bolton et al. (14Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmorstein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that excludes the PK digestion. The P4 pellet was resuspended in buffered saline containing glycerol (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol), and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The reaction conditions for the denaturation and subsequent renaturation were based upon the cell-free conversion reactions described by Kocisko et al.(13Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). PrPSc-enriched preparations were lyophilized and then resuspended in 2 m GdnHCl at a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. An aliquot was removed immediately upon the addition of the GdnHCl (t 0). The remainder of the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and a second aliquot was removed (denatured). The sample was then diluted to a final GdnHCl concentration of 0.5 m by the addition of TN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 130 mm NaCl) and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C (renatured). For the copper addition experiments, CuCl2 or CuSO4 was added, at the time the GdnHCl was diluted to 0.5 m, to a final concentration of 10 mm. All samples (t 0, denatured, and renatured) were adjusted to the same volume and divided into two equal aliquots, one aliquot being digested with PK, and the other being the non-PK-treated control. For the protease treatment, PK (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the samples at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. All samples were treated with a serine protease inhibitor (final concentration, 1 μg/ml; Pefabloc sc; Boehringer Mannheim) and precipitated in the presence of thyroglobulin (10 μg), as a carrier protein, with four volumes of methanol. After centrifugation for 30 min in a microcentrifuge, the samples were resuspended in 20 μl of TN buffer. Half of each sample was used for Western blot analysis, and the other half was used for bioassay in Syrian hamsters. For Western blot analysis, the samples were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon P, and immunoblotted with the anti-hamster PrP monoclonal antibody, 3F4 (1:40,000, a gift from R. Rubenstein) as described previously (15McKenzie D. Kaczkowski J. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7534-7536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All samples (10 μl) were diluted to 1 ml by the addition of TE buffer and sonicated in a cuphorn sonicator (Fisher). 30 μl of each sample was inoculated intracerebrally into weanling outbred Syrian hamsters. Hamsters were monitored weekly for the onset of clinical symptoms. Thirteen different denaturation/renaturation experiments were bioassayed with 38 animals inoculated with the t 0 samples, 37 with the denatured samples, 36 with the renatured samples, and 26 with samples renatured in the presence of copper. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS general linear models. We addressed the question of whether the PK-sensitive, GdnHCl-treated PrP (i.e. denatured PrPSc) was capable of regaining both PK resistance and infectivity. PrPSc-enriched samples were prepared from hamsters infected with the 263K strain of scrapie using a modification of Bolton et al. (14Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmorstein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that excluded PK digestion. PrPSc-enriched preparations were incubated for 0 h (t 0) and 16 h (denatured) in 2 m GdnHCl, diluted to 0.5m GdnHCl, and incubated for 48 h (renatured), all at 37 °C. An aliquot of each sample (t 0, denatured, and renatured) was then treated with PK and analyzed by Western blot to determine the effect of GdnHCl treatments on the protease resistance of PrP. All samples (treated and non-PK-treated) were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-PrP monoclonal antibody, 3F4. Samples not treated with PK produced similar levels of staining on the Western blot demonstrating that nearly equivalent amounts of PrPSc are present in all samples (Fig. 1, left panel). For the majority of the experiments, the samples treated with 2 mGdnHCl were sensitive to PK digestion resulting in a very faint signal on the Western blot (Fig. 1, right panel), suggesting that they were denatured. Dilution of the denatured sample to 0.5 m GdnHCl and further incubation at 37 °C for 48 h resulted in restoration of PK resistance (Fig. 1, right panel). This restoration of PK resistance was also observed by Kocisko et al. (13Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The PK-resistant PrP was similar in molecular weight and glycoform pattern to that of the starting material, 263K. The intensity of the immunostaining of the renatured PrP was generally less than observed with the starting material (t 0), suggesting that the renaturation was not complete. The degree of renaturation varied between PrPSc-enriched preparations. In a few experiments, the PK resistance of PrP in the GdnHCl-treated material was not regained, suggesting that the samples were irreversibly denatured (data not shown). To determine the effect of the GdnHCl treatment on infectivity, aliquots of the t 0, denatured, and renatured samples were bioassayed in Syrian hamsters (Fig. 2). In all cases, loss of PK resistance was correlated with a loss of infectivity as indicated by the increase in incubation periods (compared with the t 0controls). When PK resistance was regained in samples incubated in dilute GdnHCl, restoration of infectivity was always observed. PK-resistant renatured PrP on the Western blots always correlated with decreased incubation periods (n = 13 separate experiments). There was no significant difference between the repetitions (p > 0.05). There were, however, significant differences in incubation periods between thet 0 samples and the denatured and renatured treatment groups (p < 0.0001). At thep = 0.05 level, the means separation test (Fischer's least significance difference test) (16SAS Institute, Inc. (1989) SAS/STAT® User's Guide, Version 6, 4th Ed., Vol. 2, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NCGoogle Scholar, 17SAS Institute, Inc. (1990) SAS® Procedures Guide, Version 6, 3rd Ed., SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NCGoogle Scholar) indicates that the incubation periods for animals inoculated with the denatured samples are significantly different from those in the untreated and renatured groups. The latter two groups did not differ significantly from each other. Based on the dose-response curves for the 263K strain, a 1-week increase in the incubation period corresponds to approximately a 1 log decrease in titer (18Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 19Marsh R.F. Hanson R.P Fed. Proc. 1978; 37: 2076-2078PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation periods greater than 130 days suggest titers of less than 10 infectious units/ml. End point dilution analysis was not performed with these samples, and because treatment of inoculum can affect the dose-response curves (20Dickinson A. Fraser H. Nature. 1969; 222: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Taylor D.M. Fernie K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is not possible to directly determine the titer of the denatured and renatured samples.

Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we explored the effect of copper on the renaturation of PrPSc. PrPSc-enriched samples were denatured as described above and renatured in the presence or absence of 10 mmCuSO4. Two different results were obtained depending on the renaturability of the samples. Addition of copper had little or no effect on the renaturation of samples that regained PK resistance (Fig. 3 A). Those samples had similar levels of PK-resistant material, as measured by Western blot, and similar incubation periods when compared with the renatured samples lacking copper (Fig. 3 A). Copper did, however, have a positive effect on regaining PK resistance in samples that did not renature (to detectable levels) under the normal conditions. In those experiments, there was no PK-resistant PrP observable by Western blot in the renatured samples (Fig. 3 B). In the samples in which copper was added, PK-resistant PrP was observed on the Western blots. This PK-resistant PrP showed the same banding pattern as the PK-treatedt 0 samples, except for the presence of higher molecular weight bands, suggesting that aggregation had occurred. Similar results were obtained with CuCl2 (data not shown) demonstrating that the observed results were copper-dependent and not sulfate-dependent. Addition of the divalent cations, magnesium (MgCl2) and calcium (CaCl2), to the renaturation reactions had no observable effect on either the restoration of PK resistance or infectivity (data not shown). In those experiments where the addition of copper had a positive effect on restoration of PK-resistant PrP, bioassay experiments confirmed the Western blot observations with the copper-treated samples having shortened incubation periods compared with the denatured samples (see Fig. 3 for representative bioassay results). The bioassay of five separate samples (a total of 26 animals) in which the addition of copper enhanced renaturation showed that the decrease in the incubation period was statistically significant as compared with the denatured samples. The addition of copper did not affect the clinical presentation of disease, and histopathological examination of these samples showed no differences between the copper-treated and nontreated samples (data not shown). Conditions were established in which the denaturation of PrPSc was reversible. Pretreatment of PrPScwith GdnHCl (2.0 m) results in modification of both the structure of the PrPSc (as measured by PK resistance) and the infectivity of the preparation. Upon dilution of the GdnHCl, the PrPSc undergoes structural changes restoring both PK resistance and infectivity. The GdnHCl concentrations at which this reversible denaturation occurs are preparation-dependent but are within the range of 2.0–3.0 m for our preparations. We have observed that the optimal ranges differ depending on the method used for the preparation of the PrPSc-enriched samples (data not shown). Because the reversal of the denaturation reaction is dependent on the initial GdnHCl concentration, it is possible that the PrPSc is not completely denatured but rather converted to an intermediate form, one that is PK-sensitive but that can regain protease resistance upon removal of the denaturant. The dependence of cell-free conversion reactions on the presence of aggregated PrPSc(i.e. “seed”) (28Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) suggest an alternative explanation. High concentrations of GdnHCl (such as the 6 m used by others (29Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A. Stahl N. Gabizon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2793-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) completely denature all PrPSc in the preparations such that no seed molecules remain. The concentration of GdnHCl used for reversal denaturation results in a small (nondetectable by Western blot) amount of seed remaining in the sample. Dilution of the GdnHCl and extended incubation permits this seed to convert the denatured PrP into PK-resistant conformations. We investigated the effect of transition metals on the renaturation process because altered metabolism of transition metals has been implicated as a cause of many neurodegenerative diseases. The deposition of these metals in the central nervous system increases with age (30Gerlach M. Ben-Shachar D. Riederer P. Youdim M.B.H. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and the distribution changes in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (31Andrasi E. Farkas E. Scheibler H. Reffy A. Bezur L. Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 1995; 21: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Aluminum salts have been shown to modulate the properties of paired helical filaments τ retarding its degradation by proteases possibly by enhancing aggregation of the protein (22Shin R.-W. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7221-7233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of copper and/or zinc to amyloid precursor protein affects conformation, stability, and homophilic interactions (23Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Science. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Copper binds to the octapeptide repeat region of the PrP protein in studies using synthetic peptides (25Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Miura T. Hori-i A. Takeuchi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the addition of copper enhances the renaturation process, possibly by stabilizing the formation of the initial aggregate. It is possible that the copper ion promotes the formation of defined structures in the PrP monomers and/or promotes intramolecular bonding by forming a bridge between individual monomers. Our studies clearly demonstrate that denaturation of PrPSc-enriched preparations is a reversible process. Dilution of the denaturant followed by extended incubation times to allow renaturation results in restoration of both PK resistance of PrP and infectivity. Protocols designed to remove TSE infectivity from infected materials must destroy the PrP protein because our studies demonstrate that denatured PrPSc can renature upon removal of the denaturant and with sufficient time. The enhancement of renaturation (and perhaps conversion) by copper suggests a role for secondary molecules in the etiology of these diseases. We thank Drs. Michael Strand, Richard Bessen, Martin Hornshaw, and Adriano Aguzzi and the members of the Aiken lab for comments on this manuscript and Dr. Byron Caughey for many helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2080559953,"Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans capable of carrying both heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains. The cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 was recently reported to undergoin vivo phosphorylation on Ser183 in the membrane-proximal part of the tail (Horowitz, A., and Simons, M. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10914–10918). However, the functional consequences of this event remain unknown. The cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is known to undergo multimerization and to activate protein kinase Cα (PKCα), with both events depending on the presence of the commonly occurring phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). In the present investigation we found that phosphorylation of Ser183 produced a 10-fold reduction in the ability of syndecan-4 to activate PKCα, without affecting its ability to bind the PKC. Because Ser183 is adjacent to positively charged lysine groups that resemble PIP2-binding regions in several other proteins, phosphorylation of this serine may affect the binding affinity of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail to PIP2. We found that the Ser183-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 has indeed a significantly lower affinity to PIP2 compared with the nonphosphorylated tail. Furthermore, Ser183phosphorylation abolished PIP2-dependent oligomerization of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tails. We conclude that Ser183 phosphorylation regulates syndecan-4-dependent activation of PKCα by reducing the affinity to PIP2 and inhibiting the oligomerization of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tails. These results further support the role of syndecan-4 in signal transduction in endothelial cells. Syndecans are transmembrane proteoglycans capable of carrying both heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains. The cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 was recently reported to undergoin vivo phosphorylation on Ser183 in the membrane-proximal part of the tail (Horowitz, A., and Simons, M. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10914–10918). However, the functional consequences of this event remain unknown. The cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is known to undergo multimerization and to activate protein kinase Cα (PKCα), with both events depending on the presence of the commonly occurring phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). In the present investigation we found that phosphorylation of Ser183 produced a 10-fold reduction in the ability of syndecan-4 to activate PKCα, without affecting its ability to bind the PKC. Because Ser183 is adjacent to positively charged lysine groups that resemble PIP2-binding regions in several other proteins, phosphorylation of this serine may affect the binding affinity of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail to PIP2. We found that the Ser183-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 has indeed a significantly lower affinity to PIP2 compared with the nonphosphorylated tail. Furthermore, Ser183phosphorylation abolished PIP2-dependent oligomerization of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tails. We conclude that Ser183 phosphorylation regulates syndecan-4-dependent activation of PKCα by reducing the affinity to PIP2 and inhibiting the oligomerization of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tails.

Heparan sulfate (HS)1chains on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix are present on a specific group of proteins referred to as proteoglycans, which is composed of several classes of core proteins that serve as acceptors for different glycosaminoglycan chains. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are thought to play an important role in a number of biological processes including regulation of blood coagulation, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. These functions are largely thought to be mediated by HS chains capable of binding growth factors, cell adhesion receptors, and other biologically active molecules (1Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Relatively little attention has been paid, however, to the function of the proteoglycan core proteins themselves. Of the three main classes of HS-carrying core proteins (syndecans, glypicans, and perlecan) only the syndecans possess a highly conserved transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. Accumulating evidence suggests that the cytoplasmic tails of several members of the syndecan family can participate in transduction of extracellular signals into the cell. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-3 was reported to bind Src family tyrosine kinases and to mediate neurite growth factor signaling (2Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Peng H.B.

The ubiquitously expressed syndecan-4, which had been reported earlier to be incorporated into focal adhesions upon PKC stimulation (3Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol.

Moreover, we have recently reported that Ser183 located in the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 becomes phosphorylated upon PKC stimulation, whereas cell treatment with bFGF reduces the phosphorylation of Ser183 (7Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The functional effects of this phosphorylation on the molecular properties of syndecan-4 and on its signaling activity have not yet been elucidated, however. The regulation of PKC activity by syndecan-4 appears to be mediated by PIP2 (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

This study addresses, therefore, the effect of phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 on its interaction with PIP2, as well as on its capacities to undergo multimerization and to activate PKCα. PIP2, phosphatidylserine (PS), and diolein were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant PKCα and PKCδ were synthesized and prepared as described (9Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z.

PKCβI optimal substrate peptide (FKLKRKGSFKKFA) was purchased from Tufts University Medical School (Boston, MA). A 28-amino acid-long syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail peptide (S4c) (RMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA) was synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). A similar peptide with a phosphorylated Ser (S4c-P) was synthesized by the Biopolymers Laboratory, Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA). PIP2 (from Sigma, dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 20 parts CHCl3, 9 parts MeOH, 1 part H2O, 0.1 part 1 n HCl) was dried under N2 and sonicated for 5 min in ice-cold H2O at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail peptides S4c or S4c-P (100 μm) were incubated on ice for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of PIP2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in aliquots of 100 μl. The samples were layered on 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off cellulose filters (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and spun at 2000 × g for 1 min following the method described in Ref. 10Haarer B.K.

The samples (40 μl of each in Laemmli sample buffer, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad), and images of the stained bands were digitized (DeskScan II on ScanJet 4c, Hewlett Packard) and quantitated by densitometry (ImageQuant, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail peptides S4c or S4c-P (300 μm) were incubated with PIP2 (350 μm, prepared as above) in 0.5 ml 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl on ice for 30 min. Samples were applied at 4 °C to a Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 30 × 1.6 cm column equilibrated with the incubation buffer, and the absorbency of the flow-through was measured at 280 nm.

The cells were harvested by trypsinization, lyzed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a cytoplasmic tail-specific antiserum (gift of Dr. N. W. Shworak, MIT (12Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred for 2 h at 250 mA in 150 mm glycine, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 20% methanol to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted as described (7Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antibodies to PKCα or to PKCδ (both at 2 μg/ml, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cytoplasmic tail peptides S4c or S4c-P (10 μm) were incubated on ice for 30 min either in the presence or absence of PIP2 (20 μm, prepared as above) with recombinant PKCα (4 μm) in 0.5 ml of the same buffer used in the PIP2 binding assay. The cytoplasmic tail peptide was immunoprecipitated, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted as described above. Samples (30 μl) consisted of PKCβI optimal substrate peptide (100 μm) either with or without syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail peptides S4c or S4c-P (both at 50 μm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). In some assays the buffer was supplemented with either PIP2 (50 μm) or PS (4 μg/ml), diolein (6.2 μg/ml), and 0.2 mm CaCl2. In PKCδ assays the buffer was supplemented with PS and diolein as above and with 0.5 mm EGTA. Upon addition of either PKCα (120 ng/ml) or PKCδ (430 ng/ml), samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer for 4 min. The samples were resolved on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to PVDF membranes, and detected as described (7Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail has been shown to activate a mixture of Ca2+-dependent PKCs and of recombinant PKCα in the presence of PIP2 (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of Ser183 phosphorylation on syndecan-4-dependent PKC activation, we studied the ability of the S4c and S4c-P peptides to activate recombinant PKCα using the PKCβI optimal substrate peptide (9Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) in an in vitro assay. When the assays were carried out with the standard cPKC cofactors PS, diacylglycerol, and calcium, the presence of neither the S4c nor the S4c-P peptides had any additional effect on the catalytic activity of PKCα (Fig. 1). That was also the case in PKC assays where no cofactors were added. However, in the presence of PIP2 together with the S4c peptide, the catalytic activity of PKCα toward the PKCβI peptide was approximately 10-fold larger than in assays with PIP2 alone. On the other hand, when the S4c-P peptide was added instead of S4c, the phosphorylation level of the substrate was similar to that obtained with PIP2 alone. Unlike PKCα, the S4c peptide did not activate PKCδ under the same conditions (data not shown). The activity of PKCα in the presence of the S4c peptide and PIP2 was 72 ± 10% (±S.D., n = 3) of its activity in the presence of the S4c peptide, PS, diacylglycerol, and calcium. The ability of the unphosphorylated but not the phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 to activate PKCα in vitro may relate to a reduced PKCα affinity upon phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 to bind PKC (5Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and the identity of the bound PKC isozyme in vivo was narrowed down to a group of four (α, βI, βII, γ, and δ (5Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)). Although PKCα was shown to bind to the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 in vitro (5Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic tail could also bind to and be a substrate of PKCδ (7Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of syndecan-4 to bind PKCα or δ in vivo, RFPEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specific to the cytoplasmic tail, and the immunoprecipitants were probed with antibodies specific either to the α or δ PKC isozymes. The presence of PKCα but not of PKCδ was detected in the immunoprecipitants (Fig. 2, Aand B). To analyze the effect of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation on its ability to bind PKCα, we carried out in vitro assays with recombinant PKCα and the S4c and S4c-P peptides. Incubation of PKCα with either peptide produced, however, similar degrees of binding both in the presence and absence of PIP2 (Fig. 2 C). It follows, therefore, that PKCα binding is not affected by the Ser183 phosphorylation in the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail and thus cannot explain the effect of syndecan-4 phosphorylation on the activity of the enzyme. Both the oligomerization and PKCα activation capacities of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 were found to depend on the presence of PIP2 (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Lee D. Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13022-13029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether the phosphorylation of Ser183 in the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 affects the affinity of the tail to PIP2. To this end, we compared thein vitro binding between PIP2 micelles and S4c or S4c-P peptides using a filtration assay. The filter retains the PIP2 micelle-bound peptide, whereas the unbound peptide passes through it. The binding affinity of the S4c peptide to PIP2, as determined by band densitometry of the SDS-PAGE-resolved filter flow-through samples, was significantly higher than that of the S4c-P peptide. At a peptide:PIP2 molar ratio of 2:1, 50% of the S4c peptide that passed through the filter in the absence of PIP2 was retained versus none of the S4c-P peptide (Fig. 3). Practically all the applied S4c peptide was retained by the filter at a peptide:PIP2 molar ratio of 1:2, whereas as much as 50% of the S4c-P peptide still passed through the filter under the same conditions. The apparent dissociation constants (K d) calculated from the results shown in Fig. 3 were 2.4 μmfor the nonphosphorylated peptide (S4c), versus 232 μm for the phosphorylated one (S4c-P). Thus, Ser183 phosphorylation results in significant reduction in the ability of PIP2 to bind to the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 undergoes oligomerization in the presence of PIP2 (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Lee D. Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13022-13029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); furthermore this oligomerization appeared necessary for PKCα activation. The reduced affinity between the cytoplasmic tail and PIP2 caused by phosphorylation could conceivably be accompanied by changes in the oligomerization properties of syndecan-4. To compare the oligomerization of the S4c peptide to that of the phosphorylated peptide S4c-P, both were incubated either in the presence or absence of PIP2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and passed through a size exclusion column. Both peptides eluted as a single peak when incubated in the absence of PIP2 (Fig. 4, A and B). When incubated in the presence of PIP2, the S4c peptide eluted as two peaks, one of an approximate molecular mass of 7 kDa (Fig. 4 C), and another heavier peak of a molecular mass greater than 17 kDa (the molecular mass of the heaviest molecular mass standard used in this experiment). The S4c-P peptide, on the other hand, eluted as a single peak of the same approximate molecular mass as the first peak of the S4c peptide (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 looses its capacity to form oligomers upon phosphorylation of Ser183. Based on the position of the first peaks of the S4c and the S4c-P peptides, it appears that both the S4c (as previously reported (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) and the S4c-P peptides formed dimers, similar to the behavior observed in the PIP2-binding experiment (Fig. 3). The broader peaks observed with both peptides when incubated in the presence of PIP2, compared with the sharper ones obtained in the absence of PIP2, reflect a wider spread in molecular mass, probably resulting from the range of PIP2 binding to the peptides. This study presents three distinct findings concerning the role of the syndecan-4 core protein in signal transduction: (a) Phosphorylation of a single serine residue (Ser183) located in the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 reduces the affinity of the tail to the phosphoinositide PIP2. Upon phosphorylation, the cytoplasmic tail loses its capacity to (b) undergo multimerization and (c) activate PKCα in the presence of PIP2. These findings provide the first evidence for a functional role of the recently reported (7Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) phosphorylation of Ser183 in the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4. The capacities of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 to undergo multimerization and to activate PKCα were manifest only in the presence of PIP2. A recent NMR study reported on PIP2 binding to a lysine-rich 9-amino acid-long variable region (LGKKPIYKK) from the middle of the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 (8Lee D. Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13022-13029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The interaction of PIP2 with this region could conceivably be mediated in part by electrostatic bonds between the two phosphates attached to the PIP2 inositol ring and the positively charged lysines of the variable region. This electrostatic interaction could be disrupted by the phosphorylation of Ser183 located 3 residues upstream of the variable region. An interaction of a similar nature may take place between PIP2 and several basic residues located in the N-terminal actin-binding domain of α-actinin (13Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The specific binding of PIP2 to the pleckstrin homology domains of several proteins also appears to be mediated by an electrostatic interaction between the PIP2 phosphates and positively charged lysines in the pleckstrin homology domain (14Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Moreover, the syndecan-4 variable region resembles the consensus sequences for PIP2-binding motifs (15Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduction in PIP2 binding following phosphorylation of serine residues, similar to the one we reported here, is thought to occur in a lysine-rich sequence of the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (16Glaser M. Wanaski S. Buser C.A. Boguslavsky V. Rashidzada W. Morris A. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S.F. Runnels L.W. Prestwich G.D. Chen J. Aderem A. Ahn J. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26187-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PKCα activation by the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 is thought to require formation of cytoplasmic tail multimers (4Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Ser183 phosphorylation prevents this oligomerization by inhibiting PIP2 binding to the variable region of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail. It follows, therefore, that the loss of PKCα activation by the cytoplasmic tail upon phosphorylation of Ser183 is a direct consequence of the concomitant reduction in affinity to PIP2 and impaired multimerization. Because the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 did not activate PKCδ, this activation may be specific to PKCα. On the other hand, Ser183 phosphorylation had no effect on the capacity of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail to bind PKCα. The ability of syndecan-4 to activate PKCα signaling in endothelial cells, the regulation of this signaling by syndecan-4 phosphorylation, and the previously demonstrated bFGF-dependent regulation of the state of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation suggests the existence of a novel bFGF-dependent signaling pathway. The same signaling pathway may also be employed by other events affecting syndecan-4 phosphorylation. We thank Drs. Lewis C. Cantley and Kiyotaka Nishikawa for helpful discussions and the Protein Chemistry Core Facility (which is supported by National Institutes of Health Grant P50 HL 56993) for providing recombinant PKCα and δ."

This formylglycine is generated by posttranslational modification of a conserved cysteine residue. The arylsulfatase gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa also encodes a cysteine at the critical position. This protein could be expressed in active form in a sulfatase-deficient strain of P. aeruginosa, thereby restoring growth on aromatic sulfates as sole sulfur source, and in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the mature protein expressed in E. coli revealed the presence of formylglycine at the expected position, showing that the cysteine is also converted to formylglycine in a prokaryotic sulfatase. Substituting the relevant cysteine by a serine codon in the P. aeruginosa gene led to expression of inactive sulfatase protein, lacking the formylglycine. The machinery catalyzing the modification of thePseudomonas sulfatase in E. coli therefore resembles the eukaryotic machinery, accepting cysteine but not serine as a modification substrate. By contrast, in the arylsulfatase of Klebsiella pneumoniae a formylglycine is found generated by modification of a serine residue.

The FGly residue is part of the catalytic site, as has been shown by crystallographic analysis of two lysosomal sulfatases (9Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J.

Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) from which the sulfate can subsequently be eliminated with concomitant regeneration of the aldehyde group. It has recently been shown that a prokaryotic member of the sulfatase family, the arylsulfatase from Klebsiella pneumoniae, also carries the FGly residue (12Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to eukaryotic sulfatases, the modified residue in the Klebsiella protein is a serine instead of a cysteine, though the amino acid sequence downstream of the FGly, which is thought to direct this protein modification, is highly conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (XPXRXXX LTG). Only 60% of the arylsulfatase polypeptides expressed under strongly inducing conditions carried the FGly residue, and the remaining 40% carried the serine predicted from the DNA sequence (12Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under these conditions it seems likely that the FGly generating machinery may be saturated. The FGly residue, which is critical for sulfate ester cleavage, is therefore conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the pathways responsible for FGly formation may be different. If the cysteine in eukaryotic sulfatases is replaced by a serine, catalytically inactive proteins are synthesized, and the serine residue does not undergo conversion to FGly (6Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Recksiek M. Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To investigate whether prokaryotes can convert both serine and cysteine to FGly, we studied the arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the DNA sequence predicts a cysteine at the position occupied by FGly in the sulfatase polypeptides from eukaryotes and K. pneumoniae (13Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Pseudomonas sulfatase was expressed in the wild-type form, carrying a cysteine in position 51, and as a C51S mutant. The recombinant sulfatase proteins were purified and analyzed for the presence of FGly. The results obtained showed that the Pseudomonas sulfatase was modified with high specificity and that the modification system accepted only the cysteine form of this sulfatase. The modification machinery therefore shows a different specificity to the machinery converting serine to FGly in theKlebsiella sulfatase. P. aeruginosa PAO1 (14Holloway B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1955; 13: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was cultivated either in LB medium or a succinate minimal medium (13Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with sulfate or pentanesulfonate (500 μm) as sulfur source. Escherichia coli DH5α [supE44 ΔlacU169 (Φ80 lacZΔM15)hsdR recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1] was used for subcloning, and E. coli BL21(λDE3) [hsdS gal(λcIts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1)] was used for protein expression, as described below. All strains were grown aerobically with constant shaking (180 rpm) at 37 °C or at 30 °C for protein overproduction. P. aeruginosa ATS2 (ΔatsA recA7::Tn501) was constructed as follows. An 832-base pair deletion was created in the atsA gene of P. aeruginosa by exonuclease III/Mung bean nuclease digestion of plasmid pME4051, which carried the atsA gene on a 3.9-kilobase EcoRI-SalI fragment in pBluescript, and religation. The deleted allele was transferred to the chromosome of strain PAO1 using a ColE1-based allele exchange vector, and correct recombination was confirmed by Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction. The recA allele was introduced subsequently by transduction from P. aeruginosa PDO3 (15Horn J.M. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1637-1650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by testing for UV-sensitivity. Plasmid pME4055 was constructed by cloning the atsA gene of P. aeruginosa as a 2.9-kilobase SalI fragment in pBBR1MCS (16Kovach M.E. Phillips R.W. Elzer P.H. Roop R.M. Peterson K.M. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 800-802PubMed Google Scholar), under the control of the lac promoter. This plasmid served as a template for polymerase chain reactions with noncoding mutagenic primers comprising a NcoI-site (C51S: 5′-CATGCCATGGTGCCGATCCCGGCGATGTGGTGGTCGGTGCCGGTGAGCAGCATCGAGCGGGTCGGCGAGCTGGTCG-3′; C51A carried a GGC triplet instead of GCT). The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned asNcoI fragments replacing the corresponding fragments of the template DNA, which carried an additional NcoI site in the vector. The subcloned fragments were checked by DNA sequencing to preclude any polymerase chain reaction-derived errors. For overproduction of arylsulfatase protein, an NdeI site was first introduced at the atsA translation start site by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pME4055, using mutagenic primer ATS-N (5′-GACCCGCATATGAGCAAACG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was then cloned into the expression vector pET24-b (Novagen Inc.), and the 3′-part of the gene was replaced by an NcoI-SalI DNA fragment from pME4055 to give plasmid pME4322. The polymerase chain reaction-derived region of this plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. For overproduction of the C51S and C51A mutant proteins, the mutant alleles were subcloned into pME4322 as EcoRV-SalI fragments. Overproduction of the sulfatase proteins was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3), as described previously (17Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23031-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After lysozyme/Dnase/Rnase treatment the cells were lysed using a French press, and membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation (250,000 × g, 30 min). Cell extract was then desalted into 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, with a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were purified by two chromatographic steps, using a BioCAD SPRINT apparatus (Perseptive Biosystems Inc.). A first separation was obtained by anion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–100 mm Na2SO4 in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The pooled fractions containing the enzyme were concentrated by ultracentrifugation with a Vivaspin 4 concentrator (Vivascience), and corrected to 1 m(NH4)2SO4 by addition of concentrated ammonium sulfate solution. They were then further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a 1-ml Resource-Iso column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min and eluted with a descending gradient of (NH4)2SO4in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing the enzyme were desalted and concentrated as before and stored at −20 °C until required. Arylsulfatase was assayed in whole cells and in cell extracts as described previously using 4-nitrocatechol sulfate (Fluka) as substrate (13Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For small scale enzyme assays with E. coli, concentrated cell suspensions were treated with lysozyme (10 min, 4 °C), and lysed by brief ultrasonication. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. 50 μg of arylsulfatase were lyophilized and solubilized in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9. Reduction with NaB[3H]H4 (Amersham), reductive carboxymethylation with dithiothreitol and iodacetic acid, desalting, tryptic digestion, and purification of tryptic peptides by RP-HPLC were performed as described (5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 12Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Before digestion with trypsin (3% total protein, w/w) an aliquot of the3H-labeled arylsulfatase was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using high Tris gels containing 12.5% acrylamide, 0.17% bis-acrylamide (19Dierks T. Volkmer J. Schlenstedt G. Jung C. Sandholzer U. Zachmann K. Schlotterhose P. Neifer K. Schmidt B. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6931-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For fluorography, the gels were treated with 1 m sodium salicylate (20Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Fractions from RP-HPLC were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing, and radiosequencing (5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Arylsulfatase expression in P. aeruginosa PAO1 is repressed during growth in LB medium because of the presence of excess inorganic sulfate (Table I; Ref. 13Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Derepression is observed during growth in minimal medium with alternative sulfur sources such as sulfate esters, sulfonates, or methionine, and under these conditions arylsulfatase activities of up to 56 nmol/min per mg of total cell protein are observed (21Hummerjohann J. Küttel E. Quadroni M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa ATS2 is an arylsulfatase-deficient derivative of strain PAO1 in which an 832-base pair fragment of the sulfatase geneatsA was deleted. This strain therefore shows no arylsulfatase activity even under derepressing conditions, and is unable to utilize aromatic sulfate esters as a sulfur source for growth. Upon transformation of this strain with a plasmid containing the wild-type atsA gene under control of the lac promoter (pME4055), the ability of the strain to grow with aromatic sulfates as sole sulfur source was restored, and sulfatase activity could be measured during growth either in LB (Table I) or minimal medium (not shown). However, when strain ATS2 was transformed with plasmids coding for the mutated C51S or C51A versions of the arylsulfatase protein, expression of sulfatase activity was below the detection limit (Table I), and no growth was possible with aromatic sulfates as sole sulfur source. The changed residue in these constructs, cysteine 51, is equivalent to the residue that is converted to FGly in the sulfatases of eukaryotes and of Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting that FGly plays a crucial role in the Pseudomonas enzyme, as well as in the other sulfatases.Table ISulfatase expression in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and ATS2 and in E. coli DH5αStrainPlasmidEncoded proteinArylsulfatase activitynmol/min/mg proteinP. aeruginosa PAO1AtsA0.1P. aeruginosa ATS2pBBR1MCS0pME4055AtsA22pPAS-S1C51S-AtsA0pPAS-A3C51A-AtsA0E. coliDH5αpBBR1MCS0pME4055AtsA42pPAS-S1C51S-AtsA0pPAS-A3C51A-AtsA0Strains harboring the indicated plasmids were grown in LB medium.

Gene expression in E. coli was induced in the mid-exponential growth phase with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) over 3 h, and arylsulfatase activity was then measured. Arylsulfatase activity in P. aeruginosa was measured in the late exponential phase. In the Klebsiella sulfatase, the FGly is generated from a serine (12Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This sulfatase can be expressed as an active enzyme in E. coli (22Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the loss of arylsulfatase activity caused by the C51S and C51A mutations in thePseudomonas sulfatase was only observed after expression in P. aeruginosa, the same plasmids were used to transformE. coli DH5α. After induction with isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside, arylsulfatase activity was measured in the cell extracts (Table I). Although E. coli carries at least one sulfatase-related gene, the aslA gene (23Daniels K.L. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), this species has not yet been found to express active endogenous sulfatases. Expression of the native Pseudomonas arylsulfatase in E. coli led to significant levels of enzyme activity in the cells, whereas the mutant forms again showed no enzyme activity (Table I). This demonstrates that the P. aeruginosa arylsulfatase can be produced in a stable, active form by E. coli. For further protein chemical studies, the atsA gene and its mutant derivatives were placed under the control of the T7 promoter, and the proteins were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3). After overexpression of the Pseudomonas sulfatase or its C51S derivative in this strain, the target proteins constituted 20–30% of total cell protein (not shown). The wild-type protein and the C51S mutant were purified to homogeneity (4–10-fold purification); the purified wild-type enzyme showed a catalytic activity of 47 μmol/min per mg, whereas the activity of the C51S mutant was extremely low (13 nmol/min per mg). The C51A mutant could not be purified, because it was degraded by the cells on overexpression (not shown). To examine whether residue 51 was converted to FGly, the purified proteins were denatured in guanidine hydrochloride and incubated with NaB[3H]H4, which reduces the aldehyde group of FGly and generates a [3H]serine residue (4Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to reductive carboxymethylation of cysteines. After removal of all low molecular weight compounds by gel filtration, aliquots were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie staining and fluorography (Fig. 1). The wild-type protein was found to carry a 3H-label but the C51S mutant was not labeled by this treatment (Fig. 1 B). The two carboxymethylated sulfatases were digested with trypsin and their tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC. The fractions were analyzed for radioactivity and by mass spectrometry. Radioactivity was recovered only from the wild-type sample (Fig. 2) and found to be associated with a single tryptic peptide (Fig. 2 A) of 1521 Da (Fig. 3 A). This mass is predicted for the [3H]serine 51-containing form of the tryptic peptide 3 comprising residues 42–55 of thePseudomonas sulfatase, i.e. after reduction of FGly-51. A peptide of the C51S mutant eluting with the same retention time (Fig. 2 B) also showed a mass of 1521 Da (Fig. 3 B) but carried no 3H-label (Fig. 2 B). Sequencing of the two peptides led to the amino acid sequence predicted for the reduced wild-type and the C51S form of peptide 3 (Fig. 4, A and B), both carrying a serine in position 51. In the tenth sequencing cycle, corresponding to residue 51, the3H-radioactivity was released from the wild-type peptide (Fig. 4 C). The association of the radioactivity with residue 51 strongly suggests that cysteine 51 in the newly translated wild-type protein had been oxidized to FGly, which was then reduced to [3H]serine by treatment with NaB[3H]H4.Figure 2The tryptic peptide 3 of Pseudomonasarylsulfatase is labeled by NaB[3H]H4. Wild-type and C51S arylsulfatase of Pseudomonas, after treatment with NaB[3H]H4 and reductive carboxymethylation (see Fig. 1), were digested with trypsin, and their tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC. The UV absorbance and the radioactivity (shaded area) associated with the tryptic peptides of the wild-type protein (A) and the C51S mutant (B) are shown. The position of the peptide 3, as identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3, A and B) and amino acid sequencing (Fig. 4, A and B), is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Analysis of the tryptic peptide 3 by mass spectrometry.

The peptide was purified by RP-HPLC of a tryptic digest of the sulfatase (wild-type or C51S mutant) treated (A and B) or not (C–F) with NaB[3H]H4 (see Fig. 2). The mass predicted for the FGly-51-containing peptide 3 is 1518.6 Da and, after Schiff base formation with p-nitroaniline, 1638.7 Da. The serine 51-containing peptide 3 has a mass of 1520.6 Da.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Analysis of the tryptic peptide 3 by amino acid sequencing. The tryptic peptide 3 comprising residues 42–55 of wild-type Pseudomonas sulfatase (A, C, D) or the C51S mutant (B) were subjected to amino acid sequencing (A, B, D) or radiosequencing (C). The amount of each phenylthiohydantoine amino acid (A, B, D) or the radioactivity (C) released per cycle and the type of amino acid identified (abscissa) is given. The material sequenced in panels A–D corresponds to that analyzed by mass spectrometry in Fig. 3, A, B, A, and C, respectively. In D, the Xindicates the position of the FGly 51 in peptide 3 (without NaB[3H]H4 treatment) that blocks Edman degradation. This can be seen most clearly from the loss of proline 53, because the recovery of the serine, threonine, and arginine phenylthiohydantoine derivatives generally is very low (seeA and B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In control samples, in which the treatment with NaB[3H]H4 had been omitted, peptide 3 showed a mass of 1519 Da for the wild-type peptide (Fig. 3 C) and of 1521 Da for the C51S peptide (Fig. 3 D), as predicted for the FGly-51 and serine 51-containing forms of peptide 3. Whenp-nitroaniline was used as a matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of the same peptides, masses of 1639 Da and 1521 Da were determined (Fig. 3, E and F). The increase of the wild-type peptide 3 by 120 Da is because of formation of a Schiff base between the peptide and p-nitroaniline (4Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), thereby confirming the presence of the aldehyde group in the wild-type and its absence in the mutant peptide. Further support for this conclusion was obtained when sequencing the peptides. Whereas the entire sequence of the C51S containing peptide 3 could be determined (not shown, cf. Fig. 4 B), almost no signal was obtained for the C-terminal residues 51–55 of the wild-type peptide (Fig. 4 D). This became most obvious in the case of proline 53, the only amino acid within this sequence (FGlySPTR) that can be recovered with good efficiency during sequencing (see Fig. 4, A and B). The presence of a FGly residue in a peptide is known to block Edman degradation at the position of the FGly (4Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The presence of FGly in the arylsulfatase of P. aeruginosa is a prerequisite for sulfatase activity, as has been observed earlier for the eukaryotic sulfatases (5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11Recksiek M. Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FGly formation in the Pseudomonas arylsulfatase is catalyzed in E. coli by specific oxidation of cysteine residue 51. Generation of FGly appeared to be quantitative, because by mass spectrometry we could not detect the unmodified peptide 3 comprising carboxymethylcysteine 51 (1595 Da) among its tryptic peptides. Modification of thePseudomonas enzyme was only observed on a cysteine residue, and serine could not substitute for cysteine as a substrate for the reaction. This specificity, observed here in E. coli, is most likely also true in P. aeruginosa, because also in this species sulfatase activity could only be detected after expression of the wild-type enzyme, and not with the C51S sulfatase. Interestingly, the arylsulfatase protein was degraded by the E. coli host after replacement of the cysteine 51 by an alanine residue, suggesting that changes in the modification status of the protein may also have an effect on its correct folding in vivo. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, by contrast, it was found that the FGly in the Klebsiella sulfatase is generated by modification of a serine residue (12Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This modification reaction is also catalyzed in E. coli, because the Klebsiellaenzyme can be expressed in E. coli as an active sulfatase (22Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of FGly, i.e. serine semialdehyde, from serine is most likely to be a one-step oxidation process, whereas FGly generation from cysteine has been proposed to occur in two steps involving an oxidation and a hydrolysis reaction (3von Figura K. Schmidt B. Selmer T. Dierks T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is highly unlikely that the cysteine is converted to serine before being oxidized to FGly, because substitution of the critical cysteine residue of thePseudomonas sulfatase by serine abolished FGly formation. Thus, the modification of both cysteine and serine is achieved by direct oxidation of the respective residue found in the primary translation product. The modifying machinery catalyzing this oxidation is highly specific for the respective residue, as was demonstrated for the cysteine-converting system of prokaryotes (this study) and of eukaryotes (6Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Recksiek M. Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6096-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The serine-converting system, which modifies the serine of the Klebsiella sulfatase but not that of thePseudomonas C51S sulfatase, may involve a modification machinery independent of the cysteine-converting system. Alternatively a cofactor may confer specificity to a modification machinery catalyzing FGly formation from either cysteine or serine. Because thePseudomonas sulfatase is a cytosolic enzyme, the cysteine-specific modification system must exist in the cytosol. On the other hand, the Klebsiella sulfatase contains a leader peptide and is exported into the periplasm. The serine-converting system may therefore not be localized in the cytosol, but in the plasma membrane or in the periplasm. In both P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, expression of arylsulfatase is coupled to the sulfur status of the cell, and is repressed when preferred sulfur sources such as sulfate or cysteine are present (21Hummerjohann J. Küttel E. Quadroni M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Dodgson K.S. White G.F. Fitzgerald J.W. Sulfatases of Microbial Origin. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982Google Scholar). When the atsA gene was expressed under lac control, however, arylsulfatase activity was observed even in the presence of excess sulfate. Expression of the bacterial genes encoding the modification system(s) therefore appears to be independent of the sulfur supply to the cells. To date, the FGly modification has only been found in sulfatase enzymes of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origin. However, the presence of FGly modification systems in E. coli, which lacks an active sulfatase gene, and the difference in the regulatory pattern between bacterial sulfatases and the enzyme system that modifies them suggest that other as yet unidentified bacterial proteins also undergo a similar FGly modification. The cysteine-modifying system of prokaryotes shows exactly the same specificity as the eukaryotic system. We anticipate, therefore, that a genetic approach to identify the modifying enzyme(s) in bacteria may be of help in elucidating the genetic defect in human multiple sulfatase deficiency, which leads to synthesis of catalytically inactive sulfatases lacking the FGly.

https://openalex.org/W2038870959,"A single translation product of theFUM1 gene encoding fumarase is distributed between the cytosol and mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All fumarase translation products are targeted and processed in mitochondria before distribution. Here we show that targeting of fumarase is coupled to translation and initially involves insertion of the protein across the mitochondrial membranes and processing by the matrix protease. Rapid folding of fumarase may determine its requirement for coupling of its translocation with translation and unique route of distribution. The amino termini of most fumarase molecules are translocated across the mitochondrial membranes and processed. Unlike the in vivo situation where these molecules are released into the cytosol, in vitro they remain externally attached to the mitochondria, thereby positioned for release from the organelle. Our model suggests that fumarase displays a unique mechanism of targeting and distribution, which occurs cotranslationally and involves folding and retrograde movement of the processed protein back through the translocation pore.

Cytosolic and mitochondrial fumarase isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene (FUM1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that these proteins follow a unique mechanism of subcellular localization and distribution in vivo. First, there is only one translation product of FUM1, and it is targeted to mitochondria by a characteristic NH2-terminal peptide presequence, which is subsequently removed by the mitochondrial matrix peptidase. Second, it appears that a subset of the processed fumarase molecules are fully imported into the matrix, whereas the majority (70–80%) are released back into the cytosol as soluble active enzyme by an unknown mechanism (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The question as to whether in vivo initiation of protein import into mitochondria must occur during (cotranslational) or can, with equal efficiency, occur after completion of protein synthesis (posttranslational) has been addressed previously. It has been proposed that in vivo the normal mode of import of such proteins is co- rather than posttranslational, as suggested by the observations that ribosomes synthesizing mitochondrial proteins were found associated with mitochondria, only minute amounts of some precursors of mitochondrial proteins were detected in yeast cells in vivo,and inhibition of translation inhibits import of mitochondrial proteins (3Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol.

On the other hand, in vivo accumulated precursors were observed to be chased into mitochondria. Thus, practically all naturally occurring proteins that have been studied could be imported posttranslationally in vivo, suggesting that translation and import are not necessarily coupled. In addition, in vitro,virtually all mitochondrial precursor proteins so far investigated are, under appropriate conditions, successfully imported posttranslationally. In the unique case of fumarase, translocation into the mitochondrial matrix in vivo appears to be strictly cotranslational (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When fumarase precursors are accumulated in the cytosol by treating cells with CCCP1 (carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone) treatment, restoration of the membrane potential did not bring about import and the formation of mature fumarase (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).A so far unresolved question is how fumarase ends up in the cytosol, given that processing of all FUM1 products takes place in mitochondria in vivo (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Either full translocation of fumarase takes place followed by processing and export back into the cytosol, or these molecules are partially translocated so that their amino termini become accessible to the matrix peptidase. According to the first alternative, processed fumarase would be secreted out of mitochondria, possibly by a mechanism resembling protein secretion in Gram-negative bacteria. According to the second alternative, following processing, fumarase molecules destined for the cytosol return to this compartment by retrograde movement through the translocation pore.In this report we present data suggesting that a cotranslational event actually appears to be required for the import and processing of the fumarase precursor, as well as for its distribution between mitochondrial matrix and cytosol. We also examine the probability of retrograde movement through the mitochondrial membranes as part of the targeting and distribution mechanism.DISCUSSIONImport of proteins into mitochondria has been generally considered, for many years, not to require cotranslational insertion across the organellar membranes. Virtually all preproteins examined can be imported in vitro after completion of translation. Although it has been suggested previously that import may be affected by inhibiting translation (3Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6841-6847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a good example of a protein that obeys a cotranslational requirement has not been described. Fumarase is unique in this sense, since it clearly exhibits a distinct requirement for coupling of translation and translocation into mitochondria. Precursors accumulated in the cytosol in vivo (by blocking import) cannot be chased into the organelle (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and pFum, synthesizedin vitro in reticulocyte lysate, is efficiently imported when coupled to translation, whereas freshly translated or urea-denatured precursors are not. Furthermore, fumarase-DHFR fusions are not blocked for import in vitro by methotrexate (in coupled translation/translocation experiments). Interestingly, the import of adenylate kinase 2, which is distributed between the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the cytosol, has also been suggested to be coupled with translation and may follow a similar mechanism of distribution (23Bandlow W. Strobel G. Schricker R. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).What is the molecular basis of this phenomenon? One possibility is that the rapid folding of the fumarase precursor determines the coupling between translation and import. Processing of precursor by purified mitochondrial matrix protease in reticulocyte lysate indicates that pFum cleavage sites rapidly become inaccessible. This may render precursors incompetent for translocation during or immediately following translation. Furthermore, fumarase precursors blocked for processing (by mutation or physiologically) aggregate in vivo. One may envisage the fumarase peptide chain emerging from the ribosome and interacting with the mitochondrial translocation machinery prior to translation termination. Other scenarios for the coupling of fumarase translation and import could include participation of molecular chaperones and direct interaction between the ribosome and the translocation apparatus. Notably, yeast strains depleted of the SRP or SRP receptor cotranslational secretory system not only show defects in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum but also minor defects in mitochondrial import (24Ogg S.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine fumarase import and distribution in such mutant strains.Another unique feature of fumarase expression is that the protein is processed by the mitochondrial matrix protease prior to its distribution between the cytosol and mitochondria (2Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is no accumulation of fumarase in mitochondria prior to its ultimate distribution in vivo and in vitro, and fumarase-DHFR fusions are not trapped in mitochondria by methotrexatein vitro. Our data in vitro and in vivo are consistent with partial insertion of the fumarase polypeptide chain across the mitochondrial membranes rather than full import followed by export. In vitro, most of the fumarase and fumarase-DHFR hybrids (in contrast to the control Su9-DHFR) accumulate on the mitochondrial outer membrane in processed form, whereas the minority (as found in vivo) is fully imported. In this sense, distribution in vivo between the cytosol and mitochondria parallels the distribution in vitro between the mitochondrial outer membrane and the mitochondrial matrix. Thus,in vitro the protein remains externally attached to the mitochondria as though unnaturally obstructed at the final release step. At present, the factors and/or physical conditions (apparently missing in the in vitro system), which are responsible,in vivo, for release of processed fumarase from the mitochondrial outer membrane into the cytosol are unknown.Based on the above results and rationale, we suggest that following processing, fumarase molecules destined for the cytosol re-enter this compartment by retrograde movement through the mitochondrial translocation pore. The phenomenon of retrograde movement has been described in a limited number of studies, mainly with respect to vectorial movement of preproteins through membranes in vitro. In such experiments, forward movement of the translocating protein through the translocation apparatus is artificially restricted favoring retrograde movement. For example, experiments have been carried out with mitochondria where the DHFR domain of different fusions with Su9 (Su9(1–48)DHFR and Su9(1–94)DHFR) were stabilized by methotrexate, thereby arresting import (9Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Schneider H.C. Bertold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 321: 768-774Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Such proteins were not long enough in the extended conformation to be maintained in the import apparatus and diffused out. Retrograde movement has also been observed in connection with transport across the endoplasmic reticulum (26Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Cell. 1992; 71: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Garcia P.D. Ou J.H. Rutter W.J. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In one case, backward movement of nascent polypeptides was artificially induced by eliminating the stop codon such that these proteins remained associated with the ribosome, thereby restricting forward movement. It has been suggested that the degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum may generally occur by retrograde transport of polypeptides through the protein conducting channel, followed by their degradation in the cytosol by the proteasome. Such a mechanism was suggested to describe the process by which the human cytomegalovirus eludes cytolytic T cells by triggering destruction of newly synthesized major histocompatibility class 1 molecules (28Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The human cytomegalovirus gene product US2 interacts with these molecules causing them to move back into the cytosol by a reaction that involves the Sec61 complex, a major component of the endoplasmic reticulum translocation apparatus. Thus, the movement of proteins back and forth through the membrane may be a normal cellular function rather than a process that can be observed only in vitro by disturbing the normal translocation process.Is there a connection between the presumed retrograde movement of fumarase and its cotranslational mode of import? One possibility is that fumarase has unique folding properties. In the full protein, we see that rapid folding conceals the mitochondrial targeting sequence within its structure. During translocation, rapid folding of domains of the translating fumarase could restrict its forward motion and cause retrograde movement into the cytosol. Alternatively or additionally, a so far unrecognized sequence after the targeting signal close to the NH2 terminus might retard translocation (e.g. by lacking high affinity binding sites for mitochondrial Hsp70) and thereby favor retrograde movement. We speculate that the following chain of events explain the subcellular distribution of fumarase in the cell (Fig. 8). A single translation product (including the signal peptide) of the FUM1 gene can either be fully translocated cotranslationally into the mitochondrial matrix, or it can be folded into an import incompetent state and released by retrograde movement through the translocation pore into the cytosol. The folding of the initial translation product may be determined by folding information within the protein sequence and participation of molecular chaperones or the translating ribosome. Future experiments will have to determine the specific targeting and sorting information within the fumarase primary sequence and the cellular components that interact with these sequence elements. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fumarase isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene (FUM1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that these proteins follow a unique mechanism of subcellular localization and distribution in vivo.

Neupert W. Cyr D. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Schneider H.C. Bertold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Nature. 1994; 321: 768-774Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Such proteins were not long enough in the extended conformation to be maintained in the import apparatus and diffused out. Retrograde movement has also been observed in connection with transport across the endoplasmic reticulum (26Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Cell. 1992; 71: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Garcia P.D. Ou J.H. Rutter W.J. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In one case, backward movement of nascent polypeptides was artificially induced by eliminating the stop codon such that these proteins remained associated with the ribosome, thereby restricting forward movement. It has been suggested that the degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum may generally occur by retrograde transport of polypeptides through the protein conducting channel, followed by their degradation in the cytosol by the proteasome. Such a mechanism was suggested to describe the process by which the human cytomegalovirus eludes cytolytic T cells by triggering destruction of newly synthesized major histocompatibility class 1 molecules (28Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The human cytomegalovirus gene product US2 interacts with these molecules causing them to move back into the cytosol by a reaction that involves the Sec61 complex, a major component of the endoplasmic reticulum translocation apparatus. Thus, the movement of proteins back and forth through the membrane may be a normal cellular function rather than a process that can be observed only in vitro by disturbing the normal translocation process. Is there a connection between the presumed retrograde movement of fumarase and its cotranslational mode of import? One possibility is that fumarase has unique folding properties. In the full protein, we see that rapid folding conceals the mitochondrial targeting sequence within its structure. During translocation, rapid folding of domains of the translating fumarase could restrict its forward motion and cause retrograde movement into the cytosol. Alternatively or additionally, a so far unrecognized sequence after the targeting signal close to the NH2 terminus might retard translocation (e.g. by lacking high affinity binding sites for mitochondrial Hsp70) and thereby favor retrograde movement. We speculate that the following chain of events explain the subcellular distribution of fumarase in the cell (Fig. 8). A single translation product (including the signal peptide) of the FUM1 gene can either be fully translocated cotranslationally into the mitochondrial matrix, or it can be folded into an import incompetent state and released by retrograde movement through the translocation pore into the cytosol. The folding of the initial translation product may be determined by folding information within the protein sequence and participation of molecular chaperones or the translating ribosome. Future experiments will have to determine the specific targeting and sorting information within the fumarase primary sequence and the cellular components that interact with these sequence elements.

CooA is the first example of a transcriptional regulator containing a heme as a prosthetic group and of a hemeprotein in which CO plays a physiological role. In this study, we constructed an in vivo reporter system to measure the transcriptional activator activity of CooA and prepared some CooA mutants in which a mutation was introduced at Cys, His, Met, Lys, or Tyr. Only the mutations of Cys75 and His77affected the electronic absorption spectra of the heme in CooA. The electronic absorption spectra, EPR spectra, and the transcriptional activator activity of the wild-type and mutant CooA proteins indicate that 1) the thiolate derived from Cys75 is the axial ligand in the ferric heme, but it is not coordinated to the CO-bound ferrous heme; 2) Cys75 is protonated or displaced in the ferrous heme; and 3) His77 is the proximal ligand in the CO-bound ferrous heme and probably also in the ferrous heme, but it is not coordinated to the ferric heme.

The homology between CRP and CooA suggests that they share a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation; however, the effectors of these regulatory proteins are completely different. The most interesting feature of the transcriptional regulation with CooA is that CO is required for the expression of the coo operons (2Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W.

CooA is a new member of the “heme-based sensor proteins.” The coordination structure of the heme is an important factor in the regulation of the function of hemeproteins. In this study, we tried to determine the coordination structure of the heme in CooA by measurements of the electronic absorption spectra, EPR spectra, and the transcriptional activator activity of wild-type and some mutant CooA proteins prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. To measure the activity of CooA, we constructed an in vivo reporter system containing acooF-lacZ operon fusion as the reporter gene. We propose that the heme in CooA exists in a six-coordinate form in ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound ferrous forms and that the exchange of the axial ligand takes place upon the change in the redox state of the heme. By measuring NMR spectra of ferrous and CO-bound ferrous CooA, we found that the conformational change around the heme, which will trigger the activation of CooA by CO, takes place upon the binding of CO to the heme.DISCUSSIONElectronic absorption and EPR spectroscopies revealed that the heme in ferric CooA was in the six-coordinate, low-spin form. In the resonance Raman spectrum of ferric CooA, ν2 and ν3 bands have been observed at 1580 and 1501 cm−1, respectively. 2T. Uchida, S. Takahashi, K. Ishimori, I. Morishima, H. Nakajima, and S. Aono, manuscript in preparation. These values are consistent with the model that the ferric heme in CooA is in the six-coordinate, low-spin state. Ferric CooA shows a clear δ band and a weak charge transfer band at 362.5 and 760 nm, respectively, which are similar to absorptions in P450 cytochromes containing a thiolate as an axial ligand of the heme (42Dawson J.H. Sono M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1257-1273Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of ferric CooA also resembles that of thiolate-ligated hemeproteins such as cytochromes P450 and P420, i.e. the g values observed in ferric CooA (g = 2.46, 2.26, and 1.90) are almost the same as those of substrate-free ferric cytochrome P450cam (g = 2.45, 2.26, and 1.91) (39Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ferric cytochrome P420cam (g = 2.45, 2.27, and 1.91) (40Martinis S.A. Blanke S.R. Hager L.P. Sligar S.G. Hoa G.H.B. Rux J.J. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14530-14536Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in which a thiolate derived from a cysteine is the axial ligand of the heme. These results show that a cysteine is an axial ligand of the ferric heme in CooA.Ferric C75A CooA shows the typical electronic absorption and EPR spectra of five-coordinate, high-spin hemeproteins. C75A CooA showed complex EPR signals in the g = 6 region as shown in Fig. 4, which may be the superposition of the signals due to the heme with a different conformation. As the mutation is introduced at the amino acid acting as the axial ligand in C75A CooA, the conformation of the heme will not be fixed. The spectroscopic properties of wild-type and C75A CooA indicate that Cys75 is an axial ligand of the ferric heme in CooA. The electronic absorption spectra of the ferric CooA mutants at His, Met, Cys, Lys, or Tyr, except for Cys75, are identical to that of the wild type, indicating that these residues are not the sixth axial ligand of the ferric heme in CooA. The EPR spectra of the His77 mutants (H77A and H77Y CooA), which are almost the same as that of the wild type, support that His77 is not coordinated to the ferric heme in CooA. A water molecule is a possible candidate for the sixth ligand of the ferric heme in CooA because ferric CooA shows almost the same EPR spectrum as the substrate-free cytochrome P450cam, which contains a thiolate and a water as the axial ligands (39Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Martinis S.A. Blanke S.R. Hager L.P. Sligar S.G. Hoa G.H.B. Rux J.J. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14530-14536Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, we cannot determine whether the sixth axial ligand in the ferric heme is a water or some amino acid residue.Ferrous CooA shows the typical electronic absorption spectrum of the six-coordinate, low-spin hemeproteins. In the resonance Raman spectrum of ferrous CooA, ν2 and ν3 bands have been observed at 1579 and 1491 cm−1, respectively (43Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These values are similar to those of the ferrous cytochromeb 5 (ν2 = 1583 and ν3= 1493 cm−1 (44Kitagawa T. Kyogoku Y. Iizuka T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yamanaka T. J. Biochem.

Ferrous H77Y CooA showed an electronic absorption spectrum similar to that of deoxymyoglobin that contains a five-coordinate heme. The resonance Raman spectrum of ferrous H77Y CooA shows the split ν3bands at 1470 and 1492 cm−1.2 The frequency of ν3 = 1470 and 1492 cm−1 is similar to that of deoxymyoglobin (ν3 = 1473 cm−1 (45Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) and wild-type CooA (ν3 = 1491 cm−1 (43Uchida T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), respectively. Resonance Raman spectroscopy therefore reveals that both the five-coordinate and six-coordinate hemes exist in ferrous H77Y CooA.2 On the other hand, ferrous H77A CooA shows an electronic absorption spectrum similar to that of wild-type CooA. The electronic absorption spectra of ferrous H77A and H77Y CooA are typical of six-coordinate and five-coordinate hemeproteins, respectively. These results suggest that His77 may be the axial ligand of the ferrous heme or may be located near the heme in ferrous CooA.Cys75 is coordinated to the ferric heme in CooA as described above. Is it also coordinated to the ferrous heme? Ferrous low-spin, thiolate-ligated heme complexes and hemeprotein such as H450 (a soluble iron protoporphyrin IX-containing protein of unknown function (46Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13637-13645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) typically exhibit Soret peaks at ∼445 nm (46Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol.

It has been reported that the blue shift in the wavelength of the Soret peak of ferrous H450 takes place from near 450 nm to ∼425 nm upon lowering the pH to 6, which requires that the thiolate (cysteinate) ligand is either protonated or displaced upon lowering the pH (46Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13637-13645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Hasegawa T. Sadano H. Omura T. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of ferrous CooA, therefore, Cys75 will be protonated or replaced by another amino acid residue to show the Soret peak at 424.5 nm.The resonance Raman spectrum of CO-bound CooA has revealed that a histidine is the fifth ligand of the heme in the CO-bound form (43Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The stretching modes of Fe–CO and C=O, ν(Fe-CO) and ν(C=O), have been observed at 487 and 1969 cm−1, respectively, in CO-bound CooA (43Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Ohkubo K. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19988-19992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among the His mutants in CooA, only the mutation at His77 affected the properties of the electronic absorption spectra of CooA. These results indicate that His77 is the proximal ligand in CO-bound CooA. The properties of H77A and C75A CooA transcriptional activator activity support that His77 is the proximal ligand of CO-bound CooA, but Cys75 is not. The binding of CO to the heme activates CooA as the transcriptional activator by the conformational change around the heme and finally in the whole molecule as discussed below. Therefore, if the mutation is introduced in the proximal ligand in CO-bound CooA, it will cause the change in the transcriptional activator activity. C75A CooA shows activity similar to that of the wild type, whereas H77A CooA is inactive even in the presence of CO, which supports the above conclusion.On the basis of the above discussion, the model of the coordination structure of the heme in CooA we propose is shown in Fig. 9. CooA shows the unique property that the axial ligand is exchanged upon the change in the redox state of the heme iron. Cys75 is coordinated to the ferric heme, but not to the CO-bound heme. On the contrary, His77 is coordinated to the CO-bound heme, but not to the ferric heme. The similar redox-controlled ligand exchange has been reported for cytochromecd 1 from Thiosphaera pantotropha (51Williams P.A. Fülop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 52Fülop V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The exchange of the axial ligands is thought to be responsible for the adjustment of the redox potential to regulate the internal electron transfer and for the release of the reaction product (NO) from the d1 heme (51Williams P.A. Fülop V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 52Fülop V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the case of CooA, the exchange of the axial ligand upon the change in the redox state of the heme may be concerned with the regulation of the redox potential of the heme.Recombinant CooA expressed in E. coli shows transcriptional activator activity when the reporter strain is grown with CO, when CooA exists in CO-bound form. It has been reported that CooA exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding and binds DNA only in the presence of CO under anoxic, reducing conditions (4He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Fox J.D. He Y. Shelver D. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J.

A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which shows that only CO-bound CooA can bind the target DNA to be active as the transcriptional activator. These results indicate that the binding of CO to the heme in CooA is a very important step in activating CooA as the transcriptional activator. CO should replace one of the axial ligands to bind the heme because the ferrous heme in CooA, which can bind CO, is in the six-coordinate form. NMR spectra of ferrous and CO-bound CooA reveal that the release of the axial ligand from the heme induced by the binding of CO causes some conformational change around the heme. This signal of the conformational change around the heme, which is induced by the binding of CO, will finally change the conformation of the whole molecule to be adapted for the specific binding to the target DNA.The properties of M131L CooA transcriptional activator activity suggest that the alteration of the relative orientation of the two domains, the heme-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain, will be involved in the activation process of CooA, which is triggered by the binding of CO. As Met131 is located at the end of the heme-binding domain and adjacent to the hinge region that connects the heme-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain (14Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the replacement of Met by Leu at position 131 will cause the change in the relative orientation of the two domains by the change in the steric hindrance of the residue at position 131. M131L CooA is active even in the absence of CO probably because the conformation of M131L CooA in the absence of CO will be the same as that of wild-type CooA in the presence of CO. A similar effect of the mutations around the hinge region has been reported in the case of CRP (53Garges S. Adhya S.

The activity of M131L CooA is up-regulated compared with that of the wild type, but the reasons for this up-regulation are not obvious at present.CooA is a new member of the heme-based sensor protein family.

Acyl-CoA metabolism plays a critical role in regulating protein N-myristoylation by the essential enzyme, myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p). In this report, we have examined whether Faa1p and Faa4p have distinct roles in affecting protein N-myristoylation as cells transition from growth in rich media to a growth-arrested state during nutrient deprivation (stationary phase). The colony-forming potential of 10 isogenic strains was defined as a function of time spent in stationary phase. These strains contained either a wild type or mutant NMT1 allele, and wild type or null alleles of each FAA. Only the combination of the Nmt mutant (nmt451Dp; reduced affinity for myristoyl-CoA) and loss of Faa4p produced a dramatic loss of colony-forming units (CFU). The progressive millionfold reduction in CFU was associated with a deficiency in protein N-myristoylation that first appeared during logarithmic growth, worsened through the post-diauxic phase, and became extreme in stationary phase. Northern and Western blot analyses plusN-myristoyltransferase assays showed that Nmt is normally present only during the log and diauxic/post-diauxic periods, indicating that N-myristoylproteins present in stationary phase are “inherited” from these earlier phases. Moreover,FAA4 is the only FAA induced during the critical diauxic/early post-diauxic transition. Although substitution of nmt1–451D for NMT1 results in deficiencies in protein N-myristoylation, these deficiencies are modest and limited by compensatory responses that include augmented expression of nmt1–451D and precocious induction of FAA4in log phase. Loss of Faa4p from nmt1–451D cells severely compromises their capacity to adequately myristoylate Nmt substrates prior to entry into stationary phase since none of the other Faaps are able to functionally compensate for its absence. To identify Nmt1p substrates that may affect maintenance of proliferative potential during stationary phase, we searched the yeast genome for known and putative N-myristoylproteins. Of the 64 genes found, 48 were successfully deleted in NMT1 cells. Removal of any one of the following nine substrates produced a loss of CFU similar to that observed in nmt1–451Dfaa4Δ cells: Arf1p, Arf2p, Sip2p, Van1p, Ptc2p, YBL049W (homology to Snf7p), YJR114W, YKR007W, and YMR077C.

Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt; EC2.3.1.97) catalyzes the co-translational covalent attachment of myristate (C14:0) to the N-terminal glycine of a subset of important eukaryotic and viral proteins (1Johnson D.R.

Genetic studies have established that Saccharomyces cerevisiaeNmt1p1 is essential for survival during vegetative growth (4Duronio R.J. Towler D.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I.

At least two metabolic pathways produce myristoyl-CoA that can be used by Nmt1p during vegetative growth: de novo synthesis by the fatty acid synthetase (Fas) complex and activation of myristate by cellular acyl-CoA synthetases (fatty acidactivation proteins or Faaps) (7Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Four unlinkedFAA genes have been identified to date. None are needed to sustain vegetative growth when Fas is active (7Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Faa1p and Faa4p are both able to activate imported myristate, have similar acyl chain length specificities in vitro, and together account for 99% of the myristoyl-CoA synthetase activity in log phase cells treated with the Fas inhibitor cerulenin (8Knoll L.J.

While both Faa1p and Faa4p can activate exogenous fatty acids, including myristate, in log phase cells, studies of isogenic strains containing various combinations of faa null alleles have demonstrated that Faa1p plays the predominant role (7Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The acyl chain specificity of purified Faa2p, a peroxisome-associated enzyme (11Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W. Distel B. van den Berg M. Vilela C. Rodrigues- Pousada C. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), is similar to that of Faa1p and Faa4p. Faa3p accommodates longer chain fatty acids than the other Faaps but has markedly lower acyl-CoA synthetase activity for C8:0 to C18:0 and prefers monoenoic fatty acids as substrates (palmitoleic acid (C16:1Δ9, 10) and oleic acid (C18:1Δ9, 10); Ref. 8Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of Faa1p or Faa4p, but not Faa2p or Faa3p, can compensate for the combined loss of Faa1p and Faa4p in faa1Δfaa4Δ cells when Fas is inhibited. This suggests that Faa2p and Faa3p are either unable to gain access to exogenously supplied fatty acids or to deliver them to required intracellular sites of metabolic processing (7Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The apparent functional redundancy of Faa1p and Faa4p in log phase cells suggests that they may have distinct functions under varying physiologic conditions. One such condition is the transition from exponential growth when nutrients are abundant to growth arrest during a nutrient-deprived state (stationary phase). Exhaustion of nutrient supplies, combined with the reported increased rate of degradation of the α and β subunits of Fas during entry into stationary phase (12Schueller H.-J. Fortsch B. Rautenstrauss B. Wolf D.H. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,13Egner R. Thumm M. Straub M. Simeon A. Schuller H.-J. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27269-27276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could require additional contributions from one or more Faaps to maintain cellular pools of acyl-CoAs, including myristoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA metabolism has an important impact on proteinN-myristoylation and is likely to be affected by a cell's nutritional status. The role of protein N-myristoylation in regulating entry into, survival during, or exit from stationary phase has not been reported. However, adaptations required for survival during periods of nutrient deprivation and stress depend upon the ability of cellular signal transduction pathways to monitor and respond to changes in the external environment. N-Myristoylproteins participate in a number of signal transduction pathways; Nmt substrates include serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, kinase substrates, phosphoprotein phosphatases, and the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (1Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 3Boutin J. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To assess the roles of the Faaps and their impact on the regulation of protein N-myristoylation, we generated a panel of isogenic yeast strains containing a wild type or a mutant NMT1 in combination with various faa null alleles. Thenmt1 mutant contains a Gly451 → Asp substitution that reduces its affinity for myristoyl-CoA (5Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Johnson R.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J.

Our results reveal that the Faaps have distinct growth phase-dependent patterns of expression, that Faa4p plays a unique role in regulating protein N-myristoylation during the transition between log and stationary phases, and that specificN-myristoylproteins contribute to stationary phase survival. Yeast strains used in this study were constructed using standard methods (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, strains were grown in 5 ml of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose (YPD) at 24 °C for 7–10 days. Growth rates were monitored by measuring optical density (OD) at 600 nm. After reaching stationary phase (defined as no further net increase in OD600), cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice in 1 m sorbitol, once in deionized water, and then resuspended in 5 ml of deionized water. Incubation was continued at 24 °C with gentle shaking. Aliquots were withdrawn at regular intervals prior to, and 1–45 days after, resuspension in water. These aliquots were plated on YPD plus 2% agar and incubated at 24 °C to define the number of colony-forming units (CFU) that remained as a function of time in water. All experiments were repeated on at least three separate occasions, each time in duplicate. Strains YB332 (NMT1), YB336 (nmt1–451D), YB524 (NMT1faa4Δ), and YB530 (nmt1–451Dfaa4Δ) (Table I) were transformed with pRS316-based episomes (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the open reading frames (ORFs) of several genes under the control of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter (20Bitter G.A. Egan K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These pRS316 derivatives included pBB406 (GPD-NMT1), pBB330 (GPD-FAA1), pBB325 (GPD-FAA2), pBB343 (GPD-FAA3), pBB365 (GPD-FAA4), pBB345 (GPD-TGL1), and pBB351 (GPD-PLB1). pBB145 contained NMT1 under the control of its own promoter (21Duronio R.J.

Transformed strains were grown in 5 ml of the synthetic media and YPD, and their viability during stationary phase assayed as described above. Duplicate aliquots were plated on selective and YPD media to establish that their episomes had been retained during incubation in water. An overnight culture (in YPD) of each isogenic strain was used to inoculate flasks containing 50 ml of fresh YPD. Growth conditions and subsequent resuspension of stationary phase cultures in water were as described above with the exception that the volume of water used to resuspend stationary phase cells was increased proportionally. At various times during growth in YPD or after resuspension in water (see Fig. 1), 5-ml aliquots were removed and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,600 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of cell wall digestion buffer (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7.4, and 250 units of Zymolyase 100-T (ICN)). Zymolyase 100-T was then activated by adding 10 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol/ml of the cell wall digestion reaction solution, and the mixture was incubated at 24 °C with shaking for 15 min. The resulting spheroplasts were pelleted at 1,600 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Lysis of spheroplasts and RNA extraction were performed exactly as described in the Purescript RNA isolation kit protocol (Gentra Systems, Inc.). The integrity of all RNA samples was confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Total cellular RNA (10 μg from each strain at each time point surveyed) was fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 1.1% formaldehyde. RNAs were then transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products). The RNA blots were probed with 32P-labeled DNAs of equivalent specific activity. Labeling was performed using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit from Boehringer Mannheim. Hybridization and washing stringencies were identical to those recommended in the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the GeneScreen Plus membranes. RNA-DNA hybrids were visualized using a storage phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics), and signal intensities were quantitated with software provided with the imaging apparatus. At least two independent RNA samples were prepared per strain per time point. Each RNA, in turn, was surveyed in duplicate or triplicate blots. Each blot contained an internal control RNA prepared from wild type cells that had been harvested at mid-log phase. Blots containing all RNAs from all strains from all time points were simultaneously probed with a given 32P-labeled DNA. These blots were stripped and reprobed with up to three different DNAs. To remove bound probe after each cycle of hybridization, blots were incubated for 30 min at 90 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS. After the final probing, blots were stripped and reprobed with rRNA DNA (kindly supplied by Susan Wente, Washington University). The signal obtained from each RNA sample after probing with each DNA was then divided by the 18 S rRNA plus 25 S rRNA signals obtained from that RNA sample after hybridization with rRNA DNA. This normalized value for the steady state concentration of a given mRNA was then expressed as a percentage of the value obtained from the internal reference RNA control. Values obtained from the reference control for a given mRNA species varied by <5% between blots. Aliquots of cultures were removed at time points 1–7, shown in Fig. 1. Cells were viewed under a 100× oil immersion lens using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with Nomarski optics, both before and after incubation in 0.1% methylene blue (Sigma) for 1–90 min at 24 °C. YB332 (NMT1), YB336 (nmt1–451D), YB524 (NMT1faa4Δ), and YB530 (nmt1–451Dfaa4Δ) were grown overnight in YPD and diluted to an OD600 of 0.005 in duplicate flasks containing 25 ml of YPD. At specified intervals (Fig. 1, time points 1–6), a 3-ml aliquot was withdrawn from each culture and incubated for 2 h at 24 °C with [3H]myristate (100 μCi/ml; final specific activity = 36 Ci/mmol). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, and total cellular lipids were extracted (9Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Extracted lipids were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (1:1), and aliquots containing 200,000 dpm of tritium label were spotted onto Silica gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates (Merck). Phospholipids were separated in a single dimension using a solution of methyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl (25:25:28:10:7) as the solvent. Neutral lipids were fractionated in the presence of ether, petroleum ether, and acetic acid (90:10:1). Purified lipid standards (Sigma) were included in each HPTLC plate and were visualized using iodine vapors. Radiolabeled lipids were then detected by spraying the plates with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) and performing fluorography at −80 °C. Overnight cultures of the various isogenic strains were diluted to an OD600 of 0.005 in duplicate flasks that each contained 75 ml of YPD. At time points 1–6 in Fig. 1, 20-ml aliquots were harvested by centrifugation at 1600 × g. Spheroplasts were prepared as described above and were disrupted by resuspension in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 2 μm leupeptin (Sigma), 2 μm pepstatin (Sigma), and 50 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzolsulfonylfluoride (Boehringer Mannheim)). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations in the resulting cleared lysates were determined according to Peterson (24Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar). An equal mass of protein from each sample was reduced, denatured, and fractionated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the protein blots were probed with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to Candida albicans Nmt that cross-react with S. cerevisiae Nmt1p (26Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Details of this assay have been described by Lodge et al. (15Lodge J.K.

Strains were grown, cells were harvested, total protein was extracted, and Western blots were prepared exactly as described above. The protein blots were subsequently probed with a rabbit anti-S. cerevisiae Arf1p sera (R40, a generous gift of R.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the Western-Light kit from Tropix. Nmt activity was assayed in cell lysates prepared from isogenic strains harvested during log and stationary phases (time points 1 and 6). Cells were collected from 50-ml cultures by centrifugation, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzolsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm pepstatin A, 8 μm leupeptin). An equal volume of glass beads (425–600 μm diameter, Sigma) was added, and the suspension vortexed for 1 min at room temperature alternating with incubation on ice for 1 min for a total of three cycles. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were assayed for Nmt activity using 0.23 μm[3H]myristoyl-CoA and previously defined octapeptide substrates (90 μm; Ref. 14Zhang L.

Molecular signals responsible for polarized sorting have been identified for several membrane proteins which span the bilayer once. Most ion transport proteins are polytopic, however, and little is known of the signals responsible for the targeting of this class of polypeptides. Members of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter family are polytopic membrane proteins found endogenously in both epithelial cells and neurons. We have identified narrowly defined sequences which are required for the proper accumulation of two members of this transporter family in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The highly homologous GABA transporter isoforms, GAT-2 and GAT-3, localize to the basolateral and apical surfaces, respectively, when expressed stably in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We have generated deletion constructs and chimeric transporters composed of complimentary portions of GAT-2 and GAT-3. We find that information which directs their differential sorting is present in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of these two polypeptides. A sequence of 22 amino acids at the C terminus of GAT-2 is required for the transporter's basolateral distribution and is capable of directing GAT-3 to the basolateral surface when appended to the C terminus of this normally apical polypeptide. The deletion of 32 amino acids from the C terminus of GAT-3 causes this transporter to become mislocalized to both surfaces. Moreover, removal of the final three amino acids of GAT-3 (THF) similarly disrupts its apical sorting. The GAT-3 C-terminal sequence resembles motifs which interact with PDZ domains, raising the possibility that the steady state distribution of GAT-3 at the apical plasmalemmal surface requires a protein-protein interaction mediated by its extreme C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. These data provide the first characterization of a protein-based signal required for the apical distribution of a membrane protein.

To generate their functionally distinct plasma membrane domains, polarized cells must be able to confine specific proteins to their appropriate locations (1Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelia and neurons are well studied examples of polarized cells whose structural designs are especially geared toward maintaining compositionally discrete membrane surfaces (2Simons K. Dupree P. Fiedler K. Huber L.A. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T. Olkkonen V. Pimplikar S. Parton R. Dotti C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

In order to achieve their proper distributions in these cell types, membrane proteins must be endowed with sorting signals which specify their sites of functional residence (4Matter K. Yamamoto E.M.

Presumably, sorting signals are recognized by components of a cell's sorting machinery which act upon the targeting instructions they encode. The task of sorting proteins to specific membrane surface domains is accomplished by all polarized cells (1Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, if all polarized cell types utilize a universal sorting machinery or if divergent mechanisms operate in different cell types. Studies of viral glycoprotein targeting have led to the suggestion that neurons and epithelia may employ similar signals and mechanisms to generate polarized protein distributions (2Simons K. Dupree P. Fiedler K. Huber L.A. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T. Olkkonen V. Pimplikar S. Parton R. Dotti C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Nature. 1991; 349: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies suggested that proteins sorted to the apical surfaces of epithelia accumulate in the axons of neurons, while proteins of the epithelial basolateral membrane are restricted to the somatodendritic regions of the neuronal plasmalemma (2Simons K. Dupree P. Fiedler K. Huber L.A. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T. Olkkonen V. Pimplikar S. Parton R. Dotti C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 611-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While there are clearly exceptions to this model (14Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The relationship between membrane protein sorting in epithelia and neurons has been further examined through studies employing members of the GABA1 neurotransmitter transporter family (17Borden L.A.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From this position, GAT-1 can limit the diffusion of GABA and serve to terminate its inhibitory signaling by reimporting the transmitter into the axon terminus, where it can be recycled into synaptic vesicles (21Kanner B.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Iversen L.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1971; 41: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 25Radian R.

When expressed by transfection in the polarized canine kidney epithelial cell line, MDCK, GAT-1 and GAT-3 are sorted to the apical surface whereas GAT-2 and the BGT-1 transporter are restricted to the basolateral domain (23Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In transfected cultured hippocampal neurons, BGT-1 is restricted to somatodendritic surfaces, while GAT-3 can gain access to the axons (26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It would appear, therefore, that these transporters encode sorting information which is interpretable by both neuronal and epithelial protein sorting machinery. In this study we have generated deletion constructs and chimeras of the GAT-2 and GAT-3 transporters in order to determine which protein sequence domains specify membrane targeting in MDCK cells. We find that both GAT-2 and GAT-3 manifest sorting information in their C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. A GAT-2 transporter lacking its C-terminal 22 amino acids is no longer strictly basolateral, but instead is predominantly apical. Additionally, when these 22 amino acids are substituted in place of the GAT-3 C-terminal amino acids, this chimeric transporter accumulates entirely basolaterally, suggesting that these C-terminal residues of GAT-2 contain dominant basolateral sorting information. Likewise, when the C-terminal 32 amino acids of GAT-3 are removed, the resultant truncated transporter is no longer polarized to the apical surface, but is instead found at both surfaces in roughly equal amounts. It would appear, therefore, that both of these GABA transporters embody sorting signals in their cytoplasmic C-terminal tails. Examination of the sequences of these tails suggests that distinct classes of cellular sorting machinery may recognize these signals and act upon their encoded targeting instructions. The clones for GAT-2 and GAT-3 were a kind gift of L. Borden. All GAT cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCB6, at the ClaI and XbaI restriction sites. GAT-3 c-Myc was generated by polymerase chain reaction using primers coding for the EQKLISEEDL c-Myc epitope tag as described (26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GAT-3 Δ32 was generated by inserting an oligonucleotide linker into the GAT-3 sequence between theHindIII site in GAT-3 and the XbaI site in the pCB6 polylinker. This manipulation was complicated by the presence of XbaI sites both 5′ and 3′ of the GAT-3 insert in the pCB6 vector. This caused a GAT-3 fragment with a 5′ XbaI overhang and a 3′ HindIII site to be released from the pCB6 vector. This fragment was isolated and the linker described below was ligated to the HindIII site (the linker was designed such that itsXbaI overhang was only exposed after it was cut withXbaI). The modified fragment was then cut withXbaI so that it now had XbaI overhangs at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. This fragment was then cloned into the pCB6 vector at the XbaI and clones screened for insertions with the correct orientation. The linker was formed by annealing the following oligos, 5′-CTAGAGAATTCCTAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTAGGAATTCT-3′. The linker introduces a stop codon after residue 595, truncating the last 32 amino acids. GAT-3 Δ40N was generated by inserting a linker between theXbaI site 5′ of GAT-3 and the DrdI site just prior to residue 40 of GAT-3. Again, because of the presence of XbaI sites at both 5′ and 3′ ends of the GAT-3 insert, cutting with XbaI and DrdI released a GAT-3 fragment with DrdI and XbaI overhangs from pCB6. As above, the linker was ligated to the DrdI overhang at the 5′ end of this fragment, the modified fragment cut with XbaI to expose the 5′ XbaI overhang and then cloned back into pCB6 at the XbaI site. Clones were screened for insertions with the correct orientation. The oligonucleotide linker was formed by annealing the oligos 5′-CGCGCCGGCGAATTCTAGACCATGG-3′ and 5′-ATGGTCTAGAATTCGCCGGCGCG-3′. This linker encodes an in-frame Kozak consensus start site, a methionine, and follows with the alanine residue at position 41 of GAT-3. GAT-3/C2 was generated by inserting a linker between the HindIII site of GAT-3 and theXbaI site of the pCB6 polylinker. The oligos used to generate this linker were 5′-AGCTCGAGCTGACTTCTCCAGCGACACCGATGACGTCCCTCCTCAGGCTCACAGAACTGGAGTCTAACTGCTAGT-3′ and 5′-CTAGACTAGCAGTTAGACTCCAGTTCTGTGAGCCTGAGGGACGTCATCGGTGTCGCTGGAGAAGTCAGCTCG-3′. The linker codes for the last 22 amino acids and stop codon of GAT-2. GAT-2/C3 was generated by inserting an oligo linker between theApaI site of GAT-2 and the XbaI site of the pCB6 polylinker. Annealing oligos 5′-CACTCAGAGAGAGACTTCGCCAGCTCGTGTGCCCGGCTGAAGACCTTCCCCAGAAGAGCAAGCTTTGAGGGGCGGCCGCCCGAATTCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGAATTCGGGCGGCCGCCCCTCAAAGCTTGCTCTTCTGGGGAAGGTCTTCAGCCGGGCACACGAGCTGGCGAAGTCTCTCTCTGAGTGGGCC-3′ formed the linker. This linker codes for GAT-2 sequence up to amino acid position 578 of GAT-2 and then codes residues 594 and 595 (Lys and Leu) of GAT-3. Insertion of the linker added aHindIII site in the intermediate construct. The GAT-2/C3 intermediate was then cut with HindIII and EcoRI and the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of GAT-3, coding for the last 34 amino acid residues and stop codon of GAT-3, was inserted. The final construct encodes the GAT-2 transporter with its last 24 amino acids replaced by the last 34 amino acids of GAT-3. GAT-2 Δ24 was prepared similarly to GAT-2/C3 using an oligonucleotide linker formed by annealing the following oligos, 5′-CACTCAGAGAGAGACTTCGCCAGCTCGTGTGCCCGGCTGAAGACCTTCCCCAGAAGAGCTGAGGGGCGGCCGCCCGAATTCT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGAATTCGGGCGGCCGCCCCTCAGCTCTTCTGGGGAAGGTCTTCAGCCGGGCACACGAGCTGGCGAAGTCTCTCTCTGAGTGGGCC-3′. This linker codes for a stop codon which truncates the GAT-2 transporter following residue 578. GAT-3 THF− was generated by inserting a linker into GAT-3 between the KpnI site in the 3′ end of GAT-3 and the XbaI site in the pCB6 polylinker. The following oligos were used to generate the linker, 5′-CATCTCTGCCATCACAGAGAAGGAGTGAAT-3′ and 5′-CGATTCACTCCTTCTCTGTGATGGCAGAGATGGTAC-3′. The oligo linker codes for GAT-3 sequence up to residue 624 and then adds a stop codon that truncates the last three amino acid residues. All restriction digests were performed using New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer's protocol. All DNA fragments were isolated using the GeneClean II (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA) system. All DNA constructs were grown in DH5αEscherichia coli and DNA was isolated using Promega (Madison, WI) Miniprep or Maxiprep systems. Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY) competent DH5α E. coli were used for all transformations. All GAT-3 and GAT-2 constructs were sequenced through the relevant junction sites to confirm their integrity. All oligos were prepared by the Keck facility at Yale University and were annealed by heating to 95 °C in annealing buffer (250 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0), and cooling slowly to 25 °C. MDCK cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 units/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Ca2PO4precipitation with 60 mg of cDNA followed by selection in Geneticin (0.9 g/liter) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant colonies were isolated using cloning rings (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) following 7 to 10 days of selection. Clones were initially screened for expression using a modified GABA transport assay (see below) and the positive cell lines were confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence with the appropriate GABA transporter antibodies. The primary antibody R22, used to detect GAT-2, was kindly provided by R. Jahn and L. Edelmann (Yale University). The GAT-3-specific antibodies 669 (N-terminal) and 670 (C-terminal) were kindly provided by B. Kanner (The Hebrew University). The anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody, 6H, has been described previously (14Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, MDCK cells were grown on Costar 24-mm Transwell filter supports (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 7 days prior to the day of the experiment. Filters were excised from the filter rings and the cell monolayers were washed twice in PBS with calcium (0.1 mmCaCl2) and magnesium (1.0 mm MgCl2) (PBS-Ca/Mg) and then fixed in −20 °C methanol for 9 min. Cell monolayers were rinsed in PBS-Ca/Mg and then incubated in permeabilization buffer (PBS-Ca/Mg, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min. Monolayers were then blocked for 30 min in goat serum dilution buffer (16% filtered goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) to reduce nonspecific IgG-binding sites (27Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in goat serum dilution buffer in a humidifying box for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed 3 times for 5 min in permeabilization buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), diluted in goat serum dilution buffer for 1 h at room temperature in a humidifying box. The cells were washed as described above in permeabilization buffer and for an additional 10 min in 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.5. The cells on filters were mounted on a glass slide using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or freshly prepared mounting solution (75% glycerol/PBS with 0.1% p-phenylenediamene). A coverslip was placed over the filter sections and sealed with nail polish. Immunofluorescent images were generated using a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope. Contrast and brightness settings were chosen to ensure that all pixels were within the linear range. Images are the product of 8-fold line averaging. Thexz cross-sections were produced using a 0.2-μm motor step. Transport assays were performed as described previously (26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Briefly, MDCK cells stably expressing a GABA transporter construct were grown on 6.5-mm Costar Transwell filter supports. Cells were plated at an initial density of 4.0 × 104 per filter and allowed to grow under standard conditions for 1 week. Cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS-Ca/Mg and then incubated with a solution containing [3H]GABA at a final concentration of 50 nm(0.33 mCi/ml) for 12 min at room temperature. One hundred-fold excess unlabeled GABA was present at the surface not being assayed for GABA transport activity. The filters were rinsed 3 times in ice-cold PBS-Ca/Mg, excised from the supports, and placed in scintillation vials with 800 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS) for 10 min with gentle horizontal shaking. A 200-μl aliquot of this lysate was removed for use in a protein assay and the remaining 600 μl was mixed well with 5 ml of EcoLume (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and counted in a scintillation counter. Each cell line was assayed in triplicate or quadruplicate with background transport measured in duplicate samples. Combined apical and basolateral background counts were subtracted from the total GAT transporter associated counts prior to calculating the transporter activity. Transport activity was measured in picomole of GABA transported per μm2 of cell monolayer assayed. All chemicals used are from J. T. Baker (Philipsburg, NJ) unless otherwise noted. Our initial studies of the distribution of GAT-3 in MDCK cells made use of specific antibodies directed against this transporter kindly provided by B. Kanner (26Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For subsequent experiments we chose to epitope tag the transporter with the short 10 amino acid c-Myc sequence (EQKLISEEDL). A tagged GAT-3 construct was designed to carry the epitope tag at the extreme C terminus, leaving all 627 amino acids of GAT-3 intact (Fig. 1). GAT-3 c-Myc transiently expressed in COS-1 cells reaches the cell surface and is capable of mediating GABA transport (data not shown). Stably transfected MDCK cells expressing GAT-3 c-Myc transporters also deliver them to the plasma membrane, where they are able to transport GABA. To assess the surface distribution of the tagged transporters, several independently generated GAT-3 c-Myc expressing MDCK lines were grown to confluence on Costar Transwell filters and then examined by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using the N-terminal-specific GAT-3 antibody 669. Surprisingly, all clones of GAT-3 c-Myc examined (more than 10 independent clones) distribute GAT-3 c-Myc roughly equally between both apical and basolateral membrane surfaces (Fig. 2, e and f). This is distinctly different from wild type GAT-3, which is almost entirely apical (Fig. 2, a and b)(26). The basolateral marker, Na,K-ATPase α subunit, remains basolateral in MDCK cells stably expressing GAT-3 (Fig. 2, c and d) as well as all of the other GAT constructs examined in these studies (data not shown). The apical and basolateral distribution of GAT-3 c-Myc is observed both when GAT-3-specific antibodies directed against the C terminus are employed, and with the antibody 9E10 directed against the c-Myc epitope tag (data not shown).Figure 2Cell surface distribution of GAT-3 c-Myc and GAT-3 Δ32 determined by immunofluorescence.

Unlike the wild type GAT-3, both GAT-3 c-Myc and GAT-3 Δ32 are present at the apical and basolateral surfaces of MDCK cells in roughly equivalent amounts. All cells stained for GAT-3 were labeled fluorescently with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies while the Na,K-ATPase α subunit was fluorescently labeled using rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies.

Cells were grown on 6.5-mm Costar Transwell filters for 1 week prior to the assay. Labeled GABA was added to either the apical or basolateral media compartments of the Transwell chamber and cells were incubated for 12 min at room temperature (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Results from the transport assay (Fig. 3) are in good agreement with the immunofluorescence data. GAT-3 c-Myc transport activity is clearly present at both the apical and basolateral surfaces. The ratio of apical to basolateral transport is very close to 1:1 and is independent of the total level of transport. Non-uniform total transport levels most likely reflect variations in transporter expression among cell lines. It is possible that overexpression of GAT-3 c-Myc saturated an apical sorting pathway and that the excess GAT-3 c-Myc was then misdirected to the basolateral surface as a result. It should be noted, however, that several of our wild type GAT-3 cell lines express the GABA transporter at levels greater than our GAT-3 c-Myc cell lines, as determined by comparative Western blotting (data not shown). Despite these high levels of expression, however, all of these cell lines exhibit strict apical polarity, suggesting that we have not attained levels of overexpression sufficient to saturate an apical sorting pathway. It would appear, therefore, that the addition of the c-Myc epitope tag interferes with the proper sorting and localization of GAT-3. One possible explanation for this surprising behavior is based upon the hypothesis that the tag prevents components of the cellular sorting machinery from recognizing and interacting with an apical sorting signal in the C terminus of GAT-3. According to this model the transporter is mis-sorted to both surfaces as a consequence of this putative steric hindrance. To determine whether such apical sorting information resides within the C terminus of GAT-3, and to rule out the possibility that the c-Myc tag itself acts as a basolateral signal, we prepared a GAT-3 C-terminal truncation construct. In GAT-3 Δ32, the C-terminal 32 amino acids are removed while the rest of the transporter remains entirely intact (Fig. 1). These 32 amino acids comprise approximately half of what is predicted to constitute the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GAT-3. GAT-3 Δ32 transporters transiently expressed in COS-1 reach the cell surface and transport GABA, suggesting that this construct is functional and not grossly misfolded (data not shown). Examination of GAT-3 Δ32 stably expressed in MDCK cell lines (more than five independent clones were examined) by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated that, like GAT-3 c-Myc, it is present at both the apical and basolateral surfaces (Fig. 2, g and h). The polarity of several lines of GAT-3 Δ32 examined by GABA transport assay confirmed that the truncated construct is present at both cell surfaces (Fig. 3). The apical to basolateral transport ratio is approximately 1:1 in the GAT-3 Δ32 lines tested. The GAT-3 Δ32 results, combined with the results from the GAT-3 c-Myc construct, rend"

Two guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Sos and C3G, which bind to the NH2-terminal SH3 domain of Crk (CrkSH3(N)), have also been detected in Cas immunoprecipitation complexes (18Vuori K.

The physiological relevance of these associations is not clearly understood, but may be involved in the activation of different downstream pathways. Sos has been shown to be an activator of the Ras/MAP kinase cascade (reviewed in Ref. 22Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and C3G was shown to transmit signals to JNK1 in fibroblasts (23Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the substrate specificity of C3G is directed against the small G-proteins Rap1 and R-Ras (24Gotoh T.

In certain systems, Rap1 can act as Ras antagonist (reviewed in Refs. 26Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 27Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that Rap1 can mediate sustained ERK activation in rat pheochromocytoma cells induced by nerve growth factor (28York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In this study we found that Cas associates directly, in vivoand in vitro, with C3G. This association was mediated through the interaction of the SH3 domain of Cas with a proline-rich motif in C3G and was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Mapping of this motif revealed that it is distinct from the well studied proline-rich motifs of C3G that bind to the CrkSH3(N) domain. The specificity of binding between the CasSH3 domain and C3G was analyzed by mutagenesis of the component residues and a consensus motif for the SH3 domain of Cas was subsequently generated. Two Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrains were used, HF7c (29Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) and SFY526 (30Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1502-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Human 293T kidney epithelial (293T) cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or calf serum, respectively. The human placenta MATCHMAKER cDNA library (HL4003AB) and the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid system (PT1265–1) were obtained from CLONTECH. Polyclonal antiserum to CrkII (C-18) and C3G (C-19) and the monoclonal antibody to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (B-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (RC20), FAK, and Cas were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The cDNA fragment encoding the rat CasSH3 domain (amino acid residues 99 to 161) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using customized primers. EcoRI and BamHI sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends and cloned into pGBT9 (CLONTECH). BamHI and EcoRI sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends and cloned into pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia) and pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia). The cDNA of CasSH3 in pGEX-4T-3 was cut out with BamHI and NotI and subcloned in-frame into the mammalian expression vector pEBG (31Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (261) Google Scholar) that expresses proteins fused with GST. Human full-length C3G (hC3G) was previously cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (32Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). GST-fusion protein constructs for v-CrkSH3 domain wild type, mutant W405L, and c-CrkSH3(C) have been described previously (33Knudsen B.S. Zheng J. Feller S.M. Mayer J.P. Burrell S.K. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Altun-Gutekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ischizaki T. de Graaf P. van Bergen en Heneguowen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner F.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GST-fusion peptides derived from the C3G sequence (amino acid residues 216 to 226 and 265 to 276) were constructed with double-stranded oligonucleotides that possessed a 5′BamHI and a 3′ EcoRI overhang and cloned in-frame into pGEX-2TK vector. For mapping the Cas-binding site in C3G, deletion constructs of C3G were generated by polymerase chain reaction with customized primers and were cloned into pACT2 (CLONTECH). All polymerase chain reaction products and all junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. The HF7c yeast strain, which carries HIS3 and lacZ genes (lacZreporter under the control of GAL4 17-mers UAS), was transformed first with pGBT9-CasSH3 (pGBT9 carries the TRP1 gene as selectable marker) and subsequently with a human placenta cDNA library cloned in pGAD10 (pGAD10 carries the LEU2 gene as selectable marker). Competent yeast cells were obtained using the YEASTMAKER yeast transformation system (CLONTECH), and cells were transformed with the indicated plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double transformants were grown on yeast plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. After 6 days, 365 yeast colonies were individually assayed for β-galactosidase activity by filter assay. The filter assay was carried out as described (35Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformants growing on a filter were lysed by freeze thawing in liquid nitrogen, and each filter was incubated in Z-buffer (16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, 0.246 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0) containing 50 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside solution (20 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in N, N-dimethylformamide) at 30 °C for 4 h (up to 24 h for screening experiments). Positive clones were selected, and target plasmids containing library cDNA inserts were isolated according to the CLONTECH manual and transformed into HB101 bacteria for amplification. Target cDNAs were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Expression and affinity purification of GST fusion proteins were carried out as described elsewhere (36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria harboring the above described expression plasmids were cultured in medium containing 40 mg/ml ampicillin, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and bacteria were cultured for an additional 4 h. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in STE buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and lysed by adding 500 μg/ml chicken lysozyme for 10 min at 4 °C. Digestion of genomic DNA was carried out by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and 50 μg/ml DNase I for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and GST fusion proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Molecular Probes), washed 4 times, and eluted with elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). For in vitro binding assays, cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins or GST alone rebound to glutathione beads, for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed 4 times with HNTG lysis buffer (see “Cell Lysis”), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and then detected by Western blotting. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in 60-mm plastic dishes, and cDNAs were introduced into cells using the modified calcium phosphate transfection system (Stratagene). Whole cell extracts were prepared by detergent solubilization in HNTG lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate) 30 min at 4 °C, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody bound to Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with lysis buffer, and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were blotted onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes and blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking solution 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) before probing with the indicated antibody. Some blots were stripped with Western blot stripping buffer (100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), washed, and re-blocked prior to probing with another antibody. Far Western blotting was carried out with 32P-radiolabeled and purified GST-CasSH3 fusion protein or GST alone. 100 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione beads (100 μl) were incubated with 1 volume of HMK buffer (100 mm sodium chloride, 12 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 100 units of cAMP-dependent heart muscle protein kinase (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of HMK stop buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) and the pellet washed twice with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Radiolabeled GST fusion protein was eluted at room temperature with 1 ml of elution buffer. After incubation in blocking solution, blots were incubated with 0.5 ml of 32P-labeled probe overnight in fresh blocking solution, washed extensively with TBS/Tween, and exposed to autoradiography films (Kodak). CasSH3 domain (Fig. 1) was expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the reporter yeast strain HF7c and used to screen for interactions with a library of human placenta cDNA-encoded polypeptides fused to the transcription activation domain of GAL4. Out of 2 × 106 independent transformants 36 cDNAs supported Cas-dependent transcription activation of two independent reporter genes (HIS3 and LacZ). Analysis of these clones by restriction enzyme digests and sequencing showed that four clones encoded the COOH-terminal noncatalytic part (amino acid residues 752–1025) of FAK (Fig. 2 A). This polypeptide contained only one of the proline-rich sequences described previously as binding sites for the SH3 domain of Cas (6Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Black blotchesindicate interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Six additional Cas interacting cDNAs, representing two distinct overlapping clones C1 and C2, encoded sequences identical to the NH2 terminus of the human guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (Fig. 2 A). The open reading frame of clone C1 is identical to amino acid residues 11 to 446 of C3G. Clone C2 contained a 124-nucleotide insertion at amino acid residue 648 which resulted in an potential truncated protein due to in-frame stop codons. The central region of C3G contains four similar proline-richXPPXLPXK sequences (Fig. 2 A) which bind with high selectivity the CrkSH3(N) domain (37Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since clone C2 encompassed all four proline-rich Crk-binding sites and clone C1 only one Crk-binding site, we were interested to see whether the CrkSH3(N) domain was capable of interacting with both C1 and C2 clones similarly to the CasSH3 domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Interestingly, of two clones only C2 supported CrkSH3(N)-dependent transcription activation (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). These results suggested that either the binding sites for the CasSH3 and CrkSH3(N) domains in C3G are different, or that Cas interacts through the same proline-rich sequence of C3G as Crk but with higher affinity. To analyze the interaction between the CasSH3 domain and C3G in mammalian cells, we examined their in vitro binding. We compared the binding of the CasSH3 and individual CrkSH3 domains to C3G. As shown by Knudsen et al. (37Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the interaction of Crk with C3G is mediated by the NH2-terminal SH3 domain of Crk adapter proteins, which we used as positive control, while no binding has been observed by the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII (c-CrkSH3(C)), which we introduced as negative control. GST fusion proteins containing the different SH3 domains were captured on glutathione beads, and equivalent amounts were incubated with cell extracts from NIH3T3 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3 A, binding of endogenous C3G to the CasSH3 domain was observed to the same extent or even better when compared with the v-CrkSH3 domain. No binding was detectable with c-CrkSH3(C) and GST alone. Furthermore, no binding was observed with v-CrkSH3(W405L), containing a point mutation in the SH3 domain (34Altun-Gutekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ischizaki T. de Graaf P. van Bergen en Heneguowen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner F.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of the SH3 domain of Cas with C3G is direct or is mediated by other proteins, a Far Western blot analysis was carried out. Bacterially expressed GST-CasSH3 domain fusion protein was purified and labeled with 32P on a specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase site located at the COOH-terminal end of GST. The labeled fusion protein was used to probe FAK, C3G, and Crk immunoprecipitates of NIH3T3 cell lysates, which were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. As shown in Fig. 3 B (upper panel), the labeled CasSH3 domain bound predominantly to a single protein with a molecular mass of about 120 kDa (first lane) which corresponds to FAK and to a single protein with a molecular mass of 145 kDa (third lane) which corresponds to C3G, as confirmed by probing with specific antibodies. The direct interaction of the CasSH3 domain and FAK was a confirmation of a previous finding by Harte et al.(7Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and used as positive control in our experiment. Weak binding of labeled CasSH3 domain to C3G but not to Crk could also be detected in Crk immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, second lane). C3G binds to the family of Crk adapter proteins and therefore it can be found in Crk immunoprecipitates. However, the amount of endogenous C3G coimmunoprecipitated by Crk was low. No binding of32P-labeled GST was observed (data not shown). These results show that the SH3 domain of Cas is able to interact directly with C3G. We were also able to detect the in vivo interaction of endogenous Cas and C3G in C3G immunoprecipitates of total cell lysates of human promyelocytic HL60 cells, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (data not shown). However, by applying that method we could not conclude that this in vivointeraction is direct. Crk proteins could act as bridging molecules between Cas and C3G, since they are known to bind to both. Thus we chose to transiently overexpress only the SH3 domain of Cas together with C3G in human 293T kidney epithelial cells. When we cotransfected the GST CasSH3 domain and C3G, we detected C3G in anti-GST immunoprecipitates by anti-C3G Western blotting (Fig. 4, upper panel). Conversely, we detected CasSH3 in anti-C3G immunoprecipitates by anti-GST Western blotting (Fig. 4, second panel). These data suggest that the CasSH3 domain and C3G associate directly in vivo. The site of interaction of C3G with Cas was investigated by assessing the ability of various C3G constructs to support transcription activation in a Cas dependent manner using the yeast two-hybrid assay system (Fig. 5 A). All C3G deletion constructs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pACT2 and expressed as HA-tagged GAL4 activation domain fusion peptides. That allowed us to assay for protein expression of the examined constructs (data not shown). First, we found that the 3′-end of clone C2, construct DL1, which includes three Crk-binding sites, is unable to activate transcription in CasSH3 background. These data immediately suggested that the sequence motif in C3G recognized by the SH3 domain of Cas is different from the Crk-binding sites. Two clones, C1 and C2, overlapped in a region of 330 amino acids, which includes one cluster of PXXP motifs located near the 3′-end of that region (amino acid residues 439 to 446). However, since this cluster of PXXP motifs is also present in construct DL1, it cannot be a binding site for the CasSH3 domain. Two additional clusters of PXXP motifs located in the middle of this overlapping region, amino acid residues 215 to 231 (NH2-terminal cluster) and 267 to 273 (COOH-terminal cluster), could also serve as potential CasSH3 domain-binding sites. All C3G constructs (DL2, DL3, DL4, and DL8) containing both clusters of those proline-rich sequences supported CasSH3-dependent transcription activation. Deletion of the NH2-terminal cluster (residues 215 to 231) of PXXP motifs in construct DL7 did not abolish the interaction between the SH3 domain of Cas and C3G. In contrast, the C3G construct DL5 which lacks the COOH-terminal cluster (residues 267 to 273) of PXXP motifs failed to interact with the CasSH3 domain in our two-hybrid assay. The shortest C3G constructs which were still able to bind the SH3 domain of Cas (DL4 and DL7) contained this COOH-terminal PXXP motif, APPKPPLP (Fig. 5 B). This sequence is different from the Crk binding motif, and indeed DL4 did not interact with CrkSH3 in the two-hybrid assay. The binding capacity of this sequence was further tested by the ability of the peptide GST-V265APPKPPLPGIR to bind endogenous Cas protein (Fig. 6 A). As negative controls, GST fusion peptides carrying proline to alanine or proline to glutamine mutations of the central two prolines (P270A/P271A, P270E/P271E) disrupting all possible PXXP motifs, the core consensus motif for SH3 domain binding, were no longer able to interact with Cas. We also confirmed that endogenous Crk did not bind to the CasSH3 domain. DL5, which contains the NH2-terminal cluster (residues 215 to 231) of PXXP motifs did not support the transcription activation with CasSH3 in the two-hybrid assay. To confirm this observation, we also synthesized GST-T216SPVKPSSPAS, which is similar to the above described motif, and examined its capacity to bind Cas protein. We found that this peptide does not bind either Cas or CrkSH3 domains (data not shown). To analyze the importance of individual amino acid residues within the CasSH3 domain binding motif, a mutagenesis study of the V265APPKPPLPGIR peptide was performed. GST fusion peptides carrying individual point mutations of all proline residues to alanine and lysine to alanine (P267A, P268A, K269A, P270A, P271A, and P273A) or a double mutation (P270A/P271A) were constructed. As shown in Fig. 7, among the proline to alanine mutations only the mutation of residue 267 and residue 270 greatly reduced binding to endogenous Cas (Fig. 7, GST-M1 and GST-M4). In addition, a drastic decrease in binding could be observed when the K269A mutation was introduced. These results showed that those two prolines and a lysine at position 269 are crucial for binding and form the core PXKP motif which is recognized by the CasSH3 domain.

G protein-coupled receptor gonadotropin-releasing hormone cyclic AMP 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol bisphosphate thyroid stimulating hormone transmembrane domain wild-type cholecystokinin. A wide variety of neurotransmitters, peptide and protein hormones, chemokines, growth factors, and other ligands elicit specific cellular responses by binding to plasma membrane receptors that are coupled to one or more heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding/regulatory proteins (G proteins). The primary signaling pathways for many of these receptors have been elucidated (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 2Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to a specific receptor on the cell surface causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with its cognate G protein, stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange on the α subunit of the G protein. The release of the α subunit-GTP and βγ subunits from the receptor-G protein complex, and the activation of effector systems including phospholipase C, adenylyl cyclase, and ion channels, regulate the intracellular levels of inositol phosphate, calcium, cyclic AMP, and other second messengers. Although most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 share a common structure, based on seven membrane-spanning domains, relatively little is known about the functional significance of this arrangement. It probably provides structural and functional integrity to the receptor, and the presence of several conserved amino acid residues in the transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic loops may reflect their role in agonist-induced G protein coupling and signal generation. Mutagenesis and chimeric studies with several receptor-G protein pairs, including the β-adrenergic-Gs, muscarinic acetylcholine-Gi, angiotensin II-Gq, and rhodopsin-Gt, have implicated the N- and C-terminal portions of the third intracellular (3i) loop of the receptors in G protein activation and signal transduction (3Kobilka B.K.

In the case of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor-Gs, dopamine (D1) receptor-Gs, and rhodopsin-Gt, regions within the cytoplasmic tail have also been found to interact with G proteins (12Konig B. Gratzel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Kosugi S. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

An analysis of the structural determinants in the IGF-II receptor, and GPCRs that are associated with Gi and Gsactivation (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed the following criteria: (a) at least two basic residues at the N terminus; (b) either a BBXXB or BBXB motif (where B is a basic amino acid and X is any amino acid) at the C terminus; and (c) a sequence length of 10–26 amino acids. The structural motifs satisfying G protein activation requirements for several GPCRs were conserved in the 2i and 3i loops, and in the C-terminal tail (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides with these structural characteristics, multiple Gi-activating regions were identified in M4 muscarinic cholinergic and α2-adrenergic receptors (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of the rat testicular follicle-stimulating hormone receptor that satisfied these criteria was shown to modulate G protein signaling (16Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not identify functionally important specific residues within the structural motifs. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor is a member of the GPCR superfamily and has several unique structural features. These include (a) the absence of a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail; (b) the replacement of Tyr by Ser in the conserved GPCR “signature” motif DRY located at the junction of transmembrane domain (TMD) III and the 2i loop; (c) the interchange of conserved Asp and Asn residues in TMDs II and VII; and (d) the presence of a relatively long and highly basic 1i loop. These characteristics are conserved in the GnRH receptors of all mammalian species sequenced to date (17Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 18Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the 1i loop of the GnRH receptor, which is coupled to both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cAMP generation, meets the criteria for G protein activation by other receptors that are coupled to Gs and Gi (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 18 amino acid 1i loop of the GnRH receptor contains two basic amino acid residues at the N terminus (Lys59 and Lys62) and a BBXXB motif at the C terminus (Lys71-Lys-Ser-Glu-Lys75) (see Fig. 1). The present study was performed to determine whether these regions of the 1i loop are involved in GnRH-induced signal transduction and receptor internalization. The roles of the N and C termini of the 1i loop of the mouse GnRH receptor in signal transduction mediated by Gq and Gs proteins were evaluated by introducing positive or negative charges into these sequences, or eliminating positive charges. Specifically, residues Lys59, Gln61, and Lys62 at the N terminus of the loop, and Leu73 and Ser74 at the C terminus, were mutated. In addition, the role of two leucine residues located at the junction of the 1i loop and TMDs I and II (Leu58 and Leu80) was assessed. The mutant receptors expressed in COS-7 cells were analyzed for ligand binding, GnRH-induced inositol phosphate and cAMP production, and agonist-induced internalization. The results of this study have demonstrated that specific residues in the 1i loop are required for agonist-induced cAMP responses but are not essential for activation of the phosphoinositide/calcium signaling pathway. GnRH and its agonist (des-Gly10-[d-Ala6]GnRHN-ethylamide, GnRH-Ag) and antagonist ([d-pGlu1,d-Phe2,d-Trp3,6]GnRH) analogs were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., cell culture related products were from Biofluids (Rockville, MD), restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and Sequenase II from United States Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotide primers for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer. The Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Version 2) was obtained from Bio-Rad and was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. AG-1-X8 resin (100–200 mesh formate form) and Poly-Prep chromatography columns for anion exchange chromatography were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of high performance liquid chromatography or analytical grade quality.myo-[3H]Inositol (80–100 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.125I-des-Gly10-[d-Ala6]GnRHN-ethylamide (125I-GnRH-Ag) and125I-S-cAMP-TME were prepared by Covance Laboratories Inc. (Vienna, VA). The 1220-base pair GnRH receptor cDNA subcloned into pcDNAI/Amp at the XbaI site (19Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used as a template for creating site-directed mutations according to the method of Kunkel et al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Meth. Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using a Muta-Gene phagemid in vitromutagenesis kit. Mutations were identified by the dideoxy sequencing method of Sanger et al. (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) using Sequenase II. Wild-type and mutant GnRH receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. To measure inositol phosphate and cAMP responses, internalization kinetics, or125I-GnRH-Ag binding to intact cells, cultures were seeded in 24-well plates (Costar Corp.) at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. The plated cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Pen-Strep) at 37 °C in an atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2, 95% humidified air. At 70–80% confluence, the cells were transfected in 0.5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM I medium with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant plasmid DNA and 6–8 μg of LipofectAMINE/well. Six h later, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and cultures were maintained for 48 h before use in ligand binding and functional assays. The binding affinity and abundance of the mutant receptors were determined in transfected COS-7 cells incubated with 2 nm125I-GnRH-Ag in binding medium (M199 containing 25 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were then rapidly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and solubilized in 0.2 mNaOH, 1% SDS solution. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured by γ-spectrometry. All time studies were performed in duplicate on at least three occasions, and displacement curves were analyzed for binding affinity and capacity by the LIGAND program using a one-site model (22Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Surface expression of most of the mutant receptors ranged from 50 to 82% of that of the wild-type (WT) receptor, except that L73R receptors were better expressed (150% of WT) and S74E receptors were poorly expressed (30% of WT). The expression levels for the L58A, Q61E, K59Q,K62Q, and L80A receptors were 82, 51, 44, and 71%, respectively, of the wild-type. The 100% level of wild-type receptor expression corresponded to 710 fmol/mg protein. Irrespective of differences in plasma membrane binding sites, the mutant receptors had similar binding affinities with apparent K d values in the range of 1.6 to 3.1 nm for the various mutants. TheK d of the wild-type receptor was 1.8 ± 0.2 nm (n = 3). The nonspecific binding for the125I-GnRH-Ag determined in the presence of unlabeled agonist (1 μm) for wild-type or mutant receptors was always less than 5% of the respective total binding. For internalization assays, transfected COS-7 cells were washed once with binding medium before the addition of 2 nm125I-labeled GnRH agonist. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of the unlabeled GnRH agonist. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated with 1 ml of 50 mm acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl (pH 2.8) for 12 min to remove surface-bound tracer. The acid-released radioactivity was collected to determine the receptor-bound radioactivity, and the internalized (acid-resistant) radioactivity was quantitated after solubilizing the cells in NaOH/SDS solution. Radioactivities were measured by γ-spectrometry, and the internalized radioligand at each time point was expressed as a percent of the total (acid-resistant + acid-released) binding. COS-7 cells were labeled 24 h after transfection by incubation in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol as described previously (19Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After 24 h of labeling, cells were washed with inositol-free M199 medium and preincubated in the same medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with increasing doses of GnRH (10−10 to 10−6m) for 20 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (5% v/v final concentration). The inositol phosphates were extracted and separated by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (23Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and their radioactivities (InsP2 + InsP3) were measured by liquid scintillation β-spectrometry. After 48 h of transfection, cells expressing WT or mutant receptors were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of GnRH (10−10 to 10−6m) in serum-free medium (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) containing 0.1% BSA, 30 mg/liter bacitracin, and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium and freezing the cells in 0.5 ml of cold ethanol. The samples were processed for extraction, and intracellular cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (24Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using a specific cAMP antiserum at a final dilution of 1:5,000. This assay showed no cross-reaction with cGMP, 2′,3′-cAMP, ADP, GDP, CTP, or isobutylmethylxanthine. The data were analyzed by the GraphPad PRISM program using nonlinear regression analysis and the best fitted sigmoidal dose response. Six substitution mutations were created in the 1i loop of the mouse GnRH receptor, as shown in Fig. 1. Two modifications at the N terminus of the loop included mutation of residues Gln61 to Glu, and Lys59 and Lys62 to Gln (a double mutant). At the C terminus, residues Leu73 and Ser74 in the BBXXB motif were mutated to Arg and Glu, respectively. In addition, leucine residues (Leu58 and Leu80) located at the juxtamembrane portions of the N and C termini of the 1i loop, respectively, were individually replaced with alanine. Measurement of 125I-GnRH-Ag binding in intact COS-7 cells transfected with WT or mutant GnRH receptors, to determine the cell-surface expression and the functional integrity of the expressed receptors, indicated that the WT and modified receptors bound the radioligand with high affinity. Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded linear plots, reflecting a single class of GnRH-binding sites with similar dissociation constants (see “Experimental Procedures”). The ability of the mutant receptors to couple to phospholipase C via Gq/G11 proteins was determined by measuring the inositol phosphate (InsP) responses of transfected COS-7 cells stimulated with 10−10−10−6m GnRH in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. Under these experimental conditions, the major accumulated products of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in GnRH receptor-transfected cells are InsP2 and InsP3 (19Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The GnRH-induced InsP responses mediated by receptors with mutations at the N terminus (L58A, Q61E, and K59Q,K62Q) were similar to those of the WT receptors, and their EC50values were 1.5–3.6 nm; the EC50 for the WT receptor was 1.4 ± 0.2 nm (n = 4) (Fig. 2 A). Among the C-terminal mutant receptors the InsP response of the L73R receptor was normal, with EC50 of 1.0 nm. For the S74E and L80A receptors, agonist potency was moderately impaired, as indicated by increases of EC50 to 9 and 15 nm, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). The magnitudes of the InsP responses elicited by a saturating concentration of GnRH (1 μm) for the mutant receptors were 80–110% of that for the wild-type response. Because the plasma membrane binding sites of cells expressing the mutant GnRH receptors showed significant differences (see “Experimental Procedures”), corrections for variations in expression levels of the mutant receptors were made by normalizing their signaling responses to the number of cell-surface binding sites measured in the same experiment. We have previously shown a linear relationship between the measured receptor sites and the InsP responses to GnRH stimulation in receptor-transfected cells (23Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Normalization of the data based on receptor number showed that the InsP responses mediated by the L73R and L80A receptors were similar to that of the WT receptor. The InsP responses of the L58A, Q61E, K59Q,K62Q, and S74E mutants were augmented relative to the WT receptor, suggesting that the “activated” state of these receptors couples more efficiently to Gq than the activated wild-type receptor. These results indicated that modifications at the N and C termini of the first loop of the GnRH receptor do not greatly affect the ability of the receptors to activate phospholipase C. The ability of the wild-type GnRH receptor to activate adenylyl cyclase is shown in Fig. 3. Treatment with increasing concentrations of GnRH (10−9−10−6m) elicited a continuous rise in cAMP accumulation with a single slope (Hill coefficient 0.9). The maximal response was at least 2-fold over basal levels, with an estimated EC50 of 9 nm. Cells transfected with vector alone showed no increase in GnRH-induced cAMP production (Fig. 3). The receptor specificity of the cAMP response was demonstrated by the ability of a GnRH antagonist (1 μm), applied prior to stimulation with GnRH, to abolish cAMP production (Fig. 4); the antagonist itself elicited no cAMP response. These results indicated that the GnRH receptors expressed in COS-7 cells are functionally coupled not only to the phosphoinositide/phospholipase C pathway, but also activation of the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway. The ability of the 1i loop mutant receptors to mediate GnRH-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase, as judged by cAMP production, was also examined in transfected COS-7 cells. The dose-dependent responses are shown in Figs. 5 A and 6 A, and the normalized data based on receptor sites are shown in Figs. 5 B and 6 B. Among the N-terminal mutants (Fig. 5), the cAMP response of cells expressing the L58A receptor was markedly impaired, with reduction of 80% from that of the wild-type receptors in response to a maximal (1 μm) concentration of GnRH (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the cAMP response for the Q61E receptor did not differ from that of the WT receptor, and K59Q,K62Q receptors were about 20% less effective than the WT receptor. The effects of the C-terminal mutants on the cAMP response were much more pronounced, as shown in Fig. 6. cAMP production for the L73R and S74E receptors was reduced by 80–90% of the WT response, and the L80A receptors failed to activate adenylyl cyclase in GnRH-treated cells (Fig. 6 B). These results indicated that modifications of the first loop, specifically at its C terminus, dramatically impair the ability of the GnRH receptors to activate adenylyl cyclase activity.Figure 4Blockade of agonist-induced cAMP response by a GnRH antagonist. Prior to stimulation with GnRH, cells were treated with a GnRH antagonist (1 μm, 30 min).

These data are representative of three similar experiments each performed in quadruplicate. Panel B, the cAMP responses normalized to the number of 125I-GnRH-Ag binding sites. These data were calculated after subtracting the respective basal levels in nonstimulated cells from the maximal response obtained after stimulation with 1 μm GnRH and then normalized to the number of expressed receptor sites. Results are expressed as percent of the wild-type response. For values shown, the S.E. values were less than 10% of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Effects of site-directed mutations in the C-terminal of 1i loop of GnRH receptor on GnRH-induced cAMP responses. For details, see the legend to Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of mutations on ligand-induced internalization were evaluated by measuring the kinetics of125I-GnRH-Ag uptake over a period of 60 min at 37 °C in cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptors. A direct comparison between the wild-type and mutant receptors was made by plotting the percent of bound radioligand that was internalized with increasing time of incubation (Fig. 7, A and B). Most of the mutant receptors at the N terminus, and L73R at the C terminus, showed internalization kinetics similar to that of the wild-type. However, internalization of the S74E and L80A mutants was reduced by about 50% after 1 h (Fig. 7 B). To gain insight into the structure/function relationships of the GnRH receptor, we constructed a series of GnRH receptors with mutations in the first intracellular loop and compared their binding characteristics and second messenger signaling properties with those of wild-type receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. These analyses revealed that mutations of residues Leu58, Lys59, Gln61, and Lys62 at the N terminus, and Leu73, Ser74, and Leu80 at the C terminus, of the 1i loop had no significant effect on the Gq-coupled phospholipase-catalyzed inositol phosphate production. However, Gs-coupled adenylyl cyclase-activated cAMP production was severely impaired by substitutions at the carboxyl-terminal region of the loop. These findings demonstrate that residues in the 1i loop are required for selectively coupling to adenylyl cyclase but are not essential for coupling to the phospholipase C pathway. The similar binding parameters of the mutant receptors to those of the wild-type receptor indicate that the substitutions did not alter the structural integrity of the receptor and that impairment of the cAMP response was not because of reduction of binding affinity. This observation, and the capacity of the mutant receptors to mediate normal GnRH-induced InsP responses, suggest that the global structure of the receptors was preserved. A search of the primary sequence of the GnRH receptor for putative G protein-coupling regions, based on conserved sequence motifs with confirmed G protein coupling functions (for Gs and Gi) within the sequences of other receptors, indicated that the 1i loop may act as a receptor-G protein activation region. Application of the structural criteria used to identify G protein activating domains in a number of Gi/Gs coupled receptors (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the GnRH receptor revealed that the 1i loop has at least two basic residues at the N terminus and a BBXXB sequence motif at the C terminus. In other receptors, this motif is usually present in the 2i or 3i loop, or in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in the tail-less GnRH receptor, it is located in the 1i loop, which is longer and richer in basic residues than most other receptor loops in this position. The present studies on the GnRH receptor describe the first mutational analysis of this structural motif previously identified in other GPCRs by the synthetic peptide strategy (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that most of the biological actions of GnRH are mediated by Gq-coupled pathways, leading to elevations of InsP3, diacylglycerol, and intracellular Ca2+ (17Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), increased cAMP signaling may also mediate physiological responses in gonadotropes. Previous reports have suggested a physiological role of cAMP as a mediator of GnRH actions in the pituitary gland (25Bourne G.A. Baldwin D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E290-E295PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in hypothalamic neuronal GT1–7 cells, the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by forskolin or application of 8-bromo-cAMP was found to mimic GnRH receptor activation by stimulating neurosecretion (24Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some recent reports have shown that GnRH can activate the Gs-coupled adenylyl cyclase pathway. For example, GnRH-stimulated cAMP production in GH3 cells stably expressing the rat GnRH receptor was found to mediate prolactin release through a cholera toxin-sensitive G protein (26Kuphal D. Janovick J.A. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of GnRH receptors in GT1 cells not only stimulated phospholipase C activity but also increased cAMP production in a biphasic manner, suggesting that the GnRH receptor can interact with both adenylyl cyclase stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins. 2L. Z. Krsmanovic, N. Mores, K. K. Arora, and K. J. Catt, unpublished observations. The present results suggest that the structural determinants that are associated with Gs/Gi activation are not essential for Gq-coupled inositol phosphate formation, but are important for Gs-coupled cAMP production. In this regard, our results are in accordance with observations on Gs- and Gi-coupled receptors studied by synthetic peptide strategies (15Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grasso P. Leng N. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the present study demonstrates that these structural criteria are not involved in the activation of phosphoinositide/calcium signaling pathway, and identifies specific amino acid residues involved in Gs coupling. Clearly, positive charges are important for the receptor-Gs protein interaction. If the overall charge is unbalanced by adding an acidic or basic residue at the C terminus of the 1i loop, the Gs-coupled adenylyl cyclase-activated cAMP response is severely impaired. Thus, it is probable that these structural regions/residues confer specificity to the receptor-G protein activation (Gs versus Gq). Upon agonist binding, GnRH receptor activation causes a Gq-mediated increase in protein kinase C activity and elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. It is possible that the activation of adenylyl cyclase observed in GnRH receptor-expressing COS-7 cells (Figs. 3 and 4) is caused by Gβγ released during Gq activation, increased protein kinase C activity, or elevated Ca2+ levels (27Antoni F.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 7-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the largely unchanged profile of InsP signaling for each of the mutants negates the possible involvement of these factors. Receptor coupling to multiple G proteins, i.e. dual coupling or cross-talk, has been observed in several recent reports. Thus, receptors for LH/CG, cholecystokinin A (CCK-A), and TRH can couple to both phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase pathways (28Herrlich A. Kuhn B. Grosse R. Schmid A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16764-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Laugwitz K.-L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In some receptors, such dual coupling has been attributed to differences in their intracellular loops, or to the presence of specific regions in the loops. For example, a CCK-B receptor chimera containing five amino acid residues from the 1i loop of the CCK-A receptor (GLSRL to IRNKM) was able to confer cAMP signaling, demonstrating that the 1i loop of CCK-A receptor is essential for G protein coupling and effector activation (30Wu V.

In another study, mutations in the 2i loop of the rat parathyroid hormone receptor (specifically Lys319) were found to result in selective loss of agonist-induced phospholipase C activity, whereas the capacity of these mutant receptors to stimulate adenylyl cyclase was unimpaired (31Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Takemura M. Drake M.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Abou-Samra A. Bringhurst R. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6882-6889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In metabotropic glutamate receptors, residues in both the 2i and 3i loops have been implicated in selective coupling to Gs and Gq α-subunits (32Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol.

However, the precise interactive sites vary considerably among the individual receptors. Recently, the β2-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) was found to couple to both Gs and Gi, and protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the β-AR was shown to serve as a switching mechanism to regulate the dual G protein coupling specificity of the receptor (35Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). It is quite likely that a similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanism will be found to operate in other GPCRs. In conclusion, our results show that activation of cAMP signaling by the GnRH receptor is dependent on specific residues in the 1i loop that are not required for the concomitant stimulation of inositol phosphate production. In addition, the presence of basic residues in the BBXXB motif at the C terminus of the 1i loop, or a combination of positive charges, is important for coupling the GnRH receptor to Gs and adenylyl cyclase. However, these residues do not appear to be required for ligand-induced internalization of the receptor."

However, the binding sites involved in these interactions have not been elucidated.

These genetic disorders clearly underscore the importance of these two proteins in lipoprotein biogenesis. ApoB is the structural protein required for lipoprotein assembly and secretion. MTP, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein, is a heterodimer of a unique 97-kDa subunit and a 58-kDa ubiquitous folding enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase. MTP is known to enhance the rate of lipid transfer between donor and acceptor vesicles in vitro (for a recent review, see Wetterau et al. (5Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)). Further evidence for the importance of MTP in lipoprotein assembly was obtained by co-expressing apoB and MTP in nonhepatic and nonintestinal cells that do not express endogenous apoB or MTP (6Gordon D.A.

Compounds that inhibited lipid transfer activity in vitrodecreased secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in cultured cells. Recently, evidence has been presented for protein-protein interactions between apoB and MTP, which may be important for achieving net transfer of lipids to apoB during its translation or may reflect a separate chaperone-like activity for MTP in apoB folding and assembly (15Wu X.

ApoB and MTP bind with high affinity, and these interactions are affected by the length and degree of lipidation of apoB (17Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal 18% of apoB are critical for these interactions (18Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the binding sites involved in these protein-protein interactions are not known. In the present study, we have used fusion proteins containing defined sequences of apoB to map an MTP binding site.RESULTSWe had previously demonstrated that optimum binding of MTP occurs with the N-terminal 18% (1–781 amino acids) of apoB (17Hussain M.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that apoB13 also interacted with MTP. Based on these studies, we thought that a high affinity MTP binding site would be present in the N-terminal region of apoB. To identify the binding site, we expressed different regions of apoB as FLAG/apoB chimeras (25Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Huang X.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31872-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). FLAG (DYKDDDDK) is an octapeptide that is commonly used as an epitope tag. The cDNAs were transiently transfected into COS cells, and the conditioned media were used to examine the secretion of FLAG/apoB chimeras using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2 (Table I). The FLAG/apoB chimeras containing B:1–300, B:270–570, and B:1–502 were secreted to a similar extent. These data on the secretion of different apoB peptides are consistent with earlier metabolic labeling studies (25Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, we studied the binding of secreted peptides to immobilized MTP and compared it with their binding to M2 (Table I). Even though significant amounts of B:1–300 bound to M2, the binding of this polypeptide to MTP was not measurable (Table I). In contrast, similar amounts of B:270–570 bound to M2 and MTP (MTP:M2 ratio of 0.93). On the other hand, B:1–502 interacted very poorly with immobilized MTP; the amount bound to MTP was 25% of that bound to M2. Compared with B:270–570, B:1–502 exhibited only ≈30% of the MTP binding. These studies indicated that optimum MTP binding occurs with B:270–570 of apoB, and truncations in this region at amino acid 502 results in significant loss (≈70%) of this binding.Table IBinding of different apoB sequences to the immobilized MTPFLAG-chimeras expressing apoB sequences (amino acids)Immobilized anti-FLAG M2 (optical densities)Immobilized MTP (optical densities)Ratio (MTP/M2)Binding (% of 270–570)270–5700.76 ± 0.100.71 ± 0.150.931001–3000.85 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.020.0441–5020.73 ± 0.110.18 ± 0.070.2527No DNA00COS cells were transfected with indicated plasmids expressing various apoB sequences.

The optical densities were determined at 405 nm. The data are representative of 10 independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The experiments were then extended to study these interactions in solution (Fig. 1). For this purpose, MTP or M2 was incubated with radiolabeled B:1–300 and B:270–570, and complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to MTP or M2 (Fig. 1). In this experiment, the amount of B:1–300 coimmunoprecipitated with M2 was 6-fold higher than that of B:270–570, indicating that the amount of B:1–300 secreted was that much higher. Nonetheless, only B:270–570 was co-immunoprecipitated with MTP. The amount of B:270–570 coimmunoprecipitated with M2 and MTP was similar. In control experiments, anti-mouse IgG or anti-MTP IgG did not precipitate B:1–300 or B:270–570 (data not shown). These data indicate that B:270–570 recognizes both soluble and immobilized MTP.To confirm further that B:270–570 contains an MTP binding site, we studied the effect of AGI-S17 on the binding of B:270–570 to MTP (Fig. 2). AGI-S17 is an antagonist that inhibits LDL-MTP binding, has no effect on the lipid transfer activity of MTP and decreases apoB secretion in hepatoma cells. 2A. Bakillah, unpublished observations. AGI-S17 (10 μm) inhibited 70% of the binding of B:270–570 to immobilized MTP, but did not inhibit binding to immobilized M2 (Fig. 2). These studies further support the evidence that B:270–570 contains a binding site for MTP.Figure 2Effect of AGI-S17 on the binding of B:270–570 to MTP. Microtiter plates were coated with M2 or MTP. Conditioned medium (100 μl) from transiently transfected COS cells was used in triplicate to study the binding of B:270–570 to immobilized M2 or MTP in the presence of different concentrations of AGI-S17 for 2 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data plotted are means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we hypothesized that an MTP binding site might be smaller than the 300 amino acid residues of B:270–570. To test this hypothesis, we deleted amino acids from the C terminus of B:270–570. Consideration was given to truncating polypeptides at naturally occurring proline residues to avoid disruption of helical structures predicted in this region (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K.

Plasmids expressing various truncated forms of the B:270–570 were transiently transfected in COS cells, and the amounts of synthesized and secreted peptides were determined by radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and exposure to PhosphorImager screens (Fig. 3). The amounts of different FLAG/apoB chimeras synthesized by transfected cells were similar; however, the amounts of secreted chimeras were very different. B:270–570 was efficiently secreted by these cells, whereas B:270–394 was secreted with the least efficiency. Next, we measured the secreted chimeras by enzyme-linked immunoassay using immobilized M2 (Table II). The secretion efficiency observed for these peptides was B:270–570 > B:270–509 and B:270–430 > B:270–341 > B:270–394, which is in agreement with the results obtained from radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). Next, we determined the binding of these peptides to MTP (Table II). The amounts of B:270–570 bound to M2 and MTP were similar since the ratio between their binding was close to one. This binding is consistent with the data in Table I. On the other hand, the ratio (MTP/M2) of B:270–509 binding was 0.52, indicating that loss of amino acids 510–570 decreased the binding to MTP by ≈58% (Table II). Further truncation of B:270–570 to B:270–430 and B:270–341 resulted in complete loss of binding to MTP. This loss was not due to low levels of the chimeras being secreted because the binding of B:270–430 to M2 was similar to that observed for B:270–509 (Table II). These studies indicate that deletion of amino acids 430–570 in apoB disrupts its ability to interact with MTP.Figure 3Synthesis and secretion of different chimeras expressing C-terminally truncated forms of B:270–570. Various C-terminal truncations were made in B:270–570 at naturally occurring proline residues.

The data are representative of four independent experiments. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence indicated that amino acids 430–570 in apoB are critical for MTP binding. First, binding of FLAG/apoB chimeras to MTP was independent of FLAG and prolactin sequences but was dependent on the presence of apoB sequences corresponding to amino acids 270–570 (Table I). Second, specific apoB sequences were required for MTP binding. For example, B:270–570, but not B:1–300, interacted with MTP (Table I). Third, B:270–570 bound to immobilized as well as soluble MTP (Table I and Fig. 1). Fourth, binding of B:270–570 to MTP was inhibited by a compound that inhibits LDL-MTP binding (Fig. 2). Fifth, MTP binding was lost with successive C-terminal deletions in B:270–570 (Table II). Sixth, loss of MTP binding was independent of the length of the peptide. For example, B:1–502 and B:270–509 terminate within this sequence and bind poorly to MTP (Tables I and II).Chou-Fasman analysis (data not shown) of amino acids 430–570 predicted the presence of two α-helices (B:496–508 and B:529–541) containing three positively charged amino acid residues each. We have previously shown that protein-protein interactions between apoB and MTP are ionic and that lysine and arginine residues in apoB are crucial for these interactions (17Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that these helices may in part be responsible for interactions between apoB and MTP.The MTP binding site identified in the present study resides within N-terminal 13% of apoB. This region has been predicted to exist as an amphipathic globular domain (28Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that two disulfide bonds within the first 250 amino acids are crucial for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (26Huang X.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31872-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Tran K. Borén J. Macri J. Wang Y. McLeod R. Avramoglu R.K. Adeli K. Yao Z. J.

Our studies indicate that the MTP binding site is present downstream of these crucial cysteine residues. However, it is possible that native disulfide bond formation is required to expose the MTP binding site during lipoprotein assembly.To obtain some information about the importance of the MTP binding site, we looked for conservation of the identified apoB sequence in other species. Complete apoB sequences from other species are not available in the data banks (see also Segrest et al. (29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Pierotti V. Young S.H. Borén J. Innerarity T.L. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 85-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, a partial pig apoB sequence (accession no. I46567.pir2) was found to be 74% identical to B:430–570. Within this site, the two identified α-helices were found to be 85% identical in human and pig. By comparison, the LDL receptor binding domains in human and pig have been shown to be 72% identical (33Ebert D.L. Maeda N. Lowe S.W. Hasler-Rapacz J. Rapacz J. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1501-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conservation of the two identified helices in these two species suggests that they may be functionally significant.The involvement of B:430–570 in MTP binding is consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated that apoB-MTP binding occurs between C-terminally truncated apoB polypeptides and MTP (17Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with our earlier observations that heparin- and MTP-binding sites may be different (18Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heparin has been shown to bind residues 5–99, 205–279, 875–932, and 2016–2151 in apoB48 (34Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11097-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the identified MTP binding site does not contain the heparin-binding consensus sequences (X-B-B-X-B-X and X-B-B-B-X-X-B-X) proposed by Cardin and Weintraub (35Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the MTP binding site is located after the heparin binding site present at 205–279. In addition to heparin, apoB is also known to exhibit ionic interactions with the LDL receptor (34Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11097-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W.M. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The LDL receptor binding site has been shown to consist of two sequences called sites A and B (36Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W.M. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The LDL receptor binding sites A and B were compared (data not shown) with the α-helices present in the putative MTP binding site. No significant similarity between these sequences was observed. Thus, MTP, heparin, and LDL receptor binding sites, while all reliant on ionic interactions, are structurally distinct.In conclusion, the data presented in this study suggest that B:430–570 plays an important role in MTP binding. Furthermore, this may be the site responsible for MTP binding within apoB that underlies the physical interactions observed between MTP and various truncated forms of apoB (15Wu X. Zhou M.

The knowledge of the specific MTP binding site will facilitate efforts to elucidate the mechanism by which both the binding and lipid transfer activities of MTP, separately and/or in combination, contribute to the biogenesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Lipoprotein biosynthesis is defective in abetalipoproteinemia due to mutations in the gene for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)1 whereas, in hypobetalipoproteinemia, plasma lipoprotein levels are low due to mutations in the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene (for reviews, see Refs.1Schonfeld G.

These genetic disorders clearly underscore the importance of these two proteins in lipoprotein biogenesis. ApoB is the structural protein required for lipoprotein assembly and secretion. MTP, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein, is a heterodimer of a unique 97-kDa subunit and a 58-kDa ubiquitous folding enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase. MTP is known to enhance the rate of lipid transfer between donor and acceptor vesicles in vitro (for a recent review, see Wetterau et al. (5Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)). Further evidence for the importance of MTP in lipoprotein assembly was obtained by co-expressing apoB and MTP in nonhepatic and nonintestinal cells that do not express endogenous apoB or MTP (6Gordon D.A.

In contrast, co-expression of apoB with MTP resulted in the synthesis and secretion of apoB polypeptides as lipoprotein particles (6Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E.

The requirement for lipid transfer activity of MTP in the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins was established by the use of inhibitors (9Haghpassand M. Wilder D."

The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues represents one of the most immediate biochemical events that follows binding of antigen to the T-cell receptor (TCR).1 They are a prerequisite for all further downstream events of T-cell activation (including the mobilization of calcium ions, the activation of phospholipase Cγ, and the loading of GTP onto p21), which collectively lead to the induction of lymphokine gene expression. Several nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases have been implicated in these initial signaling events, including the Src kinases p56 and p59 as well as the Syk-related protein tyrosine kinase ZAP70 (1Burkhardt A.L.

Studies of Fyn-deficient mice have demonstrated that loss of Fyn does not lead to major alterations of T-cell development (8Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), suggesting that the events associated with positive and negative selection can occur in the absence of Fyn. However, it has been demonstrated recently that combined disruption of lck and fyn genes in mice results in an arrest of T-cell development at the CD4−CD8− stage, whereas reintroduction of a fyntransgene completely restores production of double-positive thymocytes (10van Oers N.S.C.

These findings demonstrate that Fyn can partially substitute for Lck in T-lymphocyte development but also reveal overlapping functions of both kinases at different stages of T-cell selection. Evidence implicating Fyn in the activation of peripheral T-cells includes its binding to the TCR-CD3-ζ complex (12Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1992; 29: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that mature T-cell lines that express Fyn only at low levels exhibit TCR signaling defects (16Lee S.-K. Shaw A. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Rigley K. Slocombe P. Wahid S. Mandair K. Bebbington C. J.

Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). One strategy to define further the role(s) of p59 during the T-cell activation is to identify its downstream substrates and to analyze the proteins that interact with Fyn in intact cells. Using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE analysis of p59 immunoprecipitates, we have demonstrated previously that Fyn, but not Lck, co-precipitates with at least four constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120, 85, 55, and 43 kDa in nontransformed resting human T lymphocytes (19Marie-Cardine A.

Koretzky G. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 57: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We recently purified and cloned the 55-kDa protein, which we have termed Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP55) (19Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). SKAP55 represents a novel phosphoprotein that is expressed exclusively in T-lymphocytes and comprises a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and tyrosine-based sequence motifs that would be predicted to mediate high-affinity interactions with SH2 domains of Src kinases. Indeed, we demonstrated that SKAP55 is precipitated by recombinant SH2 domains of Src protein tyrosine kinases but not by SH2 domains of other molecules involved in signaling processes in T-lymphocytes (19Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The structural organization of SKAP55 thus suggests that it represents a novel adaptor protein that is involved in Fyn-mediated signaling events in T-lymphocytes. However, the precise role of SKAP55 during T-cell activation remains unclear. A major challenge in understanding its function will be the identification and molecular characterization of SKAP55 binding partners in T-cells. Recently we have also cloned a novel substrate of the TCR-stimulated protein tyrosine kinases, which we termed SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein 76 (SLP-76)-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa (SLAP-130). This molecule was identified initially as a protein that associates with the SH2 domain of the hematopoietic cell-specific protein SLP-76 (22Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Importantly, SLAP-130 is identical to Fyn-binding protein (FYB), which was characterized originally as a protein that interacts with the SH2 domain of Fyn (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). Like SKAP55, SLAP-130 is expressed exclusively in mononuclear cells of the hematopoietic system, with preferential expression in T-lymphocytes and monocytes. It has no obvious structural motifs to suggest a function; however, it possesses several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites that could mediate interactions with SH2 domain-expressing proteins. In addition, a proline-rich region is present in SLAP-130 that could allow for association with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Interestingly, both our laboratories and da Silva et al. (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar) found that SLAP-130/FYB not only binds to the SH2 domains of Fyn and SLP-76 but also associates with a so far not characterized tyrosine-phosphorylated 55-kDa protein in T-cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that this unknown SLAP-130-associated protein likely represents SKAP55. In addition, using a transfection system in COS cells as well as the yeast two-hybrid analysis, we demonstrate that the association between SLAP-130 and SKAP55 is direct and involves the proline-rich region of SLAP-130 and the SH3 domain of SKAP55. Together these data suggest that SLAP-130 and SKAP55 may represent newly identified components of a Fyn-mediated signaling pathway in T-lymphocytes.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) expression vectors containing amino-terminal FLAG- or HA-tagged cDNAs of SKAP55 were generated by PCR amplification of the full-length SKAP55 coding region with a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an NheI site at the 3′ end. The resulting PCR product was ligated in frame with the FLAG or HA epitope in pEF-BOS expression vector, as described (26Musci M. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J.

FLAG-tagged SKAP55 mutated constructs were produced using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis system from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). 5′ and 3′ primers encompassing the desired deletion or point mutation were designed leading to: 1) a SKAP55 truncation mutant encoding a deletion of the PH domain (Δ106–205, referred to as SKAP55 ΔPH), 2) a SKAP55 construct missing the SH3 domain coding region (Δ300–356, SKAP55 ΔSH3), and 3) a point mutant of SKAP55 where the first (absolutely conserved) tryptophan of the characteristic tryptophan doublet of the SH3 domain was changed to lysine (SKAP55 W333K).

For all constructs, verification of the desired mutations was checked by double-stranded sequencing of the corresponding clones. The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the Matchmaker two-hybrid system and protocol provided by Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cDNA encoding either full-length or truncation mutants of SLAP-130 was subcloned in frame into the pGBT9 vector, creating a fusion protein with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain. cDNA encoding either the wild type or the deletion or point mutation mutant of SKAP55 was subcloned in frame into the pGAD424 vector to generate a fusion protein with a GAL4 activation domain. The yeast strain HF7c was transformed with the plasmid constructs using the lithium acetate method described byClontech. Transformants were plated on synthetic medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine to detect the histidine phenotype or onto synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to measure transformation efficiency. The activity of the LacZ gene product β-galactosidase in transformants was measured in a filter assay with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. COS-7 cells (107) were washed once in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Each transfection was carried with 30 μg each of the two indicated plasmids using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with settings of 320 V and 960 μF. Cells were allowed to recover for 18 h before manipulation. Cell lysates were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-p59, anti-SKAP55, or anti-SLAP130 antibodies as previously reported (19Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B.

Western blots were conducted with the indicated antibodies and developed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham). To confirm the previous finding of da Silva et al. (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating an association of FYB with Fyn in murine T-cells, we investigated whether human SLAP-130 also associates with Fyn in vivo. To this end we subjected Fyn immunoprecipitates prepared from Jurkat T-cells to Western blot analysis using polyclonal SLAP-130 antiserum. The data shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 1, demonstrate that SLAP-130 indeed co-precipitates with Fyn under these experimental conditions. We next asked whether the previously described 55-kDa phosphoprotein that has been reported to associate with FYB in T-lymphocytes could represent SKAP55 (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). Our approach was to perform reciprocal immunoprecipitation in which anti-SKAP55 or anti-SLAP130 immunoprecipitates were prepared from Jurkat cells and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against the putative binding partner. As shown in Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3, large amounts of SLAP-130 co-precipitate with SKAP55 (lane 2), and, conversely, high levels of SKAP55 are detectable in the anti-SLAP130 immunoprecipitate (lane 3). These results support the notion that SKAP55 associates with SLAP-130 in T-lymphocytes. To evaluate the amounts of SLAP-130 and SKAP55 that are associated with each other, a preclearing experiment was performed. To this end, Jurkat cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40-containing buffer and subjected to four consecutive rounds of immunoprecipitation using anti-SKAP55 or anti-SLAP-130 antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates from the first and fourth preclearing steps as well as the corresponding lysates were analyzed by anti-SLAP-130 and anti-SKAP55 Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). These experiments revealed that ∼70% of the endogenously expressed SLAP-130 molecules constitutively associate with SKAP55 in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5). In contrast to SLAP-130, all endogenously expressed SKAP55 molecules can be completely depleted from cellular lysates after SLAP-130 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 8–10). Identical results as shown here for Jurkat T-cells were obtained when peripheral blood T-lymphocytes were subjected to SLAP-130 immunoprecipitation. These data collectively suggest that all SKAP55 molecules that are expressed in Jurkat cells (and in resting T-lymphocytes) constitutively associate with SLAP-130, whereas ∼30% of the endogenously expressed SLAP-130 molecules do not interact with SKAP55. To begin to analyze whether the association between SKAP55 and SLAP-130 results from a direct interaction between both molecules or whether their association requires additional molecules expressed in T-lymphocytes, FLAG-tagged cDNA constructs coding for SKAP55 and SLAP-130 (Fig. 2) were individually or coordinately expressed in COS cells in a transient transfection assay. Subsequently, anti-SKAP55 immunoprecipitates were prepared and analyzed by anti-FLAG Western blotting for co-precipitation of SLAP-130. As shown in Fig. 1 C, FLAG-tagged SLAP-130 can be co-precipitated by SKAP55 antibodies when both molecules are co-expressed in COS cells. These data suggest that SKAP55 and SLAP-130 are capable of associating with each other in the absence of additional lymphocyte-specific proteins. To map the region within SKAP55 that is responsible for its binding to SLAP-130, COS cells were transiently co-transfected with a wild-type FLAG-SLAP-130 construct in combination with a series of FLAG-tagged SKAP55 mutants (Fig. 2). After anti-SKAP55 immunoprecipitation, the presence of FLAG-tagged SLAP-130 in the SKAP55 immunoprecipitate was investigated by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3 A). Protein expression of the SLAP-130 and SKAP55 molecules was determined in parallel by anti-FLAG Western blot of total cell lysates (Fig. 3 B). As shown, deletion of the SKAP55-PH domain (SKAP55 ΔPH) does not influence the SLAP-130-SKAP55 association. In marked contrast, when a SKAP55 construct lacking the complete SH3 domain (SKAP55 ΔSH3) was expressed in COS cells, a complete loss of SLAP-130 binding to SKAP55 was observed. Identical results are obtained when a SKAP55 mutant was expressed in which a critical tryptophane residue in the SH3 domain was mutated to lysine (SKAP55 W333K). These data demonstrate clearly that the SH3 domain of SKAP55 is involved in the binding to SLAP-130. We next attempted to identify the region within SLAP-130 that mediates its association with SKAP55. To this end, a similar set of co-transfection experiments as described above were performed using mutated versions of SLAP-130 (Fig. 2). To allow discrimination between wild-type SKAP55 and the SLAP-130 mutants, the wild-type SKAP55 molecule was expressed as an HA-tagged protein, whereas the SLAP-130 mutants were tagged with the FLAG epitope. For each experiment, both the wild-type SKAP55 construct and a wild-type or mutant variant of SLAP-130 were expressed in COS cells. After immunoprecipitation using anti-SKAP55 antiserum, co-precipitation of wild-type SLAP-130 or of the various mutants was assessed by anti-FLAG Western blotting. As a control, anti-FLAG and anti-HA blotting of total lysates and of the SKAP55 immunoprecipitates were performed to demonstrate that equivalent amounts of protein were expressed in the cells and that for each experimental condition equal amounts of SKAP55 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4,A, bottom panel, and B). The results shown in Fig. 4 A, top panel, demonstrate that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 335 amino acids of SLAP-130 (SLAP5′) does not affect its binding to SKAP55. In contrast, a SLAP-130 construct in which the amino-terminal 448 amino acids have been deleted (SLAP3′) fails to bind to SKAP55. These data suggest that the region of SLAP-130 that is responsible for its interaction with SKAP55 is located within the amino-terminal 448 amino acids of the protein. The SLAP5′ mutant contains a sequence motif of ∼100 amino acids, which is enriched in proline residues, whereas the SLAP3′ mutant comprises most of the putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, two possible nuclear translocation sequences as well as a region with homology to an SH3 domain. Because of the highly selective binding of SLAP-130 to the SH3 domain of SKAP55, we speculated that the proline-rich region present in the SLAP5′ construct mediates the binding between SLAP-130 and SKAP55. To investigate this further, a construct coding only for the proline-rich sequence of SLAP-130 (SLAP-Pro) was generated and tested for its ability to interact with SKAP55. As expected, this small region of SLAP-130, when expressed in isolation, is capable of binding to SKAP55, inferring its involvement in the SKAP55-SLAP-130 interaction. To confirm that the SKAP55-SLAP-130 association is direct and that it involves the protein domains that were mapped by the use of the co-transfection approach in COS cells, we investigated SKAP55-SLAP-130 interaction with the yeast two-hybrid analysis. The mutant constructs shown in Fig. 2 were subcloned into yeast expression vectors creating fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding or activation domains. Each construct was tested individually and shown to not autonomously activate the reporter gene by itself (results not shown). Fig. 5 depicts the results of a growth assay on synthetic medium either lacking leucine and tryptophane to demonstrate the presence of plasmids encoding the fusion proteins (left panel) or lacking leucine, tryptophane, and histidine to detect an interaction between wild-type or mutated SLAP-130 and SKAP55 fusion proteins (right panel). As shown, both the full length SLAP-130 (WT) and its truncation mutants containing the central proline-rich region (SLAP 5′ and SLAP-Pro) interact directly with SKAP55 and result in growth. In addition, both wild-type SKAP55 (WT) and the SKAP55 mutant lacking the amino-terminal PH domain (ΔPH) were able to bind SLAP-130. In contrast, no interaction was detected either when the SLAP-130 mutant lacking the proline-rich motif (SLAP 3′) or when SKAP55 mutants lacking a functional SH3 domain (ΔSH3 or W333K) were co-transformed. These results were confirmed by detection of β-galactosidase activity in the yeast transformants initially shown to express interacting the fusion protein pair by growth assay (data not shown). In summary, these results confirm that the association of SKAP55 with SLAP-130 is direct and is mediated through the SH3 domain of SKAP55 and the proline-rich motif of SLAP-130. In an effort to define better the role of p59 during T-cell activation, we recently began a search for proteins that might represent specific substrates or regulating factors for this kinase. Our approach resulted in the identification of a Fyn-associated protein complex comprising Fyn as well as additional phosphoproteins of 120, 85, 55, and 43 kDa (19Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E.

Lett. 1997; 57: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the 55-kDa Fyn-associated polypeptide revealed that it possesses an amino-terminal PH domain and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. In vitro, the full-length protein was found to selectively bind Src-like SH2 domains and was therefore termed SKAP55 (19Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The structural organization of SKAP55 suggests that it represents a novel adaptor protein that may be involved in Fyn-mediated signaling processes in T-lymphocytes. Recently, da Silva et al. (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of the 120-kDa Fyn-associated phosphoprotein. This molecule, termed FYB, is identical to SLAP-130, which we initially identified as a phosphoprotein that binds to the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (22Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this report we confirm that SLAP-130 and Fyn associate with each other in Jurkat cells. In addition, we demonstrate that SLAP-130 also interacts with SKAP55 under stringent lysis conditions. The interaction between SKAP55 and SLAP-130 is direct and does not require additional molecules, as judged from the ability of SKAP55 and SLAP-130 to associate in COS cells (Figs. 3 and 4) and to interact in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 5). This view is further supported by our observation that transiently transfected wild-type SKAP55 interacts with endogenously expressed SLAP-130 in Jurkat cells, whereas this association is not detectable with SKAP55 mutants lacking a functional SH3 domain (data not shown). Our data therefore indicate the existence of a molecular complex that is formed in Jurkat cells between SLAP-130 and SKAP55 and thus suggest that SKAP55 is identical to the 55-kDa phosphoprotein that has previously been shown to associate with FYB (24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of SKAP55 truncation mutants that were coexpressed with wild-type SLAP-130 in COS cells or in the two-hybrid selection system allowed us to define the sites of interaction between SKAP55 and SLAP-130. Our data demonstrate that the association between SKAP55 and SLAP-130 requires the SH3 domain of SKAP55. Deletion of this domain or mutation of the conserved tryptophane residue to lysine results in complete loss of SLAP-130 binding to SKAP55 (Figs. 3 and 5). Conversely, deletion of the central proline-rich sequence of SLAP-130 leads to the abolishment of its association with SKAP55, whereas the isolated domain is capable of binding to SKAP55 (Figs. 4 and 5). Which of the individual proline residues of the SLAP-130 proline-rich domain are involved in its interaction with the SH3 domain of SKAP55 is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, our data indicate that SKAP55 and SLAP-130 directly interact with each other in Jurkat cells and COS cells and that this association is mediated via the SH3 domain of SKAP55 and the proline-rich domain of SLAP-130. The functional role that the SKAP55-SLAP-130 complex serves during T-cell activation is not yet clear. We have reported previously that overexpression of SLAP-130 in Jurkat cells inhibits rather than enhances nuclear factor of activated T-cell activation (22Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, SLAP-130 notably antagonizes SLP-76 function when both molecules are co-expressed (22Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of SKAP55 in transformed T-cell lines (including Jurkat cells) does not interfere with TCR-mediated activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell or of the interleukin 2 gene. 2A. Marie-Cardine, L. R. Hendricks-Taylor, N. J. Boerth, H. Zhao, B. Schraven, and G. A. Koretzky, unpublished data. Given the high stoichiometry of the interaction between SKAP55 and SLAP-130, the diverging functional consequences following overexpression of the two molecules in Jurkat cells seem to be surprising. However, we have reported recently that in transformed human T-cell lines SKAP55 does no longer interact with Fyn, whereas the protein clearly coprecipitates with the kinase in resting T-cells (20Schraven B. Bruyns E. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S. Marie-Cardine A. Yakura H. Kinases and Phosphatases in Lymphocyte and Neuronal Signalling. Springer, Berlin1997: 100-111Google Scholar,21Schraven B. Marie-Cardine A. Koretzky G. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 57: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis for these alterations of the Fyn complex in transformed T-cell lines is not yet clear, the presently available data suggest that in T-cell lines SKAP55, whether overexpressed or not, lacks one major binding partner, namely Fyn, and therefore may not be capable of modulating TCR-mediated signaling events. The elucidation of the functional role that the SKAP55-SLAP-130 complex plays during T-cell activation might thus require analysis in nontransformed T-cells (e.g. T-lymphocytes of SKAP55- or SLAP-130-deficient mice). The data shown in Fig. 1 A as well as previous observations (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Mueller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2007-2016PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that a fraction of SLAP-130 is expressed in transformed cell lines that coprecipitate with Fyn. In addition, the preclearing experiment shown in Fig. 1 B clearly demonstrated that although all endogenously expressed SKAP55 molecules associate with SLAP-130, a substantial fraction of SLAP-130 (∼30%) is present in Jurkat cells that does not interact with SKAP55 under the same experimental conditions. Because SKAP55 is undetectable in Fyn immunoprecipitates prepared from transformed cells, these data together suggest that the Fyn-associated fraction of SLAP-130 may not interact with SKAP55. Thus, ∼30% of SLAP-130 is expressed in Jurkat cells, which may exert its function independently of SKAP55. The question why the Fyn-associated fraction of SLAP-130 does not bind to SKAP55 and why SKAP55 does not interact with Fyn in Jurkat cells was not addressed in this study. However, one possibility could be that Fyn-associated SLAP-130 is expressed in a conformational state that does not allow binding to the SH3 domain of SKAP55 and therefore prevents the interaction between SKAP55 and Fyn. A second possibility could be that the proline-rich region of the Fyn-associated fraction of SLAP-130 binds to an unknown molecule that contains an SH3 domain, and that this interaction interferes with the association between SKAP55 and SLAP-130. It is tempting to speculate that the complex formed among Fyn, SLAP-130, and the unknown SLAP-associated protein may be involved in regulation of nuclear factor of activated T-cell activity. Overexpression of SLAP-130 potentially could alter the composition of such a trimolecular complex, thereby interfering with TCR function. A second possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of SLAP-130 overexpression on SLP76 function is based on the observation that tyrosine-phosphorylated SLAP-130 binds to the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (22Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R.

Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a tyrosine-phosphorylated pool of SLAP-130 could interfere with the recruitment of an additional tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that is required for SLP-76-mediated induction of interleukin 2 promotor activity. In this regard it has been reported that, besides SLAP-130, an as yet unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated 62-kDa protein (p62) precipitates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 in TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells (14Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this protein binds directly to the SH2 domain of SLP-76 or indirectly via SLAP-130. Molecular cloning of p62 and biochemical analysis of the SLP-76-SLAP-130-p62 complex is required to answer this question. In addition, it will be necessary to determine the stoichiometry of interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated SLAP-130 and SLP-76 and to analyze whether the SLP-76-associated portion of SLAP-130 associates with SKAP55 and/or Fyn or with other signaling molecules expressed in T-lymphocytes. In contrast to the inhibitory effect that SLAP-130 exerts in Jurkat cells, overexpression of FYB in a murine T-cell hybridoma appears to enhance TCR-induced interleukin 2 production rather than to inhibit it (23da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the divergent observations in Jurkat cells versus the murine T-cell hybridoma is unclear at present but could be due to the fact that functionally different types of cells were analyzed in the two studies. With regard to the latter point it is important to mention that we have recently cloned a 55-kDa molecule that is structurally highly related to SKAP55. This molecule, which we termed SKAP-HOM, for SKAP homologue, is not expressed in Jurkat cells but is coexpressed with SKAP55 at high levels in the murine T-cell hybridoma that was used to analyze the function of FYB. 3A. Marie-Cardine, A. M. Verhagen, C. Eckerskorn, and B. Schraven, submitted for publication. Importantly, when transiently expressed in Jurkat cells or COS cells, SKAP-HOM binds to SLAP-130 (possibly via its SH3 domain). It is intriguing to speculate that the relative levels of expression of SKAP55 versusSKAP-HOM in different types of T-cells regulate the functional activity of adaptor proteins including SLAP-130 or SLP-76 and thus determine the signaling phenotype of particular T-cell lines. Precise biochemical analyses will be necessary to elucidate the stoichiometry of interaction among Fyn, SKAP55, SKAP55-HOM, SLAP-130, and SLP76 in different populations of T-lymphocytes and to define the functional roles that the individual members of this network of adaptor proteins play during T-cell activation. In addition, further understanding of these signaling complexes will require molecular cloning of p62 as well as of the Fyn-associated p85 and p43 molecules."

Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1is an important plasma protein that functions in triacylglycerol and cholesterol transport. In addition to its structural role in stabilization of circulating lipoproteins, apoE serves as a ligand for at least three lipoprotein receptors, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, the LDL receptor-related protein, and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (1Dergunov A.D.

By directing the cellular uptake of circulating lipoproteins, apoE functions in maintenance of plasma lipid homeostasis. The critical role played by apoE in this process is vividly seen in apoE knockout mice, which are predisposed to hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (2Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A.

Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon thrombolytic cleavage, it is possible to separate the two domains (7Wettereau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which retain structures similar to those present in the intact protein (10Aggerbeck L.P. Wettereau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the 22-kDa N-terminal domain has been determined by x-ray crystallography (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), revealing an elongated globular four-helix bundle. Individual helices (up to 37 amino acids) are distinctly amphipathic and orient with their hydrophobic faces directed toward the center of the bundle. This molecular architecture, which resembles the structure of invertebrate apolipophorin III (12Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,13Wang J. Gagné S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), provides a structural basis for the water solubility of this protein in its lipid-free state. Like most exchangeable apolipoproteins, the N-terminal domain of apoE is capable of transforming multilamellar vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) into uniform-size bilayer disc complexes. Interestingly, in the absence of lipid, the receptor binding region (residues 130–150; Ref. 9Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) does not interact with the LDL receptor on fibroblasts (14Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is postulated that lipid binding induces a conformational change in this domain, which confers receptor recognition properties. A description of the structure and association of apoE N-terminal domain DMPC disc complexes, which mimic lipoprotein complexes containing the full-length apoE in terms of receptor binding interactions (8Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is of primary importance in terms of understanding the molecular details of this process. We have used FTIR-ATR spectroscopy to study the N-terminal domain (residues 1–183) of the apoE3 isoform. First, we evaluated the secondary structure of the protein, both free in solution and complexed with DMPC, and compared it with previous measurements (10Aggerbeck L.P. Wettereau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K.H. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and with the x-ray structure of the lipid-free protein (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Second, using linear dichroism, we provide experimental evidence that apoE3 N-terminal domain α-helices orient perpendicular to the acyl chains of the lipids in discoidal complexes. Based on these dichroism IR data and geometric considerations, we propose a model of association of the apoE3 N-terminal domain in discoidal complexes and discuss possible implications in terms of the apoE3 structure-function relationship. DMPC was purchased from Sigma. Phospholipid (choline) enzymatic colorimetric analysis kit was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Recombinant apoE3(1–183) was produced and isolated according to Fisher et al. (16Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DMPC:apoE3(1–183) complexes were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (17Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of DMPC, dissolved in CHCl3, was dried under N2 to form a thin film. 90 μl of prewarmed (37 °C) sodium cholate (30 mg/ml) was added to create a lipid suspension. The contents were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 30 min, vortexing every 10 min. Subsequently, 0.9 mg of recombinant apoE3(1–183) and buffer were added (final buffer concentration 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 150 nm NaN3, 250 nm EDTA), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking. The solution was dialyzed against buffer to remove the cholate. Where necessary, free apolipoprotein was removed by gel permeation chromatography on a Sepharose CL-6B column. ApoE3(1–183):DMPC complexes were subjected to non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% acrylamide slab with Stokes diameter determined by comparison with the mobility of known standards (18Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Muslinger T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Samples for electron microscopy were adsorbed to carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0 (19Ryan R.O. Howe A. Scraba D.G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 871-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Grids were photographed in a Philips EM 420 operated at 100 kV. Protein assays were performed using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Phospholipid analysis was carried out using an enzyme-based colorimetric assay. A Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge was used for hydrodynamic analysis of apoE3(1–183):DMPC complexes. Samples were dialyzed for 24 h against 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 m KBr to equilibrate the complexes at a density of 1.21 g/ml. The Rayleigh interference optical system was used for flotation equilibrium experiments using the high speed equilibrium technique described by Nelson et al. (20Nelson C.A. Lee J.A. Brewster M. Morris M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Runs were performed at 18,000 rpm at 293 K in a double sector, charcoal-filled Epon sample cell equipped with sapphire windows for a minimum of 48 h before equilibrium photographs were taken. Molecular mass calculations were carried out using an APL computer program. The ln Y versusr 2 data were fitted to a second order polynomial equation using least squares techniques, and the apparent weight average molecular mass was calculated from the slope of the resulting plot. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 55 infrared spectrophotometer equipped with a reflectance accessory and a polarizer mount assembly with a gold wire grid element. The internal reflection element was a germanium ATR plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45° yielding 25 internal reflections. 256 accumulations were performed to improve the signal/noise ratio. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air dried on a silica gel column (5 × 130 cm). Spectra were recorded at a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1. All the measurements were made at 30 °C. Prior to any analysis, the side-chain contributions to the spectra were subtracted according to Goormaghtigh et al. (21Goormaghtigh E. de Jongh H.H.J. Ruysschaert J.-M. Appl. Spectrosc. 1996; 50: 1519-1527Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oriented multilayers were formed by slow evaporation of ∼50 μl of the sample (∼2 mg/ml) on one side of the ATR plate. The ATR plate was then sealed in a universal sample holder. Secondary structure quantification was performed on samples subjected to 1 h of deuteration as described previously (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fourier self-deconvolution was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide I region. Least squares iterative curve fitting was performed to fit different components of the amide I band revealed by the self-deconvolution to the non-deconvolved spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm−1. The proportion of various structural elements was computed as reported (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). For the amount of material used in the present studies, film thickness remains small when compared with the IR wavelength. This allows the “thin film” approximation to be used for establishment of equations describing the dichroic ratio as a function of the orientational order parameter (23Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). In an α-helix, the main transition dipole moment lies approximately parallel to the helical axis. It is therefore possible to determine the mean orientation of the α-helix structure from the orientation of the peptide bond C=O group (23Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar). To obtain this information, additional spectra were recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized incident light with respect to a normal to the ATR plate. Polarization was expressed as the dichroic ratio R atr =A ///A ⊥. The mean angle between the helix axes and a normal to the ATR plate surface was then calculated from R atr. In these calculations, a 27° angle between the long axis of the α-helix and the C=O dipole moment was considered (23Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar, 24Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The γw(CH2) transition at 1201 cm−1, whose dipole lies parallel to the all-trans hydrocarbon chains, was used to characterize the lipid acyl chain orientation (25Fringeli U.P. Gunthard H.H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar). When two helix populations (or any other structure) with different orientations are present in a sample, both orientations must be considered in the interpretation of the dichroic ratio. We define the dichroic ratios of helix populations a and b as follows: Ra=Aa∥Aa⊥(Eq. 1) and Rb=Ab∥Ab⊥(Eq. 2) and the experimental dichroic ratio is given as follows: Rexp=Aa∥+Ab∥Aa⊥+Ab⊥(Eq. 3) Because the total, unpolarized contribution from populations a and b must remain proportional to the fraction of population a (x) and b (1 − x), the following must be true: x1−x=Aa∥+2Aa⊥Ab∥+2Ab⊥(Eq. 4) Resolving these equations, we find the following results: Ra=xR(Rb+2)+2(1−x)(R−Rb)x(Rb+2)−(1−x)(R−Rb),(Eq. 5) Rb=(1−x)R(Ra+2)+2x(R−Ra)(1−x)(Ra+2)−x(R−Ra),(Eq. 6) x=(R−Rb)(Ra+2)(Rb+2)(Ra−R)−(Ra+2)(Rb−R)(Eq. 7) The cholate dialysis method was employed to prepare apoE3(1–183):DMPC disc complexes. Non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of a uniform population of complexes. Comparison of the relative migration of the complexes versus that of known standards yielded a Stokes diameter of ∼11 nm. The morphology of the complexes was investigated by negative stain electron microscopy, revealing disc-shaped complexes of a similar diameter. Subsequently, flotation equilibrium experiments were conducted to evaluate the molecular mass of the apoE3(1–183):DMPC discs. Plots of ln Y versus r 2yielded a straight line, indicating one species of complex was present with an apparent molecular weight of 468,000. Compositional analysis of the discs revealed a molar ratio of DMPC:apoE3(1–183) of ∼200:1. Fig. 1 displays the IR spectra of a lipid-free apoE3(1–183) sample (bottom spectrum) and apoE3(1–183):DMPC discoidal complexes (upper spectrum) in the region of 1800–1400 cm−1. The amide I band (1700–1600 cm−1) reveals a sharp peak centered at 1654 cm−1 for lipid-free apoE3(1–183) and at 1653 cm−1 for the apoE3(1–183):DMPC sample. 1654 and 1653 cm−1 are wave numbers characteristic of α-helical structures (24Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The maximum intensity of the amide II peaks (1600–1500 cm−1) are located at 1547 cm−1, a region normally assigned to helical structures (24Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Quantification of secondary structure conformers present was performed on samples subjected to deuteration for 1 h. Partial deuteration of the sample allows for discrimination between the relative contributions of random coil and α-helix. The percentage of helical secondary structure reaches 65% for lipid-free apoE3(1–183) and 60% for the protein in complex with DMPC (Table I). Similar amounts of other secondary structure elements were observed in both lipid-free and DMPC-bound apoE3(1–183). Conceivably, these arise from the extreme N- and C-terminal regions that were disordered in the crystal (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar).Table ISecondary structure components in apoE3(1–183)α-Helixβ-SheetTurnCoil%ApoE3(1–183):DMPC6015322Free apoE3(1–183)6514516Determined by self-deconvolution and curve fitting of apoE3(1–183) IR spectra in the DMPC-bound and lipid-free states, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Determined by self-deconvolution and curve fitting of apoE3(1–183) IR spectra in the DMPC-bound and lipid-free states, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 65% α-helix content determined for apoE3(1–183) by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is in good agreement with data obtained by CD and FTIR (10Aggerbeck L.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using the DSSP algorithm (27Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11983) Google Scholar) to analyze the x-ray atomic coordinates of the protein in the protein data base file (1lpe), five discrete α-helical segments were identified. Four of these, designated H1–H4, constitute the bundle and range in length from 17 to 37 residues, whereas a fifth short helix, H* (residues 45–52), connects H1 and H2 and orients perpendicular to the bundle axis. Thus, 118 of the 183 amino acids present are in a helical conformation (64.5%). Thus, values derived from FTIR analysis (65%) are in very good agreement with corresponding values determined from the x-ray crystal structure. ApoE3(1–183) complexed with DMPC was found to possess 60% α-helical structure. Although this value is in agreement with data obtained by CD (10Aggerbeck L.P. Wettereau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is higher than that reported by De Pauw et al. (15De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K.H. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) on the basis of CD and FTIR measurements. Our data suggest that there is no real change in the secondary structure content in the N-terminal domain of apoE3 upon binding to lipid with subtle changes observed, likely reflecting a change in tertiary structure. Spectra of apoE3(1–183):DMPC complexes were recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized light (Fig. 2,A and B, respectively; see Ref. 23Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar for the geometry of the experiment). The dichroic spectrum (Fig. 2 C) was obtained by subtracting the spectrum recorded with perpendicular polarized light from the spectrum recorded with parallel polarized light. Initially, the orientation of DMPC acyl chains in disc complexes was assessed using characteristic bands associated with lipid molecules. Specific spectral bands, such as νas(CH2) at 2916 cm−1, νs(CH2) at 2849 cm−1, and δ(CH2) at 1467 cm−1, whose dipoles orient perpendicular to the hydrocarbon chains of DMPC (25Fringeli U.P. Gunthard H.H. Grell E. Membrane Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1981: 270-332Google Scholar), displayed a negative deviation in the dichroic spectrum (Fig. 2 C). This indicates an orientation perpendicular to the normal of the germanium crystal plane. Conversely, bands corresponding to dipoles that orient parallel to the hydrocarbon chains (νas(CH3) at 2962 cm−1 and the bands of the γw(CH2) progression observed for saturated hydrocarbon chains with all-trans configuration at 1328, 1306, 1279, 1260, 1229, and 1201 cm−1) had a positive deviation in the dichroic spectrum. Thus, these orient parallel to the normal of the germanium plane. As described previously (28Raussens V. Narayanaswami V. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12542-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we used the last peak in the γw(CH2) progression peak (1201 cm−1) to quantify the lipid chain orientation. The measured dichroic ratio for this band is 4.45 with an isotropic dichroic ratio of 1.67. On the basis of these dichroic ratio measurements, we can assume that the maximum tilt between the acyl chains and a normal to the germanium surface is 15–20°. As any additional source of disorder would reduce this tilt (28Raussens V. Narayanaswami V. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12542-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the value of 15–20° is a maximum tilt with respect to a normal to the germanium plate. By defining the orientation of a DMPC disc by a normal vector passing through the face of the disc, the results show that the normal vector is oriented parallel to a normal to the germanium plate. In the case of apoE3(1–183), helix orientation was determined using the amide I band. In the dichroic spectrum (Fig. 2 C), a strong negative deviation at 1648 cm−1 is observed, indicating a parallel orientation of the associated dipole to the surface of the Ge plate and, thus, a perpendicular orientation with respect to a vector normal to the face of the disc. From the secondary structure of apoE3(1–183), and the frequency of the negative deviation (1648 cm−1), we conclude that the dipole responsible for this deviation is associated with α-helices, which orient in the direction of the helical axes (24Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative deviation observed indicates that the helices are primarily oriented perpendicular to the normal vector of the disc and, therefore, perpendicular to the hydrocarbon chains of the lipids. This helix orientation is confirmed by two additional observations: 1) negative deviation of the amide A band at 3283 cm−1, for which the dipole orientation is similar to that for the amide I band, and 2) positive deviation of the amide II band (at 1547 cm−1), which is oriented in the opposite, perpendicular direction with respect to the helical axes (see Refs. 23Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Brasseur R. Molecular Description of Biological Membrane Components by Computer Aided Conformational Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 285-329Google Scholar and 24Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar for a complete discussion of orientation determination in ATR-FTIR). To quantitatively determine the orientation of the apoE3(1–183) helical segments in the disc complex, we decomposed and curve-fitted the amide I region of the parallel and perpendicular polarized light spectra (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively) with four Lorentzian curves (Fig. 3). Using the main curve associated to the helices (maximum intensity at 1652 cm−1), we calculated a dichroic ratio associated with the helical structure in the protein equal to 1.25. With such a dichroic ratio, and assuming that the normal to the disc is parallel to the normal to the plate (see above), the minimum mean tilt between the helical axes and a normal to the face of the DMPC disc is 60–65°. From the x-ray crystal structure of apoE3 N-terminal domain (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), it is recognized that helix H* (the 8 residue helix that connects helix 1 and helix 2 in the bundle) orients perpendicular to the four long helices. Thus, helical segments in the bundle can be separated into two groups with different orientations. Using the equations described under “Experimental Procedures,” we found that the 1.25 dichroic ratio could also be decomposed into two components with different orientations. A first component representing 92% of the helix content has a 1.11 dichroic ratio, whereas the second, representing the rest of the helix content, has a dichroic ratio of 4.5. It seems reasonable that the 1.11 ratio representing 92% of the helices could be attributed to the four long helices (representing 110 amino acids of a total of 118 in helix conformation), which orient perpendicular to a vector normal to both the face of the disc and the germanium plate (65–70° minimum tilt). On the other hand, the dichroic ratio of 4.5 could be attributed to helix H*, suggesting this helix orients parallel to the normal vector of the disc, with a maximum tilt of 10–15°. Our results using linear IR dichroism to characterize the orientation of apoE3(1–183) helical segments when bound to DMPC bilayer discs are consistent with a model wherein the four main helices (H1–H4) orient perpendicular with respect to a normal to the face of the discs (and the DMPC acyl chains), whereas helix H* adopts the opposite orientation. Fig. 4 depicts a model of apoE3(1–183):DMPC discoidal particles in which the helices of the protein align around the periphery of the discoidal phospholipid bilayer, as previously proposed and experimentally demonstrated for insect apolipophorin III (28Raussens V.

Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In solution, the hydrophobic side chains of the amphipathic helices of apoE3(1–183) are oriented toward the interior of the bundle (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, upon lipid interaction, the hydrophobic faces of the helices interact with the hydrophobic acyl chains (9Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be accomplished by a conformational change in which the bundle opens, without disruption of the helical boundaries, by pivoting around a hinge region connecting H2 and H3, as proposed by Weisgraber (9Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This “open” conformation would expose the hydrophobic faces of individual helices, permitting their direct contact with the lipid surface, specifically phospholipid acyl chains around the perimeter of the disc. In this conformation, the hydrophilic faces of the helices retain contact with the aqueous environment, whereas the hydrophobic faces essentially substitute helix-lipid interactions for the helix-helix interactions which stabilize the bundle (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Our results support this proposed mechanism. First, the absence of a real change in secondary structure content upon lipid binding agrees with the concept that bundle opening occurs without helical disruption. Second, our experimental determination of the orientation of apoE3(1–183) α-helices in disc complexes agrees with such a model. Even the short helix connecting H1 and H2 seems to adopt the predicted orientation. Third, the following geometric considerations are consistent with this model. The disc particles employed in the present study have a molecular weight of 468,000 and a protein:lipid molar ratio of ∼200:1. If each disc particle contained three apoE3(1–183) and 600 DMPC, the calculated molecular weight of the complex would be 470,000, in good agreement with the value determined by flotation equilibrium analysis. In our model, when the bundle opens with helices 1 and 2 on one side and helices 3 and 4 on the other, we estimate that the elongated structure is about 116 Å long (see Fig. 4). Assuming a helix diameter of 15–17 Å (15De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K.H. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), two helices oriented side by side are large enough to effectively cover the DMPC bilayer thickness. Thus, three elongated, open molecules could cover 348 Å, in agreement with a disc circumference of 345 Å, as derived from gradient gel electrophoresis. In the case of larger diameter discs, it is plausible that additional apoE3(1–183) could be accommodated, adopting a similar orientation. Recently, De Pauw et al. (15De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K.H. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) described the organization of apoE helices in DMPC disc complexes wherein antiparallel 17-residue helices surround the disc, oriented parallel with respect to the lipid chains. Such a model, however, is hard to reconcile with the length of helical segments present in the lipid free globular conformation of the N-terminal domain (helices 3 and 4 comprise 37 and 32 amino acids, respectively). Indeed, in this case a disruption of the helical segments found in the lipid-free globular conformation must be imposed. This is likely to be an energetically unfavorable reorientation and, in the case of helix 4, cannot explain the profound effect of the Arg-Cys interchange (apoE3 and apoE2 isoforms) at position 158 in terms of receptor binding ability (30Dong L.-M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, using the same geometrical arguments described above, their model is not in agreement with the disc diameter. The recently reported x-ray crystal structure of a human apolipoprotein A-I N-terminal deletion mutant ((Δ1–44) apoA-I) provides additional support for the model presented in Fig. 4. Borhani et al. (31Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) showed that this protein adopts an elongated, horseshoe-shaped conformation. This structure is predicted to resemble the lipid-associated conformation of apoA-I (32Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Ananatharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the authors suggest that apoA-I may interact with disc particles and spherical high density lipoproteins, forming a “belt” that surrounds the lipid complex. In the case of discs, it is envisaged that two apoA-I molecules could circumscribe the periphery of the disc aligning perpendicular to the phospholipid fatty acyl chains with retention of specific helical pairings observed in the antiparallel dimer seen in the crystal structure of this protein. Although our data are consistent with a simple conformational opening of the apoE3(1–183) helix bundle, they do not exclude a belt configuration wherein paired, extended apoE3(1–183) molecules circumscribe the disc perimeter, as suggested for apoA-I discs (31Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The model described here represents a first step toward understanding the interactions between apoE3-lipid particles with lipoprotein receptors. Keeping in mind that lipid association is a requirement for high affinity binding to the LDL receptor (8Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the conformational change occurring in the N-terminal, receptor binding domain of apoE3 upon interaction with lipid surfaces is of primary importance. In the absence of modification of the helical structure, we propose that the conformational change is due to a realignment of discrete helical segments, especially the hydrophilic face of helix 4, which contains the amino acids thought to interact with the receptor (amino acids 130–150). Side-chain reorientation could conceivably be attributed to the curvature imposed upon the helices by the disc shape of the particle and/or to the reorientation of the helices with respect to each other when the bundle “opens” and associates with lipid. This rearrangement could modify some of the numerous salt bridges present in the apoE3 N-terminal domain helix bundle conformation (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the recently determined x-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding repeat 5 of the LDL receptor (33Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) reveals a concave face that could act as an apoE-lipid particle binding surface. Improved knowledge of the receptor-active conformation of apoE3(1–183) should allow for characterization of the molecular features that modulate receptor-ligand interactions critical to maintenance of plasma lipid homeostasis.

In this report, we describe that the treatment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. This stimulation is independent of cell adhesion or the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting potentially different mechanisms by which the HGF receptors and integrins regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Our results also suggest that the activation of Src upon HGF stimulation is likely to be one, if not the only, of the mechanisms responsible for the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Furthermore, we showed that a mutation in the Grb2 binding site Tyr-925 of FAK partially abolishes its increase in HGF-induced phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated that HGF stimulates the association of FAK with Grb2 in vitro and in intact cells and provided evidence that FAK might contribute to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase through Ras in HGF signaling by functioning as an adapter molecule.

After binding to FAK, Src family kinases (Src or Fyn) phosphorylate p130cas, leading to the association of p130cas with Crk·C3G complex (15Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, Src can also phosphorylate FAK on tyrosine residues 925, creating a binding site for the Grb2·Sos complex, but the stoichiometry of this event appears to be low (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that FAK can link integrin-initiated signals to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (17Schlaepfer D.D.

In addition, FAK phosphorylation is also stimulated by many other stimuli, including v-Src transformation (1Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynold A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mitogenic neuropeptides (e.g. bombesin; Ref. 25Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, FAK may play a role in integrating the cellular responses to multiple extracellular stimuli. However, the mechanism and the functional significance of FAK phosphorylation in those stimuli are poorly understood. HGF, also known as scatter factor, is a multifunctional growth factor that elicits mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities in various cell types (27Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The diverse biological effects of HGF are transmitted through activation of its transmembrane receptor encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene (28Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M.-L.

The Met receptor is a heterodimer composed of a 45-kDa α chain that remains entirely extracellular, and a 145-kDa β chain that traverses the plasma membrane and contains the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (30Gonzatti-Haces M.

Upon HGF binding, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the receptor is activated, resulting in autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues in the β chain (34Naldini L. Vigna E. Narsimhan R.P. Gaudino G. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 501-504PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ferracini R. Longati P. Naldini L. Vigna E. Comoglio J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues can then associate with molecules containing SH2 and phosphotyrosine binding domains that act to transduce extracellular signals to the cell interior (36Ponzetto C.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which HGF stimulates FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and the functional consequence of this event. Recombinant HGF, protein A-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-agarose beads, polylysine, cytochalasin D, myelin basic protein (MBP), poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1), and rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Sigma. Fibronectin and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (clone 77) and anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) monoclonal antibody PY20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Met (C-28), anti-Grb2 (C-23), and anti-ERK (C-16) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Src monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal anti-Ras (Ab-1) was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibody (12CA5) against an epitope of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus (YPYDVPDYA, HA epitope) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK serum were kindly provided by Dr. J.-L. Guan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and described previously (37Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For HGF stimulation, subconfluent cells were serum starved for 18 h in serum-free DMEM. They were washed once with DMEM, treated with 10 ng/ml HGF for 15 min at 37 °C, and then lysed as described below. In some experiments, serum-starved cells were plated onto fibronectin or polylysine-coated dishes as described previously (38Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before HGF additions. In other experiments, serum-starved cells were pretreated with 2.5 μm cytochalasin D as described previously (38Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before HGF stimulation. 293 cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmNa3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Hercules, CA). For immunoprecipitations, aliquots of lysates were incubated with 3 μl of various polyclonal antibodies or 6 μl of monoclonal antibody 12CA5 for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. For 12CA5, protein A-Sepharose beads were coupled with rabbit anti-mouse IgG before use. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Western blotting was performed with monoclonal anti-PY (1:1000), anti-FAK (1:1000), or anti-Src (1:1000) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech enhanced chemiluminescence system for detection. For MAPK assays, polyclonal anti-ERK was used to immunoprecipitate MAPK from cells. In vitro kinase reactions were carried out in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μg of MBP and 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1, NEN Life Science Products) for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The pKH3 plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged FAK and its two mutants kd (kinase-defective; Lys-454 mutated to Arg) and Y397F (Tyr-397 mutated to Phe) were obtained from Dr. J.-L. Guan and described previously (14Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding Y925F mutant (Tyr-925 mutated to Phe) of FAK was generated using site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction. The desired mutation was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). It was then cloned into pKH3 vector for the expression of HA epitope-tagged Y925F mutant. The pEVX plasmids encoding wild-type (WT) c-Src and its kd mutant (Lys-295) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The pZipneoSV plasmid encoding a dominant-negative Ras (Asn-17) was obtained from Dr. L. Feig (Tufts University, Boston, MA) and described previously (39Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). For transient transfection of 293 cells, one day after plating 5 × 105 cells on 60-mm dishes, the cells were transiently transfected with various concentrations (as indicated in figure legends) of expression plasmids using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE. One or two days after transfection, cells were serum starved for 18 h, treated with 10 ng/ml HGF, and lysed as described above. pGEX-Grb2.SH2 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Pawson (Mt. Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (14Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with lysates from serum-starved or HGF-treated 293 cells in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-FAK or 12CA5. The effect of HGF on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was examined in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Fig. 1 A). HGF induced a prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins with molecular weights between 100 and 145 kDa in 293 cells (lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, HGF induced a significant increase (∼10-fold) in the level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145-kDa β chain of c-Met in response to HGF was also detected (lanes 5 and 6). Control experiments confirmed that an equal amount of FAK or c-Met was present in immunocomplexes from serum-starved or HGF-treated cells (data not shown). The increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation upon HGF stimulation was further examined by performing time-course experiments (Fig. 1 B). An increase in the level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable as early as 3 min after HGF stimulation. This increase reached a plateau by 30 min and gradually declined at 120 min. Using a similar approach, the effect of different concentrations of HGF on FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed (Fig. 1 C). The elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was readily detected upon HGF stimulation at 1 ng/ml, and the maximal increase of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at 10 ng/ml of HGF. To determine whether HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is dependent on cell adhesion to ECM proteins, serum-starved 293 cells were plated onto culture dishes that had been coated with either polylysine or fibronectin. After 30 min of plating, cells were further incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml HGF (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with previous reports (9Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), FAK from cells plated on fibronectin contained more tyrosine phosphorylation than that plated on polylysine in the absence of HGF (lanes 1 and 3). Interestingly, HGF was capable of stimulating FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in cells plated both on polylysine and fibronectin (lanes 2 and 4), indicating that stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by HGF is independent of cell adhesion to fibronectin. It was shown that stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by cell adhesion (40Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar) or other stimuli such as neuropeptides (41Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (42Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. To examine whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton could affect the HGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK, serum-starved 293 cells were preincubated for 1 h with cytochalasin D at 2.5 μm, which completely disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in these cells (data not shown). The level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was then measured by further incubation with HGF (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with previous reports (38Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 40Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), cytochalasin D at this concentration completely abolished FAK phosphorylation on tyrosine (lane 2). Surprisingly, HGF was still able to induce FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in cells preincubated with cytochalasin D (lane 4). These results indicate that stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by HGF is independent of the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. It is known that Src directly phosphorylates FAK upon cell adhesion to ECM proteins (18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 43Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Src is activated in response to HGF stimulation (36Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK upon HGF stimulation is because of the activation of Src. To test this possibility, 293 cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of expression vector encoding WT c-Src and then the level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was measured after HGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in the absence of HGF, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK remained at basal level regardless of ectopic expression of c-Src (lanes 1–4). In contrast, in the presence of HGF, the effect of HGF on the stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was further enhanced along with the increasing expression of ectopic c-Src (lanes 5–8). These results suggest that activation of Src by HGF may play a positive role in the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. To examine whether Src kd mutant could block the HGF-stimulated FAK phosphorylation, 293 cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of expression vector encoding c-Src kd mutant (Fig. 3 B). The result showed that the effect of HGF on the stimulation of FAK phosphorylation could actually be blocked by a high level expression of c-Src kd mutant (lane 5). Together, these results suggest that the activation of Src upon HGF stimulation is likely to be one, if not the only, of the mechanisms responsible for the HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. To determine the potential phosphorylation sites on FAK in response to HGF stimulation, HA epitope-tagged FAK and three mutants including kd, Y397F, and Y925F were transiently expressed in 293 cells. One day after transfection, these cells were serum starved, treated with HGF, and lysed. The ectopically expressed FAK proteins were immunoprecipitated by 12CA5 and then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PY. As shown in Fig. 4, the tyrosine phosphorylation of kd mutant was elevated to a level similar to the WT FAK in response to HGF stimulation. This result suggests that the HGF-stimulated increase in FAK phosphorylation is not dependent on its own catalytic activity or that the observed tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed FAK kd mutant is because of a trans-phosphorylation by endogenous FAK. In addition, a mutation in Tyr-397 of FAK only slightly decreased the HGF-stimulated FAK phosphorylation, suggesting that, unlike stimulation by ECM proteins, Tyr-397 of FAK is not a primary phosphorylation site upon HGF stimulation. Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Y925F mutant was about 21% lower than that of the WT FAK upon HGF stimulation (110 versus 140%), indicating that Tyr-925 is one of the phosphorylation sites of FAK in response to HGF stimulation. It is known that Tyr-925 of FAK is the binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To examine if the increased phosphorylation of FAK stimulated by HGF enhances its association with Grb2, in vitro binding experiments were performed by incubating serum-starved or HGF-treated 293 cell lysates with immobilized GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of Grb2 (GST-Grb2.SH2). After washing, the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-FAK. As shown in Fig. 5 A, more FAK from HGF-treated cells were bound to the SH2 domain of Grb2. To examine whether this is also the case in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Consistent with the results from in vitro binding experiments, more FAK were recovered in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from HGF-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that the FAK Y925F mutant does not associate with Grb2 in response to HGF stimulation, the lysates containing ectopically expressed FAK proteins as prepared in Fig. 4 were used in in vitro binding experiments by incubating with immobilized GST-Grb2.SH2 (Fig. 5 C). As expected, the Y925F mutant was unable to associate with Grb2 in the presence or absence of HGF. In addition, the results also showed that the WT FAK and its kd and Y397F mutants from HGF-treated cells increased their binding to the SH2 domain of Grb2 in vitro, which approximately correlates their increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to HGF stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that FAK may serve as a docking protein for Grb2 binding upon HGF stimulation. The ability of FAK to recruit Grb2 in response to HGF stimulation raised the possibility that one of its physiological roles is to link HGF-receptor activation to the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. To examine this possibility, 293 cells were transiently transfected with vector alone or vector encoding FAK, and then the activity of the endogenous ERK was measured in immunocomplexes using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 6 A, HGF induced about 3-fold activation of MAPK in cells transfected with empty vectors (lane 2). Overexpression of WT FAK led to a slight activation (∼1.5-fold) of MAPK without HGF stimulation (lane 3). In contrast, overexpression of WT FAK led to a strong MAPK activation (∼8.5-fold) upon HGF stimulation (lane 4). This enhancement of MAPK activation was also achieved by overexpression of FAK kd mutant (data not shown). As expected, overexpression of FAK Y925F mutant was unable to induce such a response (data not shown). To examine the role of Ras in this process, the effect of FAK overexpression on MAPK activation in the presence of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) was analyzed. The results showed that expression of RasN17 efficiently blocked FAK-enhanced MAPK activation in response to HGF stimulation (lane 5). Taken together, these results suggest that FAK may function as a link between HGF-receptor activation and the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Although the mechanism of FAK activation by integrins is unclear, it is likely to involve the aggregation of FAK with integrins and other cytoskeletal proteins at focal contacts (44Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 45Guan J.-L. Chen H.-C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 81-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, which selectively disrupts actin cytoskeleton, can block FAK activation and phosphorylation by integrins (40Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). However, we report here that stimulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by HGF is independent of cell adhesion or the integrity of actin cytoskeleton. Similarly, the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by fibroblast growth factor has also been shown to be cell adhesion-independent (46Hatai M. Hashi H. Mogi A. Soga H. Yokota J. Yaoi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that a mechanism different from that involving integrin signaling is responsible for FAK activation by HGF and that the dependence of FAK activation on cell adhesion and intact actin cytoskeleton may be varied among distinct stimuli. In integrin-mediated signaling, the catalytic activity of Src is activated by binding to the phosphorylated Tyr-397 of FAK via its SH2 domain, presumably by displacement of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue 527 from the SH2 domain (10Schaller M.D. Hindebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.X. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 11Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Our results reported here suggest that Src may function as an upstream regulator of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in HGF signaling. Overexpression of WT c-Src enhances the effect of HGF on the stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, overexpression of c-Src kd mutant blocks it. This is similar to the previous finding that epidermal growth factor-induced FAK phosphorylation can be completely abolished by the expression of Src kd mutant in NBT-II carcinoma epithelial cells (47Boyer B. Roche S. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5904-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although our results strongly suggest that Src is likely to be a mediator responsible for HGF-induced FAK phosphorylation, we cannot exclude the possibility that kinase(s) other than Src may directly phosphorylate FAK. For example, after activated by Src, FAK may trans-phosphorylate itself upon HGF stimulation. In fact, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed FAK kd mutant by endogenous FAK has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells (5Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which FAK kd mutant behaved like WT FAK to promote cell migration in response to ECM proteins. This trans-phosphorylation mechanism may be responsible also for the increased phosphorylation of FAK kd mutant and its ability to activate MAPK in response to HGF stimulation as described in this report. The autophosphorylation site Tyr-397 is essential for Src binding and the function of FAK in integrin signaling (44Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 45Guan J.-L. Chen H.-C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 81-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we report here that the loss of Tyr-397 has only a very slight effect on the stimulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation by HGF. It is possible that other tyrosine residues may have compensated for the loss of Tyr-397. Alternatively, HGF treatment may induce a subcellular translocation of FAK and/or Src, bring two proteins to a closer position, and finally lead to a direct phosphorylation of FAK by Src. Indeed, in subcellular fractionation experiments, more FAK was recovered in cytosol and membrane fractions from HGF-treated cells than from serum-starved cells (data not shown), implying that a redistribution of FAK from insoluble fractions to soluble fractions may occur upon HGF stimulation. Hamawyet al. (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) reported that aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of kd and Y397F mutants to the same extent as WT FAK in RBL-2H3 mast cells and suggested that Syk/ZAP70 family kinases may be involved in this stimulation. Together, these data raise the possibility that FAK may function as an adapter or linker molecule independent of its own catalytic activity and Tyr-397 in some signaling pathways. Although it has been proposed that FAK can link integrin-initiated signals to the Ras/MAPK pathway, recent studies have provided evidence that, in normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the activation of MAPK by integrin ligation is independent of FAK (49Wary K.K.

Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that FAK plays such a role upon overexpression in carcinomas (51Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Knornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar, 52Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1024-1025Abstract PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or under certain circumstances. In the present study, we propose that FAK may function as a link between the activation of HGF receptor and the Ras/MAPK pathway. Overexpression of FAK enhances the activation of MAPK upon HGF stimulation. This enhancement by FAK overexpression can be efficiently blocked by the dominant-negative Ras. Consistent with the role of Grb2·Sos in MAPK activation, the Y925F mutant of FAK fails to enhance HGF-induced MAPK activation. Furthermore, the mutation of Tyr-925 of FAK partially abolishes its increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon HGF stimulation, indicating that HGF can stimulate the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-925 and thereby promote the association of FAK with Grb2. Because the mutation of Tyr-925 does not completely abolish the HGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK, it is likely that other tyrosine residues in addition to Tyr-925 are also phosphorylated upon HGF stimulation. However, it is not clear whether these potential phosphorylation sites upon HGF stimulation are the same as those upon cell adhesion. The role of FAK/Ras/MAPK pathway in HGF-elicited cellular functions is currently unknown. Because the activation of the MAPK pathway is known to lead to transcriptional control of genes important for cell proliferation and differentiation (53Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 54Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), it is likely that FAK may contribute to HGF-stimulated cell proliferation. Recently, MAPK has also been shown to play roles in promoting cell migration and suppressing integrin activation (55Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 56Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In accord with the role of FAK in promoting cell migration on ECM proteins (5Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that FAK may be involved in HGF-triggered cell migration or morphological changes. Finally, HGF has been shown to protect epithelial cells from apoptosis induced by disruption of cell adhesion to ECM proteins (57Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar), it is possible that FAK may play a role in this process. Experiments to test these possibilities are in progress.

Using purified preparations of rat brain sodium channels, we have shown that the α subunit was phosphorylated by a co-purifying protein kinase. The co-purifying kinase was stimulated by cAMP and phosphorylated PKA substrate peptides. Both the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA were detected by immunoblotting in purified sodium channel preparations. Bound PKA was immunoprecipitated with anti-SP19 antibodies directed against the sodium channel α subunit. PKA bound to sodium channels phosphorylated the sodium channel α subunit on the same four serine residues as observed with exogenously added PKA, indicating that association with the sodium channel does not restrict the sites of phosphorylation. Analysis of proteins with high affinity for the type II α regulatory subunit of PKA in a gel overlay assay identified a 15-kDa cAMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) in these preparations. Determination of its amino acid sequence by mass spectrometry revealed two peptides identical to AKAP15, a recently described AKAP that targets PKA to skeletal muscle calcium channels. The co-purifying AKAP was also immunoreactive with antibodies generated against AKAP15, and antibodies directed against AKAP15 co-immunoprecipitated the sodium channel. Our results indicate that PKA is bound to brain sodium channels through interaction with AKAP15.

In neurons and transfected cells expressing type IIA brain sodium channels, phosphorylation of the α subunit by PKA reduces peak sodium current by 20–50%, with little change in the voltage dependence of activation or inactivation (11Li M. West J.W. Lai Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1151-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This effect is blocked by a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI) and reversed by a mixture of catalytic subunits of phosphatases 1 and 2A (11Li M. West J.W. Lai Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1151-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of D1-like dopamine receptors in acutely isolated hippocampal neurons reversibly reduces peak sodium current by activation of the cAMP pathway (12Cantrell A.R. Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

When bound to the regulatory subunits, the catalytic subunits are maintained in an inactive state. The binding of two cAMP molecules/regulatory subunit causes the dissociation of the catalytic subunits. Type II PKA is localized to specific subcellular compartments by association of the RII subunits with cAMP-dependent proteinkinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (17Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 18Murphy B.J. Scott J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 39-45Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AKAPs are localized in many different compartments of a wide range of cell types and range in size from 15 to 420 kDa (18Murphy B.J. Scott J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 39-45Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although AKAPs were originally defined by their ability to bind RII, a new class of dual-specificity AKAPs has recently been described that can also bind the type I regulatory subunit (19Huang L.J.-S.

Although AKAPs do not share significant primary sequence homology, the RII-binding domains each contain a conserved secondary structure motif consisting of an amphipathic helix structure (20Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.

The Ht31 anchoring inhibitor peptide has been used to determine the functional importance of PKA anchoring in intact cells. PKA anchoring to specific subcellular locations is required for modulation of ion channels. In hippocampal neurons, basal α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor currents require anchored PKA and can be inhibited by the Ht31 inhibitor peptide (22Rosenmund C.

Kinase anchoring is also required for PKA-dependent potentiation of skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels, which is blocked by the Ht31 inhibitor peptide (23Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

A PKA-binding peptide containing an amphipathic helix derived from AKAP15 blocks voltage-dependent potentiation of calcium channel activity (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G.

Previous studies have shown that partially purified rat brain sodium channel preparations contain a cAMP-stimulatable protein kinase that phosphorylates the α subunit (6Costa M.R. Casnellie J.E. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7918-7921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that the co-purifying protein kinase is PKA and that it phosphorylates the α subunit on the same sites that are phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and in intact cells in response to cAMP. Both the RII and catalytic subunits of PKA are co-immunoprecipitated with the brain sodium channel. AKAP15 is present in purified sodium channel preparations and is also co-immunoprecipitated with the channel complex. Our results show that AKAP15 targets PKA to voltage-gated brain sodium channels as well as voltage-gated skeletal muscle calcium channels. The Ht31, Ht31-P (20Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.

Rat brain sodium channels were purified as described by Hartshorne and Catterall (26Hartshorne R.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1667-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequentially utilizing ion-exchange, hydroxylapatite, and wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography. Quantitation of the sodium channel was based on [3H]saxitoxin binding as described previously (26Hartshorne R.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1667-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKA was purified from bovine heart as described previously (27Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R.

A. 1980; 77: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). 0.5–1 pmol of purified sodium channel was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.005 mCi/mmol) in the presence or absence of 0.25 μm PKA or 5 μm cAMP. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by heating at 65 °C for 3 min in 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% SDS (SDS sample buffer) and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE on Novex 6% Tris/glycine gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). In some cases, individual phosphoprotein bands were excised from the gels, and 32P incorporation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Synthetic peptides were phosphorylated by incubation at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.005 mCi/mmol) for 10 min in the presence of 0.5–1.0 pmol of purified sodium channel. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by acidification to 16% acetic acid, spotted on P-81 paper, and washed two times for 10 min each with 0.1% phosphoric acid. Incorporation of 32P into peptides was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was carried out essentially as outlined previously (29Beemon K.

Expression, purification, and biotinylation of RIIα were carried out as outlined previously (24Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol.

Conditions for SDS-PAGE, electrotransfer, and protein detection via antibody or RII-biotin overlay were the same as described previously (24Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For RII overlays, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 10% normal horse serum, washed three times for 10 min each with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated for 2 h with 5 nm RIIα in TBST. Where indicated, RIIα was first preincubated with 0.4 μm Ht31 or Ht31-P peptide for 30 min at room temperature in TBST prior to incubation with goat anti-RII antibody (kindly provided by Dr. John Scott, Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). Approximately 10 pmol of partially purified sodium channel were incubated at 0 °C with 20 μg of affinity-purified anti-SP19 antibody (32Gordon D. Merrick D. Wollner D.A. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7032-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or control antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.5 ml in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer D). 5 mg of pre-swelled protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each 0.5-ml reaction and incubated 0.5 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads containing precipitated complexes were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 s at 2000 ×g and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer D buffer and twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmmagnesium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (phosphorylation buffer). Associated proteins were used in phosphorylation experiments as described above or eluted by incubation in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 65 °C. SDS-eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for AKAPs as described above. Approximately 10 pmol of partially purified rat brain sodium channel were incubated with 20 μg of anti-AP1 antibody in the presence or absence of 2 μm of AP1 peptide for 2 h at 0 °C in a final volume of 0.5 ml of buffer D. 2–5 mg of protein A-Sepharose were added to each 0.5-ml reaction and incubated for 0.5 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads containing precipitated complexes were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer D and three times with phosphorylation buffer. Precipitated sodium channel was detected by back-phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitated samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.05 ml of phosphorylation buffer containing 0.25 μm PKA and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.005 mCi/mmol). The precipitated complexes were then washed three times with 1 ml of phosphorylation buffer, and proteins were eluted by incubation in SDS sample buffer at 65 °C for 10 min and separated on 6% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gels. γ-32P-labeled phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. Rat brain membranes, prepared as described by Hartshorne and Catterall (26Hartshorne R.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1667-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were washed at high pH by dilution (1:25) in 10 mm CAPS at pH 12. Diluted membranes were incubated by rotation at 4 °C for 45 min and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. Washed membranes were resuspended in 2 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.6) and solubilized in 3% Triton X-100 and 0.025% egg phosphatidylcholine containing aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μm), benzamidine (15.7 μg/ml), and 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The sodium channel-associated AKAP was isolated from solubilized rat brain membranes based on the method of Gray et al. (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (16-ml packed bed volume) was equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.025% phosphatidylcholine containing aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μm), benzamidine (15.7 μg/ml), and 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) (Buffer A). Solubilized brain extract (25 ml) was applied to the column and washed with 100 ml of Buffer A. The column was eluted with a 200-ml 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. Eluted fractions were probed with RII-biotin as described below, and fractions containing the 15-kDa RII-binding protein were pooled for further purification. Pooled fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated RIIα bound to cross-linked streptavidin-agarose as described by Gray et al. (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The column was then sequentially washed with 30 ml of Buffer A, 30 ml of 1m NaCl in Buffer A, and 30 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Proteins were eluted in 4-ml fractions by incubation with 0.1% SDS and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and tested for RII binding using RII-biotin as a probe. Affinity-purified samples containing RII-binding activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were visualized by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 50% (v/v) methanol for 1 min. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then washed extensively in H2O and destained in 50% (v/v) methanol and 5% (v/v) acetic acid for 2 min, followed by three 15-min H2O washes. A 15-kDa band containing ∼15 pmol of affinity-purified AKAP was excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and digested with 10 μg of sequencing-grade trypsin (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar). Sequence data were obtained by mass spectrometry (LCMS/MSMS) coupled with on-line data base searching using the computer program SEQUEST (34Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 3202-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Using this approach, peptides were identified that corresponded to AKAP15 sequences. The isolated sodium channel-associated AKAP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting and washing were carried out essentially as described above. Briefly, blots were blocked overnight in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a 13-amino acid peptide (anti-AP1 antibody) derived from the amino acid sequence of AKAP15 (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) followed by protein A-horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL. We examined partially purified brain sodium channel preparations for endogenous protein kinase activity. Brain sodium channels were prepared using the method of Hartshorne and Catterall (26Hartshorne R.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1667-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through the wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography step. These preparations were then incubated under phosphorylating conditions in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures,” separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. A single major high molecular mass phosphoprotein of ∼250 kDa was detected (Fig. 1,first lane). This protein was also phosphorylated by exogenous PKA (third lane), and it was recognized in immunoblots by the anti-SP19 antibody (32Gordon D. Merrick D. Wollner D.A. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7032-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) against the loop connecting domains III and IV of the sodium channel α subunit (fourth lane). These results show that the endogenous protein kinase specifically phosphorylates the sodium channel α subunit. Inclusion of 5 μm cAMP resulted in a 156 ± 27% increase in [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into the sodium channel α subunit (Fig. 1, second lane). The known PKA peptide substrate, sodium channel peptide SP48 (8Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a substrate for the endogenous kinase, and addition of cAMP consistently stimulated the phosphorylation of SP48 by 339 ± 57% (n = 8). In addition, the basal phosphorylation of SP48 was inhibited 60% by the specific PKA inhibitor peptide PKI-(5–24) (data not shown). These results indicate that the endogenous kinase is PKA. Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies directed against both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA to directly determine if they are present in sodium channel preparations. Sodium channel preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single polypeptide of 55 kDa was identified using an anti-RIIα antibody, corresponding to the expected SDS-PAGE mobility of RIIα in our gel system (Fig. 2). When blots were probed with the anti-catalytic subunit antibody, a band of 45 kDa was identified, demonstrating the presence of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 2). The presence of the RII and catalytic subunits in purified sodium channel preparations indicates that the PKA holoenzyme co-purifies with the sodium channel through several chromatographic purification steps and provides evidence for a physical association between the channel and kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were used to further test whether PKA is physically associated with the sodium channel complex. The sodium channel was first immunoprecipitated from partially purified sodium channel preparations with the α subunit-specific anti-SP19 antibody (32Gordon D. Merrick D. Wollner D.A. Catterall W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7032-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and then incubated under phosphorylating conditions in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm cAMP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, the sodium channel was phosphorylated by the co-precipitating PKA (Fig. 3). The co-precipitation of the kinase activity was specific since no kinase activity was detected when a control nonimmune IgG antibody was used (Fig. 3). These co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a physical association between the sodium channel complex and PKA. To determine which residues on the sodium channel are phosphorylated by the endogenous co-purifying PKA bound to the sodium channel, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the phosphorylated α subunit were generated. Purified sodium channel was incubated under phosphorylating conditions in the presence or absence of exogenous PKA and [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylated α subunit was subjected to tryptic digestion and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 shows that the bound PKA phosphorylated the same seven major tryptic phosphopeptides generated by exogenous PKA phosphorylation of the rat brain sodium channel in previous experiments with purified sodium channels, transfected cells, and neurons (7Rossie S. Gordon D. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17530-17535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide 4 is a minor variable tryptic phosphopeptide (8Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not clearly visible in this exposure of the autoradiograph. An identical tryptic phosphopeptide map was also obtained when the endogenous kinase was stimulated by cAMP (data not shown). These results indicate that bound PKA phosphorylates serines 573, 610, 623, and 687 in the α subunit of the sodium channel, as observed previously in purified sodium channels, transfected cells, and intact neurons (7Rossie S. Gordon D. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17530-17535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether AKAPs are present in partially purified sodium channel preparations. AKAPs were detected using a modified kinase overlay assay with RIIα as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Using this assay system, we detected a low molecular mass RII-binding protein of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 5 A). Preincubation of RIIα with Ht31, an anchoring inhibitor peptide, prevented recognition of the 15-kDa AKAP (Fig. 5 A). Preincubation of RIIα with an inactive control peptide (Ht31-P) had no effect on RII binding to AKAP (Fig. 5 A). These findings indicate that RIIα binding to the sodium channel-associated AKAP is a specific interaction. An RIIα-binding protein of ∼80 kDa was also detected; however, the binding of RII to this protein was not consistently blocked by Ht31 (Fig. 5 A). The ∼55-kDa protein detected in all lanes was identified as RIIα using RII-specific antibodies alone (Fig. 5 A). In recent experiments, Gray et al. (24Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) employed a RII-biotin overlay assay to detect AKAPs. The low molecular mass AKAP detected in partially purified sodium channel preparations was also detected using the RII-biotin overlay system (Fig. 5 B) (24Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Labeling of this AKAP was selectively blocked by Ht31, whereas Ht31-P had no effect (Fig. 5 B). Thus, two different AKAP overlay systems detected a 15-kDa AKAP present in rat brain sodium channel preparations. The low molecular mass AKAP was isolated from rat brain membrane preparations by affinity chromatography on immobilized RIIα based on the purification scheme used to isolate skeletal muscle AKAP15 (see “Experimental Procedures”) (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). During each purification step, the RII overlay assay was used to detect RII-binding proteins. Approximately 15 pmol of RII affinity-purified AKAP were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, excised from the blot, digested with trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis (LCMS/MSMS) coupled with data base searching (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar). Two distinct peptide sequences that both match AKAP15 sequences (AVQQYLEETQNKK and DRKEPEDAELVR) were identified in these AKAP samples, indicating that the sodium channel-associated AKAP is AKAP15. Antibodies generated against the AP1 peptide sequence derived from AKAP15 (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were used to probe blots containing isolated skeletal muscle AKAP15 and the co-purifying brain sodium channel AKAP (Fig. 6). The low molecular mass AKAP in brain sodium channel preparations was immunoreactive with polyclonal anti-AP1 antibodies (Fig. 6). Fig. 6also shows that the apparent molecular masses of the brain and skeletal muscle AKAPs are the same. Together, these results show that skeletal muscle AKAP15 and the co-purifying brain AKAP are likely the same protein. To determine if AKAP15 and the rat brain sodium channel are physically associated, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the AP1 peptide were used to immunoprecipitate AKAP15 from partially purified sodium channel preparations. The presence of co-precipitating sodium channel was assessed by phosphorylation of the α subunit by PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The precipitated phosphoproteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Fig. 7 shows that the brain sodium channel α subunit co-precipitated with AKAP15 present in purified sodium channel preparations. To test the specificity of this co-precipitation, the AP1 antibody was preincubated with the AP1 peptide prior to immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation of the sodium channel α subunit by the anti-AP1 antibody was substantially diminished by the preincubation with the AP1 peptide (Fig. 7). Furthermore, preimmune IgG did not immunoprecipitate the sodium channel α subunit (Fig. 7). These results further demonstrate a physical association of AKAP15 with the rat brain sodium channel complex. We have found that a protein kinase activity co-purifies with rat brain sodium channels through multiple chromatography steps and specifically co-immunoprecipitates with sodium channels. This kinase activity phosphorylates the α subunit of the sodium channel as well as specific PKA peptide substrates and is stimulated by addition of cAMP. This result is consistent with the findings of Costa et al.(6Costa M.R. Casnellie J.E. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7918-7921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported the presence of a cAMP-stimulated protein kinase in purified rat brain sodium channel preparations. Our immunoblots show that both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA are present in purified sodium channel preparations, directly demonstrating the association of the PKA holoenzyme in brain sodium channel preparations. Phosphorylation by the endogenous co-purifying protein kinase generated the same tryptic phosphopeptides as exogenous PKA, demonstrating phosphorylation of serines 573, 610, 623, and 687. Thus, association of PKA with the sodium channel does not alter the sites that it phosphorylates. Phosphorylation of Ser-573 is both necessary and sufficient for sodium channel regulation under the conditions studied to date (12Cantrell A.R. Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6086-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Ser-610, Ser-623, and Ser-687 by PKA specifically bound to sodium channels suggests that phosphorylation of these sites may also be important for PKA regulation of sodium channels. Recent studies have shown that PKA activity also co-purifies with L-type calcium channels isolated from skeletal muscle, due to association with a 15-kDa RII-binding protein designated AKAP15 (24Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that AKAP15 co-purifies with rat brain sodium channels and likely mediates the association of the sodium channel and PKA. Three lines of evidence indicate that the AKAP associated with sodium channels is identical to skeletal muscle AKAP15. The co-purifying sodium channel AKAP is immunoreactive with antibodies generated against AKAP15. Antibodies directed against AKAP15 co-immunoprecipitate the brain sodium channel from partially purified sodium channel preparations, suggesting that the brain sodium channel and AKAP15 are physically associated. Two peptides isolated from the AKAP associated with brain sodium channels are identical to sequences found within AKAP15 (25Gray P.C. Johnson B.D. Westenbroek R. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The association of AKAP15 with both skeletal muscle calcium channels and brain sodium channels indicates that it is likely to be involved in a broad range of ion channel regulation by PKA. Brain sodium channels are regulated by PKA when expressed in non-neuronal cells orXenopus oocytes without coexpression of AKAP15 (11Li M. West J.W. Lai Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1151-1159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Cantrell A.R. Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Smith R.A. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. J.

For skeletal muscle calcium channels, the effect of AKAP15 anchoring of PKA is most striking for rapid, voltage-dependent potentiation on the millisecond time scale (23Johnson B.D. Scheuer T.

Presumably, immediate access of the kinase to its substrate is required for this rapid form of regulation. It will be of interest to search for rapid modes of sodium channel modulation in which anchored kinase may have a unique role in the channel regulatory process.

To examine the requirement for Rab5 on both fusion partners, we prepared cytosol and endosomes depleted of Rab5. Unlike control cytosol, Rab5-depleted cytosol was only marginally active in the in vitro endosome fusion. However, fusion could be restored by the addition of wild-type Rab5 or Rab5 D136N, a mutant whose nucleotide specificity favors xanthine over guanine. The addition of Rab5 D136N restored fusion only in the presence of XTP. In the absence of XTP or in the presence of XDP, Rab5 D136N failed to restore fusion. When fusion was carried out with endosomal vesicles depleted of Rab GTPases (by preincubation of vesicles with GDP dissociation inhibitor), together with cytosol immunodepleted of Rab5, fusion was virtually absent. We then used immunodepleted cytosol and GDP dissociation inhibitor-treated vesicles to determine whether Rab5 is required by both fusion partners. Using separate sets of endosomal vesicles, we found that priming both sets of Rab5-depleted vesicles with Rab5 Q79L, a GTPase-defective mutant, substantially stimulated endosome fusion. Priming one set of vesicles with Rab5 Q79L and a second set of vesicles with Rab5 S34N failed to activate fusion. When both sets of Rab5-depleted vesicles were primed with Rab5 D136N supplemented with XTP, endosome fusion was stimulated, similar to that observed with Rab5 Q79L. However, when one set of vesicles was preincubated with Rab5 D136N plus XTP and the second set with Rab5 D136N and XDP, no stimulation of fusion was observed. We conclude that Rab5-GTP is required on both fusion partners for docking and fusion of early endosomes. To confirm the fusion of Rab5-GTP-positive vesiclesin vivo, we expressed GFP-Rab5 Q79L in fibroblasts and observed fusion of Rab5-positive vesicles. We failed to record fusion of Rab5-positive vesicles with Rab5-negative vesicles. We conclude that Rab5-GTP is required on both sets of endosomes for fusion in vitro and in living cells.

GDP dissociation inhibitor guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Individual Rab proteins have been localized to distinct compartments of both the endocytic and exocytic pathways (1Nouffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 2Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Endocytosis requires a series of vesicle fusion events to deliver internalized solute and membrane to the endosomal sorting compartment and beyond (3Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Multiple Rab GTPases are required for endocytosis, but Rab5 is a key early-acting GTPase that is rate-limiting (4Bucci C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Rab5 also plays an essential role in phagosome-endosome fusion (7Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Like other small GTPases, Rab proteins are thought to act as regulatory molecules that recognize target proteins through a nucleotide-dependent conformational change. Several candidates for downstream targets of Rab5 have been identified including rabaptin 5 and rabphilin 3A, which are molecules that bind specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rab5 and Rab3A, respectively (8Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,9Ohya T. Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 613-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More than one effector may be required for Rab5 function (10Gourmier H. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Lippe R. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1930-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Association of Rab proteins with membranes depends on C-terminal isoprenylation, which is also essential for their function (11Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Membrane association is regulated by Rab-GDI1 and REP (Rab escort protein) and is accompanied by exchange of bound GDP with GTP (12Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide status of Rab5 is also regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (14Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Conversely, the switch from the GTP- to the GDP-bound state occurs through hydrolysis of GTP, a process catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (15Xiao G.- H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Complex intracellular trafficking pathways are thought to be composed of overlapping relays involving multiple GTPases often acting sequentially. However, fusion per se does not require GTP hydrolysis by Rab5. For example, the GTPase-defective mutant of Rab5, Rab5 Q79L, is fully active in promoting endocytosis and enhancingin vitro endosome fusion (6Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 16Li G. Barbieri M.A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Earlier work demonstrated that GTPγS stimulates in vitro endosome fusion under conditions where cytosolic proteins added to the assay are in limiting supply (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given that both GTPγS and Rab5 Q79L stimulate fusion, the question arose as to whether the GTP form of Rab5 was required on both fusion partners. To explore this question, we have made use of a mutation that has previously been shown to change the nucleotide binding specificity of a number of GTPases from GTP to XTP (20Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Sweet D.J. Gerace L. J.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar), including Rab5 (23Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra C. Goody R. Zerial M.

The Rab5 D136N mutant allowed us to selectively load one set of endosomes with the active form of Rab5 and a second set with an inactive form of Rab5. Our results indicate that the GTP-bound form of Rab5 is required on both fusion partners during an in vitro endosome fusion assay. Dinitrophenol-derivatized β-glucuronidase and aggregated anti-dinitrophenol IgG were prepared as reported (26Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibody 4F11 was a generous gift of Angela Wandinger-Ness (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The preparation and purification of wild-type Rab5 and the Rab5 D136N mutant were carried out as described (23Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rab5 D136N (10 μm) was incubated with the semipurified REP-1/Rab geranylgeranyltransferase in 50 μl of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 20 μm geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) for different times at 37 °C as described (17Barbieri M.A Li G. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Alternatively, [3H]GGPP was used to label Rab5 protein as described (17Barbieri M.A Li G. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following prenylation, Rab5 was directly used as indicated in each figure legend. Early endosomes were prepared from J774 E-clone macrophages as described (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After ligand uptake, cells were washed and homogenized in 250 mmsucrose, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, and 0.5 mm EGTA (homogenization buffer) as described (26Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-nuclear supernatants were stored in liquid nitrogen. To obtain endosome-enriched fractions, the post-nuclear fractions were diluted 15-fold in homogenization buffer and centrifuged sequentially at 35,000 × g for 1 min and at 50,000 × g for 5 min. The second pellet was used for fusion reactions (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For experiments involving priming, KCl was omitted during the formation of the primed vesicles to prevent fusion during the formation of the primed vesicles (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After incubating the vesicles for the times and temperatures indicated, KCl was added to the samples, and fusion was measured as reported (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An ATP-depleting system was substituted for the ATP-regenerating system where indicated (26Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of endosomal membrane protein was resuspended in 50 μl of buffer (0.25m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm GDP) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. After incubation, 1 μl of 10 mm MgCl2 was added to stabilize the Rab-GDP complexes. GDI (25 μl, 500 μg) was then added to the samples, which were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. GDI-treated endosomes (vesicles: Va− and Vb−) were diluted with 50 volumes of buffer, followed by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in fusion buffer (26Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the samples were used for endosome fusion. As a control, the endosome fraction was treated as described above, except that GDI was omitted (vesicles: Va+ and Vb+). Macrophage cytosol was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibody 4F11 bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as described (7Alvarez-Dominguez C. Barbieri A.M. Beron W. Wandinger-Ness A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13834-13843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was removed and used in in vitro fusion assays. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the bound Rab5 was then visualized by Western blotting. Rab5-immunodepleted cytosol (Cy−) and control cytosol (Cy+) were used as described in each experiment. The GFP-Rab5 Q79L cDNA used in these studies was prepared as described. 2R. Roberts, M. A. Barbieri, M. Chua, J. H. Morisaki, and P. D. Stahl, submitted for publication. The GFP-Rab5 fusion constructs were excised from pH3′2J byXbaI/XhoI digestion and ligated into theXbaI/XhoI site of the Sindbis virus vector Toto 1000:3′2J (18Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baby hamster kidney cells, grown on glass coverslips and inverted on glass slides made into a narrow flow cell by strips of vacuum grease (28Heuser J. Zhu Q. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1311-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), were examined by confocal microscopy. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy was carried out on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope using a 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture bright-field objective and fluorescence and rhodamine filter sets. Confocal sequences were collected as Bio-Rad Pic files and were converted to bitmaps for use in Photoshop 4.0. As shown in Fig. 1 A, in vitro fusion carried out with cytosol immunodepleted of Rab5 was substantially reduced, with ∼70% reduction in normal fusion activity (Fig. 1 A, column 2). To selectively activate Rab5 in the presence of other GTPases, we constructed, purified, and characterized the Rab5 D136N mutant. Rab5 D136N avidly bound [3H]XTP, and an excess of unlabeled XTP selectively blocked [3H]XTP binding. Moreover, the presence of other nucleotides (GTP, GDP, and GTPγS) did not show significant competition in the [3H]XTP binding assay (data not shown) (23Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The addition of Rab5 D136N to the in vitroendosome fusion assay containing Rab5-depleted cytosol and an excess of XDP (Fig. 1 A, column 3) failed to stimulate in vitro fusion, as did the addition of the mutant protein alone (data not shown). The addition of Rab5 D136N restored endosome fusion using Rab5-depleted cytosol only when Rab5 D136N was supplemented with XTP (Fig. 1 A, column 4). The concentrations of wild-type Rab5 (Fig. 1 A, column 5) and Rab5 D136N plus XTP required for maximal recovery of fusion were similar, indicating that they are equally active in the fusion assay. To demonstrate that the Rab5 D136N mutant was prenylated, the purified protein was incubated with the semipurified REP-1/Rab geranylgeranyltransferase and GGPP for different times at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The prenylation of the Rab5 D136N mutant was nucleotide-dependent (Fig. 1 B) (17Barbieri M.A Li G. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inability to completely suppress fusion activity using cytosol immunodepleted of Rab5 suggested that the remaining endosome fusion activity was due to membrane-associated Rab5. To explore this point, endosome membrane fractions were depleted of Rab5 by the addition of GDI. The release of Rab5 from the endosomes was carried out in the presence of GDP and an excess of GDI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In agreement with previous results (29Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GDI (100–120 μm) completely removed Rab5 from endosomal membranes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 D). To examine the role of membrane-bound Rab5 in one or both vesicle populations, two sets of vesicles were prepared. One set of vesicles (Va) contained one of the probes necessary for in vitro endosome fusion (e.g. anti-dinitrophenol IgG), and the second set of vesicles (Vb) contained the second probe (e.g. dinitrophenol-derivatized β-glucuronidase). Control vesicles are denoted as Va+ or Vb+, whereas GDI-depleted vesicles are denoted as Va− or Vb−. To control the influence of Rab5 present in cytosol, normal cytosol (denoted as Cy+) or immunodepleted cytosol (denoted as Cy−) was used. In Fig. 1 C, maximal endosome fusion was observed when both untreated cytosol and vesicles were used (Va+/Vb+/Cy+). In contrast, virtually no fusion was observed when Rab5 was removed from both cytosolic and membrane fractions (Va−/Vb−/Cy−). Low levels of fusion activity (∼16%) were recorded when one population of control vesicles was used (Va−/Vb+/Cy−) with immunodepleted cytosol. Only minimal recovery of endosome fusion was obtained when Rab5 was present in one set of vesicles in the presence of normal cytosol (e.g.Va−/Vb+/Cy+) or in neither set of vesicles, but in the presence of cytosol (Va−/Vb−/Cy+). These results clearly show that the presence of Rab5 is required in both sets of vesicles and that the Rab5 activity associated with normal cytosol was insufficient to recover fusion. The removal of Rab5 seems not to be specific to either set of endosomes since Rab removal from either set produced inhibition. Removal of Rab5 from the membranes appears to be the rate-limiting factor since the addition of Rab5 D136N to GDI-treated vesicles in the presence of XTP (but not in the presence of XDP) substantially restored fusion (Fig. 2 A). The restorative activity was temperature-, ATP-, and concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 A). The addition of Rab7 was unable to restore endosome fusion (data not shown). Moreover, incubation of GDI-depleted membranes with [3H]Rab5 D136N resulted in the accumulation of radiolabeled Rab5 on the membranes (Fig. 2 B). Rab5 D136N binding was temperature- and ATP-dependent (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, following incubation of membranes with Rab5 D136N, Rab5 D136N/XTP was substantially more enriched on endosomal membranes than Rab5 D136N/XDP. In contrast, the addition of ATPγS blocked the binding of the Rab5 D136N mutant in the presence of either XTP or XDP (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Restoration of fusion with Rab5 D136N/XTP, but not Rab5 D136N/XDP. A, vesicles (Va−and Vb−), cytosol (Cy−), and different amount of Rab5 D136N plus 1 mm XTP were incubated in fusion buffer for 45 min at 37 and 4 °C and in the absence of ATP (a depleting system (DS) was used as described under “Experimental Procedures”). B, vesicles (Va− and Vb−), cytosol (Cy−), and 400 nm[3H]GGPP-labeled Rab5 D136N plus 0.5 mm XTP or 0.5 mm XDP were incubated in fusion buffer for 45 min at 4 and 37 °C in the presence of 200 μm ATP or 200 μm ATPγS or in the absence of ATP (DS). After incubation, the membranes were separated by centrifugation, and membrane-associated [3H]GGPP-labeled Rab5 D136N was analyzed by autoradiography. The data are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that GTPγS induces the binding of cytosolic factors in the presence of low levels of cytosol (referred to as priming) and that GTPγS is a potent stimulator of in vitro endosome fusion under these conditions (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because of these observations and the fact that the GTPγS stimulation of endosome fusion is Rab5-dependent, 3M. A. Barbieri and P. D. Stahl, unpublished results. we investigated whether priming vesicles with Rab5 is symmetric. To test whether GDI removal of Rab GTPases from endosomal membranes interfered with the priming reaction, control vesicles (Va+and Vb+) and GDI-treated vesicles (Va− and Vb−) were incubated (i.e. primed) without KCl for 5 min at 37 °C in 0.05 mg/ml control cytosol (Cy+) and Rab5-depleted cytosol (Cy−), respectively. As ions are absolutely required for optimal fusion activity, KCl was omitted during this step to avoid fusion during the priming step. Cytosol was removed by diluting the endosomes in 100 volumes of homogenization buffer. The vesicles were then collected by centrifugation. The endosomal pellets were resuspended in fusion buffer containing 50 mm KCl in the absence of cytosol. Fusion was measured by incubation at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 A (first and second columns) shows that priming control vesicles with as little as 0.05 mg/ml cytosol stimulates endosome fusion by nearly 3-fold compared with GDI-treated endosomes. We then used the priming assay to investigate whether Rab5 Q79L or Rab5 S34N, when added to separate sets of GDI-treated vesicles, stimulates fusion. The addition of Rab5 Q79L to both sets of vesicles (e.g.Va−/Vb−/Cy−) (third column) during the priming reaction greatly stimulated fusion, whereas the addition of Rab5 S34N to both sets of vesicles (fourth column) prevented priming and fusion. When Rab5 Q79L was added to one set of vesicles and Rab5 S34N to a second set of GDI-treated vesicles, fusion was prevented (fifth column). These results suggest that the GTP form of Rab5 is required in both sets of vesicles for docking and fusion to occur. Rab5 Q79L and Rab5 S34N are locked in the GTP and GDP forms, respectively. To determine whether selective activation of Rab5 (i.e. with respect to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis) displays a symmetrical requirement, we took advantage of the Rab5 D136N mutant. GDI-treated endosomes (Va−/Vb−/Cy−) were preincubated separately with Rab5-immunodepleted cytosol (0.05 mg/ml) in the presence of either Rab5 D136N/XTP or Rab5 D136N/XDP. Control vesicles were incubated without Rab5 addition. KCl was removed from the incubation buffer to prevent fusion from proceeding. After priming, the samples were centrifuged, as described above, to remove the excess of Rab5 D136N and cytosol. The vesicles were then resuspended in complete fusion buffer, and fusion was assessed (19Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that the addition of Rab5 D136N/XTP to both sets of vesicles (second column) substantially stimulated fusion compared with the Rab5-deficient control (first column). In contrast, a pronounced inhibition of priming and fusion was observed when one or both sets of GDI-treated vesicles were preincubated in the presence of Rab5 D136N/XDP, even if the other set of vesicles was treated with Rab5 D136N/XTP (fourth column). These results indicate that Rab5-GTP is required in both endosomal vesicles for priming and for subsequent endosome fusion. To visualize the fusion of endosomes in living cells, we took advantage of GFP constructs of Rab5 in which both fusion partners were labeled with GFP-Rab5 Q79L. Following transient expression of GFP-Rab5 Q79L in living cells, enlarged endosomes develop, which allows one to monitor endosome fusion directly by confocal microscopy. Cells expressing GFP-Rab5 Q79L show green fluorescence over the entire surface (Fig. 4).2 Docking and fusion between two or more green endosomes were observed in all the preparations tested. To test whether Rab5-negative vesicles were able to fuse with Rab5-positive vesicles, cells expressing GFP-Rab5 Q79L were incubated with Lysotracker as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Lysotracker dyes are weak basic amines that selectively accumulate in cellular compartments with low internal pH (e.g.lysosomes/late endosomes). Rab5-positive endosomes were very weakly labeled with this probe (Fig. 4, a–f).2 In Fig. 4 (a–f, see arrows), fusion can be seen between two Rab5-positive endosomes. However, the Rab5-negative structures (red) were unable to fuse with Rab5-positive endosomes (Fig. 4, a–f, see arrowheads). In contrast, in Fig. 4 (a–c), we show an apparent fusion event between two “red” endosomes. These data clearly show the GTPase-defective form of Rab5 Q79L (i.e. Rab5-GTP) present on both partners of a fusing pair of endosomes. Rab5 is a rate-limiting factor required for endocytosis and endosome-endosome fusion. Work from several laboratories has shown that endosome fusion does not require GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 since GTPase-defective mutants of Rab5 allow endocytosis to proceed and fully support in vitro endosome fusion (6Stenmark H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicle docking, which precedes endosome fusion, is also Rab5-dependent. We set out to examine whether Rab5 is required on both fusion partners during endosome docking and fusion. First, we prepared and characterized Rab5 D136N, a mutation that changes the nucleotide binding specificity of Rab5 from GTP to XTP (23Hoffenberg S. Nikolova L. Pan J.Y. Daniel D.S. Wessling-Resnick M. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I.

Pharmacol. 1997; 5: 47-51Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Rab5 D136N allowed us to activate Rab5 selectively in the presence of other GTPases. We showed that Rab5 D136N (i) stimulates endosome-endosome fusion, which was cytosol-, XTP-, and Rab5 D136N concentration-dependent, and (ii) restores endosome fusion using both cytosol and/or membranes that were depleted of Rab5. We also showed that Rab5 D136N binding to membranes is temperature- and ATP-dependent. Earlier work by Ullrich et al.suggested that Rab5 binding is ATP-independent; however, these studies were carried out in a semipermeabilized cell preparation (13Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To examine the question of whether both cytosolic and membrane-bound Rab5 proteins are required for docking and fusion, we immunodepleted cytosol of Rab5 with an anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibody. Immunodepletion of Rab5 from cytosol reduced its ability to support fusion by 70%. Complete recovery of fusion with vesicles and immunodepleted cytosol was achieved by the addition of Rab5 D136N plus XTP, but not XDP. Moreover, Rab5 D136N binding to membranes corresponded with the recovery of fusion and was temperature- and ATP-dependent. Interestingly, ATP hydrolysis was also required for the binding of Rab5 D136N/XTP or Rab5 D136N/XDP. To remove Rab5 fully from the in vitro system, we depleted Rab5 from endosomal vesicles by treatment with GDI in the presence of GDP. Removal of Rab5 from both cytosol and membranes completely inhibited fusion. To explore the symmetrical requirement of Rab5 to restore fusion, two sets of endosomal vesicles were prepared, and the vesicles were primed (i.e. preincubated) either with normal cytosol or with cytosol that had been depleted of Rab5 with GDI treatment. Following a brief priming incubation in the presence of limiting levels of cytosol, vesicles were tested for fusion in the absence of cytosol. Removal of Rab5 from one or both sets of endosomes inhibited fusion. Priming both sets of vesicles with Rab5 Q79L restored endosome fusion. However, priming both sets of vesicles with Rab5 S34N had little effect on fusion. Interestingly, priming one set of vesicles with Rab5 Q79L and the other set of vesicles with Rab5 S34N resulted in no restoration of fusion. These findings suggest that Rab5 in the GTP form is required in both sets of vesicles. To carry this analysis a step further, we examined priming of endosomal vesicles under conditions where only Rab5 was activated using the Rab5 D136N mutant. Rab5 D136N is functional only in the presence of XTP. To determine the role of Rab5 in priming, we incubated vesicles in Rab5-depleted cytosol along with Rab5 D136N in the presence or absence of XTP. We found that only in the presence of Rab5 D136N and XTP in both sets of vesicles were we able to recover fusion. To extend these observations to living cells, we expressed GFP-Rab5 Q79L in cells using the Sindbis virus expression system.2 GFP-Rab5 is functional in living cells when transiently expressed or in stable cell lines. GFP-Rab5 appears to localize to endocytic compartments as evidenced by co-localization studies using transferrin as a marker. By observing living cells expressing GFP-Rab5 Q79L, we recorded multiple endosome fusion events by video microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, endosomes labeled with GFP-Rab5 Q79L preferentially fused with each other and failed to fuse with adjacent acidic compartments that were not labeled with GFP-Rab5 Q79L. The binding and subsequent activation of Rab5 induce the binding of cytosolic factors (i.e. rabaptin 5 and others (8Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M.

Haas et al. (31Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and Mayer and Wickner (32Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown that Ypt7 was required in both sets of yeast late endosomal vesicles for the docking step to occur. Thus, the yeast homotypic fusion event seems quite similar to macrophage endosome fusion described here. Clearly, more work needs to be done to characterize the Rab5-membrane requirement for both sets of endosome and to understand how Rab5 is linked to other proteins (i.e. rabaptin 5 (8Stenmark H.

Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Homotypic fusion may utilize only target SNARES, as has been suggested for endoplasmic reticulum vesicle fusion (35Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Rab GTPases do appear to be required for the proper assembly of SNARES into active units (36Sogaard M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), although Rab GTPases are not necessary for SNARE-driven membrane fusion (27Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A.

The signals transduced by the small GTPases are transient; the GTP-bound Rho family proteins are capable of cleaving the phosphodiester bond linking β-phosphate of GTP to its γ-phosphate via the intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis machinery of the GTPases, a process that can be further accelerated by the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 (13Lamarche N.

The GDP-bound Rho was found to form a stable complex with aluminum tetrafluoride and GAP and thereby to stabilize a transition state of the GAP reaction (26Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), further suggesting that Rho GAP contributes directly to Rho GTP-hydrolysis by supplying essential determinants to the catalytic core of the GTPase. Although Rho GAP shares no sequence homology to RasGAP or Gα of heterotrimeric G-proteins, this feature of formation of a transition state of G-protein-GAP complex is apparently conserved across the panel of Ras superfamily members (27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A.

Biol. 1997; 4: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a divergent structural evolution that utilizes multiple opportunities to negatively regulate the GTPase activity of respective GTP-binding proteins. In the absence of GAP stimulation, certain members of the Rho family,i.e. Cdc42 and Rac, have been known to contain significantly higher intrinsic GTPase activity than others (e.g. RhoA and TC10) and Ras (22Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Zhang B. Chernoff J. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

It was unclear how the fast rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 and Rac come to arise and how this special property of the GTPases may contribute to their mechanism of regulation. In the present study, we found that the Rho family proteins Cdc42, Rac2, and RhoA were capable of forming reversible homodimers. The homodimer formation by Cdc42 and Rac2, but not RhoA, at the GTP-bound state, caused a marked activation of intrinsic GTPase activity. Furthermore, the specific GTPase-activating effects of Cdc42-GTP and Rac2-GTP because of the homophilic interaction were dependent upon the structural determinant(s) in the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain of the GTPases that was required for the formation of a transition state complex of the GTPase-activating reaction. Our findings provide a rationale for the fast rate of intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis by Cdc42 and Rac and suggest that dimerization may play a role in the negative regulation of specific Rho family GTPases mediated by the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain.

GTP-hydrolysis of the small GTPases were measured by the MESG/phosphorylase system monitoring the free γPi release as described for the cases of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (22Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y.

Single turnover GTPase reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mM. Data were fitted into a single exponential to derive the apparent rate constant K app. For measurements of GTPase-activating reactions, 5–50 μl of stock solution containing the indicated amount of GAP (Cdc42GAP) or the GTPγS-bound G-proteins were added together with MgCl2 to the reaction mixtures. A control experiment in which the substrate GTPases were omitted was carried out in each independent measurement to provide a background. The concentration of Pi in the reaction solution was calculated by a factor of extinction coefficient ε360 nm = 11,000 m−1cm−1 at pH 7.6 from the absorbance change resulting from the phosphorylase coupling reactions (32Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and was used to determine the effective concentrations of the small G-proteins after one round of single turnover reaction. A Superdex 200HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled to a Bio-Rad biologic liquid chromatography system was used to analyze the homophilic interactions of the small GTPases. Purified samples (200 μl) of the respective GTPases in the GDP or GTPγS-bound form at the indicated concentrations were injected to the column, and an elution buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol was applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption. Complex formation between the immobilized GST-fusion G-proteins and the endogenous G-proteins of NIH 3T3 cell lysates or purified recombinant G-proteins was carried out following previously established protocols (34Zheng Y.

Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GDP or GTPγS preloaded cell lysates containing the endogenous G-proteins or the His6-tagged recombinant G-proteins were mixed with the glutathione-agarose beads bound to various GST-G-proteins at either the GDP or GTPγS-bound state in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of AlCl3 and NaF for 20 min at 4 °C, and the coprecipitates of the agarose beads were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis or Coomassie Blue staining. The fluorescence emission spectra of mantGDP-bound small GTPases were monitored with the excitation wavelength at 360 nm using an SLM-Aminco Series 2 luminescence spectrometer similar to that previously described (27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). 150 μm AlCl3 and 15 mm NaF and/or various concentrations of Cdc42-GTPγS (or C-7-GTPγS) were titrated into a 0.6-ml sample containing the mantGDP-bound GTPase in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. It has been known that the Ras proteins have slow intrinsic GTPase reaction rates (37Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). The apparent rate was determined to be 0.022 min−1 for N-Ras by an assay measuring the time course of γPi release from Ras-GTP, and it did not seem to be affected by increasing concentrations of Ras (Fig. 1 A). RhoA behaved similarly to Ras in this aspect, whereas the apparent rates of GTP-hydrolysis of Cdc42 and Rac2 were found to increase significantly with increasing concentrations of the G-proteins bound to GTP (Fig. 1 A). Titration of Cdc42-GTPγS to Cdc42-GTP under single turnover conditions resulted in a significant increase of the initial rate of the GTPase reaction, similar to the effect of the addition of Cdc42GAP, whereas addition of Cdc42-GDP had no detectable effect (Fig. 1,B and C), indicating that the activated form of Cdc42 presents a GAP activity toward Cdc42. This apparent GTPase-activating effect by Cdc42-GTPγS was not affected by isoprenylation modification since Cdc42 isolated from an insect cell expression system (*Cdc42) had a similar behavior (Fig. 1 C). Similar observations were also made for Rac2 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the GTPγS-bound RhoA lacked the ability to stimulate the GTPase activity of RhoA-GTP (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, it appears that the Rho family proteins Cdc42 and Rac2, but not RhoA, possess self-stimulatory GAP activity when in the activated state. The self-stimulatory multiple turnover GTPase reactions (Fig. 1 A) may provide a rationale for the previously observed fast rate of intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis by recombinant Cdc42 and Rac (22Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Zhang B. Chernoff J. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8776-8782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Zhang B. Zheng Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5249-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the apparent homophilic interaction between molecules of the small GTPases, recombinant Cdc42 and Rac2, as well as the controls RhoA and N-Ras, were subjected to gel filtration chromatography analysis. Aside from the ∼25-kDa elution peak expected for the monomeric form of the proteins, an absorption peak at ∼50 kDa corresponding to the dimer position was observed in the chromatography profiles of all three Rho family GTPases, Cdc42, Rac2, and RhoA (Figs. 2 A). The homodimer formation was slightly affected by replacement of bound GDP with GTPγS, which resulted in a minor shift of the overall population of the GTPases from dimers to monomers (Figs. 2 A). A concentration-dependent breakdown of preformed dimers of Cdc42-GTPγ35S was detected from the traces of the radioactive GTPγ35S-bound Cdc42 eluents (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the dimer formation is a reversible process. The estimated dissociation constant is at ∼2 μm for (Cdc42-GTPγS)2 based upon the concentration-dependent absorption peak distributions. The property of dimer formation appeared to be specific to the Rho family members, because N-Ras at either nucleotide binding state remained exclusively monomeric (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that the Rho family GTPases Cdc42, Rac2, and RhoA can form reversible homodimers at the GTP-bound state with micromolar binding affinity. To assess whether the homophilic interaction may apply to native Rho GTPases of mammalian cells, a complex-formation assay was performed using the immobilized GST-Cdc42, GST-RhoA, or GST-Ras as bait and NIH 3T3 cell lysates as the source for endogenous small GTPases. Western blot analysis of the coprecipitates of the GST fusions revealed that GST-Cdc42-GDP and GST-Cdc42-GTPγS were capable of binding to the endogenous Cdc42-GDP and Cdc42-GTPγS, respectively, but with much reduced affinity to Cdc42 of the different nucleotide binding states (Fig. 2 B). Neither GST-RhoA-GDP, GST-RhoA-GTPγS, GST-Ras-GDP, nor GST-Ras-GTPγS interacted with Cdc42 at a detectable level (Fig. 2 B) even though both the GST-RhoA and GST-Ras were able to bind to guanine nucleotides and to interact with their respective regulatory proteins (data not shown). Thus, endogenous Cdc42 of the mammalian cells is capable of forming a homophilic complex. The carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain of the Rho family proteins, spanning the last eight amino acid residues before the CAAXisoprenylation sequences (Fig. 3 A), was suspected to have a role in homodimer formation because of its positively charged exposure on the surface of the molecules (38Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 9: 699-702Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 39Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutants of Cdc42 with deletion of the last seven residues of the C terminus (C-7) and of RhoA with the carboxyl-terminal eight residues truncated (Rho-8) were found to be present only in monomeric form (Fig. 3 B). These deletion mutations did not seem to affect the tertiary folding of the proteins and maintained the full capability to interact with Rho GAP (25Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). C-7 lost the dose dependence of the intrinsic GTPase activity of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 C), which was consistent with its inability to catalyze the GTPase reaction of itself or wild-type Cdc42 when bound to GTPγS (Fig. 3 D). However, C-7 remained a good substrate for the GAP reaction catalyzed by wild-type Cdc42 bound to GTPγS (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that determinant(s) in the polybasic domain of Cdc42 contributes to the catalytic GAP reaction. We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain of the Rho family proteins mediate their homodimer formation and that structural determinants within the polybasic domain play a critical role in the self-stimulatory GAP reactions of Cdc42 and Rac2. Interactions between Rho proteins and Rho GAP and between Ras and RasGAP have been found to undergo a transition state of the respective GAP reactions, which can be mimicked by the ternary complex of the respective G-proteins at the GDP-bound state, AlF4−, and the respective GAPs (27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4392-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether the self-stimulatory GAP reaction of the Rho family homodimers, i.e. (Cdc42-GTP)2 and (Rac2-GTP)2, may be through a mechanism similar to that of GAP activations of Ras and Cdc42, a fluorescence assay originally designed to detect the formation of the ternary transition state complex of Ras-GDP, AlF4−, and GAP for the Ras-RasGAP reaction (27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was employed to examine the case of Cdc42 homodimers. The addition of AlF4− or Cdc42-GTPγS alone did not change the emission spectrum of Cdc42 bound to the fluorescent GDP-analog mantGDP, whereas the spectrum was changed both in maximum absorption wavelength (from 448 to 430 nm) and in intensity (a 100% increase at 448 nm) when AlF4− and Cdc42-GTPγS were added together to Cdc42-mantGDP (Fig. 4 A). This change in Cdc42-mantGDP fluorescence indicated a conformational change around the GTPase active site, which attributes to the formation of an analog of the GTP-bound transition state of the GTPase reaction involving Cdc42-GDP, AlF4−, and Cdc42-GTPγS, as were the cases for Ras-GDP, AlF4−, and RasGAP (27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and for Cdc42-GDP, AlF4−, and Cdc42GAP (40Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Oswald R.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4392-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, stoichiometric amounts of Cdc42-GTPγS to Cdc42-mantGDP were needed for this effect (Fig. 4 B). The effective dissociation constant (K d) of the transition state complex Cdc42-mantGDP-AlF4−-Cdc42-GTPγS was calculated at 5.8 μm after the background signals were subtracted. When the C-7 mutant of Cdc42 was examined under similar conditions, it became clear that it had lost the ability to form the transition state complex with Cdc42-mantGDP and AlF4− when bound to GTPγS (Fig. 4 B). RhoA, which is capable of forming homodimers through the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain (Fig. 2 A) but lacks the self-stimulatory GAP activity (Fig. 1 C), was found unable to form the transition state complex (data not shown). To further visualize the AlF4−-induced ternary complex formation between the inactive and active forms of Cdc42, a pull-down assay using the agarose-immobilized GST-Cdc42 and recombinant His6-tagged Cdc42 was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4 C, whereas both GST-Cdc42-GDP and GST-Cdc42-GTPγS were able to pull down a significant amount of His6-Cdc42 of the same nucleotide binding states, presumably because of the formation of dimer complex, GST-Cdc42-GDP were only able to marginally complex with His6-Cdc42-GTPγS. However, the ability of complex formation between Cdc42-GDP and Cdc42-GTPγS was significantly enhanced when AlF4− was included in the incubation mixture, indicating the formation of Cdc42-GDP-AlF4−-Cdc42-GTPγS complex. These results provide evidence that the homodimer formation of specific Rho family GTPase, i.e. Cdc42 and Rac2, in the GTP-bound form, undergoes a similar transition state like that of the Ras or Rho proteins interacting with GAPs. From both the biochemical and structural analysis of G-protein-GAP interactions, it has become evident that evolutionarily divergent structures, e.g. RasGAP, RhoGAP, and a built-in domain of Gαi, may utilize a similar mechanism in the course of down-regulation of respective G-proteins (29Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 277: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One common feature of the GTPase-activating reactions is the progression from the ground state (GTP-bound state) to the transition state (GDP-AlF4−-bound state), which appears to be critical for the activation of GTPase activity. Another is the direct participation of critical amino acids from the respective GAP molecules in the GTP hydrolysis reaction to stabilize the transition state conformation of the GTPases. The findings reported in this study, that the Rho family members Cdc42 and Rac2 in the GTP-bound form forms a similar transition state complex in the homodimers and that one molecule of the dimer supplies specific structural determinant(s) to the GTPase core of the other molecule and thereby stabilizes the transition state conformation of the GTPase-activating reaction, may provide yet another example of evolutional convergence of the mechanism of negative regulations of GTPases. The carboxyl-terminal region of Rho family proteins represents the most divergent sequences in the family. Most members contain a stretch of two to six poly-lysine and/or arginine residues immediately before the isoprenylation CAAX sequence. Not unlike the similar structure of K-Ras, this polybasic domain of S. cerevisiaeCdc42 has been suggested to have a role in membrane attachment (41Davis C.R. Richman T.J. Deliduka S.B. Blaisdell J.O. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and, in the case of human Cdc42, may be involved in interaction with acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (42Zheng Y. Glaven J.A. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23815-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our observation of the dimer-formation and the GTPase-activating capability of wild-type and C-terminal mutant (C-7) of Cdc42 further suggest that the C-terminal region of certain Rho family proteins is essential for dimerization and self-stimulatory GAP activity and may be involved in a non-symmetric homodimer configuration: one molecule of Cdc42 contributes the C-terminal domain containing the binding and catalytic determinant(s) (such as a critical arginine residue) to function as a GAP, whereas the other molecule may act as a substrate to interact with this “GAP” through a distinct region of the molecule such as the GTP-binding core. Based upon studies of the carboxyl-terminal hypervariable region of Ras, it was expected that the C-terminal domain might not contain definable tertiary structure (37Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Our findings that the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain can act only as a GAP when bound to GTP in the homophilic interaction of Cdc42 and Rac2 and that synthetic polypeptides corresponding to the domain sequences are capable of competing with the homodimer formation yet contain no GAP activity 2B. Zhang and Y. Zheng, unpublished observations. indicate that the conformation of this region of Rho proteins is sensitive to the nucleotide binding state of the GTPases. Moreover, all Rho family proteins examined containing the polybasic sequences at the carboxyl termini, including the additional mammalian members Rac1, RhoC, and RhoG, have been found capable of forming homodimers or higher oligomers, whereas others lacking polybasic residues in the region,e.g. TC10 and RhoB, are in monomeric form,2suggesting that the polybasic nature of the domain is critical in mediating homophilic interactions of specific Rho family GTPases. The fact that RhoA is found to form homodimers but yet is unable to stimulate the GTPase activity in the homophilic interaction further implies that additional unique structural determinant(s) is required to elicit the GTPase-activating effect. Whether the observed homodimer formation and self-stimulatory GTPase-activating activity of Cdc42 and Rac2 bear physiological significance remains unclear. Given that these Rho family proteins are expected to assemble directly or indirectly to large molecular complexes in cells (1Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar) and the potential dual roles as both activator and down-regulator of their own signals of the GTPases at the activated state, it will be a particularly challenging issue to address. Although the K cat values of the self-stimulatory GAP reaction of the GTP-bound homodimers may be an order of magnitude lower than that catalyzed by Rho GAP,2the observed K d of the Cdc42-GTP homodimers and the effective K d of the transition state complex are comparable with that of Cdc42-RhoGAP interaction (∼2 μm) and Ras-RasGAP interaction (∼1.3 μm), respectively (22Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The relatively high abundance and ubiquitous distribution of Rho family proteins also make it an attractive possibility that the homophilic interaction may have a role in the regulation of these small GTPases. Future work to examine the structural determinant(s) of the carboxyl-terminal polybasic domain of Cdc42 and Rac2 involved in the dimer formation and catalysis and the site(s) of the GTPase hydrolysis core of the substrate required for the interaction should provide additional insight for the mechanism of dimer formation."

The identification and comparison of the molecular determinants of receptor/G protein coupling within the different receptor families may help identify general rules involved in this protein/protein interaction.

G protein-coupled receptor metabotropic glutamate human embryonic kidney inositol phosphate. Transduction of extracellular signals to intracellular responses via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 includes activation of the receptor and subsequent regulation of effectors via trimeric G proteins. A variety of heterotrimeric G proteins have different target proteins (1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the intracellular response depends on the G protein subtypes (among those located in the proximity of the receptor) that can be activated by the receptor (selectivity). Identification of the molecular basis of receptor/G protein coupling selectivity is therefore of interest since this determines the transduction mechanism of these receptors. Three major families of GPCRs can be defined, and the members of each family share no sequence similarity with receptors from the other families. Receptors homologous to rhodopsin (receptors for catecholamines, acetylcholine, certain peptides, and glycoproteins) constitute the first family (family 1) which is to date the best characterized one. Family 2 receptors are those homologous to the vasoactive intestinal peptide and the glucagon receptors. Family 3 receptors comprise the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) (2Conn P.

Among these, the extreme C terminus was shown to play a critical role by interacting with certain motifs within a cavity formed by the second and third intracellular loops of the receptor (9Wess J.

Comparison of the molecular determinants of receptor/G protein coupling between members of the different GPCR families should help to establish some general principles for this interaction. Accordingly, we recently started to identify the structural determinants of G protein coupling in mGlu receptors that are used here as representatives of the family 3 GPCRs. Three groups of mGlu receptors have been defined based on their sequence similarity and G protein-coupling selectivity (2Conn P. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 24Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). In these receptors, the first and third intracellular loops (i1 and i3) are short with low variability. Major sequence differences are found in the second intracellular loop (i2). The highly variable intracellular C termini play a role in G protein interaction but probably not in a discriminatory manner (25Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prézeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl.

It was shown that the C terminus of the G protein α-subunit plays a critical role in the recognition of the Go/Gi-coupled groups II and III mGlu receptors (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to identify the important residues in the C-terminal end of the G protein α-subunit controlling the selectivity. Chemicals including glutamate were obtained from Sigma (L'Isle d'Abeau, France) unless otherwise indicated. Serum, culture media, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). The plasmids expressing mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors were as described previously (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Gαq and chimeric G proteins (21Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Conklin (The Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA). The mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors were tagged with MRGS-His6 (MRGS: methionine, arginine, glycine, serine) epitope at the C termini. A pRK5 plasmid containing the sequence encoding the epitope MRGS-His6 flanked by a unique NheI site at its 5′ end and an in-frame TAA stop codon at its 3′ end was first constructed. To generate this vector, the following oligonucleotides were annealed and introduced into the HindIII unique restriction site of the pRK5 plasmid: 5′-agc tag cat gag agg atc gca tca cca tca cca tca cta aca t-3′; 5′-tcg tac tct cct agc gta gtg gta gtg gta gtg att gtc ga-3′. The mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptor-coding sequences were then introduced by a polymerase chain reaction using the unique NheI restriction site so that the stop codon was replaced by alanine followed by serine and the MRGS-His6epitope. The sequence of the epitope-tagged receptors was verified using 17–25 mer primers and Sequenase with the dideoxynucleotide method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The resulting fusion protein is detectable using specific antibodies recognizing this epitope (Qiagen, Paris, France). Functional studies after co-expression with various chimeric G proteins, and determination of the EC50 of at least three distinct agonists revealed no differences between the wild-type and the epitope-tagged receptors in our system (data not shown). Point mutations were introduced by a polymerase chain reaction into the plasmids encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Gαqo or Gαqz using specific oligonucleotides and Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ozyme, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the original plasmids usingXhoI and HindIII sites. The sequences of the mutated G protein α-subunits were verified by sequencing. For the nomenclature of the chimeras and mutants, see Fig. 3. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin 100 units/ml final). Electroporation was performed in a total volume of 300 μl with 10 μg of carrier DNA, mGlu2 or mGlu4 receptor plasmid DNA (4 and 10 μg, respectively), wild-type or mutated Gα-subunit plasmid DNA (2 μg), and 10 million cells in electroporation buffer (K2HPO4, 50 mm; CH3COOK (potasium acetate), 20 mm; KOH, 20 mm). After electroporation (260 V, 960 μF, Bio-Rad gene pulser electroporator), cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, and split into 12-well clusters (Falcon, Paris, France) (10 million cells per cluster) previously coated with poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml;M r 40,000) (Sigma, Paris, France) to favor adhesion of the cells. The procedure used for the determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was adapted from previously published methods (31Berridge M. Dawson R. Downes C. Heslop J. Irvine R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar, 32Bone E. Fretten P. Palmer S. Kirk C. Michell R. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 2 to 3 h after electroporation and incubated for 14 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Glutamax-I (Life Technologies, Inc., Paris, France) containing 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (23.4 Ci/mol) (NEN, Paris, France). Cells were then washed three times and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of Hepes saline buffer (NaCl 146 mm, KCl 4.2 mm, MgCl2 0.5 mm, glucose 0.1%, Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France) and 2 mm pyruvate (Sigma, Lisle d'Abeau, France). Cells were then washed again twice with the same buffer, and LiCl was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The agonist was applied 5 min later and left for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 0.5 ml of perchloric acid (5%), on ice (32Bone E. Fretten P. Palmer S. Kirk C. Michell R. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Supernatants were recovered and the IPs were purified on Dowex columns (31Berridge M. Dawson R. Downes C. Heslop J. Irvine R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fraction was counted after treatment with 10% Triton X-100, 0.1 nNaOH for 30 min and used as a standard. Results are expressed as the amount of IP produced over the radioactivity present in the membranes. The dose-response curves were fitted according to the equationy = ((y max −y min)/1 + (x/EC50)) + y minusing the kaleidagraph program (Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA). The cells were transfected and treated as described above. Cells cultured in one well were harvested for immunodetection, and the rest of the cells were used for IP assay. Protein samples (10 μg/lane) were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10494) Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Prior to the immunoblotting, total protein on the membranes was visualized with Ponceau S to confirm that the same amounts of protein were loaded on the gel. The receptors and G proteins were detected using primary monoclonal antibodies against MRGS-His6epitope (Qiagen, Paris, France) or hemagglutinin epitope (generous gift of Dr. B. Mouillac, Montpellier, France), respectively. ECL chemiluminescence system was used to stain the secondary antibodies (Amersham Life Sciences, Paris, France). Group II (mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors) and group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4, 6, 7, and 8 receptors) inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in transfected cells via pertussis toxin- sensitive G proteins and are not capable of stimulating IP formation (2Conn P. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar, 29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol.

Their coupling to chimeric G protein α-subunits, that correspond to Gαq with the 5 C-terminal residues of Gαi2 (Gαqi), Gαo (Gαqo), or Gαz(Gαqz) (34Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), can therefore be easily determined by measuring their capability of stimulating IP formation upon activation with glutamate (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that both group II and group III mGlu receptors coupled to Gαqi and Gαqo, but that Gαqz was activated by group III receptors only (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). By using hemagglutinin-tagged G protein α-subunits (21Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

The group II mGlu2 receptor stimulated phospholipase C when co-expressed with Gαqi or Gαqo but not when expressed alone or with Gαq or Gαqz, even though these G proteins were expressed at very similar levels (Fig. 2). Like mGlu2 receptor, the group III mGlu4 receptor activated Gαqi and Gαqo, but not Gαq (Fig. 1, c and d). Only mGlu4, but not mGlu2, activated Gαqz (Fig. 1,c and d), even though these two receptors were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the differential coupling of mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors to Gαqz is not due to a difference in the level of expression of either the receptor or the G protein. This raises the question of the sequence element and amino acid residues responsible for this coupling selectivity.Table IPotency of glutamate in stimulating IP formation in HEK 293 cells expressing mGlu2 or mGlu4 receptors with either Gαqo, Gαqz, GαqoCI or GαqzICmGlu2 receptormGlu4 receptorEC50n HnEC50n HnμmμmGαqo7.6 ± 1.51.2 ± 0.1316.1 ± 1.31.5 ± 0.19Gαqzn.e.29.8 ± 3.81.1 ± 0.23GαqoCIn.e.19.2 ± 3.41.5 ± 0.34GαqzIC11.8 ± 8.81.0 ± 0.1312.8 ± 3.91.1 ± 0.16EC50 (μm) and Hill coefficients (n H) were calculated for each individual experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Values are means ± S.E. of (n) experiments performed in triplicates.n.e., no significant glutamate-induced IP formation.

As shown in Fig. 3, the Gα chimeras used in our study vary in a span of 5 extreme C-terminal amino acid residues, among which three differ between Gαqo and Gαqz (at positions −1, −4, and −5). All the mutant G proteins were expressed at a similar level in transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2). Reciprocal exchange of the residue at position −5 or −1 between Gαqo and Gαqz did not change their coupling specificity toward mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors (Fig. 4, a and c). In contrast, swapping the residue at position −4 between Gαqo and Gαqz (mutants GαqoCI and GαqzIC where isoleucine replaces cysteine and vice versa, respectively) resulted in the exchange of coupling properties of the G proteins toward the mGlu2 receptor (Fig. 4,a and b). The mGlu2 receptor activated GαqzIC upon activation with glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner, but not GαqoCI (Fig. 4 b). As expected, both are stimulated by mGlu4 receptor (Fig. 4, c and d). The potency of glutamate in stimulating IP formation was determined in cells expressing mGlu2 or mGlu4 receptors with any of the mutated G proteins. As shown in Table I, when a glutamate-induced IP formation was detected, a similar potency was observed, whatever G protein was co-expressed with the receptor. Chimeric and mutated G proteins that are activated by mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors show differences in the maximal effect of glutamate (Fig. 4, a and c). Mutation of residue −1 or −5 in Gαqo or Gαqzresulted in small changes in the maximal effect of glutamate, indicating that these positions influence the coupling efficacy to these receptors. Among the various chimeric and mutant G protein α-subunits tested, those which possess a tyrosine at position −5 and a cysteine at position −4 (GαqoGY and GαqzIC) allow a better coupling of mGlu2 receptor to phospholipase C (Fig. 4 a). These same mutated G proteins also allow a very good coupling to phospholipase C of mGlu4 receptor (Fig. 4 c) as well as other group II and III mGlu receptors (data not shown). This indicates that a tyrosine residue at position −5 is often better accepted by mGlu receptors than is a glycine residue. Changing the −1 residue alone does not dramatically modify the coupling efficacy of the G protein to the mGlu2 receptor. Tyrosine at position −1 is often less accepted by the mGlu4 receptor than is cysteine. For example, the cysteine −1 to tyrosine mutation of Gαqz, or GαqzYG generates GαqzCY and GαqoCI, respectively, that are less efficient in coupling mGlu4 receptor to phospholipase C (Fig. 4 c). Taken together, residues at the other positions −1 and −5 weaken or enhance coupling efficiency to mGlu2 and mGlu4 receptors. The present data extend our knowledge on the importance of the last few C-terminal amino acid residues of the G protein α-subunit in the specific interaction with heptahelical receptors, including the metabotropic glutamate receptors from family 3 GPCRs. Usage of chimeric G protein α-subunits that do not differ in other portions of the proteins than the extreme C terminus allowed us to study specifically the relevance of this region. We show that a single residue (at position −4) on the extreme C terminus is crucial for chimeras of Gαq proteins to distinguish group II from group III mGlu receptors. Residues at position −5 and at position −1 do not control specificity, but still play a role in coupling efficiency to mGlu receptors. Several studies using different approaches indicated that the extreme C-terminal part of the G protein α-subunit has a critical role in specifying interactions with family 1 GPCRs (for reviews, see Refs.9Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 10Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 11Bourne H.R. Curr.

Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The present study extends our knowledge of the role of this portion of the α-subunit in the specific interaction with family 3 GPCRs. Moreover, our data indicate that a single amino acid residue within this sequence is sufficient to cause discrimination between group II and group III mGlu receptors. Cysteine at position −4 is compatible with a coupling of Gαqi and Gαqo to either mGlu2 or mGlu4 receptors, whereas in Gαqz isoleucine at position −4 is compatible with a coupling to mGlu4 receptor, but prevents coupling to the mGlu2 receptor. In agreement with our observation, post-translational modifications of residue −4 has been shown to play an important role in the interaction with family 1 GPCRs. In Gi and Go, this position corresponds to the cysteine residue that is ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, which prevents coupling of these G proteins to their receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar and 10Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In Gq and G11 a tyrosine −4 has to be phosphorylated to allow coupling to family 1 as well as to the mGlu1a receptor from family 3 GPCRs (40Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Residues at positions −4 and −3 in Gi have been reported to play an important role in discriminating between Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors (15Conklin B.R. Herzmark P. Ishida S. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Sun Y. Farfel Z. Bourne H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 885-890PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, residues at positions −3 and −5 in Gαqs chimeras play a key role in coupling to muscarinic and vasopressin receptors and that a residue at position −5 discriminates between these two receptors from family 1 GPCRs (37Kostenis E. Gomeza J. Lerche C. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23675-23681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of transducin bound to rhodopsin was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (16Dratz E.A. Furstenau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This study revealed the glycine residue at position −3 which is conserved in Gi, Go, Gz, and Gt α-subunits is involved in a β-turn, a structure that likely favors the contact between the receptor and the side chain of the −4 residue. It is interesting to note that in Gα15, which is activated by both group II and group III mGlu receptors (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), there is an isoleucine at position −4, as in Gαqz. However, the residue at position −3 in Gα15 is not a glycine, but an asparagine. This possibly changes the flexibility in this area and thus neutralizes the decisive discriminatory effect of the (−4) residue. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the same sequence and/or structural element of the G protein α-subunit C-terminal end for the specific interaction with either family 1 or family 3 receptors. Such similarity in the molecular determinants of the G protein α-subunit involved in the specific recognition of family 1 and family 3 GPCRs was not expected. The C terminus of the G protein α-subunit is likely to fit into a cavity formed by the second and the third intracellular loops of family 1 GPCRs (9Wess J.

The third intracellular loop of these family 1 receptors is the longest and often plays a discriminatory role toward the Gα protein, while the second contains a highly conserved sequence (DRY) important for G protein activation (41Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. Debenedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In contrast, the third intracellular loop of mGlu receptors is very short, highly conserved (10 conserved residues out of 13), and involved in G protein activation (42Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the second is longer (24–26 residues), more variable (only 5 are conserved in all mGlu receptors), and involved in G protein recognition (26Pin J.-P.

It would therefore be of interest to examine how family 1 and 3 GPCRs could recognize the same features of the C terminus of the G protein α-subunits with such different intracellular loops. The C-terminal end of the α-subunit is only one of several areas that is likely to contact the receptor directly, these also include the N-terminal end and the α4→β6 loop (9Wess J.

One may therefore propose that all portions of heterotrimeric G proteins that are in contact with the receptor influence the receptor interaction with (and activation of) Gα, and therefore the coupling has to be seen as an outcome of network coordination. Moreover the βγ dimer interaction with various α-subunits might play a role in the coupling efficiency as well (12Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol.

When interactions at certain contact points are weak, absent, or negative, coupling between the receptor and G protein can still be possible if this is overcome by a strong interaction at some other points, or when such regions that weaken coupling are removed either from the receptor or from the G protein (see, for example Refs. 27Mary S.

https://openalex.org/W2134653135,"Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala (RRETAWA) is a novel ligand peptide for integrin α5β1, which blocks α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (Koivunen, E., Wang, B., and Ruoslahti, E. (1994)J. Cell Biol. 124, 373–380). Here we have localized the binding site for RRETAWA on α5β1 using inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and site-directed mutagenesis. A cyclic peptide containing this sequence (*CRRETAWAC*) had little effect on the binding of most anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs to α5β1 but completely blocked binding of the anti-α5 mAb 16 in a directly competitive manner. Hence, the binding site of RRETAWA appears to closely overlap with the epitope of mAb 16. *CRRETAWAC* also acted as a direct competitive inhibitor of the binding of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing fibronectin fragments to α5β1, suggesting that the binding site for RRETAWA is also closely overlapping with that for RGD. However, differences between the binding sites of RRETAWA and RGD were apparent in that (i) RGD peptides allosterically inhibited the binding of mAb 16 to α5β1, and (ii) several mAbs that perturbed binding of α5β1 to RGD had little effect on binding of α5β1 to RRETAWA. A double mutation in α5 (S156G/W157S) blocked the interaction of both RRETAWA and mAb 16 with α5β1 but had no effect on fibronectin binding or on the binding of other anti-α5 mAbs. Ser156-Trp157 is located near the apex of a putative loop region on the upper surface of a predicted β-propeller structure formed by the NH2-terminal repeats of α5. Our findings suggest that this sequence forms part of the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1. Furthermore, as Ser156-Trp157 is unique to the α5 subunit, it may be responsible for the specific recognition of RRETAWA by α5β1.

Integrin α5β1 is a widely distributed cell surface receptor for the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin. The cell-binding domain of fibronectin contains a number of repeated modules termed fibronectin type III repeats. An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)1 sequence in the 10th type III repeat is the major binding site for α5β1 (1Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2820) Google Scholar, 2Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), although an additional “synergy” sequence in the ninth type III repeat is also recognized by this integrin (3Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel ligand sequence for α5β1, Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala(RRETAWA), was identified from a CX 7C phage display library (5Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Peptides containing this sequence support cell adhesion directly, and antagonize α5β1-mediated adhesion of cells to fibronectin. RRETAWA appears to be specific to human α5β1, as it is not recognized by other RGD-dependent integrins or by murine α5β1. Although the RRETAWA sequence appears unrelated to RGD, the binding sites for RRETAWA and RGD on α5β1 were proposed to be closely overlapping because peptides containing the RRETAWA sequence blocked the recognition of RGD by α5β1 and vice versa (5Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal half of integrin α subunits consist of a seven-fold repeated unit of about 60 amino acid residues. Repeats 4–7 (or in some integrins repeats 5–7) contain putative divalent cation binding sites (6Tuckwell D.S. Brass A.M. Humphries M.J. Biochem J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). About one third of integrin α subunits contain an inserted (I or A) domain of about 200 amino acid residues between the second and third repeats. Where present, the A-domain contains the major sites involved in ligand binding (7Newham P. Humphries M.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 304-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Humphries M.J. Newham P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 78-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding sites in non-A-domain-containing integrins (such as α5β1) have been localized to defined regions in the NH2-terminal portions of both α and β subunits (8Humphries M.J. Newham P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 78-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Takada Y. Kamata T. Irie A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Zhang X.-P. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal repeats of α subunits are predicted to have a mainly β-strand secondary structure (10Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. Brass A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and to fold cooperatively into a seven-bladed β-propeller (11Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Each blade of the propeller contains four β-strands connected by loops of varying length; these strands are tilted such that the connecting loops are either on the upper or lower surfaces of the propeller. In an important recent advance, it was shown that exchanging several putative loop regions on the upper surface of the α4 subunit β-propeller with the corresponding loops in α5perturbed ligand recognition by α4β1 and also attenuated the binding of inhibitory anti-α4monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (12Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, swapping predicted loop regions on the upper surface of the α5 subunit β-propeller with the corresponding loops from α4blocked binding of inhibitory anti-α5 mAbs (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A.

The region of the β subunit that participates in ligand recognition has been predicted to have a von Willebrand factor A-domain-like fold (13Lee O.-J. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 14Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol.

A model for the quaternary arrangement of the α and β subunit ligand-binding sites has recently been presented (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Humphries M.J. Newham P.

However, the precise amino acid residues that participate in ligand recognition are currently unknown. We have recently described how inhibitory mAbs can be used to map the binding interface between integrin and ligand (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Newham P. Craig S.E. Clark K. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4508-4517PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the molecular basis of RRETAWA recognition using inhibitory anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs, in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis. We show that the binding site for RRETAWA is spatially overlapping with the epitope of the anti-α5 mAb 16 and also with sequences that participate in recognition of RGD. As mAb 16 does not bind to murine α5β1, we exchanged non-conserved residues in predicted loop regions on the upper surface of the human α5 β-propeller with the corresponding residues from murine α5. A double mutation (S156G/W157S) was found to specifically block binding of mAb 16. The same mutation also perturbed binding of α5β1 to RRETAWA. Our results pinpoint specific amino acid residues involved in recognition of RRETAWA and imply that residues that interact with RGD may be located in the same loop, or in a closely adjacent region of the integrin. These findings also support the proposed model of the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1 (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Rat mAbs 16 and 11 recognizing the human α5 subunit, and mAb 13 recognizing the human β1 subunit were gifts from Dr. K. Yamada (NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Mouse anti-human α5mAbs VC5, P1D6 and JBS5 were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), Life Technologies, Inc., and Serotec (Oxford, UK), respectively. Mouse anti-human α5 mAbs SAM-1 and SAM-2 were from Serotec and Bradsure Biologicals (Loughborough, UK), respectively. Mouse anti-human β1 mAbs P4C10, 4B4, and K20 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland, UK), Coulter Corp. (Miami, FL), and The Binding Site (Birmingham, UK), respectively. All antibodies were used as purified IgG, except P4C10 (as ascites). Rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). The synthetic peptides GRGDS and GACRRETAWACGA were synthesized using Fastmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer and purified as outlined previously (18Humphries M.J. Akiyama S.K. Komoriya A. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2637-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). GACRRETAWACGA was cyclized using 10% Me2SO according to published protocols (19Tam J.P. Wu C.-R. Liu W. Zhang J.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-6662Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and purified by filtration on Sephadex G-10 (Sigma). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer, or were purchased from MWG Biotech (Southampton, UK). Poly-l-lysine was obtained from Sigma. Integrin α5β1 was purified from human placenta as described previously (20Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recombinant fragments of the cell-binding domain of fibronectin were produced as before (21Danen E.H.J. Aota S. van Kraats A.A Yamada K.M. Riuter D.J. van Muijen G.N.P. J. Biol.

Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). mAb 11 (∼500 μg/ml in buffer A) was mixed with an equal mass of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido biotin (Pierce, Chester, UK) and rotary mixed for 30–40 min at room temperature. The mixture was then dialyzed against several changes of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, to remove excess biotin. The dialysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and stored at 4 °C. Rabbit IgG (3 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of coupling buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8). To this solution, approximately 0.5 mg of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) dissolved in 0.1 ml of coupling buffer was added. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and then *CRRETAWAC* (1 mg dissolved in 0.1 ml of coupling buffer) was added. After incubation of the mixture for 5 min at room temperature, unreacted peptide and cross-linker were removed by dialysis against PBS. The dialysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Purified α5β1 (at a concentration of ∼500 μg/ml) was diluted 1:500 with PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+and 0.5 mm Mg2+, and 100-μl aliquots were added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (Dynatech Immulon 3). Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, and wells were blocked for 1–3 h with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) BSA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Wells were then washed three times with 200 μl of 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA (buffer A). 100-μl aliquots of mAbs (0.3 μg/ml or 1:10,000 dilution of ascites in buffer A) were added to the wells in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml peptides. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Unbound antibody was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with buffer A. Bound antibody was quantitated by addition of 1:1000 anti-rat or anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (Dako A/C, Denmark) in buffer A for 20 min. Wells were then washed four times with buffer A, and color was developed using ABTS substrate (Sigma). The absorbance of each well at 405 nm was then measured using a multiscan ELISA reader (Dynatech, Billingshurst, UK). Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. In experiments in which the effect of replacing Mn2+ in the assay buffer with Mg2+, Ca2+, or EDTA was examined, buffer A without Mn2+ was used throughout the assay, except during the incubation of mAb with integrin where Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or EDTA were included at a concentration of 1 mm. To test if peptides behaved as direct competitive inhibitors or allosteric inhibitors of mAb 16 binding, the inhibition of antibody binding at different concentrations of peptide was measured as described above over a 10-fold range of mAb 16 concentrations (0.1, 0.3 and 1 μg/ml). The concentration of peptide required to half-maximally inhibit antibody binding, and the maximal extent of inhibition were estimated by non-linear regression analysis as described previously (20Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis of single-reciprocal plots was performed using SigmaPlot Version 6 (Jandel Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). Solid-phase receptor-ligand binding was performed using a modification of previously described assays (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Here a “reverse” assay was used in which ligand (instead of integrin) was adsorbed to the solid phase support, and integrin (instead of ligand) was allowed to bind from the solution phase. ELISA plate wells were coated with III6–10(SPSDN) (50 μg/ml) or *CRRETAWAC*-IgG conjugate (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, blocked as described above, and washed three times with 200 μl of buffer A. 100-μl aliquots of purified α5β1 (approximately 1 μg/ml) in buffer A were added to the wells, with or without mAbs (10 μg/ml or 1:1000 dilution of ascites). The plate was then incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. Unbound integrin was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with buffer A. 100-μl aliquots of biotinylated mAb 11 (10 μg/ml) in buffer A were added to the wells for 20 min at room temperature. The wells were then aspirated, washed three times in buffer A, and 100-μl aliquots of 1:200 ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) added in buffer A for 10 min. Wells were then washed four times with buffer A, and color was developed using ABTS. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. In all the assays described above, the amount of nonspecific binding was measured by determining the level of antibody or integrin binding to wells coated with BSA alone; these values were subtracted from the corresponding values for receptor- or ligand-coated wells. Each experiment shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. A 1.8-kilobase pairKpnI/XhoI fragment of human α5 in pcDNA3 was subcloned into pUC119.

The KpnI/XhoI fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3 containing α5 to reconstruct the full-length cDNA. The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells B2 variant (24Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M. Juliano R.L. J.

Juliano, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in PBS, washed twice in PBS, resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 107cells/ml in PBS, and 8 × 106 cells were placed into 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of wild-type or mutant α5 DNA was added and the cells were left on ice for 10 min. Cells were electroporated at 25 microfarads and 800 V, and then left on ice for another 10 min. Growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids) was added, and the cells were plated out and incubated at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 48 h after transfection, the medium was supplemented with 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). G418-resistant colonies were harvested after 10–14 days. The cell population was incubated first with mAb 11 (a mAb that recognizes a non-functional epitope on the α5 subunit), and then with anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dako) to select for cells expressing α5. The expression of wild-type and mutant α5 was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using mAb 11. Cells expressing mutant or wild-type α5 were then cloned by limiting dilution to obtain high level expressors. The percentage of cells reactive to a panel of anti-α5 mAbs was assessed using flow cytometry, using rat IgG or mouse IgG as controls. Chinese hamster ovary-B2 cells, or cells transfected with mutant or wild-type human α5 were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in PBS, washed with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the same buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer with 1 mm MnCl2 (buffer B) to a concentration of 2 × 106/ml. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, High Wycombe, UK). Wells were coated for 60 min at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of III6–10 or *CRRETAWAC*-IgG diluted with Dulbecco's PBS, and then sites on the plastic for nonspecific cell adhesion were blocked for 40–60 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA. The BSA was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed once with buffer B. 100-μl aliquots of the cells in buffer B were then added to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. For experiments examining the effect of anti-α5 mAbs on cell attachment, cells were preincubated with mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature before being added to the wells. To estimate the reference value for 100% attachment, cells in quadruplicate wells coated with poly-l-lysine (500 μg/ml) were fixed immediately by direct addition of 100 μl of 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Loosely adherent or unbound cells from experimental wells were removed by aspiration, the wells washed twice with 100 μl of buffer B, and the remaining bound cells were fixed as described above for reference wells. The fixative was aspirated, the wells were washed three times with 200 μl of H2O, and attached cells were stained with Crystal Violet (Sigma) as described previously (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The absorbance of each well at 570 nm was then measured using a multiscan ELISA reader (Dynatech). Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate, and attachment to BSA (<10% of the total) was subtracted from all measurements. Each experiment shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. We have shown that recognition of fibronectin by α5β1 attenuates the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 and anti-β1mAbs (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and that these mAbs can be used to localize ligand contact sites. To investigate if recognition of RRETAWA causes changes in the binding of inhibitory anti-α5 or anti-β1 mAbs, we examined the effect of a high concentration of the cyclic peptide GACRRETAWACGA (*CRRETAWAC*) (5Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) on the binding of a panel of these mAbs to α5β1. VC5 and K20 were used as control (non-inhibitory) anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs, respectively. The results (Fig. 1) showed that binding of the anti-α5 mAb 16 to α5β1 was almost completely blocked by *CRRETAWAC*. The binding of other anti-α5 mAbs was unaffected, or slightly increased. *CRRETAWAC* had a small inhibitory effect on the binding of the anti-β1 mAbs 13, P4C10, and 4B4 (maximal extent of inhibition ≤ 25%). Inhibition of mAb 16 binding by *CRRETAWAC* was dependent on the presence of divalent cations (Fig. 2). Antibody binding was strongly inhibited only when Mn2+ or Mg2+ was present in the assay buffer. A lower level of inhibition was observed in the presence of Ca2+, and the peptide was inactive in the presence of EDTA. These findings strongly suggest that the inhibition of mAb 16 binding is due to recognition of RRETAWA by α5β1, which has been shown to be cation-dependent (5Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The divalent cation requirements for the interaction of RRETAWA with α5β1 appear similar to those for fibronectin (22Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To examine if the *CRRETAWAC* peptide acted as a direct competitive inhibitor or as an allosteric inhibitor of mAb 16 binding, we tested the inhibitory effect of *CRRETAWAC* on mAb 16 binding over a range of mAb concentrations. The results (Fig. 3 A) showed that antibody binding could be completely inhibited at high peptide concentrations, and that the concentration of *CRRETAWAC* required for half-maximal inhibition of mAb 16 binding increased in parallel with the antibody concentration (∼8-fold increase for a 10-fold increase in antibody concentration), as would be expected for a direct competitive inhibition. Plots of 1/(antibody binding) versus *CRRETAWAC* concentration were linear (Fig. 3 B), confirming that *CRRETAWAC* competed directly with mAb 16 for binding to α5β1. Hence, it appears that the binding site for RRETAWA on α5β1 is overlapping with the epitope of mAb 16. To examine the relationship between the binding sites for RRETAWA and RGD on α5β1, we tested the inhibitory effect of *CRRETAWAC* on the binding of a recombinant fibronectin fragment to α5β1. This fragment, III6–10 (21Danen E.H.J. Aota S. van Kraats A.A Yamada K.M. Riuter D.J. van Muijen G.N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), contains the RGD site in the 10th type III repeat. The results (Fig. 4 A) showed that *CRRETAWAC* peptide completely blocked the binding of III6–10 to α5β1, and the concentration of *CRRETAWAC* required for half-maximal inhibition of binding increased in parallel with the concentration of recombinant fragment (∼10-fold increase for a 10-fold increase in III6–10 concentration), as would be expected if RRETAWA acted as a direct competitive inhibitor of RGD binding. Plots of 1/(III6–10 binding) versus*CRRETAWAC* concentration (Fig. 4 B) were linear, confirming that RRETAWA competes directly with fibronectin for binding to α5β1. Although the fibronectin fragment used in these experiments also contains the synergy region of the ninth type III repeat, similar results were obtained with a mutant fragment III6–10(SPSDN) (21Danen E.H.J. Aota S. van Kraats A.A Yamada K.M. Riuter D.J. van Muijen G.N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), in which the synergy sequence is replaced with an inactive sequence from the eighth type III repeat (data not shown). Hence, it appears that the binding site for RRETAWA directly overlaps with that of RGD. This finding is consistent with the previously described ability of peptides containing the RRETAWA sequence to block the recognition of RGD by α5β1 and vice versa (5Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To further study the relationship between RRETAWA and RGD, we examined if recognition of RGD by α5β1 affected the binding of mAb 16, or other anti-α5 mAbs. The peptide GRGDS was used as a model RGD-containing ligand, as this peptide has been shown to have similar properties to fibronectin fragments that lack the synergy sequence (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 5) showed that mAb 16 binding to α5β1 was partially inhibited by GRGDS. In agreement with our previous study (4Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), this peptide had no effect on the binding of other anti-α5 mAbs but did perturb the binding of inhibitory anti-β1 mAbs. To examine if RGD peptide acted as a direct competitive inhibitor or as an allosteric inhibitor of mAb 16 binding, we tested the effect of GRGDS on mAb 16 binding over a ten-fold range of antibody concentrations. The results (Fig. 6 A) showed that the concentration of RGD peptide required for half-maximal inhibition of antibody binding was approximately the same for each concentration of antibody, and the maximal extent of inhibition decreased with increasing antibody concentration. These data are inconsistent with a direct competitive inhibition and instead suggest that GRGDS is an allosteric inhibitor of mAb 16 binding. Plots of 1/(antibody binding)versus GRGDS concentration were hyperbolic (Fig. 6 B), confirming that GRGDS allosterically inhibited mAb 16 binding to α5β1. Hence, GRGDS and *CRRETAWAC* showed distinct modes of inhibition of mAb 16 binding. These distinct modes of inhibition"

The broad substrate specificity of Gm-methylase has so far been elucidated using various species of tRNAs from native sources, suggesting that the common structures in tRNAs are recognized by the enzyme. In this study, by using 28 yeast tRNAPhe variants obtained by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, it was revealed that the nucleotide residues G18 and G19 and the D-stem structure are essentially required for Gm-methylase recognition, and that the key sequence for the substrate is pyrimidine (Py)17G18G19. The other conserved sequences were found not to be essential, but U8, G15, G26, G46, U54, U55, and C56 considerably affected the methylation efficiency. These residues are located within a limited space embedded in the L-shaped three-dimensional structure of tRNA. Therefore, disruption of the three-dimensional structure of the substrate tRNA is necessary for the catalytic center of Gm-methylase to be able to access the target site in the tRNA, suggesting that the interaction of Gm-methylase with tRNA consists of multiple steps. This postulation was confirmed by inhibition experiments using nonsubstrate tRNA variants which functioned as competitive inhibitors against usual substrate tRNAs.

To date, more than 80 modified nucleosides in tRNAs have been isolated and characterized (1Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2138-2196Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These nucleosides are post-transcriptionally formed at specific positions of tRNA by specific tRNA modification enzymes and are presumed to play important roles in the structure and function of tRNA (2Bjork G., R.

Among tRNA modification enzymes, tRNA (guanosine-2′-)-methyltransferase (Gm-methylase,1 EC 2.1.1.34), one of the ribose modification enzymes, specifically catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine to the 2′-OH of the ribose ring of guanosine at position 18 (G18) in the D-loop (8Kumagai I Watanabe K.

Although 2′-O-methylguanosine at position 18 (Gm18) is distributed widely in tRNAs of prokaryotes, eukaryotes, archaea, and plant mitochondria (13Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), purification of the enzyme has been reported solely from Thermus thermophilus (7Nishimura S. Schimmel P.R. Soll D. Abelson J.N. Transfer RNA: Structure, Properties and Recognition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979: 59-79Google Scholar). Recently, theEscherichia coli spoU gene has been reported to be essential for Gm18 modification, suggesting that spoUencodes E. coli Gm-methylase (14Persson B.C. Jager G. Gustafsson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4093-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). With respect to the physiological role of the methylation of the ribose of the G18 residue, it is known that the resistance of tRNA against RNases is increased by this modification, thus probably prolonging the half-life of the tRNA (15Kumagai I. Watanabe K. Ohshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7388-7395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In higher plants, a relationship between Gm18 methylation and the transport of tRNALeu into mitochondria has also been reported (16Marechal-Drouard L. Neuburger M. Guillemaut P. Douce R. Weil J.-H.

The mechanisms of interactions between tRNAs and modification enzymes are of interest not only physiologically but also biochemically as typical examples of RNA-protein interaction. However, there are only a few reports on tRNA recognition by modification enzymes. The following purified enzymes have been studied: tRNA-(m1G37)-methyltransferase (17Holmes W.M. Andraos-Selim C.

Nature. 1983; 302: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have been reported using in vivo assay systems. Two technical difficulties have hindered investigations using purified enzymes. First, most tRNA modification enzymes are labile and only very scanty amounts are able to be purified. Second, special RNAs are usually required as substrates because the enzymes are highly specific for a particular nucleoside(s), sequence(s) and/or three-dimensional structure, and such tRNAs are not easy to prepare. Fortunately, the modification enzymes from T. thermophilus, one of which we used in this work, are relatively stable compared with those from other species. To overcome the second problem, we employed a T7 RNA polymerase system. A synthetic gene of yeast tRNAPhe was chosen as the template DNA of T7 RNA polymerase, because yeast tRNAPhe is one of the best substrate tRNAs for Gm-methylase, and its three-dimensional structure is well established (11Robertus J.D.

In this report, the essential regions in the tRNA for recognition by Gm-methylase and its recognition mechanism are discussed. The methyl-14C-labeledS-adenosyl-l-methionine (55–60 Ci/mol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA oligomers were synthesized by an Applied Biosystems model 381 DNA synthesizer. DNA modifying enzymes and human placenta RNase inhibitor were obtained from Takara (Ohtsu, Japan). A T7 RNA polymerase expression system (E. coli BL21/pAR1219) was kindly provided by Dr. F. W. Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratory) (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendroff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified by the method of Grodberg and Dunn (36Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Other chemical reagents were of analytical grade. Purified E. colitRNA2Glu, tRNA3Ser, and tRNA2Tyr were kindly provided by Dr. N. Hayashi (Tokyo Institute of Technology); Hallobacterium volcanii tRNAiMettRNA was a gift of Dr. Y. Kuchino (National Cancer Research); Bacillus subtilistRNAGly was supplied by Dr. K. Murao (Jichi Medical School). Yeast tRNAPhe was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. A synthetic wild-type yeast tRNAPhe gene with a T7 promoter were constructed between the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the multicloning linker of pUC18, and the insert was then subcloned into the SalI and HindIII sites in the multicloning linker of pUC118 for site-directed mutagenesis. In the resultant plasmid, the transcriptional initiation site was designed to be G at the 5′ terminal, the first position of yeast tRNAPhe. Yeast tRNAPhe gene variants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using a Muta-Gene phagemid mutation kit (Bio-Rad). The sequences of all the tRNA genes were analyzed using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Read-through transcription was carried out with 18 μg of T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 3 h using 20 μg of BstNI-digested plasmids encoding the yeast tRNAPhe gene variants as the template in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm CTP, 2 mm UTP, 20 mm GMP, 1 mm spermidine, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50 units of human placenta RNase inhibitor, and 3% glycerol in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1, w/w) and then with chloroform-isoamylalcohol(25:1, v/v). Transcripts were recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The dried pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mmEDTA, and the transcript was purified by 10% polyacrylamide (7m urea) gel electrophoresis. The melting profiles of yeast tRNAPhe and the wild-type transcript were measured by monitoring the change in the absorbance at 260 nm at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min with a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer using 0.32 A 260 unit RNA in 400 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The melting temperatures were determined by the first derivative of the melting curve. Gm-methylase was purified by the method previously reported (8Kumagai I Watanabe K. Ohsima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The homogeneity of the purified enzyme was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The quantity of the protein was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The standard assay for Gm-methylase activity was used according to our previous report (8Kumagai I Watanabe K. Ohsima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the assays with transcripts were carried out at 60 °C. The apparent kinetic parameters, K m and V max, were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots of the methylation reaction in which incorporations of the14C methyl group into the transcripts was measured for 20 min. In tRNA of the extreme thermophile T. thermophilus, Gm18 is one of the generally existing modified nucleosides, and is produced by Gm-methylase (8Kumagai I Watanabe K. Ohsima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to various kinds of tRNAsin vitro as well as in vivo. The tRNAs that have so far been identified as substrates of Gm-methylase in an in vitro methylation reaction are listed in Table I. The only tRNA in the table that cannot be methylated is E. colitRNA2Tyr, because it already contains the Gm18 residue in the E. coli cells. This indicates that Gm-methylase does not catalyze the exchange reaction of the methyl group, which is in line with the reaction mechanisms of E. coli tRNA-(m5U54)-methyltransferase (39Kealy J.T. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus tRNA-(m1A58)-methyltransferase (26Yamazaki N. Hori H. Ozawa K. Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since not only Class I but also Class II tRNAs (E. colitRNA3Ser and B. subtilistRNALeu) are methylated by Gm-methylase, the structural diversities derived from the sizes of the D-arm and the variable arm do not affect recognition by the enzyme. Moreover, the tRNA from an archaean, H. volcaniitRNAiMet, was a good substrate for Gm-methylase, suggesting that the recognition sites of Gm-methylase are common for tRNAs from three kingdoms, eukarya, prokarya, and archaea.Table INatural tRNAs that can be substrates for Gm-methylasetRNARelative initial velocity of CH3incorporationK mV maxAssay temperatureReference%nmnmol/mg protein/h° CProkaryotes E. colitRNAfMet69.0578657Nishimura S.

The nucleotide residues conserved and semiconserved in the tRNAs of the three kingdoms are shown in Fig. 1 A. To clarify the recognition sites of Gm-methylase, 28 variants of yeast tRNAPhetranscribed by T7 RNA polymerase were employed. Nucleotide substitutions were mainly introduced into the conserved residues in the three- dimensional core region in the tRNA (Fig. 1 B), because these residues interact directly or indirectly with the D-arm, which includes the methylation target site, the 2′-OH group of the G18 ribose. Previous results from foot printing and experiments using half fragments indicated that the essential region for the recognition by Gm-methylase was limited within the sequence G10–G26 in E. coli tRNAfMet (24Hori H. Saneyoshi M. Kumagai I. Miura K. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto T. Nishikawa K. Hori H. Ohta T. Miura K. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, all the residues of the D-loop were individually substituted by other nucleotides, irrespective of whether they were conserved or nonconserved (Fig. 1 B), by introducing point mutations into the synthetic yeast tRNAPhe gene. Each variant is designated by the original and mutated residues connected byarrows in Fig. 1 B and the position of the substitution (e.g. U8A denotes the variant in which U at position 8 was substituted by A). Some examples of the kinetic analyses of Gm-methylase for these variants are given in Fig. 2, and the summarized results are given in Table II. Fig. 2 A shows the relationship between substrate concentration and the initial velocity of methyl group incorporation by Gm-methylase when the wild-type tRNAPhe transcript and some tRNA variants (U17A, U17G, and G18A) were used as the substrate.

The kinetic parameters indicated in this table are the averages of data obtained in at least two independent experiments. The methyl group acceptance activity of the wild-type transcript was about 1/20 that of the native yeast tRNAPhe through increase of K m (Tables I and II and Fig. 2 B). The structural flexibility of a transcript can be estimated by its melting curve; the melting temperature of the wild-type transcript was determined to be 69.0 °C, while that of the native yeast tRNAPhe was 76.0 °C. Some of the modified nucleosides in the native tRNA affects the methylation efficiency, probably through the structural stability of the substrate RNA and/or the direct association with the enzyme. Since a suitable temperature for the methylation of the transcript was estimated to be 60 °C (data not shown), all the experiments with transcripts were carried out at that temperature. The difference in methyl group acceptance between native tRNA and its transcripts is more clearly observed with shorter length transcripts corresponding to a part of yeast tRNAPhe; methyl group acceptance activity of the transcript corresponding to the 5′-half fragment (positions 1–33 in yeast tRNAPhe) was hardly detectable at 37–60 °C (data not shown), while that of the native 5′-half fragment could be detected, the initial velocity being about 20% of that of the full-length tRNA (24Hori H. Saneyoshi M. Kumagai I. Miura K. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto T. Nishikawa K. Hori H. Ohta T. Miura K. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the case of the thermophile Gm-methylase, it was difficult to discern the so-called minimalist substrate by using a totally unmodified short fragment, since the initial velocities for such fragments could not be measured under the standard conditions; at least, the methylation of the chemically synthesized 18-mer corresponding to positions 9–26 was not able to be detected at either 37 or 50 °C in 24-h incubation under the standard conditions (data not shown). Thus, it is assumed that modified nucleosides such as m2G10, D16, D17, m22G26, and Cm32 present in the native 5′-half fragment strongly affect the methylation efficiency, probably through stabilizing the D-loop stem structure or making the enzyme recognition toward the substrate easier. In the point-substituted full-length variants, the only residues essential for Gm-methylase recognition among those conserved or semiconserved were determined to be G18 and G19 (Fig. 2 A and Table II). Substitution of the nonconserved residue U17 by purine (Pu) (U17A and U17G) resulted in a drastic decrease in theV max/K m value. In contrast, no effect was observed when U17 was substituted by C. Analysis of the kinetic parameters indicated that the V maxvalues for U17A and U17G were very small (Fig. 2 and Table II), suggesting that the substitution of U17 by Pu changes the environment of the catalytic center in the Gm-methylase -tRNA complex. Thus, the most appropriate minimal sequence for Gm-methylase was deduced to be Py17G18G19 (Py = pyrimidine). This is supported by the result forE. coli tRNA3Ser possessing an A17G18G19 sequence (Table I), which was the worst substrate for Gm-methylase among the native tRNAs tested. In E. coli tRNAs, the G18 residue in almost all class II tRNAs is modified to Gm18, an exception being tRNA3Ser, which has an unmodified G18 (13Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, no prokaryote tRNA possessing a Pu17Gm18 sequence has been reported (13Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the optimum sequence deduced for the thermophile Gm-methylase, Py17G18G19, is likely to be applicable to most prokaryotic Gm-methylases. It is also clear that positions 17–19 were distinctly recognized by the enzyme, because the G18C variant with a C18G19G20 sequence was not methylated at all (Table II). Judging from the results with the D-stem variants (discussed in the next section; see Table III), it is likely that the recognition of these positions depends on the steric distance and the angle from the phosphate-ribose backbone of the D-stem structure. On the other hand, it has been reported that the 2′-O-methylation of G34 (the anticodon first letter) in X. laevis is not affected by the nucleotide sequence around position 34 (30Droogmans L.

Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After initiating from a promoter, the RNA polymerase II elongation complex is subjected to a block to elongation by the action of components of N-TEF (negative transcription elongation factors).1 One component of N-TEF, Drosophila factor 2, was originally identified by its ability to suppress the generation of long RNA polymerase II transcripts (3Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later it was found that factor 2 caused termination of transcription in an ATP-dependent manner (4Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol.

DSIF was identified as another negative factor comprised of the human homologues of yeast SPT4 and SPT5 (7Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), presumably through its ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (10Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). After the polymerases have made the transition into a productive mode, elongation is made more efficient by the action of other general elongation factors such as TFIIF and S-II (2Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It has been reported that RNA polymerases can undergo spontaneous termination at specific sites along the template; however, efficient and accurate termination at other sites requires accessory protein factors (11Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Richardson J.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These proteins function through several distinct mechanisms. One involves an RNA helicase that binds to and tracks along nascent RNA chains. When it encounters a transcription complex at a termination site, it disrupts the RNA-DNA hybrid causing release of the RNA. Rho protein for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and La protein for eukaryotic RNA polymerase III belong to this category (13Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 15Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schroder H.C. Muller W.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another termination mechanism involves two components. One component binds to a specific DNA sequence and serves as a “roadblock” to elongation by RNA polymerase. The other then terminates the stalled complexes in an energy-independent manner. TTF-I, Reb1p, and a termination activity for RNA polymerase I belong to this category (16Mason S.W. Sander E.E. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Mason S.W. Wallisch M. Grummt I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Reeder R.H. Lang W.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 473-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The third mechanism involves protein components that bind to DNA and/or RNA polymerase and employ DNA-dependent ATPase activity to dissociate polymerase complexes from the DNA template. VTF/CE and NPH-I proteins for vaccinia polymerase function through this mechanism (19Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory indicates that factor 2 causes termination of RNA polymerase II in a similar fashion (4Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol.

The three peptide sequences obtained (NLSQPTIQAVLK, YRWALTGTPIQNK, and KLDLADGVLTGAK) were identical to regions in a known protein, lodestar. A cDNA encoding lodestar was amplified by PCR from a Drosophila embryonic cDNA mix (CLONTECH) and cloned into a pET21a vector (Novagen). The plasmid was expressed in DE3 cells grown to anA 600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1.5 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in 100 mm HGKEDP (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 15% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropanol). Cells were lysed by passing through a French press three times at 4 °C. The cell lysate containing rDmF2 was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 30-ml P-11 column equilibrated with 0.1 m HGKEDP. Proteins were eluted with 0.3 and 1 m HGKEDP. The 1 m P-11 step was dialyzed against 0.1 m TUS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 7 m urea, and 0.1 m NaCl) and applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column equilibrated with 0.1 m TUS. Proteins bound to Mono Q were eluted with 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient in TUS buffer. Fractions containing rDmF2 (0.18–0.3m NaCl) were pooled, dialyzed, and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl in TUS buffer. The column was then eluted with 0.1–0.6 m NaCl gradient in TUS buffer. Fractions containing factor 2 (0.12–0.18 m NaCl) were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and used to immunize rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Inc.). We searched the EST data base for possible homologues using BLAST programs (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Using the sequence of this clone and another EST (70720) primers were designed to obtain the 5′ end of the coding region from Marathon-Ready human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). Single strand cDNA was synthesized from HeLa total RNA using a primer downstream of the stop codon. A double-stranded cDNA encoding human factor 2 (HuF2) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the modified expression vector pBAC4X-1 (Novagen) to create plasmid pBhHF that encodes an NH2-terminally (His)6-tagged human factor 2. Pairwise or multiple alignments of full-length factor 2 proteins or their conserved COOH-terminal domains (amino acids 415–1061 for DmF2, 365–1026 for Caenorhabditis elegans factor 2, and 374–990 for HuF2) were made by Gap, Bestfit, and Pileup programs of the GCG program package. The primary sequence analysis was done using SAPS program (23Brendel V. Bucher P. Nourbakhsh I.R. Blaisdell B.E. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PEST sequence search was done using PESTfind program (25Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) and pBhHF plasmid. Sf9 cells were harvested 3 days postinfection and were lysed for 40 min in lysis buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropanol). After centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min, the lysate was brought to 1 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole before a 45 min centrifugation at 250,000 × g. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with a solution containing 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and PMSF and then washed with a similar buffer containing 0.1m NaCl. HuF2 was eluted by raising the imidazole to 200 mm. After diluting the fractions to 65 mm NaCl using HGEDP (25 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% of a saturated solution of PMSF in isopropanol) the sample was cleared by 30-min centrifugation at 2,000 × g and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column. A linear gradient from 0.065–0.5 mHGKEDP was used to elute the recombinant protein. The peak fractions (0.11–0.24 m) were pooled, diluted to 0.12 mHGKEDP, and cleared as described above before being loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column. The recombinant protein eluted from 0.20 to 0.27m by a linear gradient from 0.12 to 0.4 mHGKEDP. ATPase assays and transcription termination assays using DrosophilaKc cell nuclear extract and actin 5C template were carried out essentially as described previously (4Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The immobilized CMV template was generated by first cloning theKpnI/HindIII fragment containing the CMV promoter into pGL2-basic (Promega) to generate pGL2-CMV. After digesting this plasmid with BamHI the resulting DNA fragments were end-filled using Klenow, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and biotin-14-dATP. The DNA was digested with EcoRI to produce a 631-nucleotide runoff transcript, phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated twice, and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA) (pH 8.0). The DNA solution was brought to 0.5 m NaCl and incubated with Streptavidin-coated beads (Dynal) for 30 min (∼40 μg/mg beads). For the termination assay the immobilized CMV template (final concentration ∼50 μg of DNA/ml) was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract in the presence of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 7 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. The preinitiation complexes were pulse-labeled for 25 s. The early elongation complexes were washed three times with 1 m HMK (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1m KCl) + 1% Sarkosyl (∼4 min for each wash). The complexes were then washed four times with 65 mm HMKB (20 mm HEPES, 7 mm MgCl2, 65 mm KCl, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The beads were resuspended in 65 mm HMKB solution and assayed for termination as described (4Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RNA transcripts were assayed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using Packard InstantImager. To further our understanding of the molecular basis of the termination activity of factor 2, we wanted to identify the gene encoding the factor. Sequence information was obtained from purified Drosophila factor 2 (DmF2), and a data base search indicated that it was a known protein, lodestar. Lodestar was first identified as a maternal-effect protein involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis (26Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Probing data bases with the Drosophila protein sequence yielded several human ESTs and a cDNA encoding an uncharacterized C. elegans protein. A full-length cDNA encoding the putative human homologue (HuF2) was generated, and its sequence was compared with Drosophila factor 2 and the putative C. elegans homologue 2The protein sequence for Drosophilalodestar was deposited in the SWISS-PROT data base under SWISS-PROT number P34739 (26Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for putative C. elegans factor 2 is in the GenBankTM data base (accession number U80033) (38Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for human factor 2 has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF073771). (Fig. 1). The three proteins shared seven motifs found in helicase superfamilies 1 and 2 and seven additional motifs shared only by SWI2/SNF2 family members (Fig. 1). The full-length DmF2 and HuF2 have 43% identity and 62% similarity, while their more highly conserved carboxyl-terminal regions are 48% identical and 68% similar, significantly higher than the average 31% identity and 53% similarity shared among SWI2/SNF2 family members (27van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The putative C. elegans homologue shares similar identity to both HuF2 and DmF2. The three proteins also share three conserved motifs and a predicated nuclear localization signal (between helicase motifs I and Ia) that are not conserved among the SWI2/SNF2 family (Fig. 1). Unlike DmF2 (26Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), HuF2 has no predicted PEST sequence. Except for the COOH-terminal domain and the three factor 2 motifs there is little additional sequence conservation in these three proteins. The NH2 termini of the factor 2 proteins are predicted to be relatively unstructured compared with the highly structured “helicase” domains. The predicted secondary structures of the factor 2-specific motifs are also conserved. Motif B shows high sequence similarity (56% identity and 68% similarity) to a 24-amino acid fragment of a poliovirus capsid protein and is predicted to have secondary structure throughout the region. However, the functional significance of this potential structural homology is not known. To confirm that the cloned cDNAs encoded factor 2, we generated recombinant forms of both the Drosophila and the human proteins. DmF2 was expressed in E. coli, but the resulting proteins were mostly truncated forms and were insoluble. The longest forms of the recombinant DmF2 had an identical mobility on SDS-PAGE to factor 2 purified from Kc cells (data not shown). Antibodies raised against the recombinant Drosophilaprotein reacted strongly and specifically with authenticDrosophila factor 2 either in purified form (Fig. 2 A) or in crude Kccell nuclear extract (data not shown). This provides strong evidence that the lodestar protein is DmF2. HuF2 was expressed in a baculovirus expression system as a soluble, NH2-terminally (His)6-tagged protein. The purified recombinant HuF2 was compared with factor 2 purified from Kc cells by silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). The concentration of DmF2 was known, and the concentration of HuF2 was estimated by densitometric comparison of the two proteins on the stained gel. As further proof of the identity of the cloned proteins we tested them for DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Purified DmF2 has strong dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity that is suppressed by the addition of ssDNA (5Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31902-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3771-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the presence of dsDNA both DmF2 and recombinant HuF2 displayed an ATPase activity proportional to the amount of protein added (Fig. 3,A and B). Both DmF2 and recombinant HuF2 were significantly stimulated by dsDNA (Fig. 3 C). The absolute activity of HuF2 was about 25% of that for DmF2. HuF2 displayed slightly more activity in the absence of dsDNA than DmF2. It is not clear if this small difference is due to a true difference in the two proteins or due to a small amount of contaminating DNA in the recombinant protein preparation. When ssDNA was added to the reactions the ATPase activity of both proteins was suppressed to near-background levels (Fig. 3 D). Again, HuF2 retained a significant level of ATPase compared with DmF2, suggesting that it does have a higher intrinsic level of dsDNA-independent ATPase activity. Overall, we conclude from the ATPase assays that HuF2 has very similar properties to authentic DmF2. We further tested HuF2 in transcription termination reactions. The assay detects the release of transcripts from early elongation complexes formed on an immobilized template into the supernatant fraction. Increasing amounts of both DmF2 and HuF2 were incubated with early elongation complexes formed using either Drosophila (Fig. 4 A) or human (Fig. 4 B) transcription factors. Both factors were able to cause release of the transcripts in an ATP-dependent manner, and the termination activity correlated with the amount of protein added. Surprisingly, even though HuF2 had a slightly weaker ATPase activity compared with DmF2, it caused the release of nascentDrosophila RNA polymerase II transcripts as efficiently (Fig. 4 A). HuF2 released nascent human RNA polymerase II transcripts roughly 3-fold more efficiently than DmF2 (Fig. 4 B). The activity of both factors exhibited no preference for transcript length. When added to saturating level, these two proteins were able to release over 80% RNA transcripts in both systems. We have extended our studies of factor 2 by cloning theDrosophila and human factor and generating functional recombinant human factor 2. We found factor 2 belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of proteins that are involved in modulating protein-DNA interactions during transcription, recombination, and repair. Unique biochemical properties and protein sequence motifs distinguish factor 2 from other SWI2/SNF2 family members and all other termination factors. Of all the known termination factors factor 2 is most similar to NPH-I, a viral protein required for VTF/CE-mediated termination of vaccinia polymerase (19Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both factor 2 and NPH-I are ATPases, but NPH-I is stimulated by ssDNA and factor 2 by dsDNA. In the absence of a termination sequence detected by VTF/CE, NPH-I stimulates transcription elongation of vaccinia RNA polymerase (19Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but factor 2 has no positive effect on elongation. Comparison of the sequences of the two proteins indicates that they are similar in that they both contain the seven helicase motifs while not exhibiting helicase activity. However, NPH-I contains no SWI2/SNF2 or factor 2-specific motifs and cannot function independently of VTF/CE. Although there are significant differences between the two proteins, further biochemical characterization is required to determine whether they share any steps in their mechanisms of termination. Comparison of the sequence of factor 2 to the other approximately 150 SWI2/SNF2 family members allows several hypotheses to be made concerning the function of factor 2 and SWI2/SNF2 proteins in general. The ATPase activity of factor 2 is likely encoded by its carboxyl terminus that contains the seven helicase motifs and SWI2/SNF2 motifs shown to be responsible for the ATPase activity and required for the function of other family members (28Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Richmond E. Peterson C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3685-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The three factor 2-specific motifs surrounding the ATPase domain may be involved in specifying the unique nucleic acid binding properties of the factor or may be involved in specifically coupling ATP hydrolysis to polymerase termination. This idea is supported by the finding that a region outside of the ATPase domain of Mot1p confers its functional specificity (28Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analysis of factor 2 proteins with mutations in these regions using DNA binding and termination assays may be able to resolve these possibilities. It has been suggested that a common feature of SWI2/SNF2 proteins is that they use ATP hydrolysis to disrupt protein-DNA interaction (30Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar),e.g. SNF2 disrupts nucleosome-DNA interactions and MOT1 removes TBP from DNA. The identification of factor 2 as a SWI2/SNF2 family member provides further evidence supporting the ATP driven disruption hypothesis, since the protein couples ATP hydrolysis with removal of RNA polymerase II from the DNA template. Based on the biochemical characterization of Drosophilafactor 2 we suggested that it might be the eukaryotic equivalent of the prokaryotic transcription repair coupling factor (TRCF), Mfd (4Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11043-11046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3771-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mfd causes termination of RNA polymerase stalled over damaged DNA and then recruits the ABC repair machinery to the damage site (31Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4890-4895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cloning of factor 2 extends the similarity between the two proteins, since both contain helicase motifs. ERCC6 was suggested to be the human TRCF (33Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar); however, several lines of evidence argue against this notion. Mutants of the yeast and mouse homologues of ERCC6 do not affect UV sensitivity (27van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 34Collins A.R. Mitchell D.L. Zunino A. Dewit J. Busch D. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1997; 29: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ERCC6 cannot dissociate stalled RNA polymerase from the DNA template (35Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More decisively, ERCC6 was dispensable for transcription-coupled repair in vitro (36Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the role of factor 2 as the TRCF is consistent with previous biochemical characterization and the sequence data presented here, it will be necessary to examine the role of factor 2 in defined transcription-coupled repair assays. The identification of Drosophila factor 2 as the maternal-effect protein, lodestar, may help to explain several previous observations. Lodestar mutants die during early embryogenesis and display chromosome segregation defects. As suggested previously, a reduction in DNA repair could result in this phenotype (26Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If so, this supports a role of factor 2 in transcription-coupled repair. Alternatively, chromosome segregation may be hindered by the presence of active transcription complexes during mitosis. Mitotic disruption of elongation complexes on long genes such as Ubx has been observed (37Shermoen A.W. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 303-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of factor 2 in this process, its localization in the nucleus (26Girdham C.H. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) coincides with the mitotic termination of Ubx transcription (37Shermoen A.W. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 303-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of factor 2 in elongation control, transcription-coupled repair, and mitotic termination suggests that the activity of factor 2 must be carefully regulated.

Neuronal exocytosis is strictly regulated by Ca2+ ions (1Katz B. The Release of Neurotransmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). Ca2+ triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane on the submillisecond time scale; this sets an aggregate upper limit for the t½ values of protein conformational changes that couple Ca2+ binding to exocytotic membrane fusion (2Llinas R.

Because the Ca2+-dependent interaction of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin with membranes is likely to serve as an important step in excitation-secretion coupling, we have used multidimensional, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural basis for this interaction. We report that short acyl chain phosphatidylserine interacts exclusively with residues in loops 2 and 3 of C2A. Loops 2 and 3 become fully ordered only after phospholipid is bound, not simply upon binding Ca2+. cDNA encoding rat synaptotagmin I (12Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by T. C. Südhof (Dallas, TX). The region of the gene coding for the C2A domain (residues 140–267) of synaptotagmin I was amplified by PCR, creating NdeI (5′) and BamHI (3′) sites. This PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI and inserted into a pET9a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), which had been cut previously with the same two enzymes. The resulting plasmid, named pET9a/C2A, was transformed into BL21(DE3) containing pLysS. A single colony picked from a plate was used to inoculate 50 ml of minimal (LB) medium; following overnight growth, this was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium. The cells were induced when A 600(absorbance at 600 nm) reached 1.0–1.3 and harvested by centrifugation 3 h later. Protein labeled uniformly with 13C and15N was produced from 1 liter of minimal medium containing [13C]glucose and [15N]ammonium chloride (Isotec, Miamisburg, OH). The harvested cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.5 and subjected to a freeze-and-thaw step to break the cell walls followed by a sonication step. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was retained, filtered, and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). C2A eluted around 150 mm NaCl, and the fractions containing C2A were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. C2A eluted around 96 ml. The purity was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The typical yield of C2A was around 40 mg/liter of culture. All NMR samples contained 1 mm C2A, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and 10% D2O. Semisynthetic 6:0 phosphatidylserine (6PS) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). One sample contained 5 mmCa2+ and the other contained 5 mmCa2+ and 5 mm 6PS. All data were collected on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) DMX-500 NMR spectrometer at 303 K. For both samples, three-dimensional HNCA (36Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am.

Raw data were converted and processed with FELIX (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) software. All data were digitally filtered to remove negative data points. The convolution difference solvent suppression routine in FELIX was applied, and the resulting data were apodized by a square-cosine window function, Fourier-transformed, and phase-corrected. The size of the data was halved by removing the right half of the spectrum. To data in the13C dimension, a square-cosine window function was applied; data in this dimension were zero-filled to 256 points, Fourier-transformed, and phased. To data in the 15N dimension, mirror image linear prediction was applied; the resulting data were apodized by a Kaiser window function, zero-filled to 128 points, Fourier-transformed, and phased. The final matrices were 512 (1H) × 256 (13C) × 128 (15N), where the numbers refer to the numbers of real data points. The Sparky software developed at University of California, San Francisco (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/Sparky.html) was used for peak-picking. Sequential assignments were determined from the combined interpretation of HNCA (36Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem.

Resonances from residues Met173, Gly174, Asp188, Lys213, Arg233, and Phe234 were not observed in spectra of the binary C2A·(Ca2+)x complex, probably because of line broadening resulting either from hydrogen exchange with solvent water or from dynamic disorder (25Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Signals from these residues were identified, however, in NMR spectra of the C2A·(Ca2+)x·(6PS)y ternary complex, suggesting that loops 2 and 3 of C2A are more ordered in the ternary complex than in the binary complex. The C2A domain of synaptotagmin exhibits preferential interactions with liposomes that contain anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6PS was used here because of its high solubility, which made it possible to saturate the lipid binding sites of C2A while keeping the free phospholipid concentration below its critical micellar concentration. The relative concentrations used here (C2A:Ca2+:6PS = 1:5:5) were chosen on the basis of results suggesting that the maximum number of metal ions bound is three (26Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and that the number of phospholipid molecules is limited (29Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Lipid binding was followed by following chemical shifts changes in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of [15N]C2A as a function of added 6PS (Fig. 1). As a test of the relevance of 6PS as a model for longer chain phosphatidylserine, it was determined 3E. R. Chapman and A. S. Davis, unpublished results. that, in the presence of Ca2+, 6PS induces the same level of resistance to limited proteolysis as PS/PC liposomes (made with PS derived from brain with acyl chain composition: ∼40% 18:0, ∼31% 18:8, ∼8.5% 22:6) (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, in the presence of Ca2+, 6PS induces the same kind of structural rearrangement (or protection from proteolysis) produced by the PS/PC liposomes. To maximize the chemical shift comparisons (Fig. 2), two gaps in the data at pH 7.5 (Arg233 and Phe234, whose signals were not seen in the binary complex but sharpen up in the ternary complex) were filled by chemical shifts for the binary complex at pH 5.0 where the peaks are sharper (39Shao X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because the referencing system used by these authors (39Shao X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was different from that used here (40Markley J.L. Arata Y. Bax A. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wüthrich K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1998; 70: 117-142Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar), their data set was first brought into register by minimizing the shift differences of signals common to both data sets. Of the residues (Fig. 2) showing the largest shifts upon addition of 6PS (His198, Val205, Phe206, Arg233, Phe234, His254), all but His254 are on loops 2 and 3. Because His254 is located on the opposite side of the molecule from loops 2 and 3, its shift likely results from a nonspecific interaction with 6PS or possibly a 6PS-mediated protein-protein interaction. Consistent with this interpretation, a fluorescent reporter (tryptophan) placed at residue 153, which lies near His254 in the three-dimensional structure of C2A, was found not to interact with lipid bilayers (41Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of Ca2+-binding loop 3 in lipid binding is consistent with the fluorescence study of Chapman and Davis (41Chapman E.R. Davis A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13995-14001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which indicated that residue 234 interacts directly with liposomes. The residues on loops 2 and 3 implicated in lipid binding (His198, Val205, Phe206, Arg233, Phe234) are oriented along a straight line on a surface ridge of C2A (Fig. 3 A). An important finding of the present work is that this “docking ridge” is located on the opposite side of the C2A domain from the transmembrane and C2B domains of synaptotagmin I. Results reported here show that the phospholipid binding site(s) of C2A are localized to loops 2 and 3. In contrast, the largest shifts that occurred upon the binding of C2A to a fragment of syntaxin were localized to Ca2+-binding loops 1 and 3, with only subtle shifts in the backbone of loop 2 (42Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Asp238, a Ca2+ ligand in loop 3 and the residue of C2A that exhibited the largest shift perturbation on forming the C2A·syntaxin-fragment complex, did not shift significantly upon binding 6PS (Fig. 2). It is localized to a region of loop 3 distinct from the proposed membrane docking site (Fig. 3 A). Thus, loop 3 interacts with both lipids and syntaxin, whereas loops 1 and 2 interact preferentially with syntaxin and lipids, respectively. Future studies will determine whether C2A can engage both lipids and syntaxin simultaneously. Localization of the phospholipid binding site adjacent to the calcium binding sites helps explain the positive cooperativity of Ca2+ and phospholipid binding to C2A (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through sequence alignments, residues analogous to amino acids 198, 205, 206, 233, 234, and 254 in the C2A domain of rat synaptotagmin I were determined for the other two C2domains whose structures are known, human cytosolic phospholipase A2 (27Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and rat phospholipase Cδ1 (26Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Table I). In all three cases, these residues (excluding residue 254) lie along a straight line on the protein surface, are adjacent to known Ca2+ binding sites, and involve loops 2 and 3 of the C2 domain (Fig. 3 B). The net charge on these residues at physiological pH is consistent with what is known about headgroup preferences for these domains: synaptotagmin (net charge for these residues of +1 or +2) has a preference for negatively charged phospholipids such as PS, whereas cytosolic phospholipase A2 (net charge zero for these residues) has a preference for positively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine. The lipid preference for the C2domain of phospholipase Cδ1 is unknown. Given the proximity of the residues that are perturbed by 6PS binding to the calcium binding sites (Fig. 3), it appears probable that the serine headgroup interacts directly with Ca2+, displacing water in open coordination sites. This kind of direct interaction would explain how PS binding increases the affinity of C2A for Ca2+.Table IResidues in the C2 domains of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and phospholipase Cδ1 that correspond to those identified here as interacting with phospholipid in the C2A domain of synaptotagmin IC2 domain (reference to amino acid sequence)Corresponding residuesC2A domain of rat synaptotagmin I (12Perin M.S.

The production of these factors by myocardial cells is noteworthy since several growth factors and cytokines have been implicated in the initiation and regulation of myocardial growth under both developmental and pathologic conditions. In this regard, work from both our laboratory and others has identified thecardiac fibroblast as an important intracardiac source of IL-1β in both the acute response to hypoxia/ischemia as well as in circumstances associated with chronic cardiac dysfunction (20Yue P. Massie B.M. Simpson P.C. Long C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H250-H258PubMed Google Scholar, 21Long C.S. Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W. Honbo N. Miguel T. Grunfeld C. Karliner J.S. Clin. Res. 1993; 41 (abstr.): 145AGoogle Scholar) and IL-1β has been found to alter the growth of myocardial cells in culture (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21134-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specifically, IL-1β increases cardiac myocyte protein content while inhibiting cardiac fibroblast DNA synthesis (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, despite the previous findings on myocardial [3H]thymidine incorporation, little work has been done to localize the effects of IL-1β on myocardial cell cycle control. In contrast to the cardiac myocyte, whose replicative capacity is limited in the adult heart, the cardiac fibroblast retains the ability to proliferate, and does so in response to many pathologic circumstances. As such, the growth of the heart after birth (both developmental, or “physiologic,” growth as well as abnormal, or “pathologic,” growth) is characterized by hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and hyperplasia of cardiac fibroblasts. This disparity in growth potential is important since the cardiac fibroblast makes up nearly two-thirds of the total myocardial cell numbers, is the major source of extracellular matrix (ECM) production in the heart, and appears to be the major producer of many of the cytokines known to have potent effects on cardiomyocyte growth, fibroblast proliferation, and ECM homeostasis (19Long C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious importance of the cardiac fibroblast in myocardial repair, however, there is little information available on either the kinetics of the fibroblast cell cycle, or the factors that regulate its initiation and progression. In order for the cardiac fibroblast to become a potential target for therapeutic manipulation, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate its entry into (and exit from) the cell cycle as well as the factors responsible for ECM deposition must be identified. For virtually all mammalian cells with proliferative potential, a general scheme has emerged for the control of cell proliferation in response to mitogen stimulation. This scheme involves the cell cycle-specific stimulation of a binary system of cell regulators consisting of a family of regulatory subunits (the cyclins), which bind to (and help to activate) the catalytic subunits, the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) (reviewed in Refs.25Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 26Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclins are believed to determine the subcellular localization, substrate specificity, interaction with upstream regulatory proteins, and timing of Cdk activation. In general, whereas Cdk expression has been felt to be more or less constitutive, cyclin expression is “cyclic,” and responsive to proliferative signals. As such, there are cyclins specific to the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. With regard to the cyclin:Cdks required for S phase entry (i.e. the D and E cyclin:Cdks), the substrates that have been identified as critical for cell cycle progression are members of the so-called “pocket protein” family. Made up of three members, p107, p130, and the quintessential pocket protein, the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), it is the phosphorylation of Rb by the cyclin:Cdk dimer that results in release of the E2F transcription family and S phase entry (27DeCaprio J.A.

Finally, proteins that block the action of specific cyclin-Cdk complexes, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), act as negative regulators of the G1-cyclins and Cdks cause G1 arrest when overexpressed in transfected cells (32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Massague and Polyak (33Massague J. Polyak K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As such, there are several levels at which a given antimitogenic stimulus may exert its control. For example, transforming growth factor β, which also appears in myocardium in response to injury, plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle machinery by its action on cyclins, Cdks, and CKIs (34Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar, 35Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massague J.

As noted previously, the expression and effects of cytokines such as IL-1β in the postinjury and remodeling heart suggest that these peptides are likely to be involved in both of these processes. Consistent with this notion, work from several investigators has suggested that IL-1β exerts a profound effect on myocardial growth and function in culture (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M.

With respect to the proliferative potential of the cardiac fibroblast, previous work from our laboratory investigating the effects of IL-1β on myocardial growth and gene expression indicated that cultured cardiac fibroblasts have a diminished capacity to synthesize DNA in response to mitogen in the presence of this cytokine. The mechanism of IL-1β action was not clear, however, and could have resulted from action at several different points in the cell cycle. The investigations described below were performed in an effort to explain the manner in which IL-1β exerted its effect(s) on fibroblast proliferation. Specifically, we examined the effect of IL-1β on the expression of cyclins, Cdks, CKIs, and Rb phosphorylation using the neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast culture system. Minimum essential medium with Hanks' salts was obtained from Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Francisco. Calf serum was obtained from Hyclone Labs (Logan, UT). Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Propidium iodide (PI), N-hexanoyl-d-sphingosine (C6-ceramide), and N-acetyl-d-sphingosine (C2-ceramide) were obtained from (Sigma). [3H]Thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Recombinant mouse IL-1β was obtained from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA).N G-Monomethyl-l-arginine, monoacetate salt (l-NMMA) was obtained from Calbiochem. For immunoblotting, anti-cyclin D2 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-cyclin D3 (mouse monoclonal), anti-cyclin E (rabbit polyclonal), anti-cyclin A (rabbit polyclonal), anti-p21/p27 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-Cdk2 (rabbit polyclonal), anti-Cdk4 (rabbit polyclonal) antibodies, gluthathioneS-transferase retinoblastoma (GST-Rb) fusion protein, protein A-agarose, and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Histone H1 and p13-agarose conjugated beads were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Rb (mouse monoclonal) was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were prepared as described previously (43Long C.S. Henrich C. Simpson P.C. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For flow analysis and Western blotting experiments, fibroblasts were plated in 60-mm dishes (2.5 × 105/dish), grown for 48 h to ∼80% confluency in growth medium (minimum essential medium, 5% calf serum). Cells were then synchronized by 48 h of serum starvation (minimum essential medium, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and subsequently treated with calf serum in the presence or absence of IL-1β and the cell cycle kinetics determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine (1-h pulse with 10 μCi/ml) (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry as described below. After treatment, cells were trypsinized at the indicated time with 500 ml of trypsin/EDTA (2 mg/ml/0.02%) for 2–5 min, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were fixed in 25% ethanol, 15 mm MgCl2 on ice for 30 min. The fixed cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml of calcium- and bicarbonate-free Hanks' solution with Hepes (CBFHH) supplemented with 10 mg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cellular DNA was stained with 10 mg/ml propidium iodide, and samples were filtered through a 70-mm nylon mesh to remove cell clumps. Samples were used immediately or kept at 4 °C until analysis. No differences were seen between fresh and stored samples. Flow cytometric analysis was done using a FACScan benchtop cytometer (Becton and Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA) with a standard 15 milliwatt, 488 nm, air cooled, argon-ion laser and standard filter sets. Single cell populations were gated using forward scatter, an indicator of cell size versus side scatter, an indicator of cell granularity. The FL2 detector measures fluorescent light from PI, which emits a red color at 650-nm wavelength of the FACScan laser, and PI intensity is proportional to the DNA content of the cell. The FL2-PI area versus width plots distinguished true cycling G2/M cells from doublets or aggregates of G0/G1 cells by comparison to standardized areaversus width plots and were adjusted in all experiments. Using Cell Quest Software (Becton and Dickinson Immunocytometry System), at least 20,000 cells were collected per sample at low flow rate (12 μl/min), and DNA data were analyzed with ModFit software (Verity Software House, Popsham, ME). For analysis of cell cycle-specific protein expression, cells treated with serum ± IL-1β were harvested in ice-cold homogenization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate) followed by sonication (2-s cycle time for 10 s). Total cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 5 min), and aliquots were removed for analysis of protein concentration (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) and either used immediately or frozen at −70 °C until use. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% discontinuous gels (7.5% gels for Rb detection) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 60 min at 100 V (30 min at 100 V for Rb). Equal protein loading for all samples was assured by Ponceau S staining of the membrane following transfer. Thereafter, membranes were probed with peptide-specific primary antibodies at 1 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit at 1:5000 dilution was used as a secondary antibody for rabbit polyclonal antibodies; horseradish peroxidade-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:5000 was used for the mouse monoclonal antibodies. The ECL detection system was used to detect the antigen-antibody complexes, with average exposure times of 5–60 s. Signal intensities were quantified by using Image densitometric analysis (National Institutes of Health, Division of Computer Research and Technology, Bethesda, MD). For the analysis of the cell cycle kinase activity, cells were treated as described previously and harvested in ice-cold homogenization buffer. Lysed cells were precleared for 60 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-agarose and 5 μg of normal rabbit IgG. Precleared lysates were subsequently incubated with 20 μl p13-agarose-conjugated beads for 2 h at 4 °C and collected by centrifugation (4,000 rpm for 5 min). Beads were washed twice with homogenization buffer and were used for in vitro kinase assay using either GST-Rb fusion protein or histone H1 as a substrate. Kinase reactions were carried out in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ -32P]ATP per reaction at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. The bands corresponding to the phosphorylated GST-Rb and histone H1 were quantified by densitometric analysis and normalized to the control. Results are given as mean ± S.D. Mean values for two groups were compared using Student's t test, or analysis of variance for more than two groups with a pvalue of <0.05 representing statistical significance. Previous work in our laboratory suggested that IL-1β had potent dose-dependent effects on cardiac fibroblast DNA synthesis in culture; however, the kinetics of this inhibitory response was unknown (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Since the determination of the time course of inhibitory effects can provide important clues as to the cell cycle-specific site of action, we fist evaluated the time-dependence of the IL-1β effect on mitogen-stimulated cardiac fibroblast proliferation in more detail. As noted in Fig. 1 A, the inhibitory effect was seen if IL-1β was added at any point up to 12 h after the addition of mitogen (5% calf serum). If IL-1β was added after this point, however, there was a diminution in its ability to prevent [3H]thymidine incorporation. Similarly, in investigations into the time course of “release” from IL-1β-induced block, the peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation was also delayed approximately 12 h (Fig. 1 B). These findings were quite similar to that seen in the response of mink lung cells (Mv1Lu) to transforming growth factor β and suggested that the IL-1β effect may be due to a similar mechanism and site of action (36Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Although the time course of IL-1β inhibition defined by [3H]thymidine incorporation suggested a site of action at the G1/S restriction point, it was critical to define this with certainty. Flow cytometric analysis allows for the measurement of DNA content in isolated cardiac fibroblasts on a per cell basis and is the technique of choice for the determination of cell cycle kinetics. In preliminary experiments, the normal cell cycle distribution of cardiac fibroblasts was determined at various times after mitogen stimulation (range from 3 to 48 h). We found that the highest percent of cells in S phase was at 20 h (data not shown). Using flow cytometric analysis of these cells, we have determined the site of inhibition by IL-1β on cardiac fibroblasts cell cycle progression following their co-treatment with IL-1β and calf serum. As indicated in Fig. 2, IL-1β prevents fibroblast entry into S phase by arresting them at the G1/S interphase. As is true for most peptide growth factors/cytokines, the biological action of IL-1β is mediated through specific cell surface receptors. In this regard, the stimulation of IL-1 receptors has been shown to initiate a variety of signaling pathways, including cyclooxygenase/prostaglandins (45Katsuura G. Gottschall P.E. Dall R.R. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 3125-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), nitric oxide (46Marczin N. Papapetropoulos A. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1014-H1018PubMed Google Scholar), and sphingomyelinase (47Mathias S. Younes A. Kan C.C. Orlow I. Joseph C. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 48Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 49Saklatvala J. Br.

Acta. 1996; 1301: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In order to understand which of these mechanisms might be involved in the arrest of cardiac fibroblast proliferation seen in our culture system, we performed a series of experiments in which inhibitors of these various pathways were included during the IL-1β treatment. Neither the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NMMA, nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had any effects on basal levels of DNA synthesis and were incapable of blocking the IL-1β effect. The percentage of cells in S phase for these experiments was 33 ± 3, 19 ± 2, 15.6 ± 1.6, and 16 ± 1.8 for serum, serum/IL-1β, serum/IL-1β/l-NMMA, and serum/IL-1β/indomethacin, respectively (n = 4, p = NS for all inhibitors). In view of the previous suggestion that the production of ceramide from sphingomyelin was associated with an inhibition of proliferation in other cells types (51Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), additional experiments aimed at understanding the role of the sphingomyelinase pathways were also performed. Using the putative down-stream effectors of sphingomyelin breakdown (C2- and C6-ceramide), we found that the cardiac fibroblasts were relatively refractory to these agents when examined under conditions of serum treatment similar to that used for IL-1β. The percentage S phase in these experiments for serum- and serum/C6-ceramide-treated cells was 30.31 ± 3.1, and 28.20 ± 2.0, respectively (n = 4, p = NS). In light of our previous report suggesting that the growth effect of IL-1β on cardiac myocytes was due to the action of a down-stream tyrosine kinase pathway (22Palmer J.N. Hartogensis W.E. Patten M. Fortuin F.D. Long C.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2555-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we attempted to address the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibition (both genestein and tyrphostin) on the IL-1β effect. Unfortunately, we were unable to either confirm or refute the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibition on the cardiac fibroblasts due to the basal effects of this class of inhibitor on cardiac fibroblasts proliferation. The percentage S phase in these experiments for serum, serum/tyrophastin-, serum/IL-1β-, and serum/IL-1β/tyrophastin-treated cells was 37.1 ± 2.5, 19.7 ± 1.4, 21.2 ± 2, and 18.3 ± 1.6, respectively (n = 4). Studies of cell cycle regulation have identified the pocket protein Rb as a critical checkpoint control protein for the G1-to-S phase transition (27, 28, 31, 52, 53). To determine whether the phosphorylation status of Rb correlated with the extent of growth inhibition as judged by accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle shown by fluorescein-activated cell sorter analysis, we performed Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in untreated cardiac fibroblasts, Rb was in the hypophosphorylated form (110 kDa), causing it to migrate faster than the hyperphosphorylated form in SDS-PAGE (pRb, 120 kDa). Investigations into the time course of 5% calf serum treatment indicate that the shift in phosphorylation state of Rb reaches a plateau by 24 h. Cells that remained serum-starved over the 24-h treatment were similar to 0 h cells with Rb remaining in the hypophosphorylated form. As shown in Fig. 3 B, cells co-treated with IL-1β showed a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of the higher mobility form of Rb. Using scanning densitometry, the ratio of the fast migrating form (Rb) to the relatively slow migrating forms (pRb) can be determined. When applied to our studies, we found that in calf serum-treated cells, 70 ± 8% of the Rb protein was in the pRb form (hyperphosphorylated) form, whereas cells co-treated with IL-1β contained only 22 ± 2.5% in the pRb form (Fig. 3 C). Of note was the finding that cells treated with IL-1β had a decrease in the overall level of detectable Rb. Similar effects were observed when Mv1Lu cells were treated with transforming growth factor β1 (36Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and is of unclear etiology, although it may reflect the relatively short half-life for Rb (54Fan G. Xu R. Wessendorf M.W. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1463-1476PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies evaluating the role of the hypophosphorylation of Rb in transforming growth factor β induced G0/G1 growth arrest have shown that SV40 large T-antigen can rescue the cell from the G0"

The resulting random library was selected for its ability to complement a TS-deficient Escherichia coli strain, and sequence analysis of survivors found multiple substitutions to be tolerable within the targeted region. An independent selection of the library was carried out in the presence of 5-FdUR, resulting in a more limited spectrum of mutations.

Thymidylate synthase (TS)1 is a 72-kDa homodimer that catalyzes the formation of dTMP from dUMP using CH2H4-folate as both the single carbon unit source and the reductant. Thymidylate synthase is a central enzyme in DNA biosynthesis as it provides the only de novo source of dTMP. Inhibition of TS in mammalian cells results in depletion of cellular thymidylate, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and ultimately thymine-less death (1Cohen S.S. Barner H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

In addition, TS activity is greatest in rapidly proliferating cells and is preferentially expressed at the onset of S phase (4Rode W. Scanlon K.J. Moroson B.A. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1305-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, TS has been a key target for chemotherapeutic agents (5Santi D.V. Danenberg P.V. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J.

Deep within the active site cavity, three arginine residues and one serine residue coordinate the bound phosphate. Two of these arginine residues are donated from the other subunit, providing the structural basis for TS being an obligate dimer (10Montfort W.R. Perry K.M. Fauman E.B. Finer-Moore J.S. Maley G.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7116-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The active site of all known TS enzymes, with one exception, contains the amino acid sequence PCH. After formation of the reversible ternary complex with dUMP and CH2H4-folate, the reactive thiol of the cysteine (Cys-195) within this motif initiates the enzymatic reaction via nucleophilic attack at C-6 of dUMP. However, site-directed mutagenesis of these three residues has demonstrated that both Pro-194 and His-196 can tolerate specific substitutions in L. casei and E. coli without significant loss of catalytic activity (15Michaels M.L.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19132-19137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic cysteine (Cys-195) was found to be immutable when tested by complementation in L. casei(17Climie S. Ruiz-Perez L. Gonzalez-Pacanowska D. Prapunwattana P. Cho S.W. Stroud R. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18776-18779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the constructed mutant C195S retains activity in E. coli. (7Hardy L.W. Finer-Moore J.S. Montfort W.R. Jones M.O. Science. 1987; 235: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence alignments indicate that TS is phylogenetically one of the most highly conserved enzymes known (18Perry K.M. Fauman E.B. Finer-Moore J.S. Montfort W.R. Maley G.F. Maley F. Stroud R.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it has become increasingly apparent that many amino acid residues that are conserved in nature are tolerant to a variety of substitutions in vitro (19Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In cells, 5-FU is metabolized to 5-FdUMP, which forms a stable inhibitory complex with thymidylate synthase and the cosubstrate CH2H4-folate (19Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 20Santi D.V. McHenry C.S. Raines R.T. Ivanetich K.M.

In the ternary complex, one covalent bond links the thiol group of Cys-195 to the C-6 of dUMP, and a second covalent bond links the C-5 of the pyrimidine ring to the one carbon unit (C11) of CH2H4-folate (19Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Due largely to its effective inactivation of TS, 5-FU is widely used in the treatment of many common carcinomas including colon, breast, and ovarian cancers. Although 5-FU is a potent anti-tumor compound, its toxicity toward normal bone marrow and gastrointestinal tissues limits its use (22Grem J.L. Chabner B.A. Collins J.M. Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1990: 180-224Google Scholar). Genetic transfer of a mutant TS enzyme that is resistant to inactivation by 5-FdUMP could protect these tissues from 5-FU toxicity. The basis for such a genetic rescue has been established for other proteins. For example, transfer of a mutant dihydrofolate reductase cDNA into mouse bone marrow stem cells has been shown to improve the survival of mice treated subsequently with methotrexate (23Williams D.A. Hsich K. DeSilva A. Mulligan R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Carr F. Medina W.D. Dube S. Bertino J.R. Blood. 1983; 62: 180-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, retroviral-mediated transfer of the gene encoding the human MGMT DNA repair protein has been shown to confer protection of hematopoetic cells against alkylating agents in vivo and in vitro (25Moritz T. Mackay W. Glassner B.J. Williams D.A. Samson L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2608-2614PubMed Google Scholar,26Marathi U.K. Harris L.C. Venable C.C. Brent T.P. Clin. Can. Res. 1997; 3: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we illustrate a unique approach for obtaining mutants of TS that are catalytically active and are resistant to inhibition by 5-FdUMP. Since 5-FdUMP is structurally similar to the natural substrate dUMP, we lack adequate knowledge to design such mutants by site-directed mutagenesis; it is difficult to predict how single amino acid substitutions or multiple substitutions could restrict the binding of 5-FdUMP without affecting binding of dUMP. Random mutagenesis provides a combinatorial method to create altered enzymes without requiring detailed knowledge about amino acid interactions or effects of specific alterations. Based on sequence homology alignment and crystallographic information, we targeted a region for mutagenesis near the catalytic Cys-195 that assists in formation of the dUMP binding site. We used genetic complementation to obtain a collection of catalytically active mutants with amino acid replacements in the active site of TS. These active mutants were subsequently selected for their ability to confer growth of E. coli in the presence of 5-FdUR. CH2H4-folate was from Schircks Labs (Jona, Switzerland). 5-[6-3H]FdUMP was supplied by Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [γ-32P]ATP and Thermo Sequenase kits for DNA were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits for fluorescent sequencing were the products of Perkin Elmer. E. coli DNA Pol I was from New England Biolabs. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Maxiprep and Miniprep kits from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). 5-FdUR, 5-FdUMP, dUMP, TES, and all other reagents were from Sigma. E. coli NM522 (Stratagene) was used for cloning and library construction. E. coli χ2913recA (ΔthyA572,recA56), kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Santi (University of California, San Francisco), is tetracycline resistant and was used in all complementation studies and in the purification of plasmid-encoded TS. Unless otherwise stated, all DNA oligomers were from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Plasmid pGCHTS-TAA, from D. Santi, contains the wild-type human thymidylate synthase cDNA modified by the addition of a 115-base pair 5′-untranslated region from the L. caseiTS in a high copy number modified pUC vector background (8Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Davisson V.J. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9145-9148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unique translationally silent MroI site was added at coding nucleotide 648 of the human TS vector pGCHTS by using the mega-primer method of oligo-directed mutagenesis (28Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 113-bp PCR product was created by amplification with the primer DLTS2F with the 29-mer mutagenic primer BSPE1DL. DLTS2F is an 18-mer, which corresponds to nucleotides 529–546 of the sense strand, and BSPE1DL corresponds to the antisense nucleotides 644–661 with a G to A substitution at nucleotide 648. The 133-bp PCR product was purified and used as a mega-primer in a PCR reaction in conjunction with the primer 3′-HSG, a 20-mer corresponding to the antisense sequence of pGCHTS approximately 33 bp downstream of the SacI site used to clone the human TS. The resulting 479-bp DNA fragment was subsequently digested withBglII and SacI and ligated into the corresponding portion of the TS vector. A TS stuffer vector was created by replacing the TS open reading frame between coding nucleotides 555 (BglII site) and 646 (MroI site) with a 1.3-kilobase DNA fragment derived from a modified pET3a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The DNA insert was prepared by digestion of pET3a with MroI and BglII agarose gel purification of the appropriate fragment and ligation into theMroI-BglII digested TS vector. The TS random library was constructed by annealing two single-stranded DNA oligomers (step 1, Fig. 1). Oligomer 1 is a 57-mer that corresponds to the sense nucleotides 529–585 and contains a BglII site (nucleotide 555) for cloning. Oligomer 2 is the 94-mer that contains a mutated sequence corresponding to amino acids 197–200 and 205–213, with 14% random nucleotides and 86% wild-type nucleotides at each of the 39 randomized positions and an MroI site for cloning (Table I). It was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The random oligomer contained on average 5.5 nucleotide changes, and thus we calculated that 0.3% of the oligomer population was wild type at the nucleotide level (0.8639 = 0.0027). Two silent mutations were introduced in the non-random region to create a unique SnaB1 site for subsequent identification based on digestion with the restriction enzyme. Oligomers 1 and 2 were annealed in 50 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl by incubation at 80 °C for 5 min, followed by 55 °C for 15 min, at 37 °C for 15 min, and at room temperature for 15 min (step 1, Fig. 1). The partial oligonucleotide duplex was extended in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm dNTPs, and 5 units of Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA Pol I for 2 h at 37 °C (step 2, Fig. 1). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were then amplified in a 100-μl polymerase chain reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.75, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm primers DLTS2F and DLTS3R, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The reaction mixture was heated for 30 cycles in a programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (step 3, Fig. 1). DLTS2F, described above, corresponds identically to the 5′-end of oligomer 1. DLTS3R is a 32-mer corresponding to antisense nucleotides 636–658 and is identical to the 3′-end of oligomer 2 with the addition of a 5′-9-bp oligo-A overhang to facilitate subsequent restriction digestion. The amplified DNA was digested with BglII (New England Biolabs) and MroI (an isoschizomer of BspE1; Boehringer Mannheim) (step 4, Fig. 1), separated via centrifugation through a Microcon-30 filter (Amicon) and extracted with phenol.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligomer designationNucleotide sequenceOLIGO15′-d(ATCATCATGTGCGCTTGGAATCCAAGAGATCTTCCTCTGATGGCGCTGCCTCCATGC)-3′OLIGO25′-d(CCATGTCTC CGGATCTCTGGTACAGCTGGCAG GACAGCTCAC TGT TCACTACGTAGAACTGGCAGAGGGCATGGCATGGAGGCAGCGCCATCAG)-3′DLTS2F5′-d(ATCATCATGTGCGCTTGG)-3′BSPE1DL5′-d(GGCCCATGTCTCCGGATCTCTGGTACAGC)-3′3′HSG5′-d(TAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAG)-3′DLTS3R5′-d(AAAAAAAAACCATGTCTCCGGATCTCTGGTAC)-3′TSNDE15′-d(AACGGTAAAGGAGCAGAG)-3′TS-SAL15′-d(AAAAAAAAGTCGACCTAAACAGCCATTTCC)-3′Underlined nucleotides were subjected to randomization, constructed such that each nucleotide position will contain on average 86% wild-type sequence and 14% of the remaining three nucleotides.

Open table in a new tab Underlined nucleotides were subjected to randomization, constructed such that each nucleotide position will contain on average 86% wild-type sequence and 14% of the remaining three nucleotides. Double-underlined bold nucleotides indicate alterations that were introduced to create a silent SnaBI restriction site. The purified partially random oligonucleotides were used as inserts for construction of the human TS plasmid library. The stuffer vector was removed by digestion with BglII and MroI, and the resulting 3.6-kilobase fragment was isolated from a 0.8% agarose gel and was ligated to the 95-bp restricted random insert using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) (step 5, Fig. 1). The ligation mixture was directly transformed (Bio-Rad Genepulser, 2 kV, 25 μFD, 400 Ohm) into electrocompetent NM522 cells (Stratagene) (step 6, Fig. 1) using 2 μl of the ligation mixture (containing 100 ng of backbone and a 5:1 molar ratio of random insert to cut plasmid DNA), and 100 μl of E. coli yielded on average 2–6 × 104 transformants. Thirty transformations were pooled to obtain a library size of 2 × 106 clones. The size of the library containing the TS plasmid was determined by plating an aliquot of the transformation mixture on media containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml; Island Scientific, Bainbridge Island, WA). The remainder of the library was amplified by growing the transformed NM522 cells overnight in 1 × YT media in the presence of carbenicillin and recovering the plasmid (step 7, Fig. 1). Transformation into χ2913 (TS−) E. coli was conducted using 500 ng of the purified plasmid DNA library and 100 μl of electrocompetent cells. (Bio-Rad Genepulser, 1.8 kV, 25 μFD, 400 Ohm). Five separate transformations were pooled, and cells were grown overnight in nonselective medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, and 50 μg/ml thymidine and stored in aliquots at −80 °C in 10% glycerol (step 8, Fig. 1). The extent of randomization was verified by sequencing plasmid DNA from 35 clones grown on nonselective 2 × YT medium as described above. Mutants encoding active TS were selected by the method of Belfort and Pedersen-Lane (31Belfort M. Pedersen-Lane J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 371-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only χ2913 E. coli cells that produce functional TS are capable of colony formation on media lacking thymidine. χ2913 cells containing the random library were grown overnight at 37 °C in 1 × YT medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. The culture was diluted 1:100 with the same medium and grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm attained a value of 0.8 to 1.0. Aliquots of 1 ml of the exponentially growing cells were pelleted and resuspended in M9 salts, plated on minimal medium containing carbenicillin and tetracycline, and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Plasmids were isolated from 39 surviving colonies, and the inserted sequences containing the random region were sequenced to determine amino acid changes tolerable in maintaining catalytic activity of TS. To select for library members that are resistant to killing with 5-FdUR, transformants were placed on minimal medium in plates with increasing amounts of 5-FdUR (0–150 nm 5-FdUR) and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Colonies that grew in 5-FdUR were isolated, and the plasmid was retransformed into fresh χ2913 E. coli to confirm the drug-resistant phenotype and eliminate false positives. Each retransformed mutant was then subjected to the same selection procedure. Appropriate dilutions were conducted ranging from 10−2 to 10−6 such that plates contained approximately 1000 colonies. DNA from those mutants that survived 125 or 150 nm FdUR (n = 53), which was lethal to E. coli harboring the wild-type TS, was sequenced. To construct a plasmid expressing the wild-type or a mutant TS enzyme (Mut 64) linked to a 6×-His polypeptide, the 981-bp TS-containing DNA fragment of pGCHTS-TAA and Mut 64 were PCR amplified by using the 5′ primer TS-NDE1 and the 3′ primer TS-SALI. TS-NDEI hybridizes to the N-terminal sequence of TS, which naturally contains an NdeI restriction site; primer TS-SALI contains a SalI restriction site and a 5′-oligo-A tail and hybridizes to the sequence encoding the terminal 16 nucleotides of TS. The amplified DNA was cloned into pHis (a modified pUC12 vector provided by A. Hizi) and similarly digested withNdeI and SalI. Cloning procedures were confirmed by both restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The TS-6×-His fusion proteins were purified by a one-step metal chelation chromatographic procedure, using Ni2+ affinity resin and buffers (His-Bind resin and buffer kit, Novagen) according to a protocol modified from the supplier. TS containing χ2913 E. coli cells (250 ml), derived from overnight incubation of a single colony, was diluted 1:100 in fresh 2 × YT medium containing carbenicillin. After attaining an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and frozen at −80 °C in 30 ml of 1 × binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 μm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and lysozyme (200 μg/ml, Sigma). Frozen cells were thawed and lysed on ice for approximately 3 h. The lysed cells were centrifuged (27,000 × g), and the supernatant was applied to a charged 2.5-ml His-Bind column (1 × 2.5 cm). The resin was prepared by successive washes with 30 ml of deionized water, 30 ml of 1 × charge buffer (50 mm NiSO4), and 30 ml of 1 × binding buffer. All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C at a maximal flow rate of 20 ml/h. Following application of the crude supernatant, the column was washed successively with 40 ml of 1 × binding buffer, 25 ml of a mixture containing 60% binding buffer and 40% wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 500 μm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and 10 ml of 1 × wash buffer. TS was eluted with 30 ml of 1 × elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 500 μm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and about 90% of the recovered TS was released from the resin in the first 8 ml. Fractions (1.5 ml) containing purified human TS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing TS were combined (3 ml) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol for 16 h and then against the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol for an additional 16 h. The concentration of purified TS was determined by FdUMP binding according to the methods of Moran et al.(32Moran R.G. Spears C.P. Heidelberger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). TS activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm that occurs concomitant with the production of H2-folate (Δε = 6400 m−1 cm−1) (33Pogolotti A.L.J. Danenberg P.V. Santi D.V. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Wahba A.J. Friedkin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The standard reaction buffer contained 50 nm TES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 6.5 mm formaldehyde, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. When the concentration of dUMP was varied, (6R)-CH2H4-folate was added at 150 μm; when CH2H4-folate was varied, the concentration of dUMP was 100 μm (>20K m). Wild-type (10 nm) or Mut 64 (2.25 nm) TS was added to initiate the reaction. Steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kalidegraph 3.0 software (Abelbeck Software, Reading PA). Equilibrium studies of FdUMP binding by wild-type TS were carried out in reaction mixtures that contained 3.5 nm enzyme, 0.3–10.8 nm[6-3H]FdUMP, and 150 μmCH2H4-folate in TES buffer, pH 7.4. Equilibrium analysis of Mut 64 TS was conducted with 10 nm enzyme and 0.3–14 nm [3H]FdUMP. Equilibrium binding mixtures were incubated for 6 h at 24 °C, and protein-bound [3H]FdUMP was separated from free [3H]FdUMP by centrifugation at 12,000 × g through a Microcon-10 filter (Amicon) and washed three times with TES buffer. The flow-through (500 μl) containing free [3H]FdUMP was added to 5 ml of Scinti-Verse scintillation fluid (Fischer), and the radioactivity was quantitated. All data points were conducted in duplicate. Values of apparent dissociation constants (K d) were determined by computer-assisted linear regression analysis of data graphed according to the Scatchard equation (35Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17801) Google Scholar) and were the average of three separate determinations. A library of 2 × 106 human (TS) mutants was created by random sequence mutagenesis. The human TS gene expressed in the plasmid, pGCHTS-TAA, was modified to include an MroI restriction site at nucleotide 648. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a stuffer fragment was first inserted and was subsequently replaced by an insert containing random nucleotides. This allowed replacement of the targeted segment with a large nonfunctional stuffer fragment. The insert was constructed by elongating a partially double-stranded oligonucleotide containing 39 random nucleotides using DNA polymerase. It was digested with restriction enzymes to produce staggered ends and ligated into the modified human TS plasmid to replace the stuffer fragment. The 39-base pair randomized region encoding for TS residues 196–199 and 204–212 was located on the C-terminal side of the catalytically active cysteine (Cys-195). Unlike the wild-type TS construct, the recombinant plasmid contains a silent SnaBI site that was used to confirm that any active clones with a wild-type DNA sequence are the result of selection from the library and not contamination. Prior to selection, plasmid DNA was isolated from 35 transformed clones and sequenced. The number of substitutions per clone is presented in Fig. 2, and the types of substitutions are tabulated in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig. 2 A, an average of 5.7 nucleotide changes and 4.3 amino acid changes per clone was detected. Amino acid substitutions in the nonselected clones were evenly distributed among the 13 residues encoded by the randomized nucleotides (Fig. 3 A). 9 of the 35 nonselected clones analyzed (26%) contained at least one frameshift mutation, and 5 contained termination codons. The substitutions observed were in accord with the expected distribution in the plasmid population (36Suzuki M. Christians F.C. Kim B. Skandalis A. Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Mol. Divers. 1996; 212: 111-118Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the number and frequency of random substitution, we calculated that the nonselected library should contain approximately 0.27% wild-type nucleotide sequences corresponding to 1% wild-type protein sequence (see “Discussion” for calculation). Therefore, it is not surprising that one wild-type molecule was detected among the 35 nonselected clones sequenced.Figure 3Amino acid substitutions. A, nonselected; B, active mutant library; C, 5-FdUR-selected library. The wild-type TS sequence is shownbelow the solid line, and the substitutions observed at each position are indicated above each site.Boxed residues are those subjected to mutagenesis. The catalytic cysteine, Cys-195, is absolutely conserved (underlined). A number following a substitution indicates the number of nucleotides observed to be mutated in the corresponding codon; no number is shown if only one nucleotide was altered. B, active clones consisting of 2 amino acid substitutions include V204G/C199I, V204F/S206R, E207R/Q211H, A197T/L208V, and C199S/V204M. Active clones harboring triple substitutions include V204G/N205D/L212M, A197S/C199F/N205K, V204L/N205H/Q211H, V204L/N205K/S206K, and V204D/N205H/E207G. No active clones con"

We have investigated these kinetics by determining 3′-CMP formation both spectrophotometrically and by a highly specific and quantitative chemical sampling method. With the use of RNase A derivatives that lack a functional p2 binding subsite, evidence is presented that the abnormal kinetics with the native enzyme are caused by the sequential binding of the substrate to the several subsites that make up the active site of ribonuclease. The evidence is based on the following points. 1) Some of the unusual features found with native RNase A and C>p as substrate disappear when the derivatives lacking a functional p2 binding subsite are used. 2) Thek cat/K m values with oligocytidylic acids of increasing lengths (ending in C>p) show a behavior that parallels the specific velocity with C>p at high concentrations: increase in going from the monomer to the trimer, a decrease from tetramer to hexamer, and then an increase in going to poly(C). 3) Adenosine increases the k catobtained with a fixed concentration of C>p as substrate. 4) High concentrations of C>p protect the enzyme from digestion with subtilisin, which results in a more compact molecule, implying large substrate concentration-induced conformational changes.

Bovine pancreatic RNase A (EC 3.1.27.5) catalyzes the breakdown of RNA by means of a transesterification from the 5′ position of one nucleotide to the 2′ position of the adjacent nucleotide with the formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate product (Scheme FS1). In an aqueous environment, the cyclic nucleotide is irreversibly hydrolyzed to a 3′ nucleotide. The forward direction of the reaction requires a dinucleoside monophosphate as the minimum size for the substrate, whereas the reverse direction of the reaction can take place with pyrimidine 2′,3′-cyclic mononucleotides. It appears that the hydrolytic step is just a special case of the reverse transphosphorylation, as has been emphasized by Cuchilloet al. (1Cuchillo C.M. Parés X. Guasch A. Barman T. Travers F. Nogués M.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Cuchillo C.M. Vilanova M. Nogués M.V. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases. Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 272-304Google Scholar) and by Thompson et al. (3Thompson J.E. Venegas F.D. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7408-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several kinetic studies with RNase A have been carried out following the hydrolysis of either uridine or cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate as substrates. At relatively low concentrations of this type of substrate, in an aqueous environment, the only significant route is that of hydrolysis, and a hyperbolic substrate concentration dependence is usually obtained. However, working at high substrate concentrations, Walker et al. (4Walker E.J. Ralston G.B. Darvey I.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Walker E.J. Ralston G.B. Darvey I.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) observed that at pH 7.0, the dependence of the rate of hydrolysis with substrate concentration shows a nonhyperbolic behavior: there is a drop at about 25 mm to 30 mm C>p1followed by a second rise and then a gradual decline, which they interpreted by an allosteric model in which there is a substrate-dependent change in the equilibrium between three pre-existing enzyme conformations, one of which inactive. Later, Piccoli and d'Alessio (6Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 693-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also showed deviations from hyperbolic kinetics for RNase A with C>p, but only at a low substrate concentration. They attributed this behavior to quaternary structure changes. Here, we propose an alternative explanation based on the now well documented model of the subsites structure of RNase A (7de Llorens R. Arús C. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol.

Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). B, R, and p stand for the base, ribose, and phosphate binding subsites, respectively. B1R1p1 is the main binding site at which catalysis takes place. Subsites with subscripts 2 and 3 are on its 3′ side in the nucleotide chain of the substrate, whereas subsites with subscript 0 are on its 5′ side. 2The ribonuclease binding subsites are named as in de Llorens et al. (7de Llorens R. Arús C. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). B, R, and p stand for the base, ribose, and phosphate binding subsites, respectively. B1R1p1 is the main binding site at which catalysis takes place. Subsites with subscripts 2 and 3 are on its 3′ side in the nucleotide chain of the substrate, whereas subsites with subscript 0 are on its 5′ side. In the present study, the p2 phosphate binding subsite (Fig. 1), adjacent to the main catalytic phosphate binding site p1, was either deleted by means of site-directed mutagenesis or blocked by chemical modification. The kinetics of these RNase A derivatives using C>p as substrate showed profound modifications with respect to the behavior observed with the native enzyme. The results can be accounted for in terms of a modification of the catalytic properties of the enzyme as a function of the sequential binding of the cyclic mononucleotide substrate to different subsites of decreasing affinity. This sequential binding with the monomeric substrate shows many similarities to the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme when oligonucleotides of different size are used as substrates. The use of a chemical sampling method developed in this laboratory to follow the reaction allowed us to dissect the backward reaction according to the use of either water (H—OH) or another molecule of cyclic mononucleotide (R—OH). 3′-CMP was obtained in the former case (what is usually known as the second step of the RNase reaction), and a dinucleotide ending in a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate was obtained in the latter case (what is usually known as reverse reaction of the first step). From these experiments, we conclude that the nonhyperbolic kinetics observed with the unmodified enzyme are due to the interaction of the substrate with the different subsites of the enzyme rather than to different pre-existing conformations of RNase A (4Walker E.J. Ralston G.B. Darvey I.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or to RNase aggregation (6Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 693-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is discussed in terms of the configuration of the several binding subsites in RNase A, which is fundamental in relation to the physiological function of the enzyme,i.e. the breakdown of polymeric RNA (9Nogués M.V. Vilanova M. Cuchillo C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Parés X. Nogués M.V. de Llorens R. Cuchillo C.M. Tipton K.F. Essays in Biochemistry. 26. Portland Press Ltd., London1991: 89-103Google Scholar). In addition, the experimental data for the native enzyme has been fitted to a fifth degree polynomial derived from a kinetic scheme based on the sequential binding of monomeric substrate molecules. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease type I-A (5 × crystallized) was purchased from Sigma. The RNase A component was obtained as described previously (11Alonso J. Nogués M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was calculated by using ε277.5 = 9800 m−1cm−1 (12Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). C>p (sodium salt), 3′-CMP, poly(C), adenosine, subtilisin (EC3.4.21.14) from Bacillus licheniformis (protease type VIII: bacterial), and pepsin from porcine stomach mucosa were from Sigma. According to the manufacturers, the M r of poly(C) ranged between 260,000 and 1,200,000. Ammonia and acetic acid, HPLC grade, were from Scharlau (Ferosa, Barcelona, Spain). Acetonitrile, HPLC grade, was from Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). A reversed-phase HPLC column, Nova Pak C18 (3.9 x 150 mm), and SepPak Plus C18 cartridges were purchased from Millipore-Waters (Milford, MA, USA). Nucleosil 10SB anion-exchange column (8 x 300 mm outer diameter, 4 mm inner diameter) and Vydac-310SB precolumn stationary phase were purchased from Macherey, Nagel & Co (Düren, Germany). Bio-Gel P60 was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. All HPLC experiments were carried out with modular HPLC chromatographs from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Waters Corp. (Mildford, MA). 500 μl of 10 mg/ml poly(C) solution in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, was incubated with 50 μl of 7 μm RNase A at 25 °C for 5 min. Oligocytidylic acids were separated according to the method of Moussaoui et al. (13Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C.M. Nogués M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4687-4692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The activity was measured by the method of Crook et al. (14Crook E.M. Mathias A.P. Rabin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), with the only difference being that the increase in absorbance was measured at 296 nm (Δε296 = 516.4m−1·cm−1). C>p concentration range and enzyme concentration are indicated under “Results.” All assays were done in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 25 °C, and measurements were carried out using either 1-cm or 2-mm path length cells. The first 2 min of the progress curves were used for the calculation of initial velocities. All assays were done in triplicate. Although a Coulombic effect has been shown for the binding of C>p to RNase A (15Eftink M.R. Biltonen R.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), no correction in ionic strength was found to be necessary because of the relatively small increase in ionic strength with respect to that of the buffer, even at the highest substrate concentrations. The simultaneous synthetic activity from C>p to cytidylyl-3′,5′-cytidine-2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (CpC>p) and hydrolytic activity to 3′-CMP at high concentrations of the substrate C>p were analyzed by HPLC (16Guasch A. Barman T.E. Travers F. Cuchillo C.M. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 473: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this case too, the first 2 min of the progress curves were used for the calculation of initial velocities. All assays were done in duplicate. The data were computer-analyzed using the GRAFIT program (17Leatherbarrow R.J. GRAFIT, version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). All reactions were carried out in 0.2 msodium acetate, pH 5.5, at 25 °C. The kinetic parameters,K m and k cat, for the transesterification reaction with oligocytidylic acids (Cp)nC>p, where n varies from 1 to 5, were determined spectrophotometrically using 2-mm path length cells. In all cases, the linear decrease in absorbance at 286 nm was recorded, and the substrate concentration range was 10–500 μm. The final enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture was 0.1 nm. For each oligonucleotide substrate, the molar absorbance change at the selected wavelength (Δε286) was determined from the maximum absorbance difference between the starting reaction mixture and the complete degradation to C>p. We applied to oligocytidylic acids the method described by Irie et al. (18Irie M. Mikami F. Monma K. Ohgi K. Watanabe H. Yamaguchi R. Nagase H. J. Biochem. 1984; 96: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in their kinetic studies with oligouridylic acids. Because poly(C) is not electrophoretically homogeneous (information provided by Sigma) it was analyzed by HPLC (13Moussaoui M. Guasch A. Boix E. Cuchillo C.M. Nogués M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4687-4692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Neither oligonucleotides nor other small molecular mass contaminants were observed in significant amounts. In the case of poly(C), the decrease in absorbance at 296 nm was followed, and the substrate concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 3 mg/ml, whereas the enzyme concentration in the final mixture was 0.8 nm. In all these cases a hyperbolic behavior was found and the kinetic parameters, K mand k cat, were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with the ENZFITTER program (19Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM-PC. Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge1987Google Scholar). Initial velocity measurements over the first 2 min of the progress curve were obtained. Assays were done in triplicate. Noncovalent dimers were obtained by the method of Crestfield et al. (20Crestfield, A. M., Stein, W. H., and Moore, S. (1962)Arch. Biochem. Biophys.1 (suppl.) 217–222Google Scholar). To 5 mg of RNase A, 5 ml of 50% acetic acid was added. The solution was frozen at −80 °C and freeze-dried. The separation of the dimeric and monomeric forms was carried out by means of gel-filtration chromatography using a Bio-Gel P-60 column (2 × 80 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The fraction containing RNase dimers was recovered by freeze-drying. Derivative II was obtained by reaction of RNase A with 6-chloropurine-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-5′-monophosphate according to the method of Parés et al. (21Parés X. Llorens R. Arus C. Cuchillo C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The preparation of this double mutant of RNase A was carried out according to the procedure of Boix et al. (22Boix E. Nogués M.V. Schein C.H. Benner S.A. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2529-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To 100 μl of C>p at concentrations in the range of 0–50 mm in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 4 °C, 15 μl of RNase A (6.5 mg/ml) was added. This was followed by a 2-min incubation at 4 °C, after which 5 μl of subtilisin (1 mg/ml) was added. After 15 min of incubation at 4 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 m HCl and 50 μl of electrophoresis loading buffer. Then, separation of the S-peptide and S-protein was carried out by 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue, and densitograms were taken. As a control, the influence of C>p, in a concentration range between 0 and 50 mm, on the subtilisin activity was checked by the enzymatic assay using casein as a substrate (method provided by Sigma). Fig. 2 shows the profile of product formation by RNase A using C>p as substrate at pH 5.5 and 25 °C. The kinetics were followed by two methods: a) an acid proteolytic quenched flow method followed by HPLC analysis of the products, and b) the classical spectrophotometric method. With the first method, the two reaction processes can be separated, and therefore, the corresponding rate constants can be calculated. It should be noted that at the time scale and elution conditions used, no other products apart from 3′-CMP and CpC>p were detected. Synthesis of CpC>p was only observed above a concentration of 10 mm of C>p, and thus, the lower concentration part of the curve, which shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, corresponds only to the hydrolysis to 3′-CMP no matter which method is used. For this reason, when no synthesis of dinucleotides was detected, as with, for example, the two RNase A derivatives assayed, the much less tedious spectrophotometric method was used. The dependence of the rate of hydrolysis of C>p upon its concentration by a synthetic noncovalent RNase dimer (results not shown) appears to be hyperbolic in the concentration range where the RNase A monomer gave nonhyperbolic kinetics. These results are in agreement with those of Piccoli and d'Alessio (6Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 693-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the high substrate concentration range (i.e. above 10 mm). However, we did not find any lack of hyperbolicity in the low substrate concentration part of the curve, neither with the monomeric nor the dimeric RNase A. The reason for this disagreement with Piccoli and d'Alessio (6Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 693-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may reside in the different pH used (5.5 here as opposed to 7.13). Richards and Wyckoff (25Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar) showed that adenosine binds to a particular region of the RNase A active site, which they called the B2R2subsite. We determined the effect of the occupancy of this subsite by adenosine on the rate of hydrolysis of C>p, and the result is shown in Fig. 3. The experiment was carried out at a fixed concentration of C>p (10 mm) and increasing concentrations of adenosine. It is clear that as the adenosine concentration is raised (up to its solubility limit) so the rate of hydrolysis of C>p increases. This effect is similar to that found on increasing the concentration of the own substrate. Similar activating effects were also observed with 5′-AMP (26Haffner P.H. Wang J.H. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1608-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wieker and Witzel (27Wieker H.J. Witzel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) found that 2′,3′-cyclic AMP, 5′-AMP, and adenosyl-3′,5′-adenosine all stimulate the hydrolysis of C>p by RNase A. Because nonhyperbolic kinetics can often be related to conformational changes, we tried a simple probe, such as the resistance to proteolytic digestion by subtilisin. It is well known that RNase A can be split by controlled digestion with subtilisin yielding two fragments, the S-peptide (residues 1–20) and S-protein (residues 21–124), which can be separated easily (28Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1459-1465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separate fragments are inactive. In the presence of C>p, the molecule became more compact, as suggested by the increased resistance to subtilisin cleavage: the formation of the proteolytic fragment S-protein decreased as the substrate C>p was present in increasing amounts, as shown in Fig. 4. As a control, it was checked that the activity of subtilisin on its casein substrate was not affected by the presence of C>p. Table I shows the steady state parameters for the depolymerization of oligo- and polycytidylic acids by RNase A as determined spectrophotometrically from initial velocities. The values for the mononucleotide C>p were obtained at low substrate concentrations (i.e. up to 5 mm, where hyperbolic kinetics are observed). At the oligocytidylic acid concentrations used, up to 500 μm, normal hyperbolic behavior was found in all cases. The sharp increase in the apparent second order constant k cat/K mupon increasing the size of the substrate is noteworthy. Thus, in going from C>p to CpC>p, the constant increased 300-fold, but then there was little significant change up to the hexamer. However, with poly(C), there was a further sharp increase to 5.8 × 108m−1 s−1, a value that is in the range expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction (108-1011m−1s−1; see, for example, Ref. 29Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H.

In the case of the kinetics observed with the modified enzymes used, the curve was obtained spectrophotometrically, as in the experiments carried out by Boix et al. (22Boix E. Nogués M.V. Schein C.H. Benner S.A. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2529-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inasmuch with the K7Q/R10Q mutant showed that the lack of a functional p2binding subsite abolishes the synthetic activity of RNase A. Fig. 5 shows the substrate concentration dependence of derivative II and of mutant K7Q/R10Q when C>p is used as a substrate. The results are quite striking in both cases. The lack of a functional p2 binding subsite results in the disappearance of the increase in velocity in the region around 10–19 mm C>p and the subsequent drop in the region around 20–25 mm C>p. Also noteworthy is the decrease in activity with respect to the native enzyme (about one order of magnitude in both cases). The curves were obtained by fitting the experimental points to a second degree rational equation in the case of derivative II and to a third degree equation for the double mutant. For comparison purposes the curve obtained for C>p hydrolysis with the native enzyme is included in the figure. Even if in both the modified RNases the p2 site were to be involved, the two dependences are not identical. Thus, whereas with derivative II the dependence is linear up to 40 mm C>p, with the mutant there was an inflection above 25 mm C>p, which corresponds to the minimum in the dependence with the unmodified enzyme. This difference could be explained by the RNase A being modified in different ways. With the mutant enzyme there is no functional p2, although there should be no steric hindrance for the phosphate of the substrate to sit there. It simply does not make a specific interaction with the catalyst, and therefore, the strength of the interaction is considerably diminished. Nonetheless, a putative interaction of an additional substrate molecule in B3R3p3 is not excluded in this mutant (Fig. 6 B). In the case of derivative II, on the other hand, the p2 binding subsite is not modified but it is blocked by the phosphate of the label. Thus, there is no possibility for a second nucleotide (which should occupy B2R2p2) to bind properly. Moreover, as the label also occupies B3R3 (8Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Boqué L. Coll M.G. Vilanova M. Cuchillo C.M. Fita I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19707-19712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of an additional substrate molecule (at B3R3p3) is also precluded (Fig. 6 C). Our purpose was to determine the cause of the unusual kinetics of the hydrolysis of C>p by RNase A at high substrate concentrations. We were confronted with two possibilities: i) classical cooperative interactions between sites located in different polypeptide subunits, and ii) interaction between different subsites in the same polypeptide chain. The lack of kinetic abnormalities when RNase A dimers were used ruled out the first possibility, and the results of this work show clearly that multiple subsites are involved in the abnormal kinetics. It is not clear why the RNase A dimers do not show an allosteric behavior, but it is likely that the nature of its catalytic site formed by amino acids originating from both subunits (25Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar) might impose constraints to additional conformational changes. In order to obviate any assay ambiguities, we studied the kinetics of the hydrolysis by a method that is at once specific and quantitative for 3′-CMP. The kinetic characteristics with C>p for several modified ribonucleases were also studied. It has been shown that RNase A can bind several mononucleotide molecules at a time, usually one with strong affinity and the others with lower affinities (31Guasch A. Solà J. Nogués M.V. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Richardson R.M. Parés X. Llorens R. Nogués M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1975; 147: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) calculated that, at pH 7.0, RNase A can bind up to 18 molecules of C>p. From crystallographic data on the interaction of (dAp)4 with RNase A, McPherson et al. (33McPherson A. Brayer G.D. Cascio D. Williams R. Science. 1986; 232: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) devised a 12-nucleotide-long virtual strand of DNA that could bind to the enzyme. Computer graphics studies on the binding of RNA (7de Llorens R. Arús C. Parés X. Cuchillo C.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that a pentaribonucleotide could be fitted into a groove on the enzyme surface and that specific interactions could be established between the phosphate groups of the substrate and positive regions in the enzyme. A number of these interactions have been confirmed by x-ray analysis of a complex of RNase A with a pentadeoxynucleotide (8Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now address the question of whether or not there is interaction between the subsites and whether such an interaction explains the abnormal hydrolysis kinetics with C>p. Site-site interaction is suggested by the activating effect of adenosine on C>p hydrolysis (Fig. 3). There is evidence that adenosine binds to B2R2, a site adjacent to the catalytic site (8Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol.

Polarized absorption microspectrophotometry was performed on single crystals under various redox, pH, and salt conditions. The results show that the enzyme is catalytically active in the crystal and that the cations cause the same spectral perturbations as are observed in solution. These studies lead us to propose a model for the entrance and binding of the substrate in the active site. methylamine dehydrogenase heavy subunit light subunit MADH fromM. extorquens AM1 MADH from P. denitrificans MADH from M. flagellatum KT MADH from T. versutus MADH from M. methylotrophus W3A1 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization root mean square polyethylene glycol trimethylamine tryptophylquinone tryptophan tryptophylquinone 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH)1 (EC 1.4.99.3) catalyzes the oxidation of methylamine in the periplasm of various methylotrophic bacteria to provide the organism with carbon, nitrogen, and energy (1Anthony C. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar). This enzyme is a quinoprotein and contains the novel cofactor tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ), which is derived from two tryptophan side chains (2McIntire W.S. Wemmer D.E. Chistoserdov A. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by MADH is as follows: CH3NH3++H2O→NH4++HCHO+2H++2e− REACTION I Subsequently, electrons are transferred to the membrane-bound terminal oxidase, cytochrome aa3 via a series of soluble electron carrier proteins (3Husain M. Davidson V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1712-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidative deamination of the methylamine to the aldehyde occurs in two steps. The first step leads to substrate oxidation with the subsequent formation of a TTQ-aminoquinol. The second step involves the reoxidation of the protein cofactor and the release of the aldehyde product. Two classes of MADH can be differentiated based on biochemical characterization and sequence comparison. The first class comprises the MADH from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 (MADH-AM) (4Chistoserdov A.Y. Chistoserdova L.V. McIntire W.S. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4052-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),Thiobacillus versutus (MADH-TV) (5Ubbink M. van Kleef M.A. Kleinjan D.J. Hoitink C.W. Huitema F. Beintema J.J. Duine J.A. Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and Paracoccus denitrificans (MADH-PD) (6Chistoserdov A.Y. Boyd J. Mathews F.S. Lidstrom M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that interact with the cupredoxin amicyanin to form a transient electron transfer complex (7Chen L. Durley R. Poliks B.J. Hamada K. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Satow Y Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4959-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The second class includes the MADH from Methylophilus methylotrophusW3A1 (MADH-WA) (8Chistoserdov A.Y. McIntire W.S. Mathews F.S. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4073-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Methylobacterium flagellatum KT (MADH-KT) (9Kiriukhin M.Y. Chistoserdov A.Y. Tsygankov Y.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 247-250Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which possess distinct biochemical and functional properties such as a different electron transfer partner. Light and heavy subunit sequences are 87 and 68% identical, respectively, for any two MADH belonging to the same subfamily, whereas these sequence identity levels drop to 72 and 49% for proteins from two distinct subfamilies. The crystal structures of two MADH from the first class, MADH-TV (resolution 2.2 Å) (10Vellieux F.M.D. Huitman F. Groendijk H. Kalk K.H. Frank J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Petrators K. Drenth J. Hol W.G.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and MADH-PD (resolution 1.75 Å) (11Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), have been solved and show a characteristic protein fold and the unique cofactor. These quinoproteins consist of a homodimer of heterodimers. The mature heterodimer is composed of one heavy subunit (H; ∼400 amino acids) and one light subunit (L; ∼130 amino acids). The structure of the heavy subunit is composed of seven β-sheets containing four anti-parallel β-strands each. The heavy subunit fold, known as a β-propeller, possesses pseudo 7-fold symmetry and is conserved among the MADHs, the central domain of galactose oxidase (12Ito N. Phillips S.E.V. Yadov K.D.S. Knowles P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 794-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the β1-subunit of the signal-transducing G protein (13Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons of the common core (160–180 amino acids) of the distinct proteins from this structural superfamily show a very low level of sequence identity (12–15%) and a large root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation (2.8–3.2 Å). The mature light subunit comprises the TTQ cofactor and six disulfide bridges. It is also mainly a β-structure but with no related fold yet identified. The specific cofactor of the MADH is formed by oxidation of a tryptophan to an ortho-quinone, the indole-6,7-dione, and by formation of a covalent link to another tryptophan (2McIntire W.S. Wemmer D.E. Chistoserdov A. Lidstrom M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14McIntire W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Nε1and O-7 of the first tryptophan are hydrogen bonded to the backbone, whereas the O-6 carbonyl group is involved in the enzymatic reaction (15Huizinga E.G. van Zanten B.A. Duine J.A. Jongejan J.A. Huitema F. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9789-9795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic studies of MADH using phenazine ethosulfate as electron acceptor support a ping-pong mechanism (16Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reductive half reaction proceeds through a substrate imine intermediate at C-6 of TTQ followed by abstraction of a methyl proton by an active site nucleophile to give a carbanion intermediate concomitant with reduction of the cofactor (17Brooks H.B. Jones L.H. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The resulting product imine intermediate is hydrolyzed to yield the aldehyde product and the reduced aminoquinol form of TTQ. In the oxidative half reaction, electrons are passed one at a time to an electron carrier while the TTQ forms an aminosemiquinone intermediate (18Bishop G.R. Brooks H.B. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8948-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ammonia release then follows transfer of the second electron and reoxidation of TTQ to the quinone. MADH is known to interact with a number of monovalent cations that cause spectral perturbations of the TTQ prosthetic group (19Kuusk V. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26136-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gorren A.C. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12202-12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These cations are of two types. Type I causes a red shift of the oxidized spectrum of MADH, whereas type II causes a bleaching of the visible spectrum and an increased absorbance in the near ultraviolet, similar to that observed during reduction of the enzyme by methylamine. Analogous spectral perturbations have been observed with another TTQ-containing enzyme, aromatic amine dehydrogenase (21Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The type I binding site is specific for larger cations such as Cs+, Rb+, and NH4+ as well as di-, tri-, and tetramethylammonium ions. Their K d values decrease with pH, typically ranging from 10–50 mm at pH 7 to 2–10 μM at pH 10. The type II site binds smaller cations such as K+ and Na+, with K d values typically much higher, ranging from 0.2–1 m at pH 7 to 0.5–1 mm at pH 10. Some ions bind to both sites with different affinities, causing a red shift at lower concentrations and bleaching at higher concentrations (19Kuusk V. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26136-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type I cations act as competitive inhibitors of MADH reduction by substrate (22Davidson V.L. Kumar M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Gorren A.C. Moenne-Loccoz P. Backes G. de Vries S. Sanders-Loehr J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A transient, red-shifted intermediate is also observed in the absorption spectrum of MADH prior to its reduction by methylamine (23Gorren A.C. Moenne-Loccoz P. Backes G. de Vries S. Sanders-Loehr J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). From these results, the binding site for these monovalent cations was predicted to be located at the active site in the vicinity of the cofactor atom O-6 and to mimic the first step of the reaction. The same ions were also shown to enhance the rate of oxidation of reduced MADH by amicyanin (24Gorren A.C. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9748-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To gain new insights into the role of these cations, we have investigated the crystal structures of MADH-AM and of some of its crystalline adducts at low ionic strength. We present here the crystallographic studies of the native MADH-AM, its substrate-reduced form after reaction with methylamine, and its complexes with two monovalent cation inhibitors. We also present spectra of MADH recorded in the presence and absence of these monovalent cation inhibitors, which demonstrate that the spectral properties of the protein behave the same in solution and in the crystalline states. In the light of our results, we discuss the first steps of the MADH enzymatic reaction. Protein was purified as described previously (25Eady R.R. Large P.J. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 757-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Boulton C.A. Large P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 570: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) experiment was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Titration of MADH-AM with cesium chloride and trimethylamine was carried out essentially as described earlier (19Kuusk V. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26136-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard 8451A diode array spectrophotometer using a 1-ml cuvette at 25 °C. Titrant solutions of CsCl and (CH3)3NHCl were 1.0–5.0 m in water. All spectra were corrected for dilution for each addition of titrant. Before use, the enzyme was treated with 50 mmK3Fe(CN)6 overnight at 4 °C to reoxidize a small amount of reduced enzyme. The K3Fe(CN)6was removed by seven cycles of washing with 25 mm bis-Tris propane buffer using a Centricon-30 centrifuge concentrator (Amicon). Crystallization conditions were identified in a sparse matrix search by the hanging drop method using the Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research, Inc.). Crystals were obtained in different PEGs (2–8 K) and at various precipitant concentrations (15–25%) in acetate buffer at acidic pH. The best crystals were grown in sitting drops using a protein concentration of 8–15 mg/ml in PEG4000 (19%) and sodium acetate buffer (70 mm, pH 4.1). Cations or substrate were introduced at 10 mm concentration into the mother liquor either prior to setting up the crystallization drops (CsCl) or later after the crystals were grown (CH3NH3+ and (CH3)3NH+). The methodology of polarized absorption spectroscopy of single crystals is well established (27Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Merli A. Brodersen D.E. Morini B. Chen Z. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Rossi G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9177-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The spectra for this study were recorded using a Zeiss MPM800 microspectrophotometer. The crystals were placed in a flow cell with quartz windows, and the aqueous surroundings of the crystal were varied by flowing fresh solutions of various pH containing a variety of salts, reducing or oxidizing agents. Two data sets (native and the cesium derivative) were collected on a Hamlin multiwire area detector, and two other data sets (methylamine- and trimethylamine-soaked crystals) were collected on a Rigaku Raxis II imaging plate, all at room temperature, using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray source. The crystals were all monoclinic, space group P21, and diffracted beyond 2-Å resolution. The unit cell dimensions for the native crystal werea = 55.3 Å, b = 94.0 Å,c = 107.5 Å, and β = 99.9° and were roughly identical (within 1%) in all derivatives. The data recorded on the Hamlin detector were processed using software developed at the University of California at San Diego (29Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The data recorded on the Raxis II were processed using the package DENZO/SCALEPACK (30Otwinowski Z. Data Collection and Processing.in: Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993Google Scholar). The structure of native MADH-AM was determined by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). A search model consisting of backbone atoms (residues 59–410 of the H subunit and 63–186 of the L subunit) and strictly conserved side chain atoms from the MADH-PD structure (11Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used. This partial model was constructed automatically with the program TITO (32Labesse G. Mornon J.-P. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which incorporates the sequence alignment of all known MADHs and also estimates the validity of the model by pseudo-energy calculations. A complete model for MADH-AM was subsequently built by reorienting the output coordinates from TITO according to the transformation matrix obtained from the AMoRe solution using an in-house program. 2G. Labesse, manuscript in preparation. Refinement of the native structure was performed by standard procedures for minimization and simulated annealing using the program X-PLOR (version 3.8.1) (33Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied to the two independent HL dimers in the asymmetric units of any of the crystals. Restraints on the TTQ cofactor geometry, in addition to those normally applied to tryptophan side chains, were that the angle tryptophylquinone (Trq)-112Cζ3—Trq-112Cε3—Trp-163Cδ1and the angle Trq-112Cε3—Trp-163Cδ1—Trp-163Nε1(in the light subunit) be equal and that the O-6 and O-7 atoms be coplanar to the indole ring of Trq-112. The dihedral angle between the two indole rings of TTQ was not restrained. The distance between Trq-112Ce3 and Trp-163Cδ1 (light subunit) was also not restrained except for the methylamine-soaked crystal, where unrealistic values for this distance were obtained in the absence of this restraint. Manual rebuilding was performed using the program O (33Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Water molecules were added using the X-PLOR automatic procedure and verified individually using O. The data quality for the substrate-reduced and cation-inhibited crystals was verified by molecular replacement with AMoRe. As these crystals were isomorphous, their structures were then determined by direct refinement of the MADH-AM structural model after stripping it of solvent. Modeling of solvent and ligands was performed using O; simulated annealing refinement and gradient refinement were carried out with X-PLOR. Crystals grow in 1 week in 19% PEG4000 at low salt concentration (70 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.1). The MADH-inhibitor complexes were obtained either by soaking or growing the crystal with the desired salt. The aminoquinol form was obtained by soaking native oxidized crystals with methylamine rather than by growing crystals directly from substrate-reduced protein, which resulted in crystals that were too small. The complexation of the cations and the reaction with methylamine were qualitatively monitored through visual observation of changes in the crystal color. The stability of the crystals upon addition of the reagents suggested that little conformation change within the protein was taking place. Similarly, change of pH did not affect the appearance of the crystal. The monoclinic unit cell contains one heterotetramer, (HL)2, in the asymmetric unit, and the solvent occupies 55% of the cell volume. Determination of the structure of MADH-AM was achieved using molecular replacement. The starting model was based on the refined structure of MADH-PD (11Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Construction of the starting model was greatly simplified using TITO to automate the procedure of sequence comparison and generation of coordinates. Refinement of the native AM1 structure to an R factor of 16.5% (Rfree20.9%) was done using several runs of simulated annealing, manual rebuilding, and addition of solvent molecules.

The numbering scheme adopted for the amino acid sequence of the H and L subunits used in the crystal structure analysis is based on the sequences of the mauB and mauA genes in M. extorquens AM1, which encode polypeptides 411 and 186 residues in length, respectively (4Chistoserdov A.Y. Chistoserdova L.V. McIntire W.S. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4052-4065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MALDI was performed to analyze the post-translational processing of the two subunits of this periplasmic enzyme. The observed peaks (not shown) correspond to each monomer, the dimer, and the complete tetramer. The molecular masses deduced from MALDI (L = 13,962; H = 41,170) are consistent with polypeptide cleavage after position 57 of the mauA gene product and after position 36 of the mauB gene product, resulting in an L subunit of 129 amino acids and an H subunit of 375 amino acids (computed molecular masses, L = 13,967, H = 41,157). In the crystallized protein, the first four residues of both mature H subunits and the first five residues and last two residues (185 and 186) of both mature L subunits are not seen in the electron density (contoured at 1ς). The refinement revealed, however, the structure of 16 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the heavy subunit (Gly-42(H) to Ala-58(H)) not seen in the crystal structure of MADH-PD. Continuous density is observed in the 2Fo − Fc map when contoured at 1.3ς showing clearly the backbone and the side chains. Despite weakness in this part, the density was sufficient to build a 12-amino acid helical segment similar to that observed in MADH-TV (10Vellieux F.M.D. Huitman F. Groendijk H. Kalk K.H. Frank J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Petrators K. Drenth J. Hol W.G.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and in the MADH-PD-amicyanin binary complex (7Chen L. Durley R. Poliks B.J. Hamada K. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Satow Y Huizinga E. Vellieux F.M.D. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4959-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The heterotetrameric structure is composed of two heterodimers related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis roughly oriented perpendicular to the 7-fold axes of the pseudosymmetrical heavy subunits. The two cofactors are separated by a distance of 38 Å (O-6—O-6′). The area of the solvent-accessible surface of the HL dimer, which is buried upon tetramer formation, is 3790 Å2, suggesting that the tetramer is stable in solution and represents the active form of the enzyme. The stabilization of the tetramer is mainly due to H1L2 and H2L1 contacts, whereas the H1H2 interface accounts for 715 Å2. The surface area buried at the interface of the H and L subunits in each dimer (H1L1 or H2L2) is also large (1600 Å2). The N-terminal tail of a heavy subunit from one HL dimer is wrapped around the small subunit of the other HL dimer. This results in the L subunit being sandwiched by two distinct heavy subunits and about half buried. The remainder of the accessible surface of the small subunit comprises part of the cupredoxin binding site. The r.m.s. deviation measured between Cα atoms of the two dimers, H1L1 and H2L2, of the of MADH-AM structure (which was refined without using any non-crystallographic symmetry restraints) is low (0.14 Å). The r.m.s. deviation between the Cα atoms of two light subunits is lower (0.10 Å) than that between the two heavy subunits (0.15 Å). This is probably due to the seven intrasubunit covalent bonds between side chains (six disulfide bridges plus TTQ in 130 amino acids for L, compared with one disulfide in 400 amino acids for H). A comparison of the common Cα atoms of the structures of MADH-AM and MADH-PD gives a low r.m.s. deviation (light subunit, 0.27 Å/121 amino acids; heavy subunit, 0.51 Å/345 amino acids; dimer, 0.46 Å/466 amino acids; tetramer, 0.52 Å/932 amino acids). In this case, their close structural similarity is probably due to their high sequence identity (89% for L subunits and 68% for H subunits). The conservation of the secondary structural elements in the heavy subunit, which comprise seven four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets common to other MADHs, was verified by secondary structure assignment based on the Cα positions (35Labesse G. Colloc'h N. Pothier J. Mornon J.-P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 291-295PubMed Google Scholar). The only major difference between the two heterodimers H1L1 and H2L2 resides in an external segment (residues 231–241) of the heavy subunits. The discrepancy is due to crystal packing involving this segment in one subunit (H2). In both H1 and H2, this segment comprises a β-turn (residues 233–236) and an extended structure (residues 237–241) on the surface of the protein. Continuous density is observed in the 2Fo − Fc map when contoured at 1.5ς (but not at 2ς) in H2, whereas in H1 the density is much weaker, especially for the β-turn. In the absence of strong stabilizing interactions with the remainder of the structure, the residues 233–240 of subunit H1 and residues 233, 234, and 239 of subunit H2 seem partly disordered. The r.m.s. deviation of this 10-amino acid-long segment in the two different environments is very high (2.20 Å). Except for this segment, the two HL heterodimers are virtually identical, and no distinction between them will be made during the remainder of this article. Only two residues, Ile-128(H) (φ = 65, ψ = −70) and His-209(H) (φ = 72, ψ = 161), lie outside the allowed zones of the Ramachandran plot. Otherwise, the overall quality of the structure is high according to PROCHECK (36Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Their identity, conformations, and molecular environments are highly conserved in MADH-PD (11Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E. Davidson V.L. Mathews F.S. J. Mol.

His-209(H) forms side chain hydrogen bonds to a carbonyl oxygen and a buried water; the two peptide planes adjacent to it are sandwiched by the side chains of Met-117(H) and Met-220(H). One cis-proline (Pro-184(H)) is also observed in MADH-AM and is present within a distorted polypeptide chain reversal as in MADH-PD (11Chen L. Doi M. Durley R.C.E. Chistoserdov A.Y. Lidstrom M.E.

What role, if any, these strained peptide groups may play in the structure and function of MADH is not clear. The side chains of residues Met-89, Val-111, Tyr-125, Leu-253, Val-364, Val-406, and Met-407 in the heavy subunits and Ser-115, Ser-128, Ile-127, and Met-172 in the light subunits were each modeled with two alternate side chain conformations. These include the sulfur atoms of three methionines that were each modeled to occupy two positions (separated by up to 2 Å) to fit weak and/or donut-shaped electron density. A concerted conformation change seems to take place for the side chains of Met-89(H) and Val-111(H), as their Cε and Cγ, respectively, are in close van der Waals contact distance. The active site of the native enzyme is similar to that of MADH-TV (15Huizinga E.G. van Zanten B.A. Duine J.A. Jongejan J.A. Huitema F. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G.

Although the heavy subunit contributes only one residue (Phe-80(H)) directly to the entrance of the substrate binding site, other residues from that subunit help stabilize the surroundings of the active site. The cofactor is built up from the covalently linked Trq-112(L) and Trp-163(L). The refined TTQ geometry is presented in Table II. The refined length of the unique bond, Cε3–Cδ, between the 6-atom ring of Trq-112(L) and the 5-atom ring of Trp-163(L), is 1.43 Å, suggesting partial aromaticity of this bond.

Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage with cell cycle arrest, activation of DNA repair, and, in the event of irreparable lesions, the induction of apoptosis. The signals controlling responses to genotoxic stress, while of importance to mutagenesis and treatment with certain anti-cancer agents, remain unclear. Certain insights, however, have been derived from the finding that DNA-damaging agents activate the c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M.

Activation of c-Abl is associated with binding to the p53 tumor suppressor and the induction of growth arrest in G1 phase through down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) (6Yuan Z.-M.

Other studies have demonstrated that c-Abl contributes to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (8Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings have supported a role for c-Abl in regulating the growth arrest and apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. c-Abl is present in a nuclear complex that includes the Src-like Lyn PTK (10Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Lyn, like c-Abl, is activated by IR and other DNA damaging agents (11Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E.

The activation of nuclear Lyn by DNA damage is associated with binding of Lyn to Cdc2 (11Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Taneja N. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yuan Z.-M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas activation of Cdc2 in a complex with cyclin B is required for the transition of cells from G2 to M phase (15Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), inhibition of Cdc2 by Lyn could contribute in part to the arrest at G2/M phase following exposure to DNA damaging agents. Alternatively, binding of Lyn to Cdc2 may prevent the interaction of Cdc2 with proteins such as c-Src that play a functional role in mitosis (16Shenoy S. Chackalaparampil I. Bagrodia S. Lin P.-H. Shalloway D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that the activation of Lyn is not restricted to cells in G2. In this context, arrest of cells in G1/S phase by 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine is associated with activation of Lyn and binding of Lyn to Cdk2 (17Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 939-946PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the available evidence suggests that the Lyn PTK, like c-Abl, plays a role in the cell cycle arrest response to DNA damaging agents. DNA-PK, a complex of three proteins, is involved in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, V(D)J recombination, and transcription (18Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell.

The 470-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is activated by binding with the 70- and 80-kDa Ku heterodimer to sites of DNA damage (23Boubnov N.V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell.

Under some conditions, DNA-PK is a self-contained kinase that is activated by direct interaction with double-stranded DNA, whereas Ku stabilizes binding of DNA-PK to DNA ends (21Chu G. J. Biol.

Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs inhibits its activity by inducing the dissociation of DNA-PKcs from DNA (28Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs by c-Abl also inhibits the ability of DNA-PK to form a complex with DNA (5Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). c-Abl, like Ku, associates with DNA-PKcs near the kinase homology region (29Jin S. Kharbanda S. Mayer B. Kufe D. Weaver D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24763-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). c-Abl phosphorylates DNA-PKcs in the C-terminal region and thereby dissociates DNA-PKcs from the Ku-DNA complex (29Jin S. Kharbanda S. Mayer B. Kufe D. Weaver D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24763-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Otherwise, little is known about the regulation of DNA-PK activity. The findings that c-Abl forms a nuclear complex with Lyn (10Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) and that c-Abl interacts with DNA-PK prompted studies on a potential interaction between Lyn and DNA-PK. The present results demonstrate that Lyn binds directly to DNA-PK. We also show that Lyn phosphorylates DNA-PKcs and inhibits DNA-PKcs activity. U-937 monoblastic leukemia cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell-1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada) under aerobic conditions with137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 gray/min. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (3Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Soluble proteins were incubated with anti-Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-DNA-PK (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters in 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-DNA-PK or anti-Lyn antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signal intensities were determined by densitometeric analysis (UltroScan; LKB, Brommer, Sweden). The pGEX plasmid encoding a GST-Lyn (amino acids 1–243) fusion protein (30Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R.

The cell pellets were lysed by sonication. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (30Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Timson Gauen L.K. Winitz S. Coggeshall K.M. Johnson G.L. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5877-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and equilibrated in lysis buffer. Total cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of immobilized GST or the indicated GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C (31Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Weichselbaum R. Woodgett J. Avruch J. Kyriakis J. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18871-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The complexes were separated by electrophoresis in 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. After blocking in 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, the filters were incubated for 1 h with anti-DNA-PK antibody and analyzed as described above. DNA-PKcs polypeptides were prepared using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation method (Promega) with templates generated from the DNA-PKcs cDNA by polymerase chain reaction as described (29Jin S. Kharbanda S. Mayer B. Kufe D. Weaver D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24763-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lyn binding to in vitro translated DNA-PKcs polypeptides was assayed by incubating GST-Lyn SH3 (5 μg) in 20 μl of MB (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) with equal amounts of each in vitro translated [35S]DNA-PKcs product for 1–2 h at 4 °C. A separate incubation of the [35S]DNA-PKcs product with GST was used as a negative control. The beads were washed four times in 1 ml of MB at 4 °C, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 4% SDS, 720 nm2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purified DNA-PK (Promega) was incubated with purified Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) in lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn or PIRS, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PK antibody. Purified DNA-PK (Promega, 0.5 μg) was incubated in the absence of DNA in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP with purified kinase-active Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.In vitro kinase reactions containing active or heat-inactivated (HI) Lyn and DNA-PKcs were also performed with cold ATP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Purified Ku (provided by Dr. Lees-Miller; 0.5 μg) was incubated in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and purified kinase-active Lyn for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. DNA-PK/Ku (1 μg, Promega) was incubated with double-stranded DNA-cellulose beads (15 μg; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-cellulose beads were then washed and resuspended in kinase buffer. Kinase reactions containing beads, 100 μm ATP and active Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), HI Lyn, or MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) kinases were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. To ensure that phosphorylation was not due to DNA-PK, 20 μmwortmannin (Sigma) was added to inhibit DNA-PK activity (5Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction was obtained by sedimentation of the beads. Following washing of the beads with kinase buffer, the beads and supernatant fraction were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 5% or 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PK or anti-Ku antibodies. Signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis (UltroScan). Purified DNA-PK was incubated with purified kinase-active Lyn or HI Lyn in kinase buffer containing [γ32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions containing the phosphorylated DNA-PK were then incubated with GST-p53 and [γ32P]ATP in KB for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. As controls, purified Lyn was also incubated with GST-p53 in the presence and absence of DNA. The kinase reactions were stopped by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine whether nuclear Lyn associates with DNA-PK, we subjected anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates to immunoblot analysis with anti-DNA-PK antibodies. Whereas immunoprecipitates obtained with PIRS had no detectable DNA-PKcs, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Lyn antibody revealed the presence of complexes containing DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1 A). To evaluate the stoichiometry of interaction between DNA-PKcs and Lyn, we subjected U-937 cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn and analyzed the precipitates by immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PK. Signal intensities from before and after anti-Lyn immunoprecipitation were compared by laser densitometric scanning. The results demonstrate that approximately 25% of DNA-PKcs is associated with Lyn (data not shown). Because exposure of cells to IR is associated with activation of both Lyn (11Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA-PK (24Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day R.S.I. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether IR affects the interaction between these proteins. IR treatment was associated with a reproducible increase in the association of Lyn with DNA-PKcs to some extent (Fig. 1 B). To confirm binding of Lyn and DNA-PKcs, cell lysates were incubated with a GST fusion protein prepared from the 1–243 amino acid fragment of Lyn that includes a unique N-terminal region, Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains but not kinase domains (30Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Timson Gauen L.K. Winitz S. Coggeshall K.M. Johnson G.L. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5877-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Adsorbates obtained with GST-Lyn 1–243 but not with GST demonstrated binding of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1 Dand data not shown). Adsorbates obtained with GST-Lyn 1–131 and GST-Lyn 27–131 but not with GST-Lyn 131–243 also revealed specific binding of DNA-PKcs to the Lyn SH3 domain (Fig. 1 D). These findings indicate that the SH3 domain of Lyn contributes to the association with DNA-PK. To assess whether Lyn binds directly to DNA-PKcs, we incubated purified DNA-PKcs with Lyn. Anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PK. In contrast to PIRS, immunoprecipitation with anti-Lyn revealed the presence of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 2 A). These findings support a direct interaction between DNA-PKcs and Lyn. To assess where Lyn binds to DNA-PKcs, we prepared fragments of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 2 B) by in vitrotranscription/translation (29Jin S. Kharbanda S. Mayer B. Kufe D. Weaver D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24763-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of the DNA-PKcs in vitro translation products were incubated with GST-Lyn 1–243 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Analysis of the adsorbates by autoradiography demonstrated binding of Lyn to DNA-PKcs fragments 8, 11, and 14 (data not shown). These results support direct binding of Lyn to a leucine zipper region in DNA-PKcs (amino acids 1503–1538). Various fragments of DNA-PKcs were also studied for binding to the Lyn SH3 domain. The Lyn SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences with the consensusXPPXXPX. Consistent with the presence of such a sequence (REFPPGTPRFNN, amino acids 1744–1755; fragments 11 and 14) in DNA-PKcs, the results of Lyn SH3 binding assays with in vitro translated DNA-PKcs fragments 11 and 14 confirmed a direct interaction (Fig. 2, C and D, and data not shown). By contrast, there was no apparent binding of Lyn SH3 to other DNA-PKcs fragments (Fig. 2 B). Collectively, these studies indicate that the association between Lyn and DNA-PKcs occurs by direct interaction of the Lyn SH3 domain with DNA-PKcs amino acids 1520–1976. To determine whether Lyn phosphorylates DNA-PKcs, we incubated purified DNA-PK with active or HI Lyn. There was no detectable phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs in the presence of HI Lyn (data not shown). By contrast, kinase reactions that included kinase-active Lyn demonstrated phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs(Fig. 3 A). Lyn phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs did not require DNA-bound DNA-PK. Also, As a positive control, DNA-PK was incubated with DNA beads to show autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3 A). To confirm Lyn-dependent phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, we incubated purified DNA-PKcs with active or HI Lyn in kinase buffer containing cold ATP. The phosphorylated products were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results demonstrate Lyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3 B). DNA-PKcs forms a complex with the 70- and 80-kDa Ku heterodimer (26Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 32Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar), and thus we also incubated Lyn with purified Ku in a kinase reaction. In contrast to DNA-PKcs, there was no detectable phosphorylation of Ku (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that Lyn phosphorylates DNA-PKcs and not Ku. The activation of DNA-PK by binding of DNA-PKcs to Ku/DNA is associated with phosphorylation of p53 (19Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore to assess the effect of Lyn on DNA-PK activity, we incubated purified DNA-PKcs/Ku/DNA complexes with active or inactive Lyn and assessed DNA-PKcs activity using GST-p53 as a substrate. In the presence of DNA, DNA-PKcs/Ku phosphorylated GST-p53 (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). By contrast, addition of either active or inactive Lyn to the reaction inhibited GST-p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). In the absence of DNA-PK, Lyn had little effect on phosphorylation of GST-p53 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). These findings indicate that the direct interaction of Lyn with DNA-PKcs, and not necessarily the Lyn kinase function, contributes to the inactivation of DNA-PKcs. To further assess the functional significance of the interaction of Lyn and DNA-PK, the DNA-PK/Ku complex was bound to DNA beads and incubated with active or HI Lyn. The reactions included wortmannin to inhibit DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and thereby inhibit autodissociation from DNA (28Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Incubation with kinase-active or kinase-inactive Lyn resulted in release of DNA-PKcs from the beads into the supernatant (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, addition of the MEK1 serine/threonine kinase had no detectable effect on release of DNA-PKcs from DNA beads (Fig. 4 B). Whereas Lyn phosphorylates DNA-PKcs, but not Ku, we also asked whether Lyn affects the interaction between Ku and DNA. In the presence of Lyn, most of the Ku remained associated with the DNA beads (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained with the MEK1 kinase (Fig. 4 C). DNA-PKcs released from Ku/DNA in the presence of Lyn as compared with release of the DNA-PKcs/Ku complex from DNA was assessed by immunoblot analysis of proteins in the supernatant and bound to the beads. The results demonstrate that approximately 40% of DNA-PKcs is released from Ku in the presence of Lyn (Fig. 4 D). By contrast, only 2–4% of DNA-PKcs/Ku complexes were released from the DNA beads in the presence of Lyn (Fig. 4 D). These findings demonstrate that interaction of Lyn and DNA-PKcs results in dissociation of DNA-PKcsand Ku, and thereby directs inhibition of DNA-PKcsactivity. DNA-PK is essential in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks that form in irradiated cells (20Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P.

Autophosphorylation inactivates DNA-PK by a mechanism in which DNA-PKcs dissociates from Ku (28Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that c-Abl negatively regulates DNA-PK in the response to DNA damage (5Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that DNA-PK is also regulated by Lyn. DNA-PK constitutively associates with Lyn by direct binding of the Lyn SH3 domain to an internal region of DNA-PKcs that includes a leucine zipper. Lyn also phosphorylates DNA-PKcs. The in vitro findings indicate that the direct binding of Lyn to DNA-PKcs is sufficient to inhibit DNA-PKcs activity. Thus, constitutive binding of Lyn and DNA-PKcs could regulate the accessibility of certain pools of DNA-PKcs for interaction with Ku/DNA complexes. Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs represent another level of DNA-PKcsregulation. These results are in concert with the demonstration that the interaction between DNA-PKcs and Lyn induces the dissociation of DNA-PKcs from the Ku/DNA complex and thereby inhibits DNA-PKcs activity. The activation of Lyn by IR and other DNA damaging agents contributes to the down-regulation of Cdc2 (13Yuan Z.-M. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D.

The present findings support a function for Lyn in the regulation of DNA repair. Accordingly, interactions between Lyn and DNA-PKcs may play a role in releasing DNA-PKcs from Ku/DNA complexes after repair to permit relocation at new sites of DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W2065587181,"GlycosaminoglycanN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylases/N-sulfotransferases are structurally related enzymes that play an important role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and heparin. They are dual catalytic, single membrane-spanning polypeptides of approximately 850–880 amino acids that catalyze the N-deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine of glycosaminoglycans followed byN-sulfation of the same sugar. On the basis of homologies of these proteins with other N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylases involved in the biosynthesis of chitin and putative deacetylases from bacteria, we have constructed two soluble chimeras between protein A and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the above mastocytoma holoenzyme. The carboxyl-terminal chimera half (amino acids 479–880) was able to catalyze the N-sulfation of glucosamine of heparan sulfate with a similar affinity for its two substrates, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate and heparan sulfate, as the holoenzyme. However, the reaction only occurred at 30 °C and not at 37 °C, both temperatures at which the holoenzyme was active. The V max of the chimera was 10–20-fold slower than that of the holoenzyme. Soluble chimeras between protein A and amino acids 43–521 and 43–680 of the holoenzyme were unable to catalyze the N-deacetylation of the bacterial N-acetylglucosaminyl-glucuronic acid polymer K5 under conditions where the holoenzyme was active. The recent appearance in genome data banks of homologs to the N-sulfotransferase domain and now the direct demonstration that this domain catalyzes this reaction raises the possibility that both N-deacetylation and N-sulfation activities of the holoenzyme might have emerged as gene fusions during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1973309670,"It is believed that specific patterns of changes in the cytosolic-free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) are used to control cellular processes such as gene transcription, cell proliferation, differentiation, and secretion. We recently showed that the Ca2+ oscillations in the neuroendocrine melanotrope cells of Xenopus laevis are built up by a number of discrete Ca2+ rises, the Ca2+ steps. The origin of the Ca2+ steps and their role in the generation of long-lasting Ca2+ patterns were unclear. By simultaneous, noninvasive measuring of melanotrope plasma membrane electrical activity and the [Ca2+]i, we show that numbers, amplitude, and frequency of Ca2+ steps are variable among individual oscillations and are determined by the firing pattern and shape of the action currents. The general Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin had no effect on either action currents or the [Ca2+]i. Under Na+-free conditions, a depolarizing pulse of 20 mm K+ induced repetitive action currents and stepwise increases in the [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+ channel blocker CoCl2 eliminated action currents and stepwise increases in the [Ca2+]i in both the absence and presence of high K+. We furthermore demonstrate that the speed of Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm depends on the [Ca2+]i, also between Ca2+ steps during the rising phase of an oscillation.

Various cellular processes like gene expression, proliferation, contraction, and secretion are regulated by extracellular first-messenger molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. Regulation of these processes is often mediated by intracellular second messengers such as cAMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and Ca2+, which convert the extracellular signal into a cellular or subcellular response. Among second messenger-mediated signaling processes, Ca2+signaling is receiving much attention (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E.

This signaling appears to be based on the induction of temporary and/or spatial changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. These changes may be either local (i.e. sparks, blips, puffs) (7Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 8Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B.

It is proposed that the temporal and spatial aspects of the Ca2+ signal determine (encode) which (sub)cellular process will be regulated (20Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It seems that not only frequency modulation but also amplitude modulation can encode cellular effects (20Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 21Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). According to this principle, first messengers can regulate specific cellular activities by inducing distinct types of Ca2+signals. Consequently, the mechanism(s) cells use to generate different types of Ca2+ signals are of special interest. The present study concerns the relationship between plasma membrane electrical activity and Ca2+ signaling in an excitable secretory cell, the neuroendocrine melanotrope cell of Xenopus laevis. This pituitary intermediate lobe cell releases α-melanophore-stimulating hormone, a peptide that causes skin darkening in animals adapted to a black background (22Jenks B.G. Leenders H.J. Martens G.J.M. Roubos E.W. Zool. Sci. 1993; 10: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The cell displays intracellular Ca2+ oscillations that are regulated by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides involved in the regulation of α-melanophore-stimulating hormone release (23Roubos E.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 533-550Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Shibuya I. Douglas W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Shibuya I.

Physiol. 1994; 427: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+signaling is assumed to be involved in neurotransmitter-controlled biosynthesis of proopiomelanocortin, the precursor of α-melanophore-stimulating hormone (23Roubos E.W. Comp.

Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Ca2+oscillations depend on the activity of ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (25Shibuya I. Douglas W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2176-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Scheenen W.J.J.M. Jenks B.G. Roubos E.W. Willems P.H.G.M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Spatio-temporal studies using confocal laser-scanning microscopy have shown that each oscillation starts at the plasma membrane and is subsequently propagated as a wave to the nucleus (30Scheenen W.J.J.M. Jenks B.G. van Dinter R.J.A.M. Roubos E.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Koopman W.J.H. Roubos E.W. Jenks B.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The high temporal resolution of the line-scanning mode of the confocal laser-scanning microscopy has revealed that the rise phase of each oscillation is built up by a number of discrete increases referred to as Ca2+ steps (30Scheenen W.J.J.M. Jenks B.G. van Dinter R.J.A.M. Roubos E.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Koopman W.J.H. Roubos E.W. Jenks B.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the steps are building blocks for Ca2+ signaling in theXenopus melanotrope cell (31Koopman W.J.H. Roubos E.W. Jenks B.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). So far, no detailed information is available on how the steps contribute to the generation of distinct Ca2+ patterns. Xenopus melanotrope cells have also been shown to display bursting electrical activity (32Scheenen W.J.J.M. Jenks B.G. de Koning H.P. Vaudry H. Roubos E.W. J. Neuroendocrinology. 1994; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,33Valentijn J.A. Valentijn K. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the action potentials are the driving force for local Ca2+ influxes that give rise to the stepwise build up of Ca2+ to form distinct Ca2+patterns. To test this hypothesis we have performed simultaneous measurements of electrical plasma membrane activity (cell-attached patch clamping) and Ca2+ signaling (microfluorometry). We show that the membrane action currents are Ca2+ currents, that each Ca2+ step is created by a single action current, and that the bursting pattern of Ca2+ currents, in combination with the Ca2+removal rate, determines the shape of each oscillation. Young-adult (8 months of age) male and female specimens of X. laevis, raised in our department under standard laboratory conditions, were adapted to a dark background for at least three weeks before the experiments, under continuous illumination, at 22 °C. The animals were fed weekly with beef heart. All experiments have been carried out under the guidelines of Dutch laws concerning animal welfare. Animals were anesthetized in a solution containing 0.1% (w/v) MS222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester; Sigma). To remove blood cells, the animals were perfused withXenopus Ringer's solution containing 112 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 15 mm Ultral-HEPES (Calbiochem), 10 mm glucose, and 0.025% (w/v) MS222 (pH 7.4). After decapitation, neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary gland were rapidly dissected and rinsed four times in XL L15 culture medium consisting of 76% (v/v) L15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% (v/v) kanamycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% (v/v) antibiotic/antimyotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). After an incubation period of 45 min in Xenopus Ringer's solution without CaCl2 and with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), the lobes were dissociated by gentle trituration with a siliconized Pasteur's pipette. Then, the resulting cell suspension was filtered, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in XL L15 culture medium (80 μl/lobe-equivalent), and the cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly(l-lysine) (Sigma;M r > 300 kDa) in aliquots equivalent to 1 lobe/coverslip, yielding approximately 10,000 cells/coverslip. The cells were allowed to settle for 1–1.5 h in an incubator, at 22 °C. Then 2 ml of XL L15 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to each coverslip, and the cells were incubated for another 3 days at 22 °C before use. A microscopic setup for combined, time-coordinated microfluorometric and electrophysiological experiments was used to simultaneously measure changes in the [Ca2+]i and action currents (current waveforms that represent action potentials). To measure changes in the [Ca2+]i, cells were loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, NL) in Xenopus Ringer's solution containing 1 μmPluronic F127 (Molecular Probes) (34Poenie M. Alderton J. Steinhardt R. Tsien R. Science. 1986; 233: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 22 °C. After loading, cells were washed with Xenopus Ringer's solution to remove nonhydrolyzed fura-2/AM. Thereafter, cells were placed under continuous superfusion with Xenopus Ringer's solution (1 ml/min) on the stage of an upright microscope (Zeiss Axioskop FS, Göttingen, Germany). Unattached cells were removed, and attached cells were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before the start of an experiment. During an experiment, cells were alternately exposed to excitation light from a multiwavelength illumination system (T.I.L.L. photonics, polychrome II, Planegg, Germany) at wavelengths of 355 and 380 nm. The fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., R928, Japan) at a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The ratio of the emission intensities (355 nm/380 nm) was used as a measure for changes in the [Ca2+]i. Electrophysiological recordings were performed using the cell-attached recording configuration of the patch-clamp technique (35Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15065) Google Scholar). In this cell-attached configuration, biphasic wave forms, the action currents reflecting action potentials, were recorded without disturbing the intracellular environment. All recordings were made with a pipette potential of 0 mV using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Data were filtered with the built-in 4-pole Bessel filter of the EPC-9 at 3 kHz. Synchronized acquisition of both microfluorometric and electrophysiological data was performed with an Apple Macintosh PowerPC 8200/120 with Pulse/Pulsefit software (version 8.07; HEKA). Patch electrodes with a resistance of 4–6 megaohms were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150–15; Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) using a Narishige PP-83 pipette puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). They were filled with Xenopus Ringer's solution. To study the calcium dynamics during loading, cells (n= 4) were loaded with fura-2 via a patch pipette in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration as described by Helmchen et al.(36Helmchen F.J. Borst G.G. Sakmann B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1458-1471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 100 μmfura-2, 112 mm CsCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm MgATP, 10 mm Ultral-HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH). The extracellular solution consisted of 93 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 15 mmUltral-HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mmglucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Background fluorescence intensity was determined when the pipette was still in the cell-attached configuration. After break-in, Ca2+ influx was triggered every 15 s by a depolarizing pulse from −80 to 0 mV with a duration of 100 ms. At the same time fura-2 fluorescence emission intensities were measured at 355 and 380 nm excitation as described above. The ratio of the emission intensities (355 nm/380 nm) was used to determine the decay time constants (τ) and the relative amplitude (A r)1 of the evoked Ca2+ transients at different fura-2 concentrations. Drug-containing solutions were applied by local perfusion from a wide-mouthed glass pipette (inner diameter 0.8 mm) placed about 100 μm from the recorded cell. The level of the bath solution was kept constant by means of a suction device. In Na+-free conditions, NaCl was replaced by an equiosmotic amount of N-methylglucamine. To block Na+channels, 1 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX) was used, whereas Ca2+ channels were blocked with 2 mmCoCl2. To keep the osmolarity constant, the concentration of NaCl was adjusted when high K+ concentrations (20 mm) were used. All chemicals were from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Because it is known that the concentration of exogeneous Ca2+ buffers like fura-2 can alter the amplitude and kinetics of Ca2+ transients (36Helmchen F.J. Borst G.G. Sakmann B. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1458-1471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 37Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1549-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) we checked whether this also holds for Xenopusmelanotropes. Cells (n = 4) were loaded with fura-2 via patch pipettes in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration. After break-in, Ca2+ influx was triggered every 15 s by depolarizing pulses from −80 to 0 mV with a duration of 100 ms (Fig. 1 A, circles). The Ca2+-insensitive fluorescence (F 355) was used to monitor the diffusion of fura-2 into the cell (Fig. 1 A). We assumed that the concentration of fura-2 in the cell was equal to the fura-2 pipette concentration whenF 355 reached a plateau. AsF 355 followed an exponential time course, the fura-2 concentration during loading could be calculated at any given time. The ratio of the emission intensities (355 nm/380 nm;eg. Fig. 1 A, inset) was used to determine the decay time constants (Fig. 1 B, τ (tau)) and relative amplitude (Ar =R top/R basal; Fig. 1 C) of the evoked transients at different fura-2 concentrations. The inset in Fig. 1 A shows a transient directly measured after break-in (Fig. 1 A;black circle). To determine τ, single exponentials were fitted to the decays of the Ca2+ transients with a fit range that started within 20 ms after the peak and extended to 5 s after the peak. The dependence of τ on the [fura-2] was well described by a linear relationship according to τ = A +B × [fura-2] (Fig. 1 B;line) with A = 2.5 ± 0.37,B = 4.5 ×10−5 ± 8 × 10−3, and a linear correlation coefficient (Pearson'sr; r p) (38Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in Pascal: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar) of 0.0024. This almost horizontal line indicates that τ was not dependent on the [fura-2]. The relationship between Ar and the [fura-2] was described by the line Ar = C + D × [fura-2] (Fig. 1 C) with C = 1.38 ± 0.027, D = −0.002 ± 0.0006, and r p = −0.67. This means that there was only a small decrease (D = −0.002 ± 0.0006) in amplitude during loading. However, no relationship between Ar and τ was found (Fig. 1 D; horizontal line, τ =E + F × Ar withE = 2.5 ± 2.93, F = 0.0019 ± 2.27, and r p = 0.0024). About 80% of the single melanotrope cells derived from the pituitary gland of X. laevis appear to display spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations (26Scheenen W.J.J.M. Jenks B.G. Roubos E.W. Willems P.H.G.M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, a total of 42 oscillating cells were studied to investigate the detailed nature and origin of the Ca2+ patterns in individual cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM. When recording the [Ca2+]i at a sampling rate of 6 s, smooth oscillations with a fixed frequency and amplitude were observed (e.g. Fig. 2 A). With a much higher temporal resolution of 20 ms, cells showed highly complex Ca2+ oscillation patterns with strong inter- and intracellular differences (Fig. 2, B–D). In most cells (37 of 42), oscillations did not appear smooth but showed stepwise increases, the Ca2+ steps (Fig. 2, B and C). In only a few cases (5 of 42), the oscillations reached the peak amplitude after one discrete rise in the [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 D). Oscillations of different cells not only varied in frequency and relative amplitude but also in the number of steps building up an oscillation, which ranged from 1 (Fig. 2 D) to 17 (Fig. 8 A). Within a given cell, the number of Ca2+ steps building up a Ca2+ oscillation can also vary (Fig. 2 E). Fig. 2 E shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory pattern may not necessarily be determined by the number of steps building up an oscillation. For example, the first and second oscillation shown in Fig. 2 E have the same relative amplitude (Ar= 1.39), whereas in the first oscillation two more steps are required to reach this amplitude. The amplitude of the oscillation displayed in Fig. 2 D is even bigger (Ar = 1.69) than that shown in Fig. 2 E, whereas only one discrete rise in the [Ca2+]i can be observed. Moreover, steps are not only present during the rising phase of an oscillation but also on top of an oscillation (Fig. 2, B and C). The number of steps on top of an oscillation is variable (e.g. Fig. 2 B; first versus second oscillation), and this parameter determines the duration of an oscillation within a given cell. In addition, the average step interval between cells can vary. For example, the step interval calculated from the first 15 steps in Fig. 2 B is 1.88 ± 0.24 s (mean ±S.E.). This is significantly higher (Student's t test; p< 0.0001) than the step interval calculated from the first 15 steps in Fig. 2 C, which is 0.56 ± 0.09 s (mean ± S.E.).Figure 8Kinetics of Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm changes during a Ca2+ oscillation. The velocity of Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm (Vd) was analyzed both during the rising phase and the declining phase of oscillations. A, three oscillations (I, II, and III) containing 27 steps (seenumbers) were used to study Vd. Dotted lines represent the linear fits of the interval [R t,n, R b,n+1] (seepanel B).

Vd,exp is the velocity of Ca2+ removal during the declining phase of oscillations determined using a first order exponential function (see Eq. 1 under “Results”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether fura-2 loading influences the electrical membrane activity, the firing pattern was checked in unloaded melanotropes. Using the cell-attached patch configuration, clear bursts of spontaneous “action currents,” representing action potentials, were observed in unloaded, single melanotropes (Fig. 2 F;n = 6). These bursts were similar to the bursts observed during combined measurements with fura-2-loaded cells (see Fig. 3 A), indicating that loading the cells with fura-2 does not alter the firing behavior. To study the relation between the electrical activity and Ca2+ oscillations of the same cell, electrophysiological measurements were combined with simultaneous measurements of changes in the [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3 A;n = 42). To check for possible pipette-induced changes in the original Ca2+ signal, each combined experiment was preceded by a Ca2+ measurement alone. Fig. 3 Ashows that the bursts of electrical activity are directly related to the Ca2+ oscillations. From looking in detail (Fig. 3 B), it is evident that each action current is accompanied by a discrete rise in the [Ca2+]i. After a burst of action currents, the [Ca2+]i smoothly returns to the basal level. During some measurements, action current firing changed from a bursting mode into continuous firing (Fig. 4 A), resulting in the disappearance of Ca2+ oscillations and a steady high [Ca2+]i. Because this phenomenon was never observed during the Ca2+ measurements preceding the combined measurements, we conclude that these particular changes in the firing pattern could have been induced by the pipette. Therefore, such recordings were discarded. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that even at this high Ca2+ level, the tight relationship between action current firing and the occurrence of Ca2+steps was maintained (Fig. 4 B). To determine the nature of the inward currents, the Na+ channel blocker TTX and the inorganic Ca2+channel blocker Co2+ were added. 1 μm TTX did not have an effect on either action currents or Ca2+oscillations in any of the cells measured (Fig. 5 A; n = 11). On the other hand, applying 2 mm CoCl2 clearly abolished both action currents and Ca2+ oscillations in every cell studied (Fig. 5 B; n = 15). In the complete absence of extracellular Na+ (Na+replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine), no action currents or Ca2+ oscillations were observed (Fig. 6 A; n = 4). Under this Na+-free condition, action currents and a rise in the [Ca2+]i could still be induced by a depolarizing K+ (20 mm) pulse (Fig. 6 A; n = 4). The rise in the [Ca2+]i was clearly built up by a number of Ca2+ steps, each accompanied by an action current (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Effect of extracellular Na+removal, alone or in combination with a depolarizing K+pulse, on action current firing and the [Ca2+]i. Combined measurements of action currents (upper trace) and [Ca2+]ichanges (lower trace) were obtained as in Fig. 3. Na+-free medium (Na+ replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)) was applied to the cells as indicated by the upper horizontal bar in panel A. To depolarize the cell under this Na+-free condition, a 20 mm K+pulse was given, as indicate by the lower horizontal bar in panel A. A, extracellular Na+ removal blocked both action currents (upper trace) and Ca2+ oscillations (lower trace). Under this Na+-free condition, a depolarizing K+ pulse induced action currents and a rise in the [Ca2+]i. B, region indicated in detail showing the action currents and the Ca2+ steps building up the increase in the [Ca2+]i during the high K+ treatment under the Na+-free condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because action current measurements were performed simultaneously with Ca2+ measurements, a link between the shape of an action current and the amplitude of a Ca2+ step could be demonstrated. The upper traceof Fig. 7 A shows the action currents reflecting the Ca2+ steps shown in the lower trace of Fig. 7 A. Whereas the amplitude of the successive action currents decreased, the amplitude of the accompanying Ca2+ steps increased. The relative difference in the ratio values between the start and the top of a Ca2+ step (Ar =R top/R basal); lower trace of Fig. 7 A) was taken as the step amplitude. To determine the amount of charge entering the cell during an action current, the peak areas of the downward action currents were integrated. In Fig. 7 B the peak area of each action current was plotted against the relative amplitude of the Ca2+steps in Fig. 7 A. The peak areas of the three successive action currents increased, and the amplitude of the Ca2+steps increased. A clear linear relation was found between the current peak area and the Ca2+ step size. The calcium removal kinetics have been studied to investigate the role of this removal in shaping the calcium oscillations. The presence of a discontinuous (i.e. stepping) Ca2+ oscillation presents a unique opportunity to analyze the speed of removal of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm"
https://openalex.org/W2005503000,"A gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase has been cloned from Chromobacterium violaceum and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified phenylalanine hydroxylase contains copper, which does not support enzymatic activity. Upon removal of copper by dithiothreitol (DTT), the enzyme contains substoichiometric amounts of calcium and zinc but little or no redox-active metal ions. The copper-depleted hydroxylase catalyzes the phenylalanine-dependent oxidation of 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin (DMPH4) by O2 in a reaction in which phenylalanine is not hydroxylated and does not appear to undergo a chemical change, and hydrogen peroxide is produced. Analogs of phenylalanine also activate the oxidation of DMPH4. Both the copper-phenylalanine hydroxylase and the copper-depleted hydroxylase catalyze the hydroxylation of phenylalanine in the presence of DTT and FeSO4 in a reaction in which hydrogen peroxide is not produced. The apparent values of K m for Fe2+ and DTT are 0.28 μm and 1.1 mm, respectively, at 1.0 mm phenylalanine, 120 μm DMPH4and pH 7.4 and 23 °C. The apparent value of k cat is 14.3 s−1 under these conditions. Glutathione, mercaptoethanol, and dihydrolipoate support the hydroxylation of phenylalanine essentially as well as DTT. Incubation of copper-depleted hydroxylase with FeSO4, phenylalanine, and DTT followed by gel permeation chromatography leads to an iron-hydroxylase containing approximately 1 molecule of iron per molecule of enzyme. The iron-hydroxylase displays an optical absorption band extending from 300 to 600 nm, and it catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine at the same maximum rate as the iron-activated hydroxylase but does not require added Fe2+. We conclude that iron participates in the hydroxylation of phenylalanine. Iron is not required for the oxidation of DMPH4, although it may exert a modest acceleration effect. A hypothetical mechanism is presented wherein the reaction of iron with the putative 4a-hydroperoxy-DMPH4 leads to 4a-hydroxy-DMPH4and a high valent iron-oxy species.

Phenylalanine hydroxylases are tetrahydropterin-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of phenylalanine by dioxygen to produce tyrosine, with the concomitant two-electron oxidation of a tetrahydropterin cofactor. The overall transformations of the cofactor are illustrated in Scheme FS1. A quinonoid form of the dihydropterin can be observed spectrophotometrically as an intermediate but spontaneously undergoes isomerization to the corresponding 7,8-dihydropterin. Recycling of the cofactor between its dihydro- and tetrahydro-forms can be brought about by reducing agents such as DTT (1Shiman R. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1985: 179-249Google Scholar).1 Phenylalanine hydroxylases exist in many species from bacteria to humans and play important roles in aromatic amino acid metabolism. A genetic deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in humans results in phenylketonuria, which is associated with mental retardation during development, as well as behavioral disorders (1Shiman R. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1985: 179-249Google Scholar, 2Goodman B.L. Youdim M.B.H. Aromatic Amino Acid Hydroxylases and Mental Disease. Wiley Interscience, New York1979: 5-79Google Scholar). Phenylalanine hydroxylases purified from mammalian sources are homotetrameric proteins that require iron for activity (3Fisher D.B. Kaufman S.

Chem. 1982; 257: 845-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which iron-containing phenylalanine hydroxylases use dioxygen to hydroxylate an aromatic substrate is not completely understood, despite investigations extending over more than two decades (5Kappock T.J. Caradonna J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2659-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A phenylalanine hydroxylase purified from Chromobacterium violaceum is a monomeric protein that contains approximately one Cu(II)/molecule (6Nakata H. Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1892-1933Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 7Pember S.O. Villafranca J.J. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, copper does not support activity (8Carr R.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14131-14138Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments reveal an overall identity of approximately 22% to the catalytic domains of mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylases (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests similarities in three-dimensional structure. Among the mechanistic questions surrounding this enzyme are whether a redox-active metal center is required for its activity, how the molecular oxygen is activated to form a hydroxylating intermediate, and whether it shares a common mechanism with the mammalian enzymes. We here describe the cloning of a gene encoding a phenylalanine hydroxylase from C. violaceum and the expression of this gene in Escherichia coli. The phenylalanine hydroxylase activity displayed by this enzyme requires iron but not other transition metal ions. The iron-free enzyme catalyzes phenylalanine-dependent oxidation of the tetrahydropterin with concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide but not hydroxylation of the substrate. Thus, the oxidation of DMPH4 can be uncoupled from the hydroxylation of substrates by the exclusion of iron. A mechanism in outline is proposed, in which the reaction of iron with the putative 4a-hydroperoxy-DMPH4 leads to a high valent iron-oxy species and 4a-hydroxy-DMPH4, which undergoes dehydration to DMPH2. The iron-oxy species is postulated to react with phenylalanine in the hydroxylation process. C. violaceum strain ATCC 12540 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HEPES, catalase, and DTT were from Sigma. l-Phenylalanine and DMPH4 were from Fluka. All solutions of buffer and substrates were freed of adventitious metal ions by passage through a column of Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad, 1.5 × 20 cm) and storage in disposable plastic containers. The solutions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy to verify the absence of transition metal ions. Distilled water was further purified by use of a NANOpure (Barnstead) ultrapure water system. Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes used in cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis were from commercial sources as indicated. All other chemicals were analytical reagent or molecular biology grade from commercial suppliers. Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-ACAGGTACCGGATGCAGGTCGAAGCCG-3′ and 5′-GCGTTAAGCTTCCTATGCGAGGCTATG-3′, were synthesized based on the deoxynucleotide sequences flanking the coding region of theC. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase gene described previously (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these primers was designed to have a restriction endonuclease site (KpnI or HindIII, respectively, as indicated by the underlined sequences) at the 5′-primer end to facilitate cloning. C. violaceum genomic DNA was isolated and purified as described (10Schleif R.F. Wensink P.C. Practical Methods in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1981: 98-99Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out by the method of Saiki et al. (11Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Hijuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (13540) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The amplification reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 0.5 μg of genomic DNA template, 50 pmol each of the two primers, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.2 mm each of the four dNTPs, 50 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Twenty-eight PCR cycles (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) were performed using a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermocycler. A portion of the reaction mixture was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Candidate products were purified using a Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.), digested with endonucleases KpnI and HindIII (Promega), and cloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites in plasmid vector pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene) using standard procedures (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The correctly amplified DNA fragments from several clones containing the gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). To express the cloned phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, the amplifiedKpnI/HindIII DNA fragment was subcloned behind the hybrid tac promoter (14Amman E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) in an expression vector construction described by Chen and Swenson (15Chen D. Swenson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32120-32130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. colistrains transformed with the expression vector were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in the absence or presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Expression of the recombinant phenylalanine hydroxylase was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207852) Google Scholar). Purification of phenylalanine hydroxylase to homogeneity was accomplished essentially by the published procedure, with minor modifications (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most significant changes were that E. coli cells were lysed by a single passage of the sample through a French pressure cell at 12,000–15,000 p.s.i. instead of by treatment with detergent and lysozyme. The DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was eluted with a linear gradient formed with 500 ml of 50 mmsodium acetate buffer at pH 6.0 containing 20 mm NaCl and 500 ml of the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, instead of by the gradient originally described. The purified enzyme was stored at −70 °C after being frozen in liquid nitrogen. Enzyme preparations were analyzed for metal content by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (Soil Sciences Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison). All components of assay mixtures were also assayed to verify the absence of adventitious metal contaminants. Copper was removed from the enzyme by several concentration/dilution cycles of the holoprotein in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon) with 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 100 mmDTT. Gel filtration chromatography to remove the excess DTT was carried out as described (8Carr R.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14131-14138Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purity of phenylalanine hydroxylase was judged by inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained gels from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Routine measurements of the concentrations of phenylalanine hydroxylase solutions were determined by use of the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The value of ε280 for C. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase was calculated from measurements of A 280 on several enzyme preparations and the molar enzyme concentrations of these solutions calculated from amino acid compositions as deduced from the DNA nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene. The value of ε280 was found to be 6.1 × 104m−1 cm−1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant C. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase was determined at the Macromolecular Structure Facility at Michigan State University. The overall molecular weight of the purified recombinant phenylalanine hydroxylase was measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to an accuracy of ± 0.01% at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The phenylalanine-dependent DMPH4 dehydrogenation activity was measured by monitoring the ΔA 347with time. Rates were calculated based on the value of ε347 = 3600 m−1cm−1 (8Carr R.T. Benkovic S.J.

The reaction mixtures contained 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.5 μm copper-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylase, 120 μm DMPH4 and phenylalanine at various concentrations at 23 °C. Hydrogen peroxide formation in DMPH4 dehydrogenation assays was measured by the horseradish peroxidase-dependent oxidation of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol (18Guibault G.G. Kramer D.M. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 2495-2500Google Scholar). Assays for tyrosine production were conducted by spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. In the spectrophotometric method, the increase in A 275 because of tyrosine formation was measured continuously in reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.5 μm phenylalanine hydroxylase, 6.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm phenylalanine, 120 μm DMPH4, and FeSO4 at various concentrations at 23 °C. The rates were calculated assuming the value of ε275 = 1700 m−1cm−1 as described (7Pember S.O. Villafranca J.J. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the spectrophotometric assays, the absorbance changes were measured using Hewlett-Packard model 8452A diode array spectrophotometer, equipped with a thermostatically controlled cuvette holder. In the HPLC method, tyrosine formation was observed by timed point assays in reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.5 μm phenylalanine hydroxylase, 1.0 mm phenylalanine, and 120 μmDMPH4 in the absence or presence of 6.0 mm DTT and/or 1.0 μm FeSO4 at 23 °C. Timed aliquots were analyzed for tyrosine with a 0.21 × 25 cm C-18 reverse phase HPLC column eluted isocratically, using 80% acetonitrile and 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 6.4 containing 2.58 mm triethylamine. Dioxygen consumption was measured using a model 53 oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) calibrated with protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The reaction mixtures consisted of 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.5 μmphenylalanine hydroxylase, 1.0 mm phenylalanine, and 120 μm DMPH4 at 23 °C in the DMPH4oxidation reaction, that is, in DMPH4 oxidation uncoupled from phenylalanine hydroxylation. Dioxygen consumption in phenylalanine hydroxylation was measured in reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 0.5 μm phenylalanine hydroxylase, 6.0 mm DTT, 120 μmDMPH4, and various concentrations of phenylalanine and FeSO4 at 23 °C. Reconstitution of phenylalanine hydroxylase with iron was carried out by incubating the metal-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylase with a stoichiometric excess of FeSO4 in the presence ofl-phenylalanine and DTT in 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and 0 °C for 30 min, followed by gel filtration chromatography to remove excess ligands. The reconstituted protein was then concentrated at 4 °C in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). Iron-containing phenylalanine hydroxylase with high activity was also obtained by adding FeSO4 to the cell extract during the purification of the enzyme. A 1.2-kilobase DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from C. violaceum genomic DNA using the two oligonucleotide primers described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that this fragment contained an open reading frame that was similar to that reported to encode phenylalanine hydroxylase in this organism (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both strands of the fragment were sequenced, and 7-deaza-dGTP and dITP were used to expand GC-compressed regions. The nucleotide sequence within the open reading frame was found to be identical to that previously reported (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from positions 1–690. The analysis revealed the presence of a C at position 691, a G at position 692, and a C at position 1000, which were absent from the published sequence. (A postulated insertion of G at position 701 (19Zhao G. Xia T. Song J. Jensen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was not confirmed by the present analysis.) These differences result in an altered amino acid sequence between residues 171 and 274, as compared with the published sequence (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The newly isolated gene contains an 894-base pair open reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 297 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide is 33613.4 Da. The codon usage is uniform throughout the gene and displays a preference for G or C at the third base; 90.2% of the codons contain one of these bases at the third position. More than 90% of the amino acids of the C. violaceum hydroxylase are encoded by only 31 codons because of this biased codon selection. The translated amino acid sequence of the gene described here is homologous with those of the liver and Pseudomonas aeruginosa phenylalanine hydroxylases. Homology between theC. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase and the catalytic domains of mammalian enzymes is shown in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequence of theC. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase described earlier was 22% identical with the catalytic domain of the human enzyme; however, the aligned sequence for the present C. violaceum enzyme is 31% identical to that of the human enzyme (Fig. 1). When conservative amino acid replacements are considered, the amino acid sequence similarities between the latter two phenylalanine hydroxylases is extended to 54%. There are no homologies between the C. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase and the mammalian enzymes in the C-terminal ends because the C-terminal domains of the mammalian enzymes are mainly involved in forming the tetramerization domains of the proteins, whereas the bacterial enzymes are monomeric. The amino acid sequence of the C. violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase described herein is 45% identical with that of the P. aeruginosa enzyme. The amplified gene was placed behind the hybrid tac promoter of an expression vector for E. coli. Among several E. coli strains transformed, high level expression was observed in strain DH5α without induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The expressed phenylalanine hydroxylase was purified to homogeneity essentially by the published procedure (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 15 mg of purified enzyme was obtained per liter of cell culture grown to stationary phase. Evidence that the purified protein is the cloned C. violaceumphenylalanine hydroxylase is based on N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and the molecular mass of the purified protein determined at high resolution. The N-terminal sequence was found to be NDRADFV, which was in agreement with the sequence translated from the nucleotide sequence of the gene except for the absence of N-terminal methionine. Apparently the methionine was removed in a post-translational modification, perhaps by the methionine-specific aminopeptidase of E. coli (20Vogt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4760-4769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the recombinant phenylalanine hydroxylase was found by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 33487.7 ± 1.7 and 33,482.9 ± 1.6 Da in two determinations on samples that had been prepared to remove metal ions. These values are virtually identical and agree very well with the molecular mass calculated based on the cloned DNA nucleotide sequence (33613.4), after subtracting the mass of the N-terminal methionine (131.2 Da). The measured mass is not in agreement with that of the polypeptide encoded by the gene originally described (9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18454-18459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of the purified recombinant phenylalanine hydroxylase by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, shown in Table I, indicated the presence of copper and zinc as reported for the enzyme described previously. An approximate 1:1 stoichiometry of (copper + zinc):hydroxylase was consistently observed when CuSO4 was added to the cell extract at an early stage of purification. The copper bound to the enzyme could be removed by extraction with DTT, followed by removal of excess DTT by gel filtration chromatography, as described previously. The copper-depleted hydroxylase contains calcium and zinc but few redox-active divalent metal ions (Table I). Zinc-free phenylalanine hydroxylase can be prepared by incubating the protein with excess CuSO4 to replace zinc with copper and then removing the copper by DTT extraction. These observations are consistent with previous reports on phenylalanine hydroxylase from C. violaceum (7Pember S.O. Villafranca J.J. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Onishi A Liotta L.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma emission and are quoted as mol%. Copper was removed by extraction with DTT followed by gel permeation chromatography. Phenylalanine hydroxylase was reconstituted by incubating copper-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylase with FeSO4, phenylalanine, and DTT, followed by gel permeation chromatography. The copper-depleted hydroxylase catalyzes the phenylalanine-dependent oxidation of DMPH4 by O2 in reaction mixtures containing 90–100 mm HEPES buffer, copper-depleted hydroxylase, DMPH4, and phenylalanine. Although the phenylalanine requirement was absolute, as shown in Fig. 2, no tyrosine formation could be detected by the spectrophotometric or HPLC assays for tyrosine. Absorbance changes during the course of the reaction were consistent with the formation of DMPH2 but not tyrosine, as shown in Fig. 3. If tyrosine had been produced, the absorbance increase at 275 nm would have been much greater. The phenylalanine analogs 3-cyclohexyl-l-alanine andd-phenylalanine also promoted the oxidation of DMPH4 under the same conditions but with decreased effectiveness. Neither l-phenylalanine nor either of the analogs appeared to undergo a chemical change in connection with the oxidation of DMPH4, as judged from their unchanged reverse phase HPLC chromatographic behavior. One mole of O2 was consumed for each mole of DMPH4 oxidized in these uncoupled DMPH4 oxidations. The kinetic parameters derived from the data in Fig. 2 are K mapp = 2.29 ± 0.74 mm and k catapp = 0.96 ± 0.30 s−1. Under the same conditions, assays by O2consumption yielded values of K mapp = 2.63 ± 0.98 mm and k catapp= 1.05 ± 0.38 s−1.Figure 3Spectrophotometric changes accompanying the phenylalanine-dependent oxidation of DMPH4 by copper-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylase. The reaction conditions are the same as those in Fig. 2 with 3.3 mm phenylalanine. Shown are the difference spectra between that of 120 μmDMPH4 and the spectra generated during the course of the reaction. The increases in absorbance at 275 and 335 nm and the decrease at 300 nm are indicative of the formation of DMPH2directly from DMPH4 by oxidation. No spectral evidence for the intermediate formation of 4a-hydroxy-DMPH4 is apparent in these spectra. HPLC assays for tyrosine and phenylalanine showed no consumption of phenylalanine and no production of tyrosine during the oxidation of DMPH4 to DMPH2. However, phenylalanine-dependent H2O2formation was detected when similar reaction mixtures were assayed using horseradish peroxidase and 4-methoxy-1-naphthol (Table II).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydrogen peroxide was detected as a product of tetrahydropterin oxidation by copper-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylase when reaction mixtures lacking ferrous ion were assayed by use of the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol. Typical data are given in Table II, which shows that hydrogen peroxide formation is maximal in the absence of ferrous ions and DTT. It will be shown in a later section that the hydroxylation of phenylalanine requires ferrous iron and DTT, which presumably couple the oxidation of DMPH4 by dioxygen to the hydroxylation of substrates. Experiment 1 was a complete hydroxylation reaction in which no H2O2 was produced. In Experiment 2 only enzyme and phenylalanine were present, and no H2O2 was produced. In Experiment 3 the exclusion of enzyme, DTT, and ferrous iron led to significant H2O2 production, because of nonenzymatic oxidation of DMPH4. In Experiment 4 the exclusion of phenylalanine, DTT, and ferrous iron resulted in a small amount of H2O2, less than the nonenzymatic control (Experiment 3), indicating that phenylalanine hydroxylase partially protected DMPH4 from nonenzymatic oxidation. The most H2O2 was produced in Experiment 5, which included enzyme, phenylalanine, and DMPH4, as well as O2 from the air. These were the components for the uncoupled enzymatic oxidation of DMPH4.Table IIHydrogen peroxide production in uncoupled oxidation of DMPH4 by copper-depleted phenylalanine hydroxylaseExperimentReaction mixtureH2O2measurednmol1Complete0.02−DMPH4, DTT, Fe2+0.03−Hydroxylase, DTT, Fe2+154−Phe, DTT, Fe2+6.45−DTT, Fe2+79Hydrogen peroxide production was measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm by the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol (18Guibault G.G.

https://openalex.org/W2100834630,"We have recently cloned a cDNA encoding an embryonic stem cell transcriptional coactivator termed UTF1 from the mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cell line (Okuda, A., Fukushima, A., Nishimoto, M., Orimo, A., Yamagishi, T., Nabeshima, Y., Kuro-o, M., Nabeshima, Y., Boon, K., Keaveney, M., Stunnenberg, H.G., and Muramatsu, M. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2019–2032). Here we have cloned a cDNA for human UTF1 and identified two highly conserved domains termed conserved domain (CD)1 and CD2. Human UTF1, like that of mouse, binds to ATF-2 and the mutagenesis analyses reveal that the leucine zipper motif within the CD2 of the UTF1 and metal binding motif of ATF-2 are involved in this interaction. The factor also binds to TATA-binding protein containing complex. By means of immunoprecipitation analysis, we mapped two domains which are independently able to bind to the complex. Importantly, both domains are located within the conserved domains (one in CD1 and the other in CD2). Furthermore, transient transfection analyses point out the importance of these domains for activating ATF-2. Thus, these results suggest that these two conserved domains identified here play important roles in activating specific transcription at least in part by supporting physical interaction between the upstream factor, ATF-2, and basal transcription machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1966893500,"Although ligand binding in c-type cytochromes is not directly related to their physiological function, it has the potential to provide valuable information on protein stability and dynamics, particularly in the region of the methionine sixth heme ligand and the nearby peptide chain that has been implicated in electron transfer. Thus, we have measured the equilibrium and kinetics of binding of imidazole to eight mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c 2 that differ in overall protein stability. We found that imidazole binding affinity varies 70-fold, but does not correlate with overall protein stability. Instead, each mutant exerts an effect at the local level, with the largest change due to mutant G95E (glycine substituted by glutamate), which shows 30-fold stronger binding as compared with the wild-type protein. The kinetics of imidazole binding are monophasic and reach saturation at high ligand concentrations for all the mutants and wild-type protein, which is attributed to a rate-limiting conformational change leading to breakage of the iron–methionine bond and providing a binding site for imidazole. The mutants show as much as an 18-fold variation in the first-order rate constant for the conformational change, with the largest effect found with mutant G95E. The kinetics also show a lack of correlation with overall protein stability, but are consistent with localized effects on the dynamics of hinge region 88–102 of the protein, which changes conformation to permit ligand binding. These results are consistent with R. capsulatus cytochrome c 2 stabilizing the complex through hydrogen bonding to the imidazole. The larger effects of mutant G95E on equilibrium and kinetics are likely to be due to its location within the hinge region adjacent to heme ligand methionine 96, which is displaced by imidazole.

In a preceding study, 1C. Dumortier, T. E. Meyer, and M. A. Cusanovich, submitted for publication. 1C. Dumortier, T. E. Meyer, and M. A. Cusanovich, submitted for publication. a detailed equilibrium and kinetic analysis of the binding of imidazole to the oxidized form of horse mitochondrial cytochrome c and two c 2-type cytochromes from the purple phototrophic bacteria (Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides) was performed. Thec 2-type cytochromes bind imidazole (K a = 1440 ± 40 m−1) 50 times more strongly than does horse cytochrome c(K a = 30 ± 1 m−1). The kinetics of imidazole binding are consistent with a change in the rate-limiting step at high ligand concentrations for all three proteins. This is attributed to a conformational change (occurring with a rate constant of ∼35 ± 10 s−1) leading to a breakage of the iron–methionine bond and providing a binding site for imidazole as previously proposed for horse cytochrome c (2Sutin N. Yandell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6932-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also proposed that the rate-limiting conformational change is a consequence of a movement of peptide region 88–102 (R. capsulatus numbering), which we have termed the hinge region based upon the crystal structure of the R. sphaeroides cytochromec 2-imidazole complex (3Axelrod H.L. Feher G. Allen J.P. Chirino A.J. Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 596-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that a critical element in the substantially higher affinity of cytochrome c 2 for imidazole as compared with mitochondrial cytochrome c is a hydrogen bond between the bound imidazole N3H, an internal water, and the Phe-102 backbone carbonyl as shown in the crystal structure (3Axelrod H.L. Feher G. Allen J.P. Chirino A.J. Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 596-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, horse cytochrome c is much more stable to guanidine denaturation than are the c 2-type cytochromes, and at least some of the difference in imidazole binding may be related to the disparity in overall protein stability. We have also shown that the imidazole binding properties of R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides c 2-type cytochromes are almost identical. These properties, coupled with their amino acid sequence homology in the hinge region and overall structural homology of the native proteins, suggest that the R. sphaeroides cytochromec 2-imidazole complex structure (3Axelrod H.L. Feher G. Allen J.P. Chirino A.J. Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 596-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a reasonable model for that of R. capsulatus cytochromec 2, for which there is no structure of the imidazole complex. Although there is no direct evidence for a role of the movement of the “hinge region” in electron transfer, this structural region has been implicated in binding to reaction partners (13Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.C. Mclendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein dynamic processes have recently become a focus of protein chemistry as efforts to understand folding pathways and stability have expanded. Ligand binding by cytochromec 2 provides an opportunity to investigate in real time an intrinsic property of a naturally occurring dynamic system. We have now studied the equilibrium and kinetics of imidazole binding to a variety of R. capsulatus cytochromec 2 mutants that differ in overall stability to guanidine denaturation. Fig. 1 presents a stereo view of the R. sphaeroides cytochromec 2-imidazole complex and a similar view of R. capsulatus ferrocytochrome c 2, with the amino acid side chains that have been mutated shown in boldface (see below). For the purpose of the studies reported here, we are utilizing mutations at positions that are highly conserved among the c-type cytochromes and one mutation that is located in the hinge region. Thus, we are reporting mutations at Gly-34, Pro-35, Ile-57, Trp-67, Tyr-75, and Gly-95, which correspond to positions 29, 30, 52, 59, 67, and 79, respectively, in mitochondrial cytochromec. Finally, we have inserted a valine between positions 10 and 11 in R. capsulatus cytochromec 2. The amino acid at this position in the mitochondrial c-type cytochromes has been deleted in R. capsulatus cytochrome c 2. Comparison of the ligand binding properties of the mutants with those of the wild-type protein provide information on the role of overall protein stability in the movement of the hinge region and on more localized factors, which influence the immediate heme environment and electronic properties. Wild-type and mutant R. capsulatus c 2-type cytochromes were prepared as described previously (4Caffrey M.S. Daldal F. Holden H.M. Cusanovich M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4119-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The spectral properties of the mutants including visible extinction coefficients were, within experimental error, the same as the wild-type protein. With some mutants, small changes in absorbance were observed in the near-IR (600–700 nm), where absorbance due to high spin species (620–640 nm) and the 695 nm charge transfer band are present. Unfortunately, this spectral region is complex, and the extinction coefficients are small and not easy to interpret. The G95E mutant shows larger spectral changes in the near-IR apparently connected with a substantial amount of high spin species present, although both the 695 nm species and the envelope are also changing. This makes it difficult to quantify. The equilibrium binding of imidazole was studied by measuring the peak-to-trough difference in amplitude due to the increase in absorbance at 405 nm and the decrease in absorbance at 417 nm as described previously.1 The kinetics were followed at 417 nm. All experiments were carried out in 100 mm Tris cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with sodium chloride to maintain a constant ionic strength. All solutions contained 100 μm potassium ferricyanide to maintain the cytochromec 2 in its oxidized state. Equilibrium titrations and kinetic experiments were carried out at 500 mm ionic strength to allow the use of a wide range of concentrations of imidazole, which is also ionized at pH 7 and contributes substantially to the ionic strength. Equilibrium and kinetic data were analyzed relative to Equation 1 as described previously,1 cyto ⇄k21k12 cyto*+[IMID0]⇄k32k23 cyto*−IMID0(Eq. 1) where cyto is the native closed form that is not reactive with imidazole and cyto* is the open form of cytochrome that binds imidazole. For kinetic analysis, both a steady-state approach (2Sutin N. Yandell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6932-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a transient kinetic approach1 were used. All equilibrium constants and second-order rate constants are given in terms of concentration of unprotonated imidazole ([IMID0]) present at the pH used. A pK of 7.0 was used for imidazole. Overall protein stability was measured by guanidine denaturation followed by the change in the circular dichroism signal at 220 nm. The guanidine concentration at the midpoint of denaturation (C M) was used to compare the mutants with the wild-type protein. The free energy of denaturation (ΔG*u) was obtained by multiplying theC M values by the average slope (3.18) obtained from the log plots for the mutants and wild-type protein (5Knapp J.A. Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1289-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The differences in ΔG*u values for mutants relative to the wild-type protein were designated ΔΔG u. The convention used is that a positive value of ΔΔG reflects a decreased stability relative to the wild-type protein and that a negative value reflects an increased stability (see Ref. 6Caffrey M.S. Cusanovich M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar for further discussion). From our previous work comparing horse cytochrome c and R. capsulatuscytochrome c 2,1 it is possible that the difference in imidazole binding affinity may be related in part to overall protein stability (i.e. increased stability may result in decreased affinity for imidazole and vice versa). Therefore, we measured imidazole binding for eight R. capsulatus cytochrome c 2 mutants that differ in overall protein stability. Fig. 2 A gives the difference absorbance spectra at different concentrations of imidazole that were obtained for mutant P35A (these results are typical of the wild-type protein and all mutants except G95E) (Fig. 3). The data were analyzed to obtain the overall apparent binding constant (K a(app)), and the results are plotted in Fig. 2 B. The values of K a(app) determined for the wild-type protein and all eight mutants are given in Table I. The overall affinities of the eight mutants for imidazole varied from 630 to 44,400m−1, which are all substantially larger than for horse cytochrome c (30 m−1) (2Sutin N. Yandell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6932-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Titration of mutant G95E (10 μm) with imidazole (concentration range of 0.003–0.63 mm) at pH 7 and 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. We found no correlation between mutant affinity for imidazole and protein stability. If ΔΔGK app is plotted against ΔΔG*u, six of the mutants show a qualitative relationship between increasing affinity and decreasing overall stability (Fig. 4). These include P35A, P35T, G34S, W67Y, G95E, and I57N. The two mutants that are stabilized relative to the wild-type protein (Y75F and 10V11) clearly do not correlate. However, Y75F does have a decreased affinity for imidazole, which would be expected from a qualitative relationship to stability. Taken together, it would appear that global destabilization does not correlate with imidazole affinity, and as a consequence, local effects dominate. This is not unreasonable since the conformational change that leads to imidazole binding involves a segment of peptide chain (amino acids 88–102) that is not involved in regular secondary structure (which is what is measured by circular dichroism at 220 nm during guanidine denaturation) and is not necessarily directly influenced by mutations distant from the hinge region. Mutant G95E has the largest affinity of any of the mutants or the wild-type protein (30-fold more than the wild-type protein). Given its location in the proposed hinge region, this is not surprising in itself. However, G95E also has difference spectra that are strongly perturbed relative to the wild-type protein and the other mutants (Fig. 3). Thus, what appears to be a relatively benign mutation (because it is at a position that is not conserved among the c-type cytochromes) results in a significant perturbation of the heme electronic structure. As glycine is the only amino acid without a side chain, it may in some cases adopt dihedral angles not allowed by the others and thus would be particularly sensitive to mutation. However, Gly-95 has normal φ-ψ angles (9Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Caffrey M.S. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that mutation at this position will not have direct structural effects on the peptide backbone. It is more likely that the glutamate in G95E interacts unfavorably with the front heme propionate, forcing the peptide chain in the hinge region into a less stable conformation (see below). The binding of imidazole to cytochromes occurs in two steps, a protein rearrangement involving breakage of the iron–methionine bond followed by binding of imidazole to the iron (Equation 1). Moreover, the alkaline pK 695 supposedly measures the strength of the iron–methionine bond. Two of the mutants, W67Y and I57N, have a significantly lower pK 695 than the wild-type protein and thus may show differences in imidazole binding at pH values above 7 but below pH 10, where lysines and tyrosines begin to deprotonate. Therefore, the affinities of wild-type cytochromec 2 and mutant W67Y for imidazole were determined over the pH range 7–10 at a constant ionic strength (500 mm). For the wild-type protein, the difference absorbance spectrum was altered at pH 10, but the affinity only decreased by a factor of 2 (K a(app) = 710 ± 30m−1) between pH 7 and 10. In contrast, for mutant W67Y, the onset of the spectral change was observed at pH 9, and the apparent affinity had changed dramatically (from 630 ± 20m−1 at pH 7 to 40 ± 0.6m−1 at pH 10). These observations are consistent with the 1 pH unit shift to a lower value in the pK for disappearance of the 695 nm absorbance band in the W67Y mutant. Thus, at high pH, there is a conformational change that results in a 16-fold decrease of the global affinity for imidazole, which qualitatively is related to the alkaline pK 695 in W67Y. However, we expected the affinity for imidazole to increase at high pH, corresponding to the loss of the methionine ligand and the increased availability of the sixth coordination position. If the methionine is replaced by another strong field ligand from the protein as expected from the literature (7Ferrer J.C. Guillemette J.G. Bogumil R. Inglis S.C. Smith M. Mauk A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7507-7508Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), then the affinity for that ligand must be stronger than that for imidazole. In any case, there is no apparent correlation between imidazole affinity at pH 7 and the pK 695 among the mutants studied (see Table I). Thus, structural or dynamic changes resulting in perturbation of the 695 nm band are not directly related to the dynamic equilibrium in the hinge region. Consistent with the results with cytochrome c 2, it was shown (8Schejter A. Aviram I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that there is no pH dependence of the K a(app) of horse ferricytochrome c for imidazole between pH 6 and 8,i.e. below the pK 695. The lack of correlation between imidazole binding affinity and either overall protein stability or the pK 695 suggests that each mutation has local effects that do not directly reflect the more global properties. Alternatively,K a(app)(K a(app) =K 1 K 2/(1 +K 1)) may need to be resolved into the two equilibria (described by Equation 1) and the corresponding kinetic parameters to accurately interpret the impact of mutation,i.e. the two equilibria could be affected differently by mutation. Therefore, we have analyzed the stopped-flow kinetics of the reaction of imidazole with the wild-type and mutant cytochromes to determine whether there is any correlation between the kinetic rate constants and either of the global stability measurements,C M and pK 695. The kinetics of the reaction of the mutants of R. capsulatus cytochromec 2 with imidazole at pH 7 are monophasic at all ligand concentrations. A typical profile of the kinetics of the binding of imidazole (25 mm) to mutant P35A (20 μm) at 25 °C is shown in Fig. 5. Plots of k obs versus ligand concentration are nonlinear and demonstrate a change in the rate-limiting step at high ligand concentrations as shown in Fig. 6. Analysis of the kinetic data can be according either to the steady-state approximation (2Sutin N. Yandell J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6932-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to the explicit solution.1 From the steady-state analysis,k 12, k 32, and the ratiok 23/k 21 can be obtained and are given in Table II. The explicit solution (termed the transient kinetic analysis) yields the same parameters, and the resulting rate constants are also given in Table II. The agreement between the two methods was excellent, indicating that the steady-state approximation is appropriate for these reactions.Figure 6Concentration dependence of the observed rate constant for the binding of imidazole to wild-type cytochromec 2 (WT) and mutants P35A, P35T, and W67Y (A) and I57N, 10V11, G34S, and Y57N (B).

Open table in a new tab SS, steady-state approach; TK, transient kinetic approach. The limiting rate constant k 12 measures the breakage of the iron–methionine bond and rearrangement to the open form of the protein that is primed to bind imidazole. As was the case with the imidazole equilibrium affinity constant, there is no apparent correlation between the rate constant for rearrangement and overall protein stability or pK 695. For example, mutant 10V11 rearranges with a larger rate constant than the wild-type protein, yet it is substantially more stable to denaturation. Mutant G95E rearranges more rapidly than any other mutant, but is only moderately less stable, and mutant W67Y rearranges with a smaller rate constant than the wild-type protein, although it is much less stable than the others. Qualitatively, I57N, P35T, P35A, and G34S behave more or less as expected from their decreased stabilities (Table I) and have substantially increased rate constants for opening (k 12) (Table II). Mutant Y75F has a significantly higher pK 695 and overall stability than the wild-type protein and rearranges only slightly more slowly. Thus, we must conclude that local effects control the kinetics of rearrangement (k 12) as well as the overall equilibrium for imidazole binding as discussed above. The second rate constant obtained from data analysis (k 32) measures the breakage of the imidazole–iron bond (or a rate-limiting step leading to bond breakage). The value of k 32 varies <3-fold among the mutants studied, and it is not perturbed significantly relative to the wild-type protein. This suggests that the electronic properties of the heme in the mutants are very similar to those of the wild-type protein and that stabilization of the imidazole-iron complex is not significantly altered by the mutations studied. These results are consistent with the presence of a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the imidazole in all of the mutants as well as in the wild-type protein.1 The steady-state and transient kinetic approaches do not provide precise values of k 21 and k 23, but rather the ratiok 23/k 21. The individual rate constants are not known with precision as a consequence of the fact that a range of values for both k 23 and k 21 is found that yields generally similar least-squares errors from the fits as long as the ratiok 23/k 21 is similar to the value given in Table II. This is unfortunate in that it prohibits calculation of K 1 and K 2with any precision. However, we know that the amount of the open form (presumably high spin heme) in the wild-type protein must be small at equilibrium. A variety of physical-chemical measurements including NMR, redox titrations, and the near-IR absorption spectra between 600 and 700 nm are all consistent with a predominantly low spin heme protein. Nevertheless, it is clear thatk 23/k 21 can vary over a significant range for the mutants (0.7–4.4) (Table II), suggesting large changes in k 23 ork 21 or both. This leaves open the possibility that detectable amounts of the open form could be present in the mutants. As shown in Fig. 7, for P35T, 10V11, and I57N, there appear to be small increases in absorbance in the 600–650 nm region, where high spin heme would be expected to absorb. This suggests K 1 values significantly higher than for the wild-type protein. Unfortunately, in the absence of a well developed understanding of small absorption bands in the 600–650 nm region of low spin c-type cytochromes, a quantitative analysis is not possible. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, the G95E difference spectrum is substantially altered relative to the wild-type protein and the other mutants, demonstrating both a significant perturbation of the heme electronic structure and an increase in the amount of high spin heme as compared with the other mutants and the wild-type protein (Fig. 7). Proline at position 35 or its structurally equivalent position is absolutely conserved in cytochromes c and c 2. This is presumably a consequence of the Pro-35–His-17 hydrogen bond. NMR studies on the R. capsulatus wild-type protein and P35A suggest that although the overall structures of the two proteins are generally similar, there are significant dynamic differences (10Gooley P.R. Caffrey M.S. Cusanovich M.A. MacKenzie N.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Gooley P.R. Caffrey M.S. Cusanovich M.A. MacKenzie N.E.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Notable are the increased flip rates of Phe-51 and Tyr-53, which are in the structural region of Pro-35 in the folded protein, and the increased exchange rates for N1H of His-17 and NH of Gly-34 in the P35A mutant. NH exchange rates also increase for residues 16, 18, 20, 37, 43, 45–46, and 58, all structurally proximal to the site of mutation. Based on both the chemical shift data for the oxidized protein 2D. Zhao, M. A. Cusanovich, and N. E. MacKenzie, unpublished data. and exchange rates, there is no evidence from the NMR studies for perturbation in the previously identified hinge region (amino acids 88–102). The apparent imidazole affinities for P35A and P35T are only slightly different as compared with each other and to the wild-type protein. Moreover,k 12 and k 32 are essentially identical for P35A and P35T, and k 32is not significantly different compared with the wild-type protein. However, k 12 is substantially increased in the two proline mutants (3-fold) relative to the wild-type protein, suggesting that the hinge region is moving between the open and closed forms at a substantially increased rate compared with the wild-type protein, consistent with destabilization of the hinge propagated from the mutation site. Glycine at position 34 or its structurally equivalent position in thec-type cytochromes has been conserved throughout evolution. Adjacent to proline 35, glycine 34 is generally believed to be critical to the maintenance of the protein structure that positions and orients the ligated histidine. The hydrogen bond between the Gly-34 amide NH and the Cys-16 carbonyl may be an important factor relating to this functional role. Based on the NMR chemical shifts,2oxidized G34S is perturbed in a similar fashion to that observed for P35A relative to the wild-type protein. However, there are chemical shifts in region 95–105 in G34S that are not observed in P35A. Thus, it appears that perturbations at positions 34 and 35, resulting from mutation, can be propagated to the hinge region, leading to generally similar increases in k 12. Given the differences in NMR properties (G34S versus P35A) discussed above and the spectral perturbations given in Fig. 7, it appears that the pathways or mechanisms for propagation are somewhat different, but yield generally similar outcomes. Trp-67 is highly conserved among the c-type cytochromes and provides a hydrogen bond between the tryptophan N1H and the rear propionate in the reduced state (9Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Caffrey M.S. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutation of position 67 to tyrosine leads to a global destabilization of 2.2 kcal/mol (Table I). It appears that the tyrosine substitution still permits the propionate hydrogen bond (based upon a low resolution crystal structure). 3M. M. Benning and H. M. Holden, unpublished data. Moreover, the difference in free energy between tryptophan and tyrosine, when transferred from a hydrophobic medium to water, predicts a destabilization of 2.2 kcal/mol and accounts for the difference in guanidine stability between W67Y and the wild-type protein. Despite a net destabilization in W67Y, k 12 is decreased, suggesting a stabilization of the hinge region relative to the wild-type protein. Tyrosine has greater hydrogen bonding capability than does tryptophan, and it is possible that it strengthens the hydrogen bond network involving Thr-94 and Tyr-75 (see below). In the context of the mutants described up to this point, Y75F is unique in that the mutation leads to an overall stabilization of the oxidized form relative to the wild-type protein. However, this is counterintuitive since the more hydrophobic side chain would be expected to destabilize the oxidized form of the protein due to the uncompensated positive charge on the heme. In the reduced wild-type cytochrome, Tyr-75 is involved in a hydrogen bond network that includes Met-96, a bound water molecule, Thr-94, and the front heme propionate, which would be expected to be substantially altered by substitution of tyrosine by phenylalanine in the Y75F mutant (9Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Caffrey M.S. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In yeast cytochromec, the structure of the Y67F equivalent of the Y75F mutant of R. capsulatus shows that there is an additional water molecule present that participates in the hydrogen bond network and takes the place of the Tyr-67 hydroxyl (13Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.C. Mclendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that Tyr-75 interacts with two hinge residues (Thr-94 and Met-96) and that mutant Y75F has similar imidazole binding characteristics as the wild-type protein, it is reasonable to expect maintenance of the hydrogen bond network in R. capsulatus due to insertion of a water molecule in Y75F by analogy to yeast. Despite the fact that the pK 695 is substantially increased, the effects of the mutation on imid-azole binding are relatively small, with a decrease in the k 23/k 21ratio that is in large part compensated for by a decrease in k 32. It appears reasonable that in terms of the increase in overall stability, the dissociation rate constant (k 32) is also decreased. Mutant 10V11 involves an insertion between the N-terminal helix and the heme-binding site. There is no available structural information, but the insertion could cause a small bulge or a more dramatic rotation in the N-terminal helix, altering the interactions between the N-terminal helix and adjacent structural elements. Major rearrangements on the C-terminal side of the insertion are not likely because of the thioether bond between Cys-13 and the heme. Any interactions that are disrupted by the 10V11 insertion are apparently compensated for by new interactions with the hydrophobic side chain. However, the site of the insertion is spatially very close to the C terminus of the hinge region, and Lys-102 apparently forms a salt bridge (3.8 Å) with Glu-9. If the helix is rotated as a result of mutation, then this salt bridge could be disrupted. Lys-12 is also apparently salt-bridged to Glu-9 (3.2 Å), and movement of Lys-12 as a result of the insertion could disrupt this interaction as well. The increased affinity for imidazole by 10V11 is the consequence of an increase in k 12 and a decrease in k 32, with the ratiok 23/k 21 the same as the wild-type protein. This suggests that the Lys-102 salt bridge with Glu-9 was weakened by mutation, resulting in increased movement of the hinge region. Position 57 in R. capsulatus cytochromec 2 is structurally homologous to position 52 in yeast cytochrome c, which is an asparagine. The N52I mutation in yeast cytochrome c results in substantial stabilization of the protein.1 Thus, the substitution of isoleucine 57 with asparagine in R. capsulatus cytochromec 2 results in destabilization, consistent with the yeast cytochrome c results, and points to the importance of a large hydrophobic side chain at this position. The side chain of mutant I57N is probably hydrogen-bonded to the rear heme propionate and the network involving Tyr-75, Thr-94, and the internal water, just as Asn-52 is in yeast (13Berghuis A.M. Guillemette J.C. Mclendon G. Sherman F. Smith M. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 786-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but our imidazole binding results suggest that the interaction of Thr-94 with the hydrogen bond network may be disrupted as a result of the mutation. The increase in imidazole affinity relative to the wild-type protein (3-fold) is accounted for by a substantial increase in k 12, which would be consistent with a loss of the Thr-94 hydrogen bond with the front heme propionate and the internal water. This deserves further study. The mutation of Gly-95 to Glu has profound effects on imidazole binding as well as on the spin state of the heme iron and overall protein stability. Clearly, there is a substantial shift in the equilibrium to the open form (Fig. 7), and the interconversion of the closed and open forms is much more rapid than in the wild-type protein. In contrast,k 32 is increased by ∼40%, suggesting that once the imidazole-G95E complex is formed, it is still stabilized by the hydrogen bonding process described for wild-type protein.1 The glycine at position 95 adopts normal dihedral angles, so this cannot be the reason for the decreased stability of G95E. However, the α-carbon of Gly-95 is only 3.2 Å from the front propionate carboxyl group. The introduction of Glu at this position would clearly clash with the propionate both because of its size and due to its charge. It would thus force a rearrangement of the hinge or the propionate or both, resulting in a loss of hydrogen bonds or other favorable interactions. We have shown that mutations in cytochromec 2 can strongly influence the affinity for imidazole and the rate constant for formation of the open form (k 12). However, there are a number of limitations on the interpretation of the kinetic and equilibrium parameters measured. These include the fact that the perturbations are relatively small (70-fold in K a(app) or 2.5 kcal/mol in energetic terms and 18-fold in k 12); there is no structural information available for the mutants beyond some NMR chemical shift data (i.e. there are no crystal or solution structures); and the rate constants k 21 and k 23 are not resolvable. Nevertheless, several general conclusions can be drawn. First, the imidazole affinity does not correlate with the stability of the mutants; rather, it appears to be influenced by local effects that presumably alterK 1 and/or K 2differentially depending on the specific mutation. Second,k 12 is relatively easily perturbed by mutation both proximal and distal to the hinge region, suggesting that the changes in dynamic properties can be propagated throughout the folded molecule. Third, there is no obvious relationship between the pK 695 and imidazole binding kinetics at pH 7. Thus, under these conditions, it appears that breakage of the iron–methionyl sulfur coordination bond is not rate-limiting. Moreover, the open and closed forms of cytochromec 2 must be in a rapid equilibrium since the kinetics are homogeneous (single pseudo first-order process) irrespective of K 1 (Fig. 7). Fourth,k 32 is relatively insensitive to mutations as it varies only slightly among the forms of cytochromec 2 studied (2.8-fold). This suggests that the stabilizing interactions, presumably a hydrogen bond involving the bound imidazole, an internal water, and the Phe-102 backbone carbonyl, are not altered significantly by the mutations studied."

We have previously noted that α-hydroxycarbonyl compounds can autoxidize with the production of O⨪2 (1Robertson Jr., P. Fridovich S.E. Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 286-289Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cyanide, and to a lesser extent other nucleophiles, strongly accelerated this autoxidation, and the augmenting effect of preincubation at elevated pH indicated the involvement of an enediolate intermediate. This cyanide-catalyzed oxidation had been seen earlier with methylglyoxal (2Meyerhof O. Biochem. Z. 1925; 159: 432-443Google Scholar, 3Smythe C.V. Berichte. 1932; 65: 819-820Google Scholar). Oxidation of α-hydroxycarbonyl compounds was subsequently seen to proceed as a chain reaction in which O⨪2 could serve as both an initator and a propagator (4Mashino T. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem.

The data reported herein indicate a role for O⨪2 in the toxicities of erythrose and shorter chain sugars. These results are relevant to the much slower process of nonenzymic glycation seen with long chain sugars, such as glucose, which exist primarily as internal hemiacetals and are therefore less reactive (11Corman B.

The strains of E. coli used in these studies were AB1157, which was the parental strain for JI132 that was sodA sodB (16Imlay J. Linn S. J.

Starter cultures were usually grown overnight in aerobic LB medium at 37 °C and were then diluted 200-fold into M9CA medium. LB and M9CA were as described (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68-69Google Scholar). Anaerobiosis, when desired, was achieved in Gas Pack jars. These jars were opened at intervals to allow turbidimetry, following which the jars were evacuated and refilled with N2. Culture growth was monitored turbidimetrically at 600 nm; whereas viability was measured by enumeration of colonies after dilution and plating on LB agar. When needed, extracts were prepared from cultures atA 600 nm = 0.5–0.8 by centrifugation, washing the cells two times in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8 and then disrupting the cells, which had been resuspended in this buffer, with a French Press. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and protein content was assayed colorimetrically (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrose dose-dependently inhibited the growth of a sodA sodB strain of E. coli, as shown in Fig. 1 by lines 3, 2, and 1. The SOD1-competent parental strain was much less affected (lines 6, 5, and 4). This suggested that an oxidation of erythrose initiated by, and/or producing, O⨪2 was a factor in this toxicity. In that case the toxicity of erythrose should be markedly diminished under anaerobic conditions. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that this was the case. The slight growth inhibition by erythrose shown in Fig. 2 was certainly because of residual oxygen, because the cultures were exposed to air periodically when the Gas Pack jars were opened and A 600 nm was measured. As a final demonstration of the importance of O⨪2 in the toxicity of erythrose, the effect of a cell permeable mimic of SOD activity (MnTM-2-PyP) (19Batinic-Haberle I. Benov L. Spasojevic I.

Such sugars have previously been seen to be prone to enolization and autoxidation (1Robertson Jr., P. Fridovich S.E. Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 286-289Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Meyerhof O. Biochem. Z. 1925; 159: 432-443Google Scholar, 3Smythe C.V. Berichte. 1932; 65: 819-820Google Scholar, 4Mashino T.

Acta. 1984; 797: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One would expect, therefore, that sugars containing two- or three-carbon atoms should equal or exceed the toxicity of erythrose and that their toxicities should be O2 and O⨪2augmented. Glyceraldehyde, dihydroxy acetone, and glycolaldehyde were all examined and all were more toxic to the sodA sodB than to the parental strain under aerobic conditions. Further, the toxicity of these compounds to the sodA sodB strain was O2-dependent and was eliminated by the SOD mimic MnTM-2-PyP (19Batinic-Haberle I. Benov L. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24521-24528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus Fig. 4 shows the growth inhibitory effect of 2.0 mm glycolaldehyde and the elimination of that growth inhibition by 25 μmMnTM-2-PyP. A control compound, ZnTM-2-PyP, which does not catalyze the dismutation of O⨪2, was without effect (not shown). It must be noted that ZnTM-2-PyP was tested in the dark. This was necessary because the zinc compound, unlike the manganese compound, exerted a photodynamic effect, which caused lethality in the light. Tautomerization to the enediolate has been shown to precede oxidation of short chain sugars by O2 or by O⨪2 (1Robertson Jr., P. Fridovich S.E. Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 286-289Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In that case, blocking the carbonyl group, through formation of hydrazides, should prevent enolization and consequently oxidation. We examined the effect of hydrazine and of aminoguanidine on the oxidation of erythrose, monitored in terms of the CN− catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c (which was inhibitable by SOD). Fig. 5 illustrates the inhibitory effect of hydrazine (line 2) and of aminoguanidine (line 3). In panel A the hydrazines were added before the cyanide and thus had time to convert much of the open chain form of erythrose to its hydrazide. When the aminoguanidine was added after the cyanide, its inhibitory effect was much diminished (panel B) because of the conversion of the carbonyl form of the sugar to the cyanohydrin, before the addition of the aminoguanidine. The interactions of aminoguanidine with erythrose and with methylglyoxal were followed in terms of increased absorbancies at 230 and 318 nm, respectively, at pH 7.8 in 50 mm potassium phosphate at 23 °C. Both reactions could be followed on a time scale of minutes, but the reaction with methylglyoxal was more rapid than that with erythrose probably because of the existence of the bulk of the sugar in the furanose form. Somewhat surprisingly the reaction of methylglyoxal with aminoguanidine exhibited a fast initial rate followed by a somewhat slower and linear rate. Because the shape of the absorption spectrum did not change with time, this probably reflects the partition of methylglyoxal between anhydrous (carbonyl) and hydrated (gem diol) status with the former reacting rapidly and then being replenished by a rate-limiting dehydration of the gem diol. If a mechanism of enolization and oxidation was involved in the toxicity of erythrose, then hydrazines might protect. Aminoguanidine was selected for this test and the results in Fig. 6show that it protected the sodA sodB strain against the growth inhibitory effect of erythrose. It has previously been seen that strong nucleophiles, such as CN, catalyze the oxidation of short chain sugars (1Robertson Jr., P. Fridovich S.E. Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 286-289Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Meyerhof O. Biochem. Z. 1925; 159: 432-443Google Scholar, 3Smythe C.V. Berichte. 1932; 65: 819-820Google Scholar). The possibility that nucleophiles within E. coli might similarly augment the oxidation of short chain sugars was examined. An extract of the sodA sodB strain stimulated the reduction of cytochrome c by erythrose, and this was partially inhibited by SOD. An extract of the parental strain was also effective, but added SOD did not then inhibit; presumably because the reaction was already maximally inhibited by the endogenous SOD. The active component in the E. coli extracts was seen to be dialyzable but was not further characterized. Among the products of oxidation of α-hydroxycarbonyl compounds are α,β-dicarbonyl compounds. It appeared possible that some of the toxicity of the short chain sugars might have been because of such dicarbonyl oxidation products. Lines 5 and 6 in Fig. 7 show that 5 or 10 mmmethylglyoxal completely inhibited the growth of the sodA sodB strain, whereas lines 2 and 3demonstrate that 20 mm aminoguanidine completely eliminated that toxicity. Lines 1 and 4 are controls with aminoguanidine alone, or no additions, respectively. The growth inhibiting effect of methylglyoxal shown in Fig. 7 was seen even under anaerobic conditions and with the SOD-competent, as well as with the SOD-null strain, and was thus not dependent on O⨪2 or on further oxidation (data not shown). Short chain sugars and their phosphate esters, in which the carbonyl group is not largely blocked by cyclization to the furanose or to more stable pyranose rings, can tautomerize to enediols, which are prone to autoxidation. O⨪2 has been shown to serve as both an initiator and a propagator of these autoxidations (4Mashino T. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Short chain sugars are thus potentially capable of synergizing with O⨪2 in causing toxicity. The results reported herein demonstrate that this does occur. Thus short chain sugars can cause a growth inhibition and a lethality toE. coli, which is O2-dependent and blocked by SOD or by an exogenous SOD mimic. CN− augments the autoxidation of short chain sugars and their phosphates, and dialyzable unidentified nucleophiles, present in extracts of E. coli, exerted a similar effect. Pentoses and hexoses are much less reactive in this regard than are the tetroses and trioses because of the stabilizing effect of ring closure to pyranose forms by hemiacetal formation. However, some carbonyl reactivity remains, even with glucose (14He R.-Q. Yang M.D. Zheng X. Zhou J.X. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and it leads to nonenzymic glycation, which generates ε-amino fructosyl lysine derivatives of proteins. These derivatives can then autoxidize leading to advanced glycation products such asN ε-carboxymethyl lysine derivatives (12Fu M.-X. Reguena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.M. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 20Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Yoshida M. Araki T. Ueda S. Hariuchi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8075-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). O⨪2 is involved in this glycoxidation process, as shown by the inhibitory effect of SOD (21Ansari H. Wang L. Erwin A.A. Church D.F. Biochem. Med. 1996; 59: 68-71Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Aminoguanidine, shown here to protect E. coli against the toxicity of short chain sugars, has been shown to ameliorate the cardiovascular and renal pathologies seen in aging rats (11Corman B. Deriez M. Poitevin P. Huedes D. Bruneval P. Tedgui A. Levy B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The protection against erythrose toxicity by aminoguanidine shown in Fig. 6 could have been because of prevention of the enolization and subsequent oxidation of the erythrose, because of formation of the hydrazide derivative (22Khatami M. Suldan Z. David I. Rockey J.H. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), or to conversion of the α,β-dicarbonyl oxidation product of erythrose to the asymmetrical triazine (24Hirsch J. Petrakova E. Feather M.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 232: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Lo T.W. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Erickson J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 4706Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or to both actions. The profound toxicity of methylglyoxal and the complete protection against that toxicity provided by aminoguanidine indicate that much of the effect of the short chain sugars was because of α,β-dicarbonyl oxidation products and that much of the protective effect of aminoguanidine was because of the trapping of these dicarbonyls, probably by conversion to triazines. Hirsch et al. (24Hirsch J. Petrakova E. Feather M.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 232: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported that the reaction of aminoguanidine with α,β-dicarbonyl oxidation products of d-glucose to yield triazines is rapid at neutral pH, being complete within 5 min at 37 °C. The protective effect of aminoguanidine may thus be because of its dual action in preventing the O⨪2-producing oxidation of open chain forms of sugars and in trapping the α,β products of such oxidations. Short chain sugars are produced during metabolism as the corresponding phosphates, and it is now clear that one of the functions of the SODs is to protect these metabolic intermediates against oxidations initiated and/or propagated by O⨪2. It is probably also important that the steady state concentrations of erythrose-4-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde be kept low. The toxicities of short chain sugars to E. coli can be exploited to shed light on the deleterious consequences of the much slower process of nonenzymic glycation followed by oxidation, by long chain sugars, which also seem to involve oxygen-derived free radicals. Thus the teratogenic effect of high glucose was diminished by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase added to the culture medium (27Eriksson U.J. Berg L.A. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated more conclusively with transgenic mice overexpressing Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, which exhibited much less embryopathy when diabetic than did nontransgenic controls (28Hagay Z.J. Weiss Y. Zusman I. Peled-Kamar M. Reece E.A. Ericksson U.J. Groner Y. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1995; 173: 1036-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). That high glucose imposes on oxidative stress was also indicated by the observation that it induced Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in cultured endothelial cells (29Ceriello A. dello Russo P. Amstad P. Ceratti P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)."

The apoprotein contains no cleavable presequence, and its import requires neither ATP nor energization of the mitochondria and no assistance of the import system for most mitochondrial proteins. Apocytochrome c is considered to freely and reversibly translocate across the outer membrane (10Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is the enzyme that catalyzes the covalent addition of heme to the apoprotein via two thioether bonds between the heme vinyl groups and cysteines 14 and 17, to yield holocytochromec following folding of the polypeptide around the heme. In contrast to apocytochrome c, holocytochrome c is confined to the intermembrane space and cannot leave the organelle without breakage of the outer membrane. See Ref. 13Dumont M.E. Adv. Mol. Cell.

By using biosynthetically made, pure apocytochrome c and mouse liver mitochondria, we have found that the fully reduced, monomeric apoprotein, with both sulfhydryl groups free, associates reversibly with mitochondria in two distinct phases, a high affinity phase with an apparent K d of about 10−10m and a low affinity phase at aK d of about 10−8m (10Hakvoort T.B.M.

To study heme lyase and its relation to the high affinity binding of the apoprotein to mitochondria, a simple and efficient HPLC2method was developed to assay the activity of the enzyme, using biosynthetically made, pure apocytochrome c and yeast mitochondria. The reaction was shown to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and holocytochrome c was found to be a competitive inhibitor, so that the normal high concentration of cytochromec in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (∼500 μm) could serve to control the level of the holoprotein. It was also shown that the high affinity binding of the apoprotein to yeast mitochondria (K d ∼2 × 10−10m) was not directly related to the formation of the holoprotein.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), so the strain A42B is with overexpressed heme lyase, whereas B-8025 is without heme lyase.CYC2 encodes a factor that increases the efficiency of cytochrome c import in vivo (31Dumont M.E.

HindIII linearized plasmids containing the D. melanogaster cytochrome c gene (pDMC1.2) (10Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Labeled mRNA was purified and translated in wheat germ extract in the presence of [35S]methionine. The apoprotein radiolabeled at its single methionine 80 was routinely purified to the monomeric, fully reduced state by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters C18μBondapak column (3.9 × 300 mm) according to Hakvoort et al. (10Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4996-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with a slower gradient (1%/min) than originally employed. The concentration of apocytochrome c was determined by liquid scintillation counting and from the specific radioactivity of the [35S]methionine. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Yeast, except the B-8025 strain, was grown at 30 °C in the semi-synthetic lactate (2.2% v/v) medium described by Daum et al. (33Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with vigorous aeration to mid-log phase. Mitochondria were prepared according to Glick and Pon (34Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and were purified by centrifugation in Nycodenz gradients (34Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Strain B-8025 cannot grow in a non-fermentable medium, so the lactate was replaced by 2% glucose. Yeast lytic enzyme (about 250 units/g of packed yeast cells) was used to prepare spheroplasts by an incubation of 40 min in a 30 °C water bath, with gentle shaking. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in 0.6m sorbitol, 20 mm K+ HEPES, pH 7.4, at protein concentrations of more than 10 mg/ml, aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The aliquots were thawed immediately before use and never frozen or used again. Mitoplasts were prepared by osmotic disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane according to Glick (35Glick B.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit with bovine plasma albumin as standard. The intactness of the outer membrane was assayed by measuring cytochrome c oxidase activity spectrophotometrically, in the presence of 40 μmadded reduced horse heart cytochrome c, with and without 0.02% Triton X-100. The intactness of the outer membrane of fresh and thawed mitochondria was almost the same, at least 92%, and the mitoplasts had more than 75% of the outer membranes broken. Fumarase activity was used to demonstrate that mitochondrial preparations obtained from yeast strain B-8025, which lacked cytochromec heme lyase, and therefore contained no cytochromec, consisted of the expected organelles. It was assayed spectrophotometrically, essentially according to Racker (36Racker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), by measuring the conversion of malate to fumarate at 240 nm in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.22m mannitol, 50 mm malate, and 0.02% Triton X-100, using an extinction coefficient of 2.1 mm−1 cm−1 (36Racker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from strain B-8025 contained about 10% the fumarase activity of mitochondria from the normal strain B-7553. Unless otherwise indicated, the reaction was carried out in 100 μl of 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm K+HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, containing 0.2 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, in the presence of 0.1 mm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 3 μm hemin, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of apocytochrome c and the mixture incubated at 30 °C. It was stopped by putting the tubes directly into liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Hemin was initially dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH at a concentration of 1 mm. Its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically after dilution in 0.1 n NaOH, using an extinction coefficient of 5.84 × 104cm−1m−1 at 385 nm (37Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After incubation with mitochondria, apocytochrome c and the holocytochrome c formed were extracted with guanidine thiocyanate. To each frozen sample were added solid guanidine thiocyanate to a final concentration of 6 m, 2-mercaptoethanol to 5%, and about 200 μg of horse heart cytochromec. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then trifluoroacetic acid was added to 1%. The sample was diluted 4-fold with HPLC solution A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ethylene glycol) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was loaded on a Shodex RSpak D18 HPLC column (6 × 150 mm) and developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solution B was 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ethylene glycol. The outflow was monitored with a radioactive flow detector (Flo-one, Radiometric Instruments), and the data were collected by computer and the areas under the peaks integrated. After correction for the decay of radioactivity, the amount of newly formed holocytochrome cand the remaining apocytochrome c could be calculated from a standard curve obtained under the same conditions of chromatography which showed a linear relationship between the peak area and the amount of protein. Binding experiments were carried out in the same buffer as for holocytochromec formation, except without hemin or DTT/NADH, and at a concentration of mitochondria or mitoplasts of 0.5 mg of protein/ml. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the organelles in each sample were pelleted by centrifugation, and 10-μl aliquots of the initial mixture and of the supernatant were taken for the measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The results are presented as Scatchard graphs (10Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4996-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibody against the carboxyl-terminal segment of yeast cytochrome c heme lyase (11Dumont M.E. Cardillo T.S. Hayes M.K. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5487-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Mark E. Dumont. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run on the Pharmacia PhastSystem. The PhastGel Gradient 10-15 was used, and the protein bands were electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Co.) by using the PhastTransfer apparatus. Immunoblots were performed with the Pierce SuperSignal Substrate Western blotting Kit (Pierce). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:2000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Pierce) were diluted 1:30,000. A simple and reliable HPLC method was developed to separate and simultaneously quantitate both the radiolabeled precursor, D. melanogasterapocytochrome c, and the holocytochrome c newly formed from it by yeast mitochondria. The proteins could be completely extracted with 6 m guanidine thiocyanate (see “Experimental Procedures”), which dissolved the mitochondria immediately and completely and did not interfere with the subsequent reverse phase chromatography. A negligible amount of radioactivity was present in the pellet after dilution with HPLC solution A and centrifugation. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to keep the sulfhydryl groups in apocytochrome c completely reduced. For HPLC, a polymer-based reverse phase column was used instead of the regular silica-based column used for purifying apocytochrome c, because the former was found to separate apo- and holocytochromec better. Moreover, it could be washed in 0.1 nNaOH, whereas the silica column could not. This was necessary because the samples for HPLC contained materials that would otherwise decrease the efficiency of the column. Five percent ethylene glycol was also included in the mobile phase to help the separation. Nevertheless, even under these modified conditions, apo- and holocytochrome ccould not be separated well enough for routine analysis (Fig. 1 A, −cytochrome c). However, it was found that in the presence of an excess of unlabeled holocytochrome c (Fig. 1 A, +cytochrome c), the peak of labeled apocytochromec (Fig. 1, peak I) was separated well from that of the labeled, newly formed holocytochrome c (Fig. 1,peak II), making accurate quantitation straightforward. To confirm that the new peak (Fig. 1, peak II), which appeared after the peak for apocytochrome c (Fig. 1, peak I) following incubation with mitochondria, was truly the newly formed holocytochrome c and not some proteolyzed fragment, the following experiments were performed. First, purified D. melanogaster cytochrome c (29Koshy T.I. Luntz T.L. Garber E.A.E. Margolish E. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was chromatographed under the same conditions and was found to emerge at precisely the position of peak II (Fig. 1 C, cytochrome c). Second, under conditions that allowed no holocytochrome cformation, such as without the addition of hemin and reducing agents, peak II almost completely disappeared (Fig. 1 B, −hemin versus +hemin and controlapocytochrome c). The remaining small peak II was presumably due to the presence of endogenous heme in the mitochondrial preparation. This was confirmed by the observation that, when reducing agents (DTT/NADH) were present without hemin being added, a significant amount of holocytochrome c was formed (see Fig. 2, column 2), apparently since the concentration of endogenous heme, estimated by Dumont et al. (24Dumont M.E. Ernst J.F. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15928-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could amount to 0.1 μm at the concentration of mitochondria employed (0.2 mg/ml). The optimal concentration of added hemin was 2–3 μm, corresponding to that reported by Nicholson et al. (20Nicholson D.W. Kohler H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A further increase to 10 μm hemin did not produce much change (data not shown). Third, with mitochondria from a yeast strain without cytochrome c heme lyase, peak II completely disappeared (Fig. 1 C, B-8025 versus B-7553), whereas with mitochondria overexpressing heme lyase (A42B), holocytochrome c formation was greatly increased as described below. Finally, mutants of apocytochrome c having either or both of the two cysteines to which the heme is attached in the holoprotein changed to serine (10Hakvoort T.B.M. Sprinkle J.R. Margoliash E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4996-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were tested. As shown in Fig. 1 D, when both cysteines were replaced (Fig. 1 D, DMcC14S/C17S), there was no peak II whatsoever, whereas for DMcC14S, there was a significant amount of holocytochrome c formed (Fig. 1 D, DMcC14S), and for DMcC17S, only a trace was detected (Fig. 1 D, DMcC17S). These results were consistent with the report of Tanaka et al. (38Tanaka Y. Ashikari T. Shibano Y. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 39Tanaka Y. Kubota I. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) on human cytochrome c, which showed that the C14A mutant could support yeast growth on lactate medium, whereas the C17A and C14A/C17A mutants could not. Of course, the conversion of the mutant apoprotein DMcC14S to the holoprotein was much less effective than that of the wild type apoprotein. Mitochondria from the strain overexpressing heme lyase were used for these experiments with the mutant apoproteins. The concentration of mitochondria used was also much higher and the incubation time was longer than in the standard procedure (see legend of Fig. 1). In summary, a simple and convenient system was established for the determination of holocytochromec synthesis by yeast mitochondria in vitro. It should be emphasized that the protease inhibitors, leupeptin, aprotinin, and PMSF, were essential to prevent apocytochromec from degradation. Under the conditions employed, no detectable proteolysis occurred as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (data not shown). With our well defined system of purified apocytochrome c and purified mitochondria, the requirements for holocytochrome cformation can be identified relatively easily. As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of any added reducing agents, regardless of the addition of hemin, holocytochrome c was formed but only with very low efficiency (columns 1 and 3). This is presumably due to the small amount of reducing power in the mitochondrial preparation. However, in the presence of reducing agents, holocytochrome c formation was stimulated, even without the addition of extra hemin (column 2). Several reducing agents were tested, including sodium dithionite, NADH, 2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT (columns 4–6 and 8). Sodium dithionite or NADH alone could not stimulate holocytochrome c formation to any great extent, whereas DTT by itself could (columns 4 and 5 versus 8). It appeared that the influence of NADH was by a different mechanism than that of the sulfhydryl reagents. Indeed, the effects of NADH and 2-mercaptoethanol were close to additive (columns 5 and 6 versus 7), whereas the combination of DTT and NADH gave the highest holocytochromec production (column 9), even though it was somewhat less than additive (column 9 versus 5 and 8). In all these cases, the concentrations of reducing agents used were saturating. Further increases in concentration did not increase the production of holocytochrome c (data not shown). DTT/NADH had to be added before the addition of the apoprotein. If apocytochrome c was added first and allowed to bind to mitochondria in the absence of DTT/NADH, a much smaller fraction converted to the holoprotein following the addition of DTT and NADH than if the reducing agents had been added first (column 10 versus 9). So all the following experiments were carried out with 5 mm DTT and 1 mm NADH added first and apocytochrome c added last to initiate the reaction. Consistent with the reports by Neupert and colleagues (see Ref. 40Stuart, R. A., and Neupert, W. (1990) Biochemie(Paris) 115–121Google Scholar for a review), no ATP or membrane potential was required in our system. The formation of holocytochrome c in vitro, catalyzed by yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c heme lyase was fast, following the initiation of the reaction by the addition of apocytochrome c. The"

Response regulators have at least two domains: an output transcription regulation domain and a receiver domain that inhibits the output domain. Phosphorylation of the receiver domain relieves the inhibition. We examined the in vitro transcription activation mechanism for Spo0A, phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A∼P), and a deletion mutant that consists solely of the C-terminal output domain (Spo0ABD).Both Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD stimulated transcription from thespoIIG promoter 10-fold more efficiently than Spo0A. Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD induced DNA denaturation by RNA polymerase in the −10 recognition region, whereas Spo0A did not. DNase I footprint assays revealed that phosphorylation enhanced binding of intact Spo0A to the 0A boxes, while the binding of Spo0ABD was similar to that of Spo0A. Thus, activation of Spo0A by phosphorylation is not primarily due to enhanced DNA binding.

Bacterial cells constantly monitor environmental conditions and adjust their metabolic state. Alterations in parameters such as cell density, temperature, nutrient status, and the presence of toxic compounds provide signals that trigger physiological responses to cope with these changes. One of the most striking examples of this adaptive ability occurs in Bacillus subtilis during continued starvation. A complex set of signals initiates a series of events leading to the remarkable morphological response of endospore formation (1Hoch J.A. Annu. Rev.

Genet. 1996; 30: 297-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). At the core of the transition into the sporulation pathway is the phosphorelay, an elaborate form of a “two-component” regulatory system, the ultimate target of which is phosphorylation of the transcription regulator Spo0A (1Hoch J.A.

Phosphate flux through the phosphorelay is controlled by the balance of activities of several sensor protein kinases, a kinase inhibitor, and a collection of specific protein phosphatases (5Ohlsen K.L.

Spo0A is a member of the response regulator family of proteins (8Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Parkinson J.S. Annu. Rev.

In the case of Spo0A, the C-terminal, output domain contains the minimal DNA binding activity and transcription activation properties (10Spiegelman G.B. Bird T.H. Voon V. Sihavy T.J. Hoch J.A.

The result is the stimulation of the transcription regulatory activity of Spo0A (12Trach K. Burbulys D. Strauch M.A. Wu J.-J. Dhillion N. Jonas R. Hanstein C. Kallio P. Perego M. Bird T.

Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in examining the mechanics of transcription activation by phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A∼P)1 and in identifying the domains within the C-terminal portion of Spo0A involved in this process. As a starting point, we used the in vitroassays established by Bird et al. (13Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to compare the properties of unphosphorylated Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, and the C-terminal, DNA binding portion of Spo0A (Spo0ABD). Phosphorylation of Spo0A increases its ability to stimulate both the initial rate of formation and maximum levels of complexes that are resistant to the inhibition by heparin at the ςA-dependent spoIIGpromoter (PspoIIG) (14Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some previous reports have suggested that Spo0A∼P stimulates transcription from thespoIIG promoter by enhanced binding to the 0A boxes (15Satola S. Baldus J.M. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Spo0ABD was similar to Spo0A in DNA binding yet was able to stimulate both the initial rate of formation and maximum levels of heparin-resistant complexes atPspoIIG, similar to Spo0A∼P. Furthermore, the pathway by which Spo0ABD and Spo0A∼P stimulate transcription was similar. We demonstrate that Spo0A∼P stimulated a step subsequent to RNA polymerase binding and activation of PspoIIG primarily involved the modification of RNA polymerase-promoter complexes, specifically in the −10 region of the promoter. Finally, we found an effect of stabilization of ternary complexes at PspoIIG, which we ascribe to the N-terminal end of Spo0A∼P. The spoIIG template was isolated from the plasmid pUCIIGtrpA (17Satola S. Kirshman P.A. Moran Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) on a 600-bp DNA fragment generated by digestion with PvuII. This fragment contained the spoIIG promoter, both upstream Spo0A binding sites, and the trpA transcription terminator approximately 160-bp downstream from the transcription start site. The trpAterminator functioned effectively in vitro. The fragment was isolated by electrophoresis, recovered by electroelution, and stored in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 20 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA at 4 °C (13Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of template fragment was determined using absorbance at 260 nm. B. subtilis RNA polymerase was isolated as described by Dobinson and Spiegelman (18Dobinson K.F. Spiegelman G.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8206-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Preparations were free of RNase and DNase and judged to be >98% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The polymerase concentration was determined using the Micro BCA assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) as a standard. The activity of the preparations was determined using single round transcription assays under DNA saturating conditions. Typically, preparations were found to be 30–50% active. Spo0A and the proteins required to phosphorylate it were a gift of J. A. Hoch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The phosphorylation of Spo0A was carried out as described previously (13Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples of unphosphorylated Spo0A or Spo0ABD did not contain KinA to ensure against low level phosphorylation during transcription initiation. A constant volume of appropriately diluted sample was added to transcription reactions. Standard transcription reactions (final volume, 20 μl) contained final concentrations of 40 nm RNA polymerase, 4.0 nm template, 80 mm potassium acetate, 0.4 mm each ATP, UTP, and CTP (fast protein liquid chromatography grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.005 mm [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in 1× transcription buffer (14Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 2-μl aliquot of an appropriate dilution of either Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, or Spo0ABD was added to transcription samples containing (in 1× transcription buffer) template DNA, potassium acetate, and the initiating nucleotides ATP and GTP in a 14-μl volume. Following a 2-min incubation at 37 °C, reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of RNA polymerase (diluted in 1× transcription buffer containing 30% glycerol (v/v)). The reactions were incubated for a further 2 min to allow the formation of initiated polymerase-promoter complexes, and RNA elongation was permitted by the addition of 2 μl of elongation mix (UTP, CTP, and heparin (10 μg/ml final concentration)). After 5 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of one-fifth the volume loading buffer (8.0 m urea, 180 mm Trizma base, 180 mm boric acid, 4 mm EDTA, 0.02% each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). Radiolabeled transcripts were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 45 mm boric acid, 45 mm Trizma base, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Labeled transcripts were localized by autoradiography (Eastman Kodak Co.), and promoter activity was determined by measuring the Cerenkov radiation in excised gel slices that contained the transcripts or on a Molecular Dynamics PhophorImager SI using Imagequant software (version 1.0). Salt stability experiments report the type and concentration added to the assays. Template DNA was prepared by end-labeling pUCIIGtrpA at the BamHI site (135 bp downstream of the transcription start site) with [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biochemicals) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). FollowingPvuII digestion, the 410-bp fragment containing the promoter was separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and extracted by electroelution. Standard transcription reactions were prepared as described, containing a final concentration of 4 nmlabeled-DNA. KMnO4 modifications were carried out by the addition of 1 μl of a freshly prepared 200 mmKMnO4 solution (19Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution (1.5 m2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.36 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0), and 120 μg/ml sonicated salmon testis DNA). The DNA was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 100 μl of 1 mpiperidine, incubated for 30 min at 90 °C, and placed on ice. The DNA was butanol-precipitated (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and residual piperidine was removed by vacuum centrifugation for 30 min. The DNA was redissolved in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and heated at 90 °C for 2 min before being loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An equivalent number of cpm from each reaction (105 cpm) was loaded. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. End-labeled template DNA was prepared as described above. DNase I digestions were carried out as described by Bird et al. (14Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Measurement of the specific binding for Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, and Spo0ABD was determined from autoradiograms of the DNase I protection patterns of the three activator forms at the spoIIG promoter by scanning at 10 bits, gray scale using an AGFA Scan II scanner. Occupancy of the site 1 and 2 0A boxes was assessed by measuring the intensity of32P-labeled bands within the protected regions and normalizing them to bands outside the protected regions on a Power Macintosh (6100/66) using a Molecular Dynamics PhophorImager SI and Imagequant software (version 1.0). End-labeled DNA was prepared as described for the DNase I footprint reactions, except that the second digestion was performed with HindIII to give a 230-bp fragment. Reactions contained either Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, or Spo0ABD at a final concentration of 400 nm and template DNA (104 cpm) in 1× transcription buffer in a final volume of 10 μl. The initiating nucleotides ATP and GTP (0.4 mmfinal concentration of each) were also present. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min to allow complex formation before the addition of one-third the volume of heparin loading buffer (100 μg/ml heparin, 20% glycerol (v/v) in 1× transcription buffer). Samples were immediately loaded onto a running (20 mA) 4.5% acrylamide gel containing 40 mm acetic acid, 40 mm Trizma base, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% glycerol, and electrophoresis was continued for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR) overnight. We were interested in examining Spo0A transcription activation using the C-terminal Spo0ABD. As a first step, we compared stimulation of thein vitro formation of heparin-resistant complexes by Spo0ABD, unphosphorylated Spo0A, and Spo0A∼P by analyzing the amount of full-length transcript produced from transcription reactions initiated with ATP and GTP (Fig. 1). The three forms of Spo0A were incubated with RNA polymerase and template to form initiation complexes, and a single round of transcription was permitted using heparin to inhibit further initiation. Earlier studies showed that even in the presence of Spo0A∼P, the polymerase could not attain heparin resistance at PspoIIG with ATP alone (which allows the potential formation of the dinucleotide pppApA (13Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Heparin resistance required that both ATP and GTP (which allows formation of an 11-mer transcript) be present. These heparin-resistant complexes, when provided with all the nucleotides, were able to produce full-length transcripts, suggesting that they were stable initiated complexes. Whereas Spo0A was capable of only slight stimulation even at 800 nm, both Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD stimulated transcription nearly 10-fold at an equivalent protein concentration (400 nm). At low concentrations, Spo0ABD appeared to cause less stimulation than Spo0A∼P; however, at higher protein inputs, the level of complexes was equivalent to that formed when Spo0A∼P was added. When electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to assess the formation of heparin-resistant complexes (Fig. 2), addition of RNA polymerase to thespoIIG template resulted in a small amount of DNA being retarded. This paralleled the low base-line transcription. None of the forms of Spo0A alone formed an association with the promoter that was stable under the conditions used. Whereas no increase in retarded band intensity was observed when Spo0A was added to the polymerase-DNA mixture, the intensity of the shifted complex increased dramatically in samples containing Spo0A∼P or Spo0ABD and RNA polymerase, in agreement with the transcription results. Thus, the C-terminal fragment of Spo0A contained the minimal machinery necessary for transcription from PspoIIG, and the N terminus of Spo0A was not required for formation of a transcriptionally active complex. We expected the structural characteristics of complexes generated by Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD to be similar to each other and different from those containing Spo0A. We used potassium permaganate to probe transcription complexes (19Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) formed in the absence or presence of various initiating nucleotides: ATP, which allows formation of a potential dimer; ApA and GTP, which allow synthesis of a trimer; and ATP and GTP, which allow synthesis of an 11-mer transcript (Fig. 3). In the absence of initiating nucleotides, the addition of Spo0A to RNA polymerase-promoter complexes induced very little sensitivity of the −13 to +13 region of the promoter to modification by KMnO4. The inclusion of ATP, ApA, or ApA and GTP caused a slight increase in thymine reactivity in the −10 region of the promoter. This low level of modification may represent an association of the RNA polymerase with the promoter that was the source of the low level stimulation of transcription observed with Spo0A. In contrast, the inclusion of Spo0A∼P to RNA polymerase-promoter complexes led to extensive denaturation of the promoter in the −3 to −13 region. Due to the presence of ATP in the phosphorelay reaction, all initiation reactions containing Spo0A∼P also contained ATP. Although the first two bases in the transcript are adenines, the presence of ATP did not result in denaturation of the thymine at position +1. When ApA and GTP were added, the denatured region was extended to the +2 position. At this point, heparin resistance was attained (data not shown); thus, this state was dependent upon denaturation around the transcription start site and the initiation of RNA synthesis. Spo0ABD stimulated denaturation in RNA polymerase-promoter complexes without nucleotide requirement. Strong KMnO4 reactivity was observed in the −3 to −13 region of the promoter. The addition of ATP or ApA did not alter the thymine reactivity pattern. This indicated that the −3 to −13 denatured region was not dependent on the presence of ATP. Under ApA plus GTP initiation conditions, the region of denaturation was propagated downstream to the +2 position. In the presence of ATP and GTP, complexes contained DNA that was denatured from −13 to +13, like those formed with Spo0A∼P. The observation that Spo0A/RNA polymerase-promoter complexes only weakly denatured the region upstream of +1 and could not efficiently initiate transcription indicated that melting of the promoter upstream of +1 is critical for stimulation of initiation at PspoIIG. With either Spo0ABD and Spo0A∼P, RNA polymerase induced the same patterns of denaturation at PspoIIG and showed the same response to inclusion of ApA and GTP. On the basis of this comparison, we concluded that the general pathway of initiation was the same for Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD. The data in Fig. 1 indicated that deletion of the N terminus of Spo0A did not reduce the maximum level of stimulation of transcription from thespoIIG promoter. However, the difference in stimulation between Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD at low protein concentrations suggested that N-terminal deletion might compromise the ability of Spo0ABD to increase the initial rate of initiation. To examine the rate of initiation, we measured the time course of heparin-resistant complex formation in reactions containing Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, or Spo0ABD. Initiation reactions were composed containing template DNA, one of the forms of Spo0A, and the initiation nucleotides ATP and GTP. RNA polymerase was added to start the initiation, and at various times, samples were removed and added to a mixture of UTP, CTP, and heparin to allow elongation by complexes that had initiated RNA synthesis (Fig. 4). In the presence of Spo0A, the initial rate of heparin-resistant complex formation was very low; however, the level of complexes continued to increase with extended incubation times. This indicated that Spo0A was ineffective at overcoming the rate-limiting step in heparin-resistant complex formation, although it could catalyze the transition to heparin resistance slowly. Although both the final levels and the initial rate of formation were increased by Spo0A∼P, the effect on the initial rate was most dramatic, in agreement with the results of Bird et al. (14Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the presence of Spo0ABD, the final level of open complexes formed was the same as with Spo0A∼P, but a lag in the initial time course of complex formation was consistently observed. With Spo0A∼P, accumulation of open complex formation was immediate, whereas reactions with Spo0ABD required 40–60 s to achieve the same level of transcription complexes. Maximum levels of initiation were reached after 3–5 min (data not shown). If the observed difference between Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD in stimulation of the initial rates of formation of heparin-resistant complexes were due to an enthalpic barrier, the temperature dependence of spoIIGtranscription stimulation by the two forms of Spo0A might differ. To test this possibility, transcription reactions containing 400 nm Spo0A∼P or Spo0ABD were carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 to 42 °C (Fig. 5). The temperature dependence profiles for transcription stimulated by Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD were virtually identical. Both forms of Spo0A stimulated transcription to the same extent at each of the temperatures tested. This suggested that the presence of a phosphorylated N terminus did not affect the rate-limiting temperature-dependent step necessary for PspoIIG transcription. Stimulation at temperatures below 30 °C was poor, and it was possible that the low level of transcription was due to reduced elongation rather than a failure to form a heparin-resistant complex. To eliminate the possibility that the temperature profile represented lower elongation, initiated complexes were formed at temperatures below 30 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for the elongation step. These assays yielded plots virtually identical to those above, indicating that elongation was not rate-limiting (data not shown). The stability of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions, including the concentration and type of salt present. Cations interfere with protein-DNA interactions because protein binding requires the displacement of the cations from the DNA, an enthalpically unfavorable process. In addition, certain anions, such as Cl−, bind to proteins with low affinities of about 10−2m. These types of anions can compete with the DNA for positively charged regions on the protein. In contrast, at low concentration, anions such as Ac− and Glu− do not compete with DNA but can interfere with protein-protein interactions (21Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5912-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 22Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4979-4986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liermo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Ha J.-H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because anions can be used as probes to monitor protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, we tested the effects of several salts on Spo0A-dependent stimulation (Fig. 6). Stimulation of transcription fromPspoIIG by Spo0A or Spo0ABD was inhibited above 40 mm KCl. Stimulation of transcription by Spo0A∼P was less sensitive, but was still inhibited above 80 mm KCl. Similar inhibition profiles were seen with NaCl (data not shown). Transcription stimulation was considerably less sensitive to the presence of the organic salt potassium acetate (KAc). Stimulation by Spo0A or Spo0ABD was not inhibited until the organic salt concentration was above 80 mm, and stimulation by Spo0A∼P was resistant to at least 120 mm KAc. We tested potassium glutamate as well and found that it also inhibited the transcription stimulation by Spo0ABD and Spo0A but not Spo0A∼P (data not shown). Because a differential effect of Ac− on transcription stimulation by the three forms of Spo0A was observed, we examined this further by testing the stability of these complexes to high salt challenge. Initiation reactions were formed in 120 mm KAc on ice and then warmed to 37 °C. After a 1-min equilibration, aliquots were removed at various times and added to a mixture of the initiating nucleoside triphosphates. After 2 min more, a mixture of UTP, CTP, and heparin was added to allow a single round of elongation (Fig. 7). Transcription by RNA polymerase alone was used as a base line throughout the assay. Transcription from complexes formed with Spo0A or Spo0ABD dropped to the base line within 30 s, whereas complexes containing Spo0A∼P decayed slowly. This indicated that the phosphorylated N terminus stabilized the uninitiated complex. We also examined stability of the complexes by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We observed that when initiating nucleoside triphosphates were omitted from reactions containing 120 mmKAc, only the Spo0A∼P/RNA polymerase sample gave rise to a shifted complex (data not shown). This result indicated that whereas both Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD could activate transcription, the phosphorylated N terminus stabilized the transcription complex. ThespoIIG promoter contains two 0A binding sites, each with two 0A consensus binding sequences (0A boxes (16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Site 1 (−95 to −70) contains Spo0A boxes that are closer to the consensus recognition sequence than those in site 2 (−60 to −35). Consequently, site 1 has been deemed a strong binding site and site 2 a weak binding site (16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One model for the effect of phosphorylation on Spo0A is that it removes N-terminal inhibition of the C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, allowing DNA binding and thus stimulation (15Satola S. Baldus J.M. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this were the case, then deletion of the N terminus, as in Spo0ABD, might lead to tight binding and thus transcription stimulation. To measure specific binding for Spo0A, Spo0A∼P, and Spo0ABD, we examined the DNase I protection patterns of the three activator forms at thespoIIG promoter. Occupancy of the site 1 and 2 0A boxes was assessed by measuring the intensity of 32P-labeled bands within the protected regions and normalizing them to bands outside the protected regions. In accordance with previous reports, Spo0A did not exhibit a high affinity for the 0A boxes. Even at 800 nm, Spo0A only displayed 35% occupancy of site 1 and no occupancy of site 2 (Fig. 8 A). The results with Spo0A∼P demonstrated that phosphorylation enhanced binding to thespoIIG promoter. Spo0A∼P was able to completely protect both site 1 and site 2. Half maximum occupancy at sites 2 and 1 required 350 and 250 nm Spo0A∼P, respectively (Fig. 8 B). Spo0ABD, like Spo0A, displayed 32% occupancy of site 1 and no occupation of site 2 at 800 nm (Fig. 8 C). Thus, concentrations of Spo0ABD that markedly increased transcription from the spoIIG promoter (see Fig. 1) did not result in stable binding. Therefore, enhanced DNA binding was not primarily responsible for the stimulation properties of Spo0ABD, and by implication, activation of Spo0A by phosphorylation does not depend on increasing the interaction of the C terminus with the 0A boxes on the template. Spo0A is the central regulator of sporulation initiation in B. subtilis and regulates endospore formation by specifically stimulating or repressing expression of developmental genes (1Hoch J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 74: 441-466Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Errington J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 1-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Spiegelman G.B. Bird T.H. Voon V. Sihavy T.J.

Gene. 1991; 100: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of Spo0A requires phosphorylation, and the level of activated Spo0A is tightly regulated by a complex signaling system that includes positive and negative regulators (1Hoch J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 74: 441-466Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Errington J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 1-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stragier P. Losick R.L. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). N-terminal deletion mutants of Spo0A are constitutively active in vivo (26Ireton K. Rudner D.Z. Siranosian K.J. Grossman A.D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and in vitro (Ref. 11Grimsley J.K. Tjalkens R.B. Strauch M.A. Bird T.H. Spiegelman G.B. Hostomsky Z. Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16977-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this work). Thus, the C-terminal fragment of Spo0A is capable of effecting transcription stimulation, and the N-terminal fragment is a negative regulatory domain. Ultimately, analysis of the C terminus is the key to defining the domains within Spo0A that are responsible for transcription activation. In this investigation, we have demonstrated that two activated forms of Spo0A, Spo0A∼P and Spo0ABD, use a common mechanism to stimulate transcription from the spoIIG promoter. Structural probing of activator-RNA polymerase-spoIIG complexes using KMnO4 revealed that the activated forms of Spo0A, generated by either phosphorylation or N-terminal deletion, were capable of interacting with RNA polymerase to stimulate melting of thespoIIG promoter upstream of the +1 site (Fig. 3). The patterns of the reactive thymines and changes in the patterns seen on addition of initiating nucleotides were the same for the two activated forms of Spo0A. Previous reports have suggested that phosphorylation stimulated transcription from the spoIIG promoter by enhancing binding to low consensus 0A boxes (15Satola S. Baldus J.M. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments reported here also found that phosphorylation enhanced binding of Spo0A∼P to the 0A boxes relative to unphosphorylated Spo0A. The increased binding could suggest that, like OmpR and NTRC (27Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Huang K.J. Lan C.-Y. Igo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2828-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Porter S.C. North A.K. Kustu S. Sihavy T.J. Hoch J.A. Two Component Signal Transduction. AMS Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 147-158Google Scholar), the primary point of regulation of Spo0A activity is the DNA affinity. However, no increase in binding was observed for Spo0ABD relative to Spo0A, although Spo0ABD stimulated both the initial rate of formation and maximum levels of heparin-resistant complexes at PspoIIG. Because Spo0ABD showed the same transcription activation mechanism as Spo0A∼P, we conclude that the enhanced stimulation of transcription caused by phosphorylation of Spo0A is not due to enhanced DNA binding per se, but that the primary effect of phosphorylation is to bring about a structural change that exposes RNA polymerase interaction domains within Spo0A that activate transcription from PspoIIG. The data in Fig. 6 indicate that a phosphorylated N terminus contributed to the stability of the Spo0A-RNA polymerase-promoter complex to challenge by organic ions but not inorganic ions (the hydrophobic effect). The hydrophobic effect (21Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5912-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 22Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4979-4986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liermo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Ha J.-H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) proposes that, relative to water, anions, such as Ac−, are preferentially excluded from hydrophobic regions on the surface of proteins. Increasing the overall salt concentration enhances an anion gradient, resulting in an entropically unfavorable formation of a water lattice at the protein surface. This unfavorable condition may be eliminated by protein association to shield these hydrophobic residues, leading to resistance to salt. If phosphorylation exposed a hydrophobic region on the N terminus of Spo0A∼P it could provide the hydrophobic effect, whereas unphosphorylated Spo0A or Spo0ABD (which lacks the N terminus) would show less difference in salt sensitivity between inorganic and organic salts. The hydrophobic effect implies that it is possible to bury the hydrophobic residues. This could be accomplished by (i) a conformational change in each Spo0A∼P, such as that demonstrated by Grimsley et al. (11Grimsley J.K. Tjalkens R.B. Strauch M.A. Bird T.H. Spiegelman G.B. Hostomsky Z. Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16977-19982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) Spo0A∼P self association leading to the formation of homo-oligomers, as suggested by Kobayashi and co-workers (30Asayama M. Yamamoto A. Kobayashi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); or (iii) intermolecular association between Spo0A∼P and RNA polymerase. The higher DNA binding affinity of Spo0A∼P compared with Spo0ABD (Fig. 8) was paralleled by an increased resistance to high anion concentrations by transcription complexes containing Spo0A∼P compared with those containing Spo0ABD (Figs. 6 and 7). Thus, the increased DNA binding could account for the greater stability of transcription complexes containing Spo0A∼P. In addition, the lower stability of complexes containing Spo0ABD may be the cause of the lag in heparin-resistant complex formation observed in the time course reactions (Fig. 4). However, our previous investigation of transcription initiation at the spoIIG promoter indicates that RNA polymerase binding is independent of Spo0A∼P and that Spo0A∼P binds to the binary complex of DNA and the polymerase (14Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects on stabilization could be due to interactions between the N termini of Spo0A proteins or to interactions of the N terminus directly with the polymerase. This raises the possibility that the N terminus itself contributes to signal transduction by wild-type Spo0A In its stimulation of the spoIIG promoter, Spo0A acts as a class II activator, binding to the promoter in a region overlapping the −35 recognition sequence for RNA polymerase (31Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and making contact with the ς subunit (32Schyns G. Buckner C. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5605-5608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Baldus J.M. Buckner C.M. Moran Jr., C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Spo0A also belongs to a class of activators (which include the regulators NTRC (34North A.K. Kustu S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), NifA (35Buck M. Cannon W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2597-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), DctD (36Huala E. Stigter J. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1428-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and N4SSB (37Miller A. Wood D. Ebright R. Rothman-Denes L.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) that function not through recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter but through modification of prebound RNA polymerase complexes. Some of this family of activators can cause an isomerization step (from a closed to an open complex) without themselves binding to DNA. We have not demonstrated this ability for Spo0A; however, strong DNA binding is not the primary requisite for its activity. Nevertheless, the Spo0A binding sites at PspoIIGhave been shown to play a role in transcription regulation in vivo because mutation of the site 2 0A boxes toward consensus result in increased transcription (16Baldus J.M. Green B.D. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 296-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The transporters consist of three functional units (IIA, IIB, IIC), which occur either as protein subunits or domains of a multidomain polypeptide. The membrane-spanning IIC domain contains the substrate binding site; IIA and IIB are phosphorylation domains that transfer phosphate from HPr to the transported sugar. The transporter complexes of the PTS are good examples for variation of design by modular assembly of domains and subunits. The domain order is IIC-IIB in the membrane subunit of the Escherichia coli glucose transporter (IICBGlc) and IIB-IIC in Salmonella typhimurium sucrose transporter (IIBCScr). The phosphorylation domain of IICBGlc was translocated from the carboxyl-terminal to the amino-terminal end of the IIC domain, and the activity of the circularly permuted form was optimized by variation of the length and the composition of the interdomain linker. IIBapCGlc with an alanine-proline-rich interdomain linker has 70% of the control specific activity after purification and reconstitution into proteoliposomes. These results indicate that the amino-terminal end of IICBGlc must be on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane, that membrane insertion of the IIC domain is insensitive to the modification of its amino-terminal end, and that a domain swap as it could occur by a single DNA translocation event can rapidly lead to a functional protein. However, IIB could not be substituted for by glucokinase. Fusion proteins between the IIC domain and glucokinase do not transport and phosphorylate glucose in an ATP-dependent mechanism, although the IIC moiety displays transport activity upon complementation with soluble subclonal IIB, and the glucokinase moiety retains ATP-dependent nonvectorial kinase activity. This indicates that IIC and IIB are two cooperative units and not only sequentially acting upon a common substrate, and that translocation of glucose must be conformationally coupled to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of IIB.

The PTS is almost ubiquitous in bacteria but with one exception, has not been found in eukaryotic cells. It consists of two cytoplasmic phosphoryl carrier proteins termed enzyme I and HPr, which sequentially transfer phosphoryl groups from PEP to the different substrate-specific transporters. The transporters comprise three independently folding units of function. IIA and IIB are hydrophilic and contain one phosphorylation site each, and IIC spans the membrane and contains the sugar binding site. The three units occur either as domains in a single polypeptide chain or as subunits of a complex. The number of carbohydrate-specific transporters varies from species to species. There are 38 PTS-related genes in Escherichia coliand 26 PTS genes in Bacillus subtilis (EMBL/SwissProt data base), most of which code for PTS transporters and their subunits. Only two open reading frames with homologies to known PTS transporters were found in Hemophilus influenzae (4Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J.

The transporters differ in amino acid sequence (from insignificant to more than 90% amino acid similarity), substrate selectivity, and in the structure of the phosphorylation site (histidine and cysteine phosphorylation). Lengeleret al. (6Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. Wehmeier U.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) grouped the transporters into five main families (glucose-sucrose, mannitol-fructose, lactose-cellobiose, mannose, glucitol) according to amino acid sequence similarity.The EMBL/SwissProt data base lists 24 homologous proteins from 12 different Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the glucose-sucrose family. 2http://protein.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/ReqProdomII.pl?acc_seq2=P05053. 2http://protein.toulouse.inra.fr/cgi-bin/ReqProdomII.pl?acc_seq2=P05053. Nine have the domain order CB, and 15 have the order BC (Fig. 1). CB and BC can be considered as circularly permuted variants. The hydrophilic B domains contain the strongly conserved sequence N(I/L)X 5CXTRLRX 4D with the active-site cysteine, which is phosphorylated by the cognate IIA domains (7Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CB forms, in addition, contain the highly conserved sequence KTPGRED (residues 368–388 of IICBGlc). This motif is 35 residues upstream of the active-site cysteine, and it serves as a hinge of constrained mobility between the IIC and the IIB domain (8Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is the only region at which a functional hybrid protein between the homologous transporters for Glc and GlcNAc could be constructed (9Hummel U. Nuoffer C. Zanolari B. Erni B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The BC variants have a conserved sequence GNXVXXX(F/Y) or GXGXVXXX(F/Y) 42 residues downstream of the active-site cysteine. It is unique to the BC subgroup and, as judged from the spacing, could be part of a linker between the B and C domains.The different transporters of the PTS are a good example for variation of design by modular assembly of domains and subunits (10Henikoff S. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Bork P. Attwood T.K. Hood L. Science. 1997; 278: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the different types of PTS transporters are circularly permuted forms of a consensus structure envisaged to consist of two transmembrane portions and of two large loops, forming cytoplasmic subdomains (11Erni B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Saier, Reizer, and co-workers produced a number of sophisticated analyses that suggest that the multidomain proteins of the PTS arose during evolution by repeated recombinational gene rearrangements (12Wu L.F. Tomich J.M. Saier M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 687-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and document the combinatorial nature and modular design of the PTS transporters (13Reizer A.

Here we show that the C and B domains of of the glucose transporter of E. coli can be circularly permuted with only minor effects on the activity and without detectable effects on membrane insertion.The wild-type form of the E. coli glucose transporter consists of two subunits IIAGlc and IICBGlc. IIAGlc is a monomeric soluble 18-kDa protein that transfers the phosphate group from HPr to the IICBGlc subunit and at the same time plays an important role in allosteric regulation of adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, and carbohydrate transporters for lactose, maltose, and other non-PTS sugars (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IICBGlc is a homodimeric membrane protein. The 52-kDa subunits consist of two domains. The C domain contains six plus two membrane-spanning (residues 17–210 and 280–325), and two extended hydrophilic segments (residues 211–279 and 326–386) on the cytoplasmic face (20Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The B domain on the cytoplasmic face (residues 386–477) has a split α/β sandwich fold composed of an antiparallel sheet and three α-helices superimposed onto one side of the sheet (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The C domain contains the sugar binding site (9Hummel U. Nuoffer C. Zanolari B. Erni B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the B domain contains the phosphorylation site (Cys-421 (7Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This B domain was translocated from its natural location at the carboxyl-terminal end to the amino-terminal end of the C domain. The two domains were coupled by peptide linkers of 4 and 22 residues. The recombinant IIBCGlc subunit with the shorter linker displayed 20%, and the protein with longer Ala-Pro-rich linker (11Erni B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) displayed 70% of wild-type activity.DISCUSSIONThe PTS transporters of the glucose family consist of two domains, the transmembrane IIC domain and the cytoplasmic IIB domain. The domain order can be either CB as in the glucose transporter or BC as in the sucrose transporter IIBCScr of Salmonella typhimurium (36Ebner R. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 9-17Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we show that the two domains of the IICBGlc subunit of the glucose transporter can be circularly permuted, thus mimicking domain shuffling as it might have occurred during the evolution of the PTS transporters from common ancestors. The circularly permuted form (IIBCGlc) complemented glucose transport and phosphorylation in vivoand could be purified and functionally characterized in vitro. The permuted form without additional structural adjustments had already between 10 and 20% wild-type activity. Increasing the length of the interdomain linker from 4 to 20 residues (Fig. 1) increased the activity to 70% of the wild-type reference. At the same time, the phosphorylation domain IIB could not be functionally substituted for by glucokinase. This indicates that IIC and IIB are two cooperative units and not only two proteins that sequentially act upon a common substrate and that translocation of glucose must be conformationally coupled to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of IIB. However, despite the high specificity of the interaction between IIC and IIB, binding is not so tight that the covalently bound but inactive IIB cannot be displaced. For example, the soluble subclonal IIBGlc unit (10 kDa) can successfully displace an inactive IIB domain (in the C421S mutant of IICBGlc, Table II) or the even larger glucokinase moiety (35 kDa) in a fusion protein between the IIC domain and glucokinase. Coupling between the two domains is likely to be mediated by parts of the antiparallel β-sheet, which carries the active site Cys-421 and the essential Arg-424 and Arg-426 (8Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The helices that form a dome-like structure on the face of the antiparallel β-sheet opposite to the active site (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) mediate the covalent links to the neighboring domains in multidomain proteins. In IICBGlc, helix 1 connects the β-sheet to the carboxyl terminus of the IIC domain, whereas helix 3 is free. In the homologous transporter for GlcNAc (IICBAGlcNAc) (34Mukhija S. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14819-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), helix 3 connects the β-sheet with the IIA domain. This same helix 3 is able to link the sheet to the IIC domain in the circularly permuted form of the IICBGlc subunit.The successful fusion of a cytoplasmic domain to the amino terminus of the IICGlc domain confirms the prediction from PhoA and LacZ fusion experiments that the amino terminus of IICBGlcis located on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (20Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, insertion of the IIC fusion protein with modified amino-terminal ends is less efficient than the insertion of fusion proteins with the native amino terminus. Insertion is also less efficient with increasing size of the attached domain, but this inhibitory effect partially can be compensated by increasing the length of the interdomain linker.The interdomain linker was chosen from among the well characterized alanine-proline-rich sequences that form flexible hinges in multidomain proteins (37Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 38Green J.D.F. Perham R.N. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). They occur naturally in the E2 chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, in the proteolytic processing site of the endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase preprotein, and in the IIABMan subunit of the E. coli mannose transporter (summarized in Ref. 40Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar). This type of linker has been successfully used to construct a multidomain protein from the four subunits of the glucose PTS (23Mao Q. Schunk T. Gerber B. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18295-18300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The length of the linker appears important for membrane insertion of the IIC domain.When transformants expressing soluble glucokinase or IIC-glucokinase fusion proteins were plated on McConkey plates containing maltose (a non-PTS sugar), only cells expressing IIC-Glk formed strongly fermenting colonies, whereas cells expressing soluble glucokinase and GlkapIIC remained yellow (results not shown). Meyer et al.(26Meyer D. Schneider-Fresenius C. Horlacher R. Peist R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that high concentrations of soluble glucokinase interfered with the expression of the maltose system. It is likely that expression of soluble glucokinase from a multicopy plasmid resulted in a nonfermenting phenotype, whereas the approximately 100-fold reduced glucokinase activity of IIC-Glk was just right for the phosphorylation of intracellular glucose but did not yet repress the maltose system. The 3 to 10 times lower glucokinase activity of GlkxIIC and GlkapIIC might be insufficient for maltose fermentation under the chosen conditions.The results of this study indicate that a domain swap as it could occur by a single DNA translocation event can immediately lead to a functional protein and that only minor structural adjustments, such as duplicating the fusion joint, might be necessary to compensate for a partial loss of activity due to a structural mismatch between the reoriented domains. The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS)1 is involved in transport and phosphorylation of carbohydrates and in regulation of the metabolism in response to the availability of these carbohydrates as nutrients (1Meadow N.D.

Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IICBGlc is a homodimeric membrane protein. The 52-kDa subunits consist of two domains. The C domain contains six plus two membrane-spanning (residues 17–210 and 280–325), and two extended hydrophilic segments (residues 211–279 and 326–386) on the cytoplasmic face (20Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The B domain on the cytoplasmic face (residues 386–477) has a split α/β sandwich fold composed of an antiparallel sheet and three α-helices superimposed onto one side of the sheet (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The C domain contains the sugar binding site (9Hummel U. Nuoffer C. Zanolari B. Erni B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the B domain contains the phosphorylation site (Cys-421 (7Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This B domain was translocated from its natural location at the carboxyl-terminal end to the amino-terminal end of the C domain. The two domains were coupled by peptide linkers of 4 and 22 residues. The recombinant IIBCGlc subunit with the shorter linker displayed 20%, and the protein with longer Ala-Pro-rich linker (11Erni B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) displayed 70% of wild-type activity. DISCUSSIONThe PTS transporters of the glucose family consist of two domains, the transmembrane IIC domain and the cytoplasmic IIB domain. The domain order can be either CB as in the glucose transporter or BC as in the sucrose transporter IIBCScr of Salmonella typhimurium (36Ebner R. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 9-17Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we show that the two domains of the IICBGlc subunit of the glucose transporter can be circularly permuted, thus mimicking domain shuffling as it might have occurred during the evolution of the PTS transporters from common ancestors. The circularly permuted form (IIBCGlc) complemented glucose transport and phosphorylation in vivoand could be purified and functionally characterized in vitro. The permuted form without additional structural adjustments had already between 10 and 20% wild-type activity. Increasing the length of the interdomain linker from 4 to 20 residues (Fig. 1) increased the activity to 70% of the wild-type reference. At the same time, the phosphorylation domain IIB could not be functionally substituted for by glucokinase. This indicates that IIC and IIB are two cooperative units and not only two proteins that sequentially act upon a common substrate and that translocation of glucose must be conformationally coupled to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of IIB. However, despite the high specificity of the interaction between IIC and IIB, binding is not so tight that the covalently bound but inactive IIB cannot be displaced. For example, the soluble subclonal IIBGlc unit (10 kDa) can successfully displace an inactive IIB domain (in the C421S mutant of IICBGlc, Table II) or the even larger glucokinase moiety (35 kDa) in a fusion protein between the IIC domain and glucokinase. Coupling between the two domains is likely to be mediated by parts of the antiparallel β-sheet, which carries the active site Cys-421 and the essential Arg-424 and Arg-426 (8Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The helices that form a dome-like structure on the face of the antiparallel β-sheet opposite to the active site (21Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) mediate the covalent links to the neighboring domains in multidomain proteins. In IICBGlc, helix 1 connects the β-sheet to the carboxyl terminus of the IIC domain, whereas helix 3 is free. In the homologous transporter for GlcNAc (IICBAGlcNAc) (34Mukhija S. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14819-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), helix 3 connects the β-sheet with the IIA domain. This same helix 3 is able to link the sheet to the IIC domain in the circularly permuted form of the IICBGlc subunit.The successful fusion of a cytoplasmic domain to the amino terminus of the IICGlc domain confirms the prediction from PhoA and LacZ fusion experiments that the amino terminus of IICBGlcis located on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (20Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, insertion of the IIC fusion protein with modified amino-terminal ends is less efficient than the insertion of fusion proteins with the native amino terminus. Insertion is also less efficient with increasing size of the attached domain, but this inhibitory effect partially can be compensated by increasing the length of the interdomain linker.The interdomain linker was chosen from among the well characterized alanine-proline-rich sequences that form flexible hinges in multidomain proteins (37Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 38Green J.D.F. Perham R.N. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23484-23488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Robien M.A. Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Perham R.N. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). They occur naturally in the E2 chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, in the proteolytic processing site of the endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase preprotein, and in the IIABMan subunit of the E. coli mannose transporter (summarized in Ref. 40Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar). This type of linker has been successfully used to construct a multidomain protein from the four subunits of the glucose PTS (23Mao Q. Schunk T. Gerber B. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18295-18300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The length of the linker appears important for membrane insertion of the IIC domain.When transformants expressing soluble glucokinase or IIC-glucokinase fusion proteins were plated on McConkey plates containing maltose (a non-PTS sugar), only cells expressing IIC-Glk formed strongly fermenting colonies, whereas cells expressing soluble glucokinase and GlkapIIC remained yellow (results not shown). Meyer et al.(26Meyer D. Schneider-Fresenius C. Horlacher R. Peist R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that high concentrations of soluble glucokinase interfered with the expression of the maltose system. It is likely that expression of soluble glucokinase from a multicopy plasmid resulted in a nonfermenting phenotype, whereas the approximately 100-fold reduced glucokinase activity of IIC-Glk was just right for the phosphorylation of intracellular glucose but did not yet repress the maltose system. The 3 to 10 times lower glucokinase activity of GlkxIIC and GlkapIIC might be insufficient for maltose fermentation under the chosen conditions.The results of this study indicate that a domain swap as it could occur by a single DNA translocation event can immediately lead to a functional protein and that only minor structural adjustments, such as duplicating the fusion joint, might be necessary to compensate for a partial loss of activity due to a structural mismatch between the reoriented domains. The PTS transporters of the glucose family consist of two domains, the transmembrane IIC domain and the cytoplasmic IIB domain. The domain order can be either CB as in the glucose transporter or BC as in the sucrose transporter IIBCScr of Salmonella typhimurium (36Ebner R. Lengeler J.W. Mol.
