https://openalex.org/W2008771485,"The electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes are shown here to be extremely sensitive to the chemical environment. Exposure to air or oxygen dramatically influences the nanotubes' electrical resistance, thermoelectric power, and local density of states, as determined by transport measurements and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These electronic parameters can be reversibly ""tuned"" by surprisingly small concentrations of adsorbed gases, and an apparently semiconducting nanotube can be converted into an apparent metal through such exposure. These results, although demonstrating that nanotubes could find use as sensitive chemical gas sensors, likewise indicate that many supposedly intrinsic properties measured on as-prepared nanotubes may be severely compromised by extrinsic air exposure effects."
https://openalex.org/W2171281715,"alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) is a 14 kDa protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we show that alpha-Syn-/- mice are viable and fertile, exhibit intact brain architecture, and possess a normal complement of dopaminergic cell bodies, fibers, and synapses. Nigrostriatal terminals of alpha-Syn-/- mice display a standard pattern of dopamine (DA) discharge and reuptake in response to simple electrical stimulation. However, they exhibit an increased release with paired stimuli that can be mimicked by elevated Ca2+. Concurrent with the altered DA release, alpha-Syn-/- mice display a reduction in striatal DA and an attenuation of DA-dependent locomotor response to amphetamine. These findings support the hypothesis that alpha-Syn is an essential presynaptic, activity-dependent negative regulator of DA neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2093958228,"Relative quiescence is a defining characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells, while their progeny have dramatic proliferative ability and inexorably move toward terminal differentiation. The quiescence of stem cells has been conjectured to be of critical biologic importance in protecting the stem cell compartment, which we directly assessed using mice engineered to be deficient in the G1 checkpoint regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21cip1/waf1 (p21). In the absence of p21, hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and absolute number were increased under normal homeostatic conditions. Exposing the animals to cell cycle-specific myelotoxic injury resulted in premature death due to hematopoietic cell depletion. Further, self-renewal of primitive cells was impaired in serially transplanted bone marrow from p21-/- mice, leading to hematopoietic failure. Therefore, p21 is the molecular switch governing the entry of stem cells into the cell cycle, and in its absence, increased cell cycling leads to stem cell exhaustion. Under conditions of stress, restricted cell cycling is crucial to prevent premature stem cell depletion and hematopoietic death."
https://openalex.org/W2028044172,"Chk2 is a protein kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and may regulate cell cycle arrest. We generated Chk2-deficient mouse cells by gene targeting. Chk2-/- embryonic stem cells failed to maintain gamma-irradiation-induced arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Chk2-/- thymocytes were resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Chk2-/- cells were defective for p53 stabilization and for induction of p53-dependent transcripts such as p21 in response to gamma irradiation. Reintroduction of the Chk2 gene restored p53-dependent transcription in response to gamma irradiation. Chk2 directly phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, which is known to interfere with Mdm2 binding. This provides a mechanism for increased stability of p53 by prevention of ubiquitination in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2046779413,Direct evidence demonstrates that urban and industrial air pollution can completely shut off precipitation from clouds that have temperatures at their tops of about –10°C over large areas. Satellite data reveal plumes of reduced cloud particle size and suppressed precipitation originating from major urban areas and from industrial facilities such as power plants. Measurements obtained by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite reveal that both cloud droplet coalescence and ice precipitation formation are inhibited in polluted clouds.
https://openalex.org/W2056213320,"Drosophila exhibits a circadian rest-activity cycle, but it is not known whether fly rest constitutes sleep or is mere inactivity. It is shown here that, like mammalian sleep, rest in Drosophila is characterized by an increased arousal threshold and is homeostatically regulated independently of the circadian clock. As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila, including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines. Flies lacking one such enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, show increased rest after rest deprivation. These results implicate the catabolism of monoamines in the regulation of sleep and waking in the fly and suggest that Drosophila may serve as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2127335580,"The 2,272,351-base pair genome of Neisseria meningitidis strain MC58 (serogroup B), a causative agent of meningitis and septicemia, contains 2158 predicted coding regions, 1158 (53.7%) of which were assigned a biological role. Three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer were identified; two of these contain genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity, and the third island contains coding sequences only for hypothetical proteins. Insights into the commensal and virulence behavior of N. meningitidis can be gleaned from the genome, in which sequences for structural proteins of the pilus are clustered and several coding regions unique to serogroup B capsular polysaccharide synthesis can be identified. Finally, N. meningitidis contains more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen studied to date, a mechanism that controls their expression and contributes to the evasion of the host immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2119706891,"To facilitate the genetic study of sleep, we documented that rest behavior in Drosophila melanogaster is a sleep-like state. The animals choose a preferred location, become immobile for periods of up to 157 min at a particular time in the circadian day, and are relatively unresponsive to sensory stimuli. Rest is affected by both homeostatic and circadian influences: when rest is prevented, the flies increasingly tend to rest despite stimulation and then exhibit a rest rebound. Drugs acting on a mammalian adenosine receptor alter rest as they do sleep, suggesting conserved neural mechanisms. Finally, normal homeostatic regulation depends on the timeless but not the period central clock gene. Understanding the molecular features of Drosophila rest should shed new light on the mechanisms and function of sleep."

https://openalex.org/W1642906945,"Empirical studies show that health improvements provide a significant boost to economic growth in developing countries. This leads to the view that health, like education, is a fundamental component of human capital, and suggests the notion of health-led growth. Better health leads to higher income, but there is also a positive feedback effect, giving rise to a beneficial situation where health and income improvements are mutually reinforcing."
https://openalex.org/W2033325995,"A Drosophila model for Huntington's and other polyglutamine diseases was used to screen for genetic factors modifying the degeneration caused by expression of polyglutamine in the eye. Among 7000 P-element insertions, several suppressor strains were isolated, two of which led to the discovery of the suppressor genes described here. The predicted product of one, dHDJ1, is homologous to human heat shock protein 40/HDJ1. That of the second, dTPR2, is homologous to the human tetratricopeptide repeat protein 2. Each of these molecules contains a chaperone-related J domain. Their suppression of polyglutamine toxicity was verified in transgenic flies."
https://openalex.org/W2079940855,"Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of taste perception in animals, particularly the initial events of taste signaling. A large and diverse family of seven transmembrane domain proteins was identified from the Drosophila genome database with a computer algorithm that identifies proteins on the basis of structure. Eighteen of 19 genes examined were expressed in the Drosophila labellum, a gustatory organ of the proboscis. Expression was not detected in a variety of other tissues. The genes were not expressed in the labellum of a Drosophila mutant, pox-neuro70, in which taste neurons are eliminated. Tissue specificity of expression of these genes, along with their structural similarity, supports the possibility that the family encodes a large and divergent family of taste receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2104652753,Topography and gravity measured by the Mars Global Surveyor have enabled determination of the global crust and upper mantle structure of Mars. The planet displays two distinct crustal zones that do not correlate globally with the geologic dichotomy: a region of crust that thins progressively from south to north and encompasses much of the southern highlands and Tharsis province and a region of approximately uniform crustal thickness that includes the northern lowlands and Arabia Terra. The strength of the lithosphere beneath the ancient southern highlands suggests that the northern hemisphere was a locus of high heat flow early in martian history. The thickness of the elastic lithosphere increases with time of loading in the northern plains and Tharsis. The northern lowlands contain structures interpreted as large buried channels that are consistent with northward transport of water and sediment to the lowlands before the end of northern hemisphere resurfacing.
https://openalex.org/W2050425822,"A new species of Archaea grows at pH ∼0.5 and ∼40°C in slime streamers and attached to pyrite surfaces at a sulfide ore body, Iron Mountain, California. This iron-oxidizing Archaeon is capable of growth at pH 0. This species represents a dominant prokaryote in the environment studied (slimes and sediments) and constituted up to 85% of the microbial community when solution concentrations were high (conductivity of 100 to 160 millisiemens per centimeter). The presence of this and other closely related Thermoplasmales suggests that these acidophiles are important contributors to acid mine drainage and may substantially impact iron and sulfur cycles."

https://openalex.org/W1991506501,"The first artery and vein of the vertebrate embryo assemble in the trunk by migration and coalescence of angioblasts to form endothelial tubes. The gridlock ( grl ) mutation in zebrafish selectively perturbs assembly of the artery (the aorta). Here it is shown that grl encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein belonging to the Hairy/Enhancer of the split family of bHLH proteins. The grl gene is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm before vessel formation, and thereafter in the aorta and not in the vein. These results suggest that the arterial endothelial identity is established even before the onset of blood flow and implicate the grl gene in assignment of vessel-specific cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1975269220,"Neuropilins are receptors for class 3 secreted semaphorins, most of which can function as potent repulsive axon guidance cues. We have generated mice with a targeted deletion in the neuropilin-2 (Npn-2) locus. Many Npn-2 mutant mice are viable into adulthood, allowing us to assess the role of Npn-2 in axon guidance events throughout neural development. Npn-2 is required for the organization and fasciculation of several cranial nerves and spinal nerves. In addition, several major fiber tracts in the brains of adult mutant mice are either severely disorganized or missing. Our results show that Npn-2 is a selective receptor for class 3 semaphorins in vivo and that Npn-1 and Npn-2 are required for development of an overlapping but distinct set of CNS and PNS projections."

https://openalex.org/W2015285707,"The auxiliary beta subunit is essential for functional expression of high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. This effect is partly mediated by a facilitation of the intracellular trafficking of alpha1 subunit toward the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that the I-II loop of the alpha1 subunit contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal that severely restricts the plasma membrane incorporation of alpha1 subunit. Coimmunolabeling reveals that the I-II loop restricts expression of a chimera CD8-I-II protein to the ER. The beta subunit reverses the inhibition imposed by the retention signal. Extensive deletion of this retention signal in full-length alpha1 subunit facilitates the cell surface expression of the channel in the absence of beta subunit. Our data suggest that the beta subunit favors Ca2+ channel plasma membrane expression by inhibiting an expression brake contained in beta-binding alpha1 sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2117620907,"Neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 bind differentially to different class 3 semaphorins and are thought to provide the ligand-binding moieties in receptor complexes mediating repulsive responses to these semaphorins. Here, we have studied the function of neuropilin-2 through analysis of a neuropilin-2 mutant mouse, which is viable and fertile. Repulsive responses of sympathetic and hippocampal neurons to Sema3F but not to Sema3A are abolished in the mutant. Marked defects are observed in the development of several cranial nerves, in the initial central projections of spinal sensory axons, and in the anterior commissure, habenulo-interpeduncular tract, and the projections of hippocampal mossyfiber axons in the infrapyramidal bundle. Our results show that neuropilin-2 is an essential component of the Sema3F receptor and identify key roles for neuropilin-2 in axon guidance in the PNS and CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2020340826,"The master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) is composed of multiple, single-cell circadian clocks. We test the postulate that these individual “clock cells” can be synchronized to each other by the inhibitory transmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). For these experiments, we monitored the firing rate rhythm of individual clock cells on fixed multielectrode plates in culture and tested the effects of GABA. The results show that the daily variation in responsiveness of the SCN to phase-shifting agents is manifested at the level of individual neurons. Moreover, GABA, acting through A-type receptors, can both phase shift and synchronize clock cells. We propose that GABA is an important synchronizer of SCN neurons in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2071635724,"The relationship between adhesive interactions across the synaptic cleft and synaptic function has remained elusive. At certain CNS synapses, pre- to postsynaptic adhesion is mediated at least in part by neural (N-) cadherin. Here, we demonstrate that upon depolarization of hippocampal neurons in culture by K+ treatment, or application of NMDA or α-latrotoxin, synaptic N-cadherin dimerizes and becomes markedly protease resistant. These properties are indices of strong, stable, enhanced cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion. N-cadherin retained protease resistance for at least 2 hr after recovery, while other surface molecules, including other cadherins, were completely degraded. The acquisition of protease resistance and dimerization of N-cadherin is not dependent on new protein synthesis, nor is it accompanied by internalization of N-cadherin. By immunocytochemistry, we found that high K+ selectively induces surface dispersion of N-cadherin, which, after recovery, returns to synaptic puncta. N-cadherin dispersion under K+ treatment parallels the rapid expansion of the presynaptic membrane consequent to the massive vesicle fusion that occurs with this type of depolarization. In contrast, with NMDA application, N-cadherin does not disperse but does acquire enhanced protease resistance and dimerizes. Our data strongly suggest that synaptic adhesion is dynamically and locally controlled, and modulated by synaptic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1524602398,"Major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) proteins are used to display, on the surface of a cell, peptides derived from foreign material — such as a virus — that is infecting that cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes then recognize and kill the infected cell. The HIV-1 Nef protein downregulates the cell-surface expression of class I MHC proteins, and probably thereby promotes immune evasion by HIV-1. In the presence of Nef, class I MHC molecules are relocalized from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Here we show that Nef-induced downregulation of MHC-I expression and MHC-I targeting to the TGN require the binding of Nef to PACS-1, a molecule that controls the TGN localization of the cellular protein furin. This interaction is dependent on Nef’s cluster of acidic amino acids. A chimaeric integral membrane protein containing Nef as its cytoplasmic domain localizes to the TGN after internalization, in an acidic-cluster- and PACS-1-dependent manner. These results support a model in which Nef relocalizes MHC-I by acting as a connector between MHC-I’s cytoplasmic tail and the PACS-1-dependent protein-sorting pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2068488653,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) signaling has been implicated in inductive interactions between pre- and postsynaptic partners during synaptogenesis. We used gene targeting to selectively disrupt ysteine-ich omain– (CRD-) containing NRG-1 isoforms. In CRD-NRG-1−/− mice, peripheral projections defasciculated and displayed aberrant branching patterns within their targets. Motor nerve terminals were transiently associated with broad bands of postsynaptic ACh receptor (AChR) clusters. Initially, Schwann cell precursors accompanied peripheral projections, but later, Schwann cells were absent from axons in the periphery. Following initial stages of synapse formation, sensory and motor nerves withdrew and degenerated. Our data demonstrate the essential role of CRD-NRG-1-mediated signaling for coordinating nerve, target, and Schwann cell interactions in the normal maintenance of peripheral synapses, and ultimately in the survival of CRD-NRG-1-expressing neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1970539905,"Piccolo is a novel component of the presynaptic cytoskeletal matrix (PCM) assembled at the active zone of neurotransmitter release. Analysis of its primary structure reveals that Piccolo is a multidomain zinc finger protein structurally related to Bassoon, another PCM protein. Both proteins were found to be shared components of glutamatergic and GABAergic CNS synapses but not of the cholinergic neuromuscular junction. The Piccolo zinc fingers were found to interact with the dual prenylated rab3A and VAMP2/Synaptobrevin II receptor PRA1. We show that PRA1 is a synaptic vesicle–associated protein that is colocalized with Piccolo in nerve terminals of hippocampal primary neurons. These data suggest that Piccolo plays a role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the active zone."

Here, 155 spherules separated from 1 gram of Apollo 14 soil were analyzed using this technique. The data show that over the last approximately 3.5 billion years, the cratering rate decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 to a low about 500 to 600 million years ago, then increased by a factor of 3.7 +/- 1.2 in the last 400 million years. This latter period coincided with rapid biotic evolutionary radiation on Earth."

https://openalex.org/W2001252937,"The mle(napts) mutation causes temperature-dependent blockade of action potentials resulting from decreased abundance of para-encoded Na+ channels. Although maleless (mle) encodes a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) helicase, exactly how mle(napts) affects para expression remained uncertain. Here, we show that para transcripts undergo adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing via a mechanism that apparently requires dsRNA secondary structure formation encompassing the edited exon and the downstream intron. In an mle(napts) background, >80% of para transcripts are aberrant, owing to internal deletions that include the edited exon. We propose that the Mle helicase is required to resolve the dsRNA structure and that failure to do so in an mle(napts) background causes exon skipping because the normal splice donor is occluded. These results explain how mlen(napts) affects Na+ channel expression and provide new insights into the mechanism of RNA editing."
https://openalex.org/W1990293683,"The role of the target cell in neurotrophin-induced modifications of glutamatergic synaptic transmission was examined in cultured hippocampal neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced rapid and persistent potentiation of evoked glutamate release when the postsynaptic neuron was glutamatergic, or excitatory (E-->E), but not when it was GABAergic, or inhibitory (E-->1). This target-specific action of BDNF was also found at divergent outputs of a single presynaptic neuron innervating both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, suggesting that individual terminals can be independently modified. Surprisingly, BDNF increased the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents at both E-->E and E-->I, although it had no effect on evoked currents at E-->I. Finally, potentiation by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) was also target specific. The selective effect at E-->E suggests that retrograde signaling by the postsynaptic target cell endows a localized presynaptic action of neurotrophins."
https://openalex.org/W1968887322,"In a variety of organisms, early neurogenesis requires the function of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. For the Drosophila PNS, such transcription factors are encoded by the proneural genes (atonal and the achaete-scute complex, AS-C). We have identified a proneural gene, amos, that has strong similarity with atonal in its bHLH domain. We present evidence that amos is required for olfactory sensilla and is regulated by the prepattern gene lozenge. Between them, amos, atonal, and the AS-C can potentially account for the origin of the entire PNS."

https://openalex.org/W2025764899,"Mitochondria are thought to be important in clearing calcium from synaptic terminals. It is unclear, however, whether the principal role of mitochondria in presynaptic calcium handling is to take up Ca2+ directly or to fuel Ca2+ removal by other mechanisms. We used patch clamp techniques and fluorescence imaging to examine calcium clearance mechanisms, including mitochondrial uptake, in single synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons. We found that extrusion through the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump of the plasma membrane is the dominant form of Ca2+ removal in the synaptic terminal. Calcium uptake into mitochondria was sometimes evident with large Ca2+ loads but was consistently observed only when plasma membrane extrusion was inhibited. We conclude that mitochondria act primarily as an energy source in clearance of Ca2+ from bipolar cell synaptic terminals."

Active regions are the centers of energetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, whose resulting electromagnetic and particle radiation interfere with telecommunications and power transmissions on Earth and can pose significant hazards to astronauts and spacecraft. Synoptic seismic imaging of far-side solar activity will now allow anticipation of the appearance of large active regions more than a week ahead of their arrival on the east solar limb."
https://openalex.org/W2023431446,"Retroviral infection involves continued genetic variation, leading to phenotypic and immunological selection for more fit virus variants in the host. For retroviruses that cause immunodeficiency, pathogenesis is linked to the emergence of T cell-tropic, cytopathic viruses. Here we show that an immunodeficiency-inducing, T cell-tropic feline leukemia virus (FeLV) has evolved such that it cannot infect cells unless both a classic multiple membrane-spanning receptor molecule (Pit1) and a second coreceptor or entry factor are present. This second receptor component, which we call FeLIX, was identified as an endogenously expressed protein that is similar to a portion of the FeLV envelope protein. This cellular protein can function either as a transmembrane protein or as a soluble component to facilitate infection."
https://openalex.org/W2029404915,"Bipolar cells in the vertebrate retina have been characterized as nonspiking interneurons. Using patch-clamp recordings from goldfish retinal slices, we find, however, that the morphologically well-defined Mb1 bipolar cell is capable of generating spikes. Surprisingly, in dark-adapted retina, spikes were reliably evoked by light flashes and had a long (1–2 s) refractory period. In light-adapted retina, most Mb1 cells did not spike. However, an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist could induce periodic spiking in these cells. Spikes were determined to be Ca2+ action potentials triggered at the axon terminal and were abolished by 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB), an agonist that mimics glutamate. Signaling via spikes in a specific class of bipolar cells may serve to accelerate and amplify small photoreceptor signals, thereby securing the synaptic transmission of dim and rapidly changing visual input."
https://openalex.org/W2087513467,"In the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, proneural genes direct the formation of different types of sensory organs. Here, we show that amos is a novel proneural gene that promotes multiple dendritic (MD) neuron formation. amos encodes a basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein of the Atonal family. During embryonic development, amos is expressed in patches of ectodermal cells, and the expression is quickly restricted to sensory organ precursors. Loss of amos function eliminates MD neurons that remain in ASC;atonal mutants. Misexpression of amos generates ectopic MD and other types of neurons. Amos interacts with the ubiquitously expressed Daughter-less protein in vivo and in vitro. Our final misexpression experiments suggest that a domain located outside the DNA-binding domain of Amos determines the MD neuronal specificity."
https://openalex.org/W40893751,"Syntaxin-1 is a key component of the synaptic vesicle docking/fusion machinery that forms the SNARE complex with VAMP/synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. Identifying proteins that modulate SNARE complex formation is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. We have cloned and characterized a protein called syntaphilin that is selectively expressed in brain. Syntaphilin competes with SNAP-25 for binding to syntaxin-1 and inhibits SNARE complex formation by absorbing free syntaxin-1. Transient overexpression of syntaphilin in cultured hippocampal neurons significantly reduces neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, introduction of syntaphilin into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture inhibits synaptic transmission. These findings suggest that syntaphilin may function as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 availability for the assembly of the SNARE complex, and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2104802955,"Anterior forebrain (AF) neurons become selective for song as songbirds learn to produce a copy of a memorized tutor song. We report that development of selectivity is compromised when birds are prevented from matching their output to the tutor song. Finches with denervated vocal organs developed stable song, but it usually did not resemble the tutor song. In those birds, numerous neurons in Area X responded selectively to both tutor and bird's own song (BOS), indicating the importance of both in shaping AF responses. The degree of selectivity for BOS was less, however, than that of normal adults. In contrast, neurons in denervated birds that successfully mimicked tutor song exhibited normal adult selectivity for BOS. Thus, during sensorimotor learning, selectivity for complex stimuli may be influenced by how well motor output matches internal sensory models."
https://openalex.org/W2060801215,"Although nerve growth factor (NGF) is a crucial factor in the activity-dependent development and plasticity of visual cortex, its role in synaptic efficacy changes is largely undefined. We demonstrate that the maintenance phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) is blocked by local application of exogenous NGF in rat visual cortex at an early stage of postnatal development. Long-term depression (LTD) and bidirectional plasticity are unaffected. At later postnatal ages, blockade of either endogenous NGF by immunoadhesin (TrkA-IgG) or TrkA receptors by monoclonal antibody rescues LTP. Muscarinic receptor activation/inhibition suggests that LTP dependence on NGF is mediated by the cholinergic system. These results indicate that NGF regulates synaptic strength in well-characterized cortical circuitries."
