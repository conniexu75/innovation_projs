By hyperspectral-stimulated Raman scattering imaging of single living cells and mass spectrometry analysis of extracted lipids, we report here significantly increased levels of unsaturated lipids in ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) as compared to non-CSCs. Higher lipid unsaturation levels were also detected in CSC-enriched spheroids compared to monolayer cultures of ovarian cancer cell lines or primary cells. Inhibition of lipid desaturases effectively eliminated CSCs, suppressed sphere formation in vitro, and blocked tumor initiation capacity in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) directly regulates the expression levels of lipid desaturases, and inhibition of desaturases blocks NF-κB signaling. Collectively, our findings reveal that increased lipid unsaturation is a metabolic marker for ovarian CSCs and a target for CSC-specific therapy."

As a countermeasure, numerous phages are known that produce proteins to block the function of class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems. However, currently no proteins are known to inhibit the widely used class 2 CRISPR-Cas9 system. To find these inhibitors, we searched cas9-containing bacterial genomes for the co-existence of a CRISPR spacer and its target, a potential indicator for CRISPR inhibition. This analysis led to the discovery of four unique type II-A CRISPR-Cas9 inhibitor proteins encoded by Listeria monocytogenes prophages. More than half of L. monocytogenes strains with cas9 contain at least one prophage-encoded inhibitor, suggesting widespread CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation. Two of these inhibitors also blocked the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 when assayed in Escherichia coli and human cells. These natural Cas9-specific ""anti-CRISPRs"" present tools that can be used to regulate the genome engineering activities of CRISPR-Cas9."

It has been suggested that an increase in the proliferative potential of neural progenitors (NPs) underlies the expansion of the cortex and its convoluted appearance. Here we show that increasing NP proliferation induces expansion and folding in an in vitro model of human corticogenesis. Deletion of PTEN stimulates proliferation and generates significantly larger and substantially folded cerebral organoids. This genetic modification allows sustained cell cycle re-entry, expansion of the progenitor population, and delayed neuronal differentiation, all key features of the developing human cortex. In contrast, Pten deletion in mouse organoids does not lead to folding. Finally, we utilized the expanded cerebral organoids to show that infection with Zika virus impairs cortical growth and folding.

Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating the structure and organization of the human cortex. A massive increase in the size of the human cerebral neocortex is accompanied by the expansion of the cortical area, and the associated emergence of extensive cortical folding (Bystron et al., 2008Bystron I.

In the developing human cerebral cortex, radial glial cells, residing in both the ventricular zone (VZ) and the later-formed sub-ventricular zone (SVZ), give rise to intermediate progenitors and, ultimately, post-mitotic neurons (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H.

Neurons in rhesus monkey visual cortex: systematic relation between time of origin and eventual disposition.Science. 1974; 183: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Compared with mice, the developing cortex of humans and other gyrencephalic mammals harbor a larger VZ and SVZ, which are composed of substantially more radial glial cells and intermediate progenitors (Hansen et al., 2010Hansen D.V.

Whether this increase in neural progenitor (NP) population is directly responsible for the expansion of the human cortex and the evolutionary transformation of a smooth, unfolded cortex to a profoundly folded one remains mostly untested, in no small part because of the inaccessible nature of the developing human cortex. However, recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell technology (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Okita K. Nakagawa M. Yamanaka S.

Starting with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells, we have recently reported the generation of cerebral organoids that self-organize into neuralized structures resembling the early developing human cerebral cortex (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A. Wenzel D. Bicknell L.S. Hurles M.E. Homfray T. Penninger J.M. Jackson A.P. Knoblich J.A. Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly.Nature. 2013; 501: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). These in vitro-derived neural tissues recapitulate early stages of cortical formation and display human-specific features such as the outer SVZ. Therefore, human cerebral organoids represent a novel method to investigate the molecular, cellular, and anatomical paradigms of early human cortical development. Cortical folding can be experimentally induced in the developing mouse brain by β-catenin overexpression (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A.

Differential regulation of NP proliferation may also contribute to human-specific cortical pattern formation (Bae et al., 2014Bae B.I. Tietjen I. Atabay K.D. Evrony G.D. Johnson M.B. Asare E.

Interestingly, multiple lines of evidence have converged to suggest a physiological involvement of growth factor signaling in regulating human-specific cortical expansion and folding. Introduction of FGF2 into the developing mouse cortex leads to regional formation of gyri (Rash et al., 2013Rash B.G. Tomasi S. Lim H.D. Suh C.Y. Vaccarino F.M. Cortical gyrification induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 in the mouse brain.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10802-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and human fetal cortical transcriptome revealed progenitor-specific enrichment of platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) (Lui et al., 2014Lui J.H. Nowakowski T.J. Pollen A.A. Javaherian A. Kriegstein A.R. Oldham M.C. Radial glia require PDGFD-PDGFRβ signalling in human but not mouse neocortex.Nature. 2014; 515: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Existing human genetic evidence strongly suggests that growth factor signaling, in particular through the PTEN-AKT cascade, regulates human cortical formation. Pathological development of a larger brain (megalencephaly) and/or increased gyrification (polymicrogyria) have been linked to mutations that activate the pathway in genes such as AKT3, PTEN, PIK3CA, and PIK3R2 (DiLiberti, 1998DiLiberti J.H.

Genetically modified mice carrying corresponding mutations were shown to mimic, but frequently to a lesser extent, aspects of the phenotypes displayed by human patients. For example, although AKT3-activating mutations have been linked to human macrocephaly and polymicrogyria (Lee et al., 2012Lee J.H. Huynh M. Silhavy J.L. Kim S. Dixon-Salazar T. Heiberg A. Scott E.

Mahaffey C.L. Monks B. Faulkner C.R. Birnbaum M.J. Danzer S.C. Frankel W.N. A novel Akt3 mutation associated with enhanced kinase activity and seizure susceptibility in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 988-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, Pten mutant mice also displayed macrocephaly without increased gyrification (Groszer et al., 2001Groszer M. Erickson R.

Such phenotypic differences may reflect inherent species differences in signaling regulation, cellular response, and anatomical organization. Therefore, the human genetic evidence strongly suggests an intrinsic and possibly preferential dependence of human NPs on the growth factor signaling cascade. In the present study, we investigated the direct effect of enhancing human NP proliferation on cortical formation in a 3D cerebral organoid system. We chose the PTEN gene because of the human genetics evidence demonstrating its function in cortical development and a substantial body of literature on its role in regulating progenitor cells of various lineages (Hill and Wu, 2009Hill R. Wu H. PTEN, stem cells, and cancer stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11755-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PTEN heterozygous loss-of-function mutations have been associated with human macrocephaly (Butler et al., 2005Butler M.G. Dasouki M.J. Zhou X.P. Talebizadeh Z. Brown M. Takahashi T.N. Miles J.H. Wang C.H. Stratton R. Pilarski R. Eng C. Subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorders and extreme macrocephaly associated with germline PTEN tumour suppressor gene mutations.J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, Marchese et al., 2014Marchese M. Conti V. Valvo G. Moro F. Muratori F. Tancredi R. Santorelli F.M. Guerrini R. Sicca F. Autism-epilepsy phenotype with macrocephaly suggests PTEN, but not GLIALCAM, genetic screening.BMC Med. Genet. 2014; 15: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the current 3D cerebral organoid system, PTEN homozygous mutation was adopted to drive the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. Indeed, deletion of the PTEN gene increased AKT activity in human NPs, promoted cell cycle re-entry, and transiently delayed neuronal differentiation, resulting in a marked expansion of the radial glia and intermediate progenitor population. Both human and mouse organoids that lacked PTEN showed a significant increase in size, but only human organoids displayed substantial surface folding. The degree of expansion and folding was regulated by further tuning the strength of AKT signaling with reduced signaling resulting in smaller and smooth organoids and increased signaling in larger and more folded organoids. These findings lend support to the notion that an increase in the proliferative potential of NPs contributes to the expansion of the human cerebral neocortex and the emergence of surface folding. Last, in light of the current global health emergency regarding Zika virus (ZIKV), we applied the expanded cerebral organoid culture system to investigate a possible link between ZIKV exposure and cortical malformations such as microcephaly and lissencephaly. To disrupt the human PTEN gene, single guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to target the first exon (Figure 1A), mimicking a recently reported macrocephalic patient mutation (Figure S1A; Marchese et al., 2014Marchese M. Conti V. Valvo G. Moro F. Muratori F. Tancredi R. Santorelli F.M. Guerrini R. Sicca F. Autism-epilepsy phenotype with macrocephaly suggests PTEN, but not GLIALCAM, genetic screening.BMC Med. Genet. 2014; 15: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). WIBR3, a previously well characterized hESC line (Lengner et al., 2010Lengner C.J. Gimelbrant A.A. Erwin J.A. Cheng A.W. Guenther M.G. Welstead G.G. Alagappan R. Frampton G.M. Xu P. Muffat J. et al.Derivation of pre-X inactivation human embryonic stem cells under physiological oxygen concentrations.Cell. 2010; 141: 872-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), was targeted to generate homozygous frameshift mutations using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 (Figure 1A). The absence of PTEN protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Using the same approach, two additional hESC lines (WIBR1 and WIBR2) were also targeted to generate mutant clones on these independent genetic backgrounds (Figures S1B–S1G). PTEN and its downstream signaling pathway are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of various stem/progenitor populations, but little is known of its function in the developing human brain. Analysis of the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain revealed that PTEN expression is low in the VZ/SVZ and high in the cortical plate, where differentiated neurons reside, a pattern inversely correlated with the progenitor markers PAX6 and TBR2 (Figures S1H–S1K). Similarly, in vitro-derived human NPs express less PTEN compared with neurons, suggesting a possible physiological involvement during normal human neural development (Figure S1L). In a 2D adherent culture system, PTEN mutant human NPs displayed a significantly higher growth rate in response to low basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (1–5 ng/ml; Figure 1C) and a higher level of cell cycle re-entry, as revealed by 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase assay and Ki67 co-staining (Figures 1D and 1E). Control and mutant NPs had similar proliferation rates in the presence of high bFGF or in the absence of bFGF (Figure 1E). Enhanced proliferation of mutant NPs was also observed in response to low concentrations of PDGF-DD and IGF2, two growth factors implicated in regulating fetal cortical growth (Lehtinen et al., 2011Lehtinen M.K. Zappaterra M.W. Chen X. Yang Y.J. Hill A.D. Lun M. Maynard T. Gonzalez D. Kim S.

Radial glia require PDGFD-PDGFRβ signalling in human but not mouse neocortex.Nature. 2014; 515: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Figures S1N and S1O). To investigate the effect of PTEN deletion on human neural development in a more complex setting, we adopted the cerebral organoid culture system (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A. Wenzel D. Bicknell L.S. Hurles M.E. Homfray T. Penninger J.M. Jackson A.P. Knoblich J.A. Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly.Nature. 2013; 501: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, hESCs, when differentiated into 3D neural tissues, grew in volume over time and displayed discrete lineage identity (Figures S2A–S2C). At 4 weeks, the organoids were composed mostly of Nestin+ NPs showing a typical radial glial morphology with processes contacting both the apical and basal surfaces of the neuroepithelium. At 8 weeks, these NPs underwent neuronal differentiation and generated a distinct layer of DCX+ neurons located exclusively away from the ventricle, consistent with the apical-basal axis of neural migration (Figure S2C). At 12 weeks and beyond, Nestin+ NPs had greatly diminished, and the organoids were mainly composed of differentiated neurons and glia (Figures S2D and S2E). In wild-type human organoids, PTEN gene expression was lower at earlier stages and increased as the organoids differentiated and matured (Figure S1M). To compare organoid formation of PTEN mutant and isogenic control hESCs, equal numbers of dissociated single cells were seeded to form embryoid bodies (EBs). Both control and mutant WIBR3 hESCs generated EBs with comparable overall morphology after 1 week (Figure S3A). At 4 weeks, although control organoids were relatively spherical and smooth, PTEN mutant organoids displayed a markedly increased outgrowth of neuroepithelial tissue surrounding ventricle-like structures (Figure 1F). Neuroepithelial overgrowth was even more evident in mutant organoids at 6 and 8 weeks and led to a drastic increase in size and an overall folded surface (Figure 1F). To better visualize and quantify their 3D morphology, we imaged the organoids on a light sheet fluorescence microscope (Figure 1G). PTEN mutants displayed a markedly increased surface area, overall volume, and reduced sphericity compared with controls (Figures 1G–1I). The increases in volume and surface area were separately validated on histological sections (Figure 1J; Figures S3B and S3C). Because the increased surface area was often organized in continuous folds, we further demonstrate a significant increase in fold density in mutant organoids (Figures 1K and 1L). The expansion and folding phenotype was fully penetrant and present in all WIBR3 PTEN mutant organoids examined across multiple independent experiments (Figures S3D and S3E) as well as in PTEN mutant organoids generated from WIBR1 and WIBR2 hESCs (Figures S4A–S4C). We explored the potential difference between mouse and human cortical development by generating cerebral organoids from control and Pten mutant mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting was used to disrupt the first exon of the Pten gene in V6.5 mESCs (Figures S4D and S4E). Three controls and three homozygous frameshift mutants were selected based on genomic sequence and loss of full-length PTEN protein (Figures 2A; Figure S4D). Equal numbers of dissociated single mESCs were used to generate mouse organoids, following an adapted protocol that utilizes similar media and culturing methods as that for human organoids (Eiraku et al., 2008Eiraku M.

Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly.Nature. 2013; 501: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). Compared with controls, Pten mutant mouse organoids became progressively larger but remained smooth throughout development with no surface folds (Figures 2B and 2C; Figure S4F). Imaging using a light sheet fluorescence microscope and subsequent quantification demonstrated that Pten mutant mouse organoids had increased overall volume but no change in sphericity compared with controls (Figures 2D and 2E). No detectable change in fold density was present in Pten mutant mouse organoids (Figure 2F). We investigated the cellular organizations that underlie the expansion and folding of the PTEN mutant human cerebral organoids. At 4 weeks, both control and mutant human organoids were composed of units of continuous neuroepithelium, as revealed by Nestin staining. PTEN mutants contained an array of large and sometimes folded neuroepithelial structures (Figure 3A) that expressed NP markers such as Nestin, Pax6, and Sox2 (Figures 3B and 3C). Because the original organoid culture condition provides minimal patterning cues and relies on the intrinsic capacity of hESCs to differentiate into the neural lineage, the majority of the organoids adopt a forebrain identity, as shown by their expression of Pax6 (Figure 3B) and FoxG1 (Figure 7G), but markers of other brain regions can also be observed (Figure S4G). To examine whether organoid expansion and folding can occur from a brain region-specific cellular population, we pre-patterned the EBs specifically toward the dorsal forebrain fate (Li et al., 2013Li Y.

Treatment with dorsomorphin during the first 7 or 14 days of culture promoted the generation of a dorsal forebrain identity and suppressed markers of other lineages (Figures 3E and 3F; Figures S4H and S4I). At 6 weeks, pre-patterned control forebrain organoids grew to a similar shape and size as un-patterned organoids. Likewise, pre-patterned PTEN mutant human forebrain organoids grew larger than controls and developed complex surface folds (Figures 3D and 3G; Figure S4J). Both control and mutant human organoids contained neuroepithelia organized in a stereotypic manner reminiscent of the early developing cortex, where Ki67+ NPs proliferated at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (Figure 4A). Compared with controls, PTEN mutant human organoids harbored significantly more Ki67+ cells at multiple developmental time points (Figures 4A and 4B), further confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure S5A). Increased proliferation was also observed in PTEN mutant organoids derived from WIBR1 and WIBR2 hESCs (Figures S5B–S5D). The enhanced proliferation was prolonged and most prominent at 4–8 weeks and declined over time, with both the control and mutant displaying minimal mitotic activity at 24 weeks (Figure S5A). To investigate the correlation of proliferation and the physical bending of the developing neuroepithelium in PTEN mutant human organoids, we measured the distribution of Ki67+ dividing cells relative to their position. We found that areas of the neuroepithelium with an outward curvature contained a significantly higher proportion of proliferating cells compared with un-curved areas (Figures S5E and S5F). This is consistent with the notion that differential proliferation can propel physical buckling and the formation of a curved structure (Kriegstein et al., 2006Kriegstein A. Noctor S. Martínez-Cerdeño V. Patterns of neural stem and progenitor cell division may underlie evolutionary cortical expansion.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Lastly, we found a comparable number and distribution of apoptotic cells within the VZ of control and PTEN mutant human organoids (Figures S5G and S5H). In PTEN mutant human organoids, the increase in proliferation coincided with an expansion of the NP pool, as shown by qRT-PCR for radial glia and the intermediate progenitor markers PAX6, ARHGAP11B (Florio et al., 2015Florio M.

Thus, the LTMR-RZ is a somatosensory processing region endowed with a neuronal complexity that rivals the retina and functions to pattern the activity of ascending touch pathways that underlie tactile perception. The somatosensory system decodes a wide range of tactile stimuli, thereby endowing us with an extraordinary capacity for object recognition, texture discrimination, and fine motor control. The anatomical substrate of innocuous touch perception is rooted in the intricate innervation patterns of physiologically distinct and morphologically specialized sensory neurons, termed low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs). The unique morphological and anatomical arrangement of LTMR subtype endings in the skin, our largest sensory organ, underlies distinct LTMR subtype response properties for the perception of object size, shape, texture, vibration, and direction of stimulus movement (Owens and Lumpkin, 2014Owens D.M. Lumpkin E.A. Diversification and specialization of touch receptors in skin.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Zimmerman et al., 2014Zimmerman A. Bai L. Ginty D.D. The gentle touch receptors of mammalian skin.Science. 2014; 346: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). LTMRs also confer complex social and emotional, or affective qualities of touch (Olausson et al., 2002Olausson H. Lamarre Y. Backlund H. Morin C. Wallin B.G. Starck G. Ekholm S. Strigo I. Worsley K. Vallbo A.B. Bushnell M.C. Unmyelinated tactile afferents signal touch and project to insular cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cutaneous LTMR subtypes are classified as Aβ, Aδ, or C based on their action potential conduction velocity (Horch et al., 1977Horch K.W. Tuckett R.P. Burgess P.R. A key to the classification of cutaneous mechanoreceptors.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1977; 69: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). LTMRs are further distinguished by their preferred stimuli, the cutaneous end organs with which they associate, and by their rates of adaptation to constant indentation of the skin. In mouse hairy skin, guard hair follicles are associated with Aβ RA-LTMRs, Aβ SAI-LTMRs, and Aβ Field-LTMRs, which are differentially sensitive to hair deflection, skin indentation, and stroke and exhibit different rates of adaptation (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E.

Conversely, Awl/Auchene and zigzag hair follicles, which together account for ∼99% of hair follicles across the body, are quadruply innervated by Aβ RA-LTMRs, Aβ Field-LTMRs, Aδ-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs and triply innervated by Aβ Field-LTMRs, Aδ-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs, respectively (Bai et al., 2015Bai L. Lehnert B.P. Liu J. Neubarth N.L. Dickendesher T.L. Nwe P.H. Cassidy C. Woodbury C.J. Ginty D.D.

Koerber H.R. et al.The functional organization of cutaneous low-threshold mechanosensory neurons.Cell. 2011; 147: 1615-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In contrast to hairy skin, the light touch receptors of glabrous skin include Aβ RA1-LTMRs, Aβ RA2-LTMRs, Aβ SA1-LTMRs, and Aβ SA2-LTMRs (Johnson and Hsiao, 1992Johnson K.O. Hsiao S.S. Neural mechanisms of tactual form and texture perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Ensembles of LTMR activities emanating from the skin convey tactile information via central projections to the spinal cord and brainstem. Thus, the perception of diverse tactile stimuli requires robust and precise mechanical stimulus detection by LTMR peripheral endings in the skin and intricate processing capabilities of LTMR activity ensembles by interneurons in the CNS. Defining the cellular and synaptic substrates of touch information processing in the CNS will reveal how LTMR activity ensembles, internal state, and experience are integrated to generate percepts of the physical world. The historical, canonical view of innocuous, discriminative touch information processing in the CNS has emphasized the “direct dorsal column pathway,” in which Aβ-LTMR axonal branches project directly, via the dorsal column, to the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN) where second-order neurons project to the thalamus, and from there to the somatosensory cortex (Johnson and Hsiao, 1992Johnson K.O. Hsiao S.S. Neural mechanisms of tactual form and texture perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the classic “labeled line” model, LTMR subtype integration and processing begins in the somatosensory cortex, with the spinal cord, DCN and thalamus serving as relay stations. An alternate model posits an integrative somatosensory system in which touch information processing begins at the earliest stages of sensory neuron input to the CNS. In the visual system, for example, we now appreciate the retina as a key locus of visual information processing, with retinal ganglion cells conveying highly processed visual information from the retina to a large number of brain regions (Masland, 2001Masland R.H. The fundamental plan of the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In an analogous, emerging view of the somatosensory system, the spinal cord dorsal horn mirrors the retina by playing a key role in processing innocuous touch information delivered from LMTR activity ensembles. In support of this idea, only a subset of LTMRs extends an axonal branch via the dorsal column to the DCN, while all LTMRs exhibit axonal branches that terminate in the dorsal horn, including regions devoid of projection neurons, in a highly somatotopic manner (Li et al., 2011Li L. Rutlin M. Abraira V.E. Cassidy C. Kus L. Gong S. Jankowski M.P. Luo W. Heintz N. Koerber H.R. et al.The functional organization of cutaneous low-threshold mechanosensory neurons.Cell. 2011; 147: 1615-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, “indirect,” or post-synaptic, ascending pathways are likely to convey processed and perceptually relevant innocuous touch information from the dorsal horn to the brain. However, the neural substrates and mechanisms of LTMR ensemble integration and processing in the dorsal horn, and the functions of dorsal horn LTMR-recipient zone (LTMR-RZ) interneurons and post-synaptic ascending pathways in touch perception are poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to define the organizational logic of the spinal cord LTMR-RZ and its role in innocuous touch information processing and tactile perception. Through an open-ended screen to identify genes that are uniquely expressed in select LTMR-RZ neuronal subtypes, and exploitation of these genes for the generation of an array of mouse molecular-genetic tools, we found within the LTMR-RZ seven excitatory and four inhibitory interneuron subtypes, each displaying a unique combination of morphological and physiological properties. Moreover, the generation of an excitatory synaptic atlas of the LTMR-RZ revealed that LTMR subtypes form synapses onto four to 11 LTMR-RZ interneuron subtypes. Each of the 11 LTMR-RZ interneuron subtypes receives convergent synaptic inputs from at least one to three LTMR subtypes, as well as other locally projecting LTMR-RZ interneurons and corticospinal projection neurons. We also found that LTMR-RZ interneurons play essential roles in innocuous touch perception and tune the responses of postsynaptic ascending projection pathway neurons that convey touch information from the spinal cord to the brain. Thus, the LTMR-RZ is a complex and highly interconnected locus of LTMR and cortical input integration that orchestrates the activity of postsynaptic ascending pathways required for innocuous touch perception. We localized initial sites of innocuous touch information processing by visualizing LTMR subtype endings in the spinal cord dorsal horn. The organization of synaptic inputs of C-LTMRs, Aδ-LTMRs, Aβ RA-LTMRs, Aβ SAI-LTMRs, and Aβ Field-LTMRs in the mouse dorsal horn was assessed using LTMR-CreER and intersectional mouse genetic tools (Figure 1A; Bai et al., 2015Bai L.

This analysis showed that LTMR inputs to the dorsal horn are organized in a highly overlapping fashion spanning ∼250 μm below IB4+ lamina IIi, in a region of the dorsal horn, which we have termed the LTMR-Recipient Zone (LTMR-RZ, Figure 1E). We estimate that the total number of C-LTMR, Aδ-LTMR, and individual Aβ-LTMR subtype synapses within the LTMR-RZ are comparable (Figures S1A–S1D), suggesting equal synaptic allocation of LTMR subtypes within the dorsal horn. The most prominent ascending pathway emanating from the LTMR-RZ is the post-synaptic dorsal column (PSDC) pathway (Rustioni and Kaufman, 1977Rustioni A. Kaufman A.B. Identification of cells or origin of non-primary afferents to the dorsal column nuclei of the cat.Exp. Brain Res. 1977; 27: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) visualized by retrograde labeling from the dorsal columns and found to be located at the lamina III/IV boundary of the LTMR-RZ (Figure 1B). Interestingly, sensory neurons and locally projecting interneurons together account for only ∼70% of total glutamatergic excitatory inputs to the LTMR-RZ (Figure 1C). Thus, we next sought to uncover additional synaptic inputs that contribute to the excitatory drive in the LTMR-RZ.Figure S1Additional Characterization of the LTMR-RZ, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Whole mount labeling of a single C-LTMR input with TH2A-CreER;R26LSL-synaptophysin-tdTomato(Ai34) and 0.02mg of tamoxifen at P21.(B) Whole mount labeling of a single Aδ-LTMR input with TrkBCreER;Ai34 and 0.25mg of tamoxifen at P21.(C) Whole mount labeling of a single Aβ RA-LTMR input with RetCreER;Ai34 and 0.02mg of tamoxifen at E10.5.(D) LTMR single input comparisons.

In other sensory systems, cortical activity plays a crucial role in sensory processing (Otazu et al., 2015Otazu G.H. Chae H. Davis M.B. Albeanu D.F. Cortical Feedback Decorrelates Olfactory Bulb Output in Awake Mice.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1461-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and a large fraction of corticospinal neurons originate in the somatosensory cortex and preferentially innervate the dorsal horn of species ranging from rodents to primates (Casale et al., 1988Casale E.J. Light A.R. Rustioni A. Direct projection of the corticospinal tract to the superficial laminae of the spinal cord in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1988; 278: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Ralston and Ralston, 1985Ralston D.D. Ralston 3rd, H.J. The terminations of corticospinal tract axons in the macaque monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 242: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Labeling of cortical projection neurons in mice using Emx1Cre revealed that cortical neuron synapses account for ∼40% of vGluT1+ synapses in the LTMR-RZ, which together with primary somatosensory terminals labeled with AdvillinCre accounts for virtually 100% of vGluT1+ synapses within this region (Figure 1D). Remarkably, cortical projection neuron synapses and LTMR subtype synapses together sharply define the upper region of the LTMR-RZ (Figures 1A and 1E). We next sought to define the neuronal substrates of innocuous touch information processing within this spinal cord region. Labeling of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes revealed that ∼70% of neurons intrinsic to the LTMR-RZ are excitatory while ∼30% are inhibitory (Figure 1F). Retrograde labeling of known supraspinal projecting neurons originating in the LTMR-RZ (PSDC and anterolateral tract neurons, ALT) revealed that these projection neurons represent fewer than 2% of neurons in this region (Figure 1F; S. Choi and D.D.G., unpublished data), and thus, the vast majority of LTMR-RZ neurons project locally, likely within the spinal cord itself. The extent of LTMR-RZ interneuron subtype diversity was next defined by assessing their morphological and physiological properties, which are largely unexplored. Morphological diversity of LTMR-RZ interneurons was assessed using an unbiased genetic labeling approach (see STAR Methods) to sparsely label, reconstruct, and morphometrically analyze 305 individual neurons. This revealed a broad range of morphological complexity in the LTMR-RZ (Figure 1G), with a correlation that suggests an increase in cell body size as a function of distance ventral to the IB4 layer (Figure S1E). Neurons exhibiting a range of spine densities and branching patterns are spread evenly throughout the LTMR-RZ, indicating an intermingling of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with varied morphologies (Figures S1F and S1G). The extent of physiological diversity of LTMR-RZ neurons was assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of randomly chosen neurons (n = 52). Current injections into randomly chosen neurons revealed neuronal types exhibiting diverse firing patterns, including single spiking, initial bursting, phasic, delayed, gap, regular spiking, and tonic firing patterns (Figures 1H and 1I), some of which had been observed previously in the rodent superficial dorsal horn (Grudt and Perl, 2002Grudt T.J.

Taken together, the LTMR-RZ is a complex spinal cord region composed mainly of local interneurons exhibiting a wide range of morphological and physiological properties. We next sought to establish mouse molecular-genetic tools useful for defining the properties, organization, and function of the morphologically and physiologically diverse LTMR-RZ interneuron populations. We conducted in silico screens of publicly available atlases: Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas and Allen Brain Atlas, for genes exhibiting expression within the adult mouse LTMR-RZ, but not the intermediate or ventral spinal cord (Figure S2A).This screen culminated in the characterization and/or production of ten fluorescent reporter BAC transgenic or knockin mouse lines that label morphologically homogeneous subsets of LTMR-RZ interneurons. Each of these lines labels 13% or fewer of all LTMR-RZ neurons (Figure 2A). The LTMR-RZ mouse lines include GENSAT BAC-GFP transgenic lines for genes that encode the cell adhesion molecules Cadherin-3 (Cdh3) and Cerebellin-2 (Cbln2), the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), Serotonin Receptor 6 (5HTr6), Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (Igfbp5), Kv Channel Interacting protein-2 (Kcnip2), Neurogenic Differentiation Factor-4 (NeuroD4), and a PV-tdTomato BAC transgenic line (Kaiser et al., 2016Kaiser T.

We also generated or obtained PKCγmGFP and RorβGFP knockin lines, which label the PKCγ+ and Rorβ+ interneuron populations, respectively (Table S1A; Liu et al., 2013Liu H. Kim S.-Y. Fu Y. Wu X. Ng L.

See also Figures S2 and S3; Table S1. The extent to which the ten genetically labeled interneuron lines represent unique subsets of excitatory or inhibitory neurons within the LTMR-RZ was next determined. For this, each of the ten fluorescent reporter lines (Figure 2A) was crossed with mice in which excitatory and inhibitory interneurons were labeled using either vGluT2iresCre or vGATiresCre and Cre-dependent reporters. This analysis revealed that six of the ten fluorescent reporter lines predominantly label excitatory neurons, while three lines label inhibitory interneurons (Figure 2B). Similar to the rat dorsal horn, we found that approximately 70% of PV+ interneurons in laminae I–III contain GABA and glycine (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes D.I. Sikander S. Kinnon C.M. Boyle K.A. Watanabe M. Callister R.J. Graham B.A. Morphological, neurochemical and electrophysiological features of parvalbumin-expressing cells: A likely source of axo-axonic inputs in the mouse spinal dorsal horn.J.

Therefore, the PV+ neuronal population was subdivided into PVe and PVi subtypes, thus yielding a total of ten genes that label 11 putative neuronal subtypes. Anatomical distribution analysis of these 11 subtypes showed that each is broadly distributed throughout the LTMR-RZ, with a subset being more prominently localized to particular lamina (Figure S2B). We next sought to increase the versatility of the LTMR-RZ interneuron genetic toolbox by generating or acquiring recombinase tools for the majority of the ten genes that label LTMR-RZ neuronal subsets. We generated Cdh3-CreER, 5HTr6-CreER, and Kcnip2-CreER BAC transgenic lines as well as PKCγCreER and RorβCreER knockin mouse lines and acquired the previously reported CCKCreER and PVFlpO knockin mouse lines (Figure S2C"
https://openalex.org/W2561607790,K-Ras is targeted to the plasma membrane by a C-terminal membrane anchor that comprises a farnesyl-cysteine-methyl-ester and a polybasic domain. We used quantitative spatial imaging and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to examine molecular details of K-Ras plasma membrane binding. We found that the K-Ras anchor binds selected plasma membrane anionic lipids with defined head groups and lipid side chains. The precise amino acid sequence and prenyl group define a combinatorial code for lipid binding that extends beyond simple electrostatics; within this code lysine and arginine residues are non-equivalent and prenyl chain length modifies nascent polybasic domain lipid preferences. The code is realized by distinct dynamic tertiary structures of the anchor on the plasma membrane that govern amino acid side-chain-lipid interactions. An important consequence of this specificity is the ability of such anchors when aggregated to sort subsets of phospholipids into nanoclusters with defined lipid compositions that determine K-Ras signaling output.
https://openalex.org/W2569617947,"Claudin-low breast cancer is a molecular type of breast cancer originally identified by gene expression profiling and reportedly associated with poor survival. Claudin-low tumors have been recognised to preferentially display a triple-negative phenotype, however only a minority of triple-negative breast cancers are claudin-low. We sought to identify an immunohistochemical profile for claudin-low tumors that could facilitate their identification in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor material. First, an in silico collection of ~1600 human breast cancer expression profiles was assembled and all claudin-low tumors identified. Second, genes differentially expressed between claudin-low tumors and all other molecular subtypes of breast cancer were identified. Third, a number of these top differentially expressed genes were tested using immunohistochemistry for expression in a diverse panel of breast cancer cell lines to determine their specificity for claudin-low tumors. Finally, the immunohistochemical panel found to be most characteristic of claudin-low tumors was examined in a cohort of 942 formalin fixed paraffin embedded human breast cancers with >10 years clinical follow-up to evaluate the clinico-pathologic and survival characteristics of this tumor subtype. Using this approach we determined that claudin-low breast cancer is typically negative for ER, PR, HER2, claudin 3, claudin 4, claudin 7 and E-cadherin. Claudin-low tumors identified with this immunohistochemical panel, were associated with young age of onset, higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, extensive lymphocytic infiltrate and a circumscribed tumor margin. Patients with claudin-low tumors had a worse overall survival when compared to patients with luminal A type breast cancer. Interestingly, claudin-low tumors were associated with a low local recurrence rate following breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, a limited panel of antibodies can facilitate the identification of claudin-low tumors. Furthermore, claudin-low tumors identified in this manner display similar clinical, pathologic and survival characteristics to claudin-low tumors identified from fresh frozen tumor material using gene expression profiling."

Despite their important network function, the underlying synaptic mechanisms remain unclear. Several mechanisms of ripple generation have been proposed, including phasic excitation from the CA3 region (Maier et al., 2011Maier N. Tejero-Cantero A. Dorrn A.L. Winterer J. Beed P.S. Morris G.

Intracellular analysis allows precise analysis of synaptic potentials, currents, and spiking, but is largely restricted to in vitro preparations (Hájos et al., 2013Hájos N. Karlócai M.R. Németh B. Ulbert I. Monyer H. Szabó G. Erdélyi F. Freund T.F. Gulyás A.I. Input-output features of anatomically identified CA3 neurons during hippocampal sharp wave/ripple oscillation in vitro.J.

Membrane potential dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neurons during hippocampal ripples in awake mice.Neuron. 2016; 89: 800-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Understanding the synaptic mechanisms of SWR generation requires recording of synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo in awake animals under voltage-clamp conditions, where excitation and inhibition can be precisely dissected (Borg-Graham et al., 1998Borg-Graham L.J. Monier C. Frégnac Y. Visual input evokes transient and strong shunting inhibition in visual cortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 393: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). To probe the synaptic mechanisms of SWR oscillations, we performed simultaneous recordings of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) and LFPs in the CA1 region of awake mice in vivo (Figure 1). Animals were head-fixed, but fully awake, showing behaviors of grooming, whisking, and moving. We first tested whether functional characteristics of SWRs measured near the pyramidal cell layer under our experimental conditions were identical to those in awake, freely moving animals (Ylinen et al., 1995Ylinen A. Bragin A. Nádasdy Z. Jandó G. Szabó I. Sik A. Buzsáki G. Sharp wave-associated high-frequency oscillation (200 Hz) in the intact hippocampus: network and intracellular mechanisms.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 30-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figures 1A–1C). On average, SWRs occurred with a mean frequency of 0.15 ± 0.02 Hz (694 events in 17 mice) and had a mean duration of 69.4 ± 4.3 ms. Individual ripple cycles were generated at a mean frequency of 154.0 ± 1.6 Hz, and the average number of ripples per sharp wave was 10.8 ± 0.7. These properties of SWRs were very similar to those reported previously in awake, behaving rodents (Ylinen et al., 1995Ylinen A. Bragin A. Nádasdy Z. Jandó G. Szabó I. Sik A. Buzsáki G. Sharp wave-associated high-frequency oscillation (200 Hz) in the intact hippocampus: network and intracellular mechanisms.J.

Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple: a cognitive biomarker for episodic memory and planning.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 1073-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the postsynaptic currents during SWR oscillations in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the voltage-clamp configuration (Figures 1D–1F). To obtain adequate resolution, several efforts were made to optimize voltage-clamp conditions and to rigorously assess possible errors. First, we minimized series resistance (Rs), which on average was 17 ± 1 MΩ in our dataset (range, 10–27 MΩ; Margrie et al., 2002Margrie T.W. Brecht M. Sakmann B. In vivo, low-resistance, whole-cell recordings from neurons in the anaesthetized and awake mammalian brain.Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2006Lee A.K.

Epsztein J. Brecht M. Head-anchored whole-cell recordings in freely moving rats.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additionally, we used a cesium-based internal solution to enhance steady-state voltage control in distal dendrites (Williams and Mitchell, 2008Williams S.R. Mitchell S.J. Direct measurement of somatic voltage clamp errors in central neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Second, we performed experimental tests for adequate voltage-clamp conditions. Measured spontaneous synaptic events showed a fast time course (Figure S1, available online), and extrapolation toward the limit of small Rs revealed even faster synaptic kinetics (Figure S2). Kinetic parameters and amplitude were only weakly correlated. Both results were consistent with adequate clamp conditions (Hestrin et al., 1990Hestrin S. Nicoll R.A. Perkel D.J. Sah P. Analysis of excitatory synaptic action in pyramidal cells using whole-cell recording from rat hippocampal slices.J. Physiol. 1990; 422: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar; Figure S2). Finally, we examined the extent of voltage-clamp errors for EPSCs and IPSCs in detailed cable models based on full reconstruction of in vivo-recorded CA1 pyramidal neurons (Major et al., 1994Major G. Larkman A.U. Jonas P. Sakmann B. Jack J.J.B. Detailed passive cable models of whole-cell recorded CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4613-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figures S3–S5). For proximal synapses, errors in peak amplitude, rise time, and decay time constant of somatically recorded EPSCs and IPSCs due to cable filtering were less than a factor of two (Figure S3), and corresponding postsynaptic voltage errors were <10 mV (Figure S4). Distributed pipette capacitance did not introduce additional errors (Figure S5). In conclusion, voltage-clamp errors were unavoidable, but appeared to be within an acceptable range under our experimental conditions. Finally, we dissected EPSCs and IPSCs during SWRs by alternatingly setting the holding potential to either −70 mV (i.e., near the reversal potential of GABAA receptors; Figure S6) or +10 mV (i.e., near the reversal potential of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors; Borg-Graham et al., 1998Borg-Graham L.J. Monier C. Frégnac Y. Visual input evokes transient and strong shunting inhibition in visual cortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 393: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Simultaneous recording of either EPSCs or IPSCs and the LFP revealed that the frequency of both excitatory and inhibitory events increased during SWRs (Figures 1D–1F). However, the generation of IPSCs (Figure 1E) appeared to be more tightly correlated to the SWRs than the generation of EPSCs (Figure 1D). To quantitatively analyze the contribution of excitation and inhibition to the generation of ripples, we performed SWR-triggered averaging of EPSCs and IPSCs (Figure 2). Synaptic currents were aligned to the maximal positive ripple deflection in the band pass-filtered LFP, averaged, and converted into synaptic conductances using the values of the driving force. SWR-triggered averaging revealed that the peak amplitude of the inhibitory conductance was markedly larger than that of the excitatory conductance (Figure 2A). On average, the SWR-associated peak conductance was 1.8 ± 0.4 nS for excitation and 6.0 ± 0.8 nS for inhibition (17 cells; p < 0.0001; Figures 2A and 2B), corresponding to an inhibition-to-excitation conductance ratio of 4.1 ± 0.5. In comparison to excitation, inhibition showed a faster rise (20%–80% rise time, 64.7 ± 5.9 ms for excitation and 42.5 ± 4.8 ms for inhibition; p = 0.0021; Figures 2A and 2B), but a slower decay (decay time constant, 47.6 ± 4.6 ms for excitation and 98.3 ± 12.1 ms for inhibition; p < 0.0001; Figures 2A and 2B). Furthermore, inhibition peaked at a slightly later time (time difference, 7.3 ± 1.9 ms; p = 0.0005). Thus, synaptic inhibition, rather than excitation (Maier et al., 2011Maier N. Tejero-Cantero A. Dorrn A.L. Winterer J. Beed P.S. Morris G. Kempter R. Poulet J.F. Leibold C. Schmitz D. Coherent phasic excitation during hippocampal ripples.Neuron. 2011; 72: 137-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), dominated during the generation of SWRs. Furthermore, excitation and inhibition showed different temporal profiles. Previous studies revealed that the amplitude of SWRs varies from event to event by over an order of magnitude (Csicsvari et al., 2000Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Ensemble patterns of hippocampal CA3-CA1 neurons during sharp wave-associated population events.Neuron. 2000; 28: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). If either excitation or inhibition was responsible for ripple generation, we would expect that the relevant conductance would positively correlate with the ripple amplitude. To test this hypothesis, we plotted the peak amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory conductance in CA1 pyramidal neurons during individual SWRs against ripple amplitude (Figures 2C and 2D). For the excitatory conductance, peak conductance and ripple amplitude were not significantly correlated (linear correlation analysis, Pearson’s r = −0.08; 238 events; p = 0.24; Figure 2C). In contrast, for the inhibitory conductance, peak conductance and ripple amplitude exhibited a strong positive correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.40; 185 events; p < 0.0001; Figure 2D). Thus, the magnitude of inhibition, but not that of excitation, was correlated with the amplitude of individual SWRs. Furthermore, excitation and inhibition were not strictly balanced during SWRs (Hulse et al., 2016Hulse B.K. Moreaux L.C. Lubenov E.V. Siapas A.G. Membrane potential dynamics of CA1 pyramidal neurons during hippocampal ripples in awake mice.Neuron. 2016; 89: 800-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine whether EPSCs and IPSCs were phase-locked to individual ripple cycles, we performed interleaved phase analysis for both EPSCs and IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 3). EPSC onset times were detected as minima of the first derivative of the membrane current at –70 mV, whereas IPSC onset times were determined as maxima of the first derivative at +10 mV (see Experimental Procedures; 3,566 and 3,180 events total for 25% largest derivative extrema; 17 cells; Figures 3A and 3B). Simulations using cable models based on cell reconstructions suggested that adequate event detection was achieved under these conditions (Figure S7). After computing the Hilbert transform of the band pass-filtered simultaneously recorded LFP signal (100–250 Hz; English et al., 2014English D.F. Peyrache A. Stark E. Roux L. Vallentin D. Long M.A. Buzsáki G. Excitation and inhibition compete to control spiking during hippocampal ripples: intracellular study in behaving mice.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 16509-16517Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the onset times of EPSCs and IPSCs were individually assigned corresponding phase values, with 0° corresponding to the peak of a ripple. Whereas EPSCs were uniformly distributed (p = 0.90 for 10% largest derivative extrema; Rayleigh test; Figure 3C, left), IPSCs were significantly clustered in the late ascending phase of ripple cycles (p = 0.0007 for 10% largest derivative extrema; Rayleigh test; mean phase angle, −62.9° ± 49.6°, equivalent to 297.1°; Figure 3C, right). This conclusion was corroborated by reverse analysis using EPSC- or IPSC-triggered averaging of the LFP (Figure 3D). Synaptic event-triggered LFP averages were weakly rhythmically modulated for EPSC onsets (Figure 3D, left), but strongly modulated for IPSC onsets (Figure 3D, right). The peak-to-trough amplitude of the triggered LFP average was significantly larger for IPSCs than for EPSCs (p < 0.0001 and 0.0038). Thus, phasic inhibition, but not excitation, was phase-locked to individual cycles of ripple oscillations. As PV+ interneurons strongly fire during SWRs (Lapray et al., 2012Lapray D. Lasztoczi B.

Mechanisms of sharp wave initiation and ripple generation.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11385-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), they are possible candidates for the generation of the SWR-associated inhibitory conductance. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of optogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons (Figure 4). The inhibitory opsin Archaerhodopsin T (ArchT) was selectively expressed in PV+ interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Figure 4A). Five-second laser pulses were alternated with 11 s off periods, and properties of SWRs and associated inhibitory postsynaptic conductance were compared between on and off periods (Figure 4B). Optogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons did not change the incidence of SWRs, but significantly reduced SWR duration (from 89.3 ± 8.5 ms to 81.0 ± 8.1 ms; 8 mice; p = 0.008; Figure 4B, right top). Furthermore, light pulses did not change the ripple frequency, but decreased the number of ripple cycles per SWR (from 12.1 ± 1.0 to 10.9 ± 1.0; p = 0.008; Figure 4B, right center). Finally, optogenetic inhibition of PV+ interneurons markedly reduced the peak amplitude of the SWR-associated inhibitory conductance (from 9.5 ± 1.9 nS to 5.6 ± 1.2 nS; 7 cells; p = 0.016) and reduced its half-duration (Figure 4B, right bottom). In conclusion, PV+ interneurons make a major contribution to the inhibitory conductance during SWRs. Furthermore, they control the duration of SWRs and the number of ripples in SWR complexes. If PV+ interneurons are primarily responsible for SWR generation, optogenetic inhibition of these interneurons might result in a disruption of phase locking of IPSCs. To test this hypothesis, we performed phase analysis and IPSC-triggered LFP averaging before and after optogenetic inhibition after adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of ArchT (Figures 4C and 4D). In the absence of light, IPSCs were phase-locked to the ascending phase of the ripple cycle (Figure 4C, left), similar to the results in uninfected control animals (Figure 3C, right). In contrast, in the presence of light, the phase preference was perturbed (Figure 4C, right). Furthermore, the peak-to-trough amplitude of IPSC-triggered LFP averages was markedly reduced (Figure 4D). Thus, PV+ interneurons provide a major contribution to phase-locked IPSCs during individual ripple cycles. The present paper provides a quantitative analysis of postsynaptic conductances during SWRs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in awake, behaving mice in vivo. Our results indicate that during SWRs, (1) inhibition dominates over excitation; (2) phasic inhibition, but not excitation, is positively correlated with SWR amplitude; (3) phasic inhibition, but not excitation, is phase-locked to individual ripple cycles; and (4) PV+ interneurons provide a major contribution to the SWR-associated inhibitory conductance. Our findings directly reveal the current generator underlying SWRs. This was possible because our experiments provided information about both phase and location of the underlying conductance. The onset of the inhibitory conductance occurred at a phase of ∼−60°, corresponding to the ascending phase of a ripple. Furthermore, the conductance was likely to be perisomatic because it was mediated, to a large extent, by PV+ interneurons (Hu et al., 2014Hu H. Gan J. Jonas P. Interneurons. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons: from cellular design to microcircuit function.Science. 2014; 345: 1255263Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory conductance represents a perisomatic current source, resulting in a positive deflection in the LFP near the pyramidal cell layer. Furthermore, our results shed light on the function of the rhythm generator. They suggest a model in which SWRs are generated by a combination of tonic excitation from CA3 and phasic inhibition within CA1. In contrast, our results are inconsistent with models in which phasic excitation is relayed from CA3 (Maier et al., 2011Maier N. Tejero-Cantero A. Dorrn A.L. Winterer J. Beed P.S. Morris G.

Furthermore, they are incompatible with a major contribution of gap junctions (Draguhn et al., 1998Draguhn A. Traub R.D. Schmitz D. Jefferys J.G. Electrical coupling underlies high-frequency oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro.Nature. 1998; 394: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Whether ripple generation involves feedback inhibition, mutual inhibition, or both remains to be determined (Stark et al., 2014Stark E. Roux L. Eichler R. Senzai Y. Royer S. Buzsáki G.

The temporal sequence of events, with action potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons at the ripple trough (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurkó A. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Fast network oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region of the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC20PubMed Google Scholar), PV+ interneuron firing in the early ascending phase (Lapray et al., 2012Lapray D. Lasztoczi B. Lagler M. Viney T.J. Katona L. Valenti O. Hartwich K.

Frequency-invariant temporal ordering of interneuronal discharges during hippocampal oscillations in awake mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2726-E2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and onset of inhibitory conductance in the late ascending phase of the ripples (this paper), would be consistent with a feedback mechanism (Stark et al., 2014Stark E. Roux L. Eichler R. Senzai Y. Royer S. Buzsáki G. Pyramidal cell-interneuron interactions underlie hippocampal ripple oscillations.Neuron. 2014; 83: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, one might expect that GABAergic interneurons receive tonic excitation during SWRs, similar to that in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This could activate mutual inhibition circuits, independent of feedback innervation. Finally, our findings have implications for temporal coding of information in the hippocampal CA1 region. Importantly, they explain why CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo fire at the ripple trough (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurkó A. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Fast network oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region of the behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC20PubMed Google Scholar). In a ripple model based on phasic inhibition, the descending phase of the ripple coincides with the decay of the inhibitory conductance. Pyramidal cells will fire at a point where inhibition has become minimal, which is near the trough in the LFP. In this scenario, fast decay of the inhibitory conductance in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo (Figure S1) will ensure temporally precise action potential generation in these neurons (Carter and Regehr, 2002Carter A.G. Regehr W.G. Quantal events shape cerebellar interneuron firing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Precise spike timing, in turn, may be critically important for the preplay or replay of temporal activity sequences in cell assemblies (Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996Skaggs W.E. McNaughton B.L. Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience.Science. 1996; 271: 1870-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and for the consolidation of memory via spike timing-dependent plasticity in downstream neocortical target cells. In vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons and simultaneous LFP recordings were performed in head-fixed, fully awake mice.

https://openalex.org/W2569559526,"Many blood-borne substances attempting to pass through the luminal membrane of brain endothelial cells are acted upon by a variety of metabolizing enzymes or are actively expelled back into the capillary lumen by embedded efflux transporters, such as Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp). Overexpression of this protein has also been linked to multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that focused ultrasound (FUS), when combined with a microbubble agent, has ability to temporarily disrupt blood-brain barrier (BBBD). In this work, we investigated whether modulation of Pgp expression is part of the FUS-induced effects. We found that ultrasound can temporarily suppress Pgp expression. When BBBD was produced at 0.55 MPa, Pgp was suppressed up to 48 hours and restored by 72 hours. At 0.81 MPa, suppression can last 72 hours or longer. These findings support the idea that microbubble-enhanced FUS disrupts the functional components of the BBB through suppression of drug efflux."

Through de novo transcriptome reconstruction, we establish dynamic expression profiles of lncRNAs at different stages of oligodendrocyte development and uncover a cohort of stage-specific oligodendrocyte-restricted lncRNAs, including a conserved chromatin-associated lncOL1. Co-expression network analyses further define the association of distinct oligodendrocyte-expressing lncRNA clusters with protein-coding genes and predict lncRNA functions in oligodendrocyte myelination. Overexpression of lncOL1 promotes precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation in the developing brain, whereas genetic inactivation of lncOL1 causes defects in CNS myelination and remyelination following injury. Functional analyses illustrate that lncOL1 interacts with Suz12, a component of polycomb repressive complex 2, to promote oligodendrocyte maturation, in part, through Suz12-mediated repression of a differentiation inhibitory network that maintains the precursor state. Together, our findings reveal a key lncRNA epigenetic circuitry through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes in control of CNS myelination and myelin repair."

Bacteriophages (phages) are probably the most abundant and bio-diverse entities in nature, often exceeding bacterial densities by an order of magnitude (Suttle, 2007Suttle C.A. Marine viruses--major players in the global ecosystem.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Being predators of bacteria, phages have a tremendous impact on shaping the structure of bacterial communities by diminishing specific populations and enabling others to flourish (Díaz-Muñoz and Koskella, 2014Díaz-Muñoz S.L. Koskella B. Bacteria-phage interactions in natural environments.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2014; 89: 135-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phages serve as one of the most extensive mediators of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), as they modify bacterial genomes through integration of temperate phages into the host chromosome and transfer of DNA by transduction. The latter is a process whereby phages occasionally package host DNA during infection and subsequently deliver it to another bacteria (Calender, 2006Calender R. The Bacteriopahges.Second Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar, Suttle, 2007Suttle C.A. Marine viruses--major players in the global ecosystem.Nat. Rev.

Mechanisms of, and barriers to, horizontal gene transfer between bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The biology of phage infection has been extensively studied since the beginning of the 20th century (Salmond and Fineran, 2015Salmond G.P. Fineran P.C. A century of the phage: past, present and future.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2015; 13: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Twort, 1915Twort F.W. An investigation on the nature of ultra-microscopic viruses.Lancet. 1915; 186: 1241-1243Abstract Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In general, phages are known to adopt two infection strategies, lytic and lysogenic. During lytic infection, the phage exploits the host machineries and resources for its own replication, culminating in lysis of the host bacterium. Lysogenic infection, on the other hand, carried out by temperate phages, is characterized by integration of phage DNA into the bacterial chromosome. This latent form of a phage, termed prophage, enables the vertical transmission of the phage DNA during host replication and cell division. Upon detection of host cell damage, the prophage can excise from the bacterial chromosome to commence a lytic cycle (Calender, 2006Calender R. The Bacteriopahges.Second Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). The typical infection cycle of a lytic phage is initiated by attachment to the host receptor, which is followed by injection of DNA into the host cytoplasm, replication of the phage genome, biosynthesis of phage components, and assembly of phage particles. Finally, the release of mature phages is accomplished by phage-encoded holin proteins that disrupt the cell membrane, enabling the phage lytic enzymes (lysins) to degrade the host peptidoglycan (Calender, 2006Calender R. The Bacteriopahges.Second Edition. Oxford University Press, New York2006Google Scholar). Phages contribute to HGT among species, yet they are considered specific to their host, as most phages can only infect a limited set of strains within a bacterial species, though polyvalent phages also exist (Koskella and Meaden, 2013Koskella B. Meaden S. Understanding bacteriophage specificity in natural microbial communities.Viruses. 2013; 5: 806-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Paez-Espino et al., 2016Paez-Espino D.

Uncovering Earth’s virome.Nature. 2016; 536: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Phage confinement is primarily determined by the specificity of adsorption and the presence of the appropriate receptor on the bacterial cell surface (Rakhuba et al., 2010Rakhuba D.V. Kolomiets E.I. Dey E.S. Novik G.I. Bacteriophage receptors, mechanisms of phage adsorption and penetration into host cell.Pol. J. Microbiol. 2010; 59: 145-155PubMed Google Scholar). SPP1 is a well-established model system for lytic phages infecting the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). SPP1 is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phage (44 kb), member of the Siphoviridae family, characterized by noncontractile tails (Alonso et al., 1997Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Stiege A.C. Chai S. Weise F. Trautner T.A. The complete nucleotide sequence and functional organization of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1.Gene. 1997; 204: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Host infection is initiated by reversible binding of the SPP1 tail tip to poly-glycosylated teichoic acids (gTA), which are anchored in the membrane via a glycolipid or covalently attached to the peptidoglycan (Brown et al., 2013Brown S. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Walker S. Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67: 313-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SPP1 binds irreversibly to the membrane protein YueB, and this specific interaction triggers a cascade of events, resulting in DNA injection into the cytoplasm (São-José et al., 2004São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. Bacillus subtilis operon encoding a membrane receptor for bacteriophage SPP1.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, São-José et al., 2006São-José C. Lhuillier S. Lurz R. Melki R. Lepault J. Santos M.A. Tavares P. The ectodomain of the viral receptor YueB forms a fiber that triggers ejection of bacteriophage SPP1 DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11464-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An additional well-studied B. subtilis dsDNA lytic phage is phi29 (19.3 kb) from the Podoviridae family, which is composed of phages containing a short noncontractile tail (Ackermann, 1998Ackermann H.W. Tailed bacteriophages: the order caudovirales.Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 51: 135-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Salas, 2012Salas M. My life with bacteriophage phi29.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 44568-44579Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Host adsorption and infection by phi29 was shown to be dependent on intact gTA (Young, 1967Young F.E. Requirement of glucosylated teichoic acid for adsorption of phage in Bacillus subtilis 168.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 58: 2377-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). gTA was found to be a crucial surface component, required for invasion by various phages, among them SPO1, representing a large and diverse group of Myoviridae bacteriophages, harboring a long contractile tail. SPO1 is a large virulent phage (132.6 kb) that exhibits a complex infection cycle, involving the subversion of the host transcription machinery for its own use (Hoet et al., 1992Hoet P.P. Coene M.M. Cocito C.G. Replication cycle of Bacillus subtilis hydroxymethyluracil-containing phages.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because bacteria in nature reside mostly in multispecies communities (e.g., Kolenbrander et al., 2010Kolenbrander P.E. Palmer Jr., R.J. Periasamy S. Jakubovics N.S. Oral multispecies biofilm development and the key role of cell-cell distance.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), infecting phages are likely to encounter heterogeneous populations of phage-resistant (R) and sensitive (S) cells. However, the fate of phages in complex bacterial communities resembling their natural ecosystem has not been studied at the cellular level. Here, we follow phage dynamics in mixtures of S and R bacteria, utilizing B. subtilis and its lytic phage SPP1 as our primary model system (Alonso et al., 1997Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Stiege A.C. Chai S. Weise F. Trautner T.A. The complete nucleotide sequence and functional organization of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1.Gene. 1997; 204: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We discovered that R cells, lacking the SPP1 receptor, could be invaded by the phage when grown together with S cells. This phenomenon was not restricted to SPP1 and was also observed for phi29 and SPO1 lytic phages. Phage invasion into R cells was mediated, at least in part, by phage attachment molecules delivered from S to R cells, transiently turning R into “S” cells. We provide evidence that this molecular transfer involves membrane vesicles (MVs) released from S cells. The exchange of phage receptors can occur in an interspecies manner, thus facilitating the attachment of phages to non-host species. To investigate the biology of phage infection in complex bacterial communities, we mixed cells lacking the SPP1 receptor gene yueB, which are resistant (R1) to infection (São-José et al., 2004São-José C. Baptista C. Santos M.A. Bacillus subtilis operon encoding a membrane receptor for bacteriophage SPP1.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8337-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Figure 1A), with wild-type cells harboring the intact receptor (S) at 1:10 ratio, respectively. At mid-logarithmic phase, the culture was infected with SPP1 and optical density 600 (OD600) and colony forming units (CFUs) were followed. The viability of R1 cells in the mixed culture clearly decreased after infection, even though pure R1 cells infected by phages grew normally, as expected (Figures 1B and 1C). The reduced viability of R1 cells correlated with the increased proportion of S cells within the mixture (Figure 1D). When R1 cells were inoculated directly into SPP1 lysate, no growth inhibition was detected (Figure S1A), suggesting that the presence of intact S cells mediates the observed effect. To directly visualize the lysis of R1 cells in real time, S cells were co-incubated with GFP-labeled R1 cells and phages were added to the mixture. As expected, lysis of GFP-expressing R1 cells was readily monitored (Figure 1E), substantiating our previous results. Importantly, this phenomenon was not restricted to SPP1 but was also observed for the B. subtilis lytic phages phi29 and SP01, infecting mixtures of their corresponding S and R cells (Figures S1B–S1E).Figure S1R Cells Can Be Lysed when Co-cultured with S Cells by Different Phages, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) R1 (ET6) cells were inoculated into: fresh medium (no SPP1), filtered (0.45 μm) SPP1 lysate (filtered lysate), or directly into lysed S (PY79) cell culture (crude lysate), and cell growth was followed by OD600.

Purified phage lysis proteins were shown to lyse cells from the outside, even in an interspecies manner, a process termed “lysis from without” (LO) (Abedon, 2011Abedon S.T. Lysis from without.Bacteriophage. 2011; 1: 46-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Fischetti, 2005Fischetti V.A. Bacteriophage lytic enzymes: novel anti-infectives.Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 491-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Nelson et al., 2006Nelson D. Schuch R. Chahales P. Zhu S. Fischetti V.A. PlyC: a multimeric bacteriophage lysin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10765-10770Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); however, the extent of this phenomenon during infection has been mostly neglected. To investigate whether LO plays a role in the infection process, we mixed S cells with cells lacking DNA (Elbaz and Ben-Yehuda, 2015Elbaz M. Ben-Yehuda S. Following the fate of bacterial cells experiencing sudden chromosome loss.MBio. 2015; 6 (e00092–15)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which cannot support phage propagation (Figure 1F), and therefore, their lysis reports LO. Evidently, lysis of DNA-less cells (DLCs) was monitored following phage addition (Figures 1G and S2A), suggesting that similarly LO contributes to R1 lysis. To directly visualize lysin release from S cells during phage development, we constructed an SPP1 phage harboring SPP1 lysin (gp51) fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; C-terminal fusion) as a sole lysin copy (SPP1-lysin-yfp). This modified phage was indistinguishable from wild-type, displaying normal infection kinetics and plaque formation (Figures S2B and S2C). Following S cells infected with SPP1-lysin-yfp in real time showed that fluorescence from infected cells increased during phage development (Figure 1H; Movie S1). In line with the process of LO, upon cell lysis, the labeled protein was observed to bind the surface of non-infected neighboring cells, frequently correlating with their lysis (Figure 1H). To further validate the ability of the lysin protein per se to induce LO, we introduced the lysin-SPP1-yfp fusion into the B. subtilis chromosome under an inducible promoter. Induction of the fusion protein within the host cytoplasm had no significant effect on bacterial growth and division (Figure S2D; data not shown). Next, we induced lysin release by treating the cells with chloroform, which damages the plasma membrane. This procedure mimics the action of the phage holin protein, which enables the lysin to cross the membrane and reach its peptidoglycan target (Young, 1992Young R. Bacteriophage lysis: mechanism and regulation.Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Visualizing lysin released from producer cells revealed that the protein could bind to nearby cells, ultimately resulting in their lysis (Figures S2E–S2G). Notably, R cells incubated in S lysate were able to grow (Figure S1A), suggesting that lysin activity rapidly decreases. Nevertheless, both S and R cells were sensitive to purified lysin-SPP1 added from outside (Figure S2H). Thus, we conclude that most R1 lysis events are likely mediated by lysin released from S cells during phage burst. To explore the impact that the LO phenomenon might have on natural multispecies communities, we mixed B. subtilis-producing lysin-SPP1-YFP with three other Bacilli species and with Staphylococcus aureus, all insensitive to SPP1. The lysin protein was then released by chloroform addition and lysis of the inspected strains followed by OD600. Lysin-SPP1-YFP was able to efficiently lyse B. pumilus and B. atrophaeus, whereas B. cereus and Staphylococcus aureus remained intact (Figure 2A). Consistently, infecting co-cultures of B. subtilis and B. atrophaeus with SPP1-lysin-yfp phage resulted in binding of the lysin protein to B. atrophaeus, causing massive lysis of the SPP1-resistant strain (Figure 2B), whereas no lysis of B. cereus co-cultured with B. subtilis took place during infection (Figure 2C), as shown by time-lapse microscopy. These results demonstrate that lysis of R cells occurs in an interspecies manner, highlighting the potential impact of LO on multispecies communities in nature. Surprisingly, closer investigation of SPP1-lysin-yfp infection in mixed R1 and S populations revealed that occasionally R1 cells were actually invaded by phages, as indicated by the expression of lysin-SPP1-YFP inside R1 cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). In comparison, inspecting SPP1-infected R1 cells grown alone (∼10,000 cells) did not yield any detectable event of phage invasion, thus ruling out the possibility of infection by an additional unknown receptor. It was challenging to quantify the frequency of the actual SPP1 invasion events into R1 cells, as R1 cells continued to grow throughout the experiment. Interestingly, phage invasion into R cells was more pronounced at late stages of infection, after lysis of the majority of S cells (see below). Next, we constructed B. subtilis cells producing the SPP1 major tail protein GP17.1 (Auzat et al., 2008Auzat I. Dröge A. Weise F. Lurz R. Tavares P. Origin and function of the two major tail proteins of bacteriophage SPP1.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) fused to GFP. Upon SPP1 infection, we could monitor a change in localization of the fusion protein from a cytoplasmic diffused pattern into discrete foci (Figures 3C and S3A). SPP1 as well as several other phages were shown to localize into foci-like domains during infection, possibly reflecting phage replication centers (Edgar et al., 2008Edgar R. Rokney A. Feeney M.

Infection of a mixed R1 and S population with SPP1 resulted in formation of foci in R1 cells, followed by cell lysis (Figure 3D). To further substantiate our results, we conducted similar experiments using SPP1-delX110lacO64 phage, which contains 64 repeats of lacO (Jakutytė et al., 2011Jakutytė L. Baptista C. São-José C.

A possible scenario that could affect our results is generation of SPP1 mutant phages that could somehow infect R1 cells. To exclude this possibility, we infected a mixture of S and R1 cells with SPP1 and utilized the lysate to re-infect a fresh S and R1 mixture. We repeated this cycle five times in quadruplicates but failed to isolate a phage capable of infecting R1 cells, as judged by plaque assay (data not shown). We next wished to explore whether invasion into R cells is displayed by other phages, such as phi29. To this end, we constructed a B. subtilis strain expressing GFP fused to the phi29 major capsid protein GP8. Upon phi29 infection, protein localization was changed from diffused into foci pattern (Figure 4A). Using this approach, the invasion of phi29 into its corresponding R cells (ΔgtaB henceforth, R2; Figure 1A), when mixed with S cells, was monitored (Figures 4B and 4C), thus showing that this unusual invasion is widespread for B. subtilis phages. We termed this phenomenon of R cells infected by phages in mixed cultures “ASEN” for acquisition of sensitivity. Because ASEN actually involves phage invasion, it could potentially facilitate transduction and consequently HGT events in complex communities in nature. To examine this possibility, we tested the ability of R1 cells to acquire new genetic material via transduction. We took advantage of a plasmid (pBT163) containing an antibiotic-resistant gene and the SPP1 packaging signal, which elevates the level of transduction events (∼5% transducing phages; Deichelbohrer et al., 1985Deichelbohrer I. Alonso J.C. Lüder G. Trautner T.A. Plasmid transduction by Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1: effects of DNA homology between plasmid and bacteriophage.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1238-1243PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis cells carrying pBT163 were infected with SPP1, and the obtained lysate was employed to infect a mix of S and R1 population. Indeed, transduction into R1 cells could be detected only when they were co-cultured with S cells (Figure 5A). Although only a small fraction of the R1 population was transduced (∼6.6 × 10−8) in comparison to S cells (∼1.5 × 10−3), the results were highly reproducible. To exclude the possibility that transduction into R1 involves prophage induction, transduction with lysates derived from a strain lacking all known B. subtilis prophages was monitored, and similar results were obtained (Kidane et al., 2009Kidane D. Carrasco B. Manfredi C. Rothmaier K. Ayora S. Tadesse S. Alonso J.C. Graumann P.L. Evidence for different pathways during horizontal gene transfer in competent Bacillus subtilis cells.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Figure S4A). Importantly, colonies of R1 cells transduced by the phage remained resistant to SPP1 (Figure S4B), demonstrating that ASEN is a transient non-genetic phenomenon, possibly mediated by transfer of protein and/or mRNA molecules. Consistent with phage transduction into R1 cells, a lysate derived from R1 cells carrying pBT163 mixed with S cells lacking the plasmid enabled plasmid transduction into S cells (Figure 5B). In a similar manner, we could also monitor transduction of genomic DNA derived from R1 cells (Figure S4C). To eliminate DNA acquisition by mode of transformation, the above experiments were all conducted in the presence of DNaseI. Furthermore, comparable results were obtained when testing the occurrence of these transduction events in strains lacking the major competence state regulator comK (van Sinderen et al., 1995van Sinderen D. Luttinger A. Kong L. Dubnau D. Venema G. Hamoen L. comK encodes the competence transcription factor, the key regulatory protein for competence development in Bacillus subtilis.Mol.

This extremely low capacity severely limits execution of many cognitive tasks, but its neuronal underpinnings remain unclear. Here we show that in the framework of synaptic theory of working memory, capacity can be analytically estimated to scale with characteristic time of short-term synaptic depression relative to synaptic current time constant. The number of items in working memory can be regulated by external excitation, enabling the system to be tuned to the desired load and to clear the working memory of currently held items to make room for new ones."
https://openalex.org/W2567728646,"This study describes an approach to quantification of attacking performance in football. Our procedure determines a quantitative representation of the probability of a goal being scored for every point in time at which a player is in possession of the ball-we refer to this as dangerousity. The calculation is based on the spatial constellation of the player and the ball, and comprises four components: (1) Zone describes the danger of a goal being scored from the position of the player on the ball, (2) Control stands for the extent to which the player can implement his tactical intention on the basis of the ball dynamics, (3) Pressure represents the possibility that the defending team prevent the player from completing an action with the ball and (4) Density is the chance of being able to defend the ball after the action. Other metrics can be derived from dangerousity by means of which questions relating to analysis of the play can be answered. Action Value represents the extent to which the player can make a situation more dangerous through his possession of the ball. Performance quantifies the number and quality of the attacks by a team over a period of time, while Dominance describes the difference in performance between teams. The evaluation uses the correlation between probability of winning the match (derived from betting odds) and performance indicators, and indicates that among Goal difference (r = .55), difference in Shots on Goal (r = .58), difference in Passing Accuracy (r = .56), Tackling Rate (r = .24) Ball Possession (r = .71) and Dominance (r = .82), the latter makes the largest contribution to explaining the skill of teams. We use these metrics to analyse individual actions in a match, to describe passages of play, and to characterise the performance and efficiency of teams over the season. For future studies, they provide a criterion that does not depend on chance or results to investigate the influence of central events in a match, various playing systems or tactical group concepts on success."

In the mammary gland, the identity and characteristics of quiescent epithelial stem cells are not clear. Here, we identify a quiescent mammary epithelial cell population expressing high levels of Bcl11b and located at the interface between luminal and basal cells. Bcl11bhigh cells are enriched for cells that can regenerate mammary glands in secondary transplants. Loss of Bcl11b leads to a Cdkn2a-dependent exhaustion of ductal epithelium and loss of epithelial cell regenerative capacity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that Bcl11b induces cells to enter the G0 phase of the cell cycle and become quiescent. Taken together, these results suggest that Bcl11b acts as a central intrinsic regulator of mammary epithelial stem cell quiescence and exhaustion and is necessary for long-term maintenance of the mammary gland."

The goal of the current research was to examine the psychology of our social connection with other animals, by specifically developing a measure of solidarity with animals. In 8 studies using correlational, experimental, and longitudinal designs, solidarity with animals predicted more positive attitudes and behaviors toward animals, over and above existing scales of identification, and even when this implied a loss of resources and privileges for humans relative to animals. Solidarity with animals also displayed predicted relationships with relevant variables (anthropomorphism, empathy). Pet owners and vegetarians displayed higher levels of solidarity with animals. Correlational and experimental evidence confirmed that human-animal similarity heightens solidarity with animals. Our findings provide a useful measure that can facilitate important insights into the nature of our relationships with animals."
https://openalex.org/W2568700018,"The purpose of this study is to examine the reciprocal relationship between motor abilities and physical activity and the mediation effects of physical self-concept in this relationship using longitudinal data. We expect that the effects of motor abilities on physical activity are rather indirect via physical self-concept and that the effects of physical activity on motor abilities are rather direct without involvement of the motor ability self-concept. Data was obtained from the Motorik-Modul (MoMo) Longitudinal Study in which 335 boys and 363 girls aged 11–17 years old at Baseline were examined twice in a period of six years. Physical activity was assessed by the MoMo Physical Activity Questionnaire for adolescents, physical self-concept by Physical Self-Description Questionnaire and motor abilities by MoMo Motor Test which comprised of the dimensions strength, endurance, coordination and flexibility. Multiple regression analyses were used to analyse the direct and indirect effects. The results of the multiple regression analyses show that the effects of motor abilities on physical activity were only indirect for the dimensions strength, coordination, and flexibility. For the dimension endurance, neither direct nor indirect effects were significant. In the opposite direction, the effects of physical activity on motor abilities were partially mediated by the self-concept of strength. For the dimensions endurance, coordination and flexibility, only indirect were significant. The results of this study support the assumption that the relationship between motor abilities and physical activity is mediated by physical self-concept in both directions. Physical self-concept seems to be an important determinant of adolescents´ physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2570033002,"Obesity is defined as the excessive accumulation of body fat that ultimately leads to chronic metabolic diseases. Diets rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA) exacerbate obesity and hepatic steatosis, which increase the risk of hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in a range of biological processes, the implications of SFA-induced miRNAs in metabolic dysregulation, particularly in the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance, are not well understood. This study investigated the implications of miR-96, which is induced strongly by SFA, in the development of hepatic insulin resistance. The liver of HFD mice and the palmitate-treated hepatocytes exhibited an impairment of insulin signaling due to the significant decrease in INSR and IRS-1 expression. According to expression profiling and qRT-PCR analysis of the miRNAs, the expression level of miR-96 was higher in hepatocytes treated with palmitate. Moreover, miR-96 was also upregulated in the liver of HFD mice. Interestingly, miR-96 targeted the 3'UTRs of INSR and IRS-1 directly, and repressed the expression of INSR and IRS-1 at the post-transcriptional level. Accordingly, the overexpression of miR-96 was found to cause a significant decrease in INSR and IRS-1 expression, thereby leading to an impairment of insulin signaling and glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes. These results reveal a novel mechanism whereby miR-96 promotes the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance resulted from SFA or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2562651131,"Mutations in NIPBL are the most frequent cause of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a developmental disorder encompassing several neurological defects, including intellectual disability and seizures. How NIPBL mutations affect brain development is not understood. Here we identify Nipbl as a functional interaction partner of the neural transcription factor Zfp609 in brain development. Depletion of Zfp609 or Nipbl from cortical neural progenitors in vivo is detrimental to neuronal migration. Zfp609 and Nipbl overlap at genomic binding sites independently of cohesin and regulate genes that control cortical neuron migration. We find that Zfp609 and Nipbl interact with the Integrator complex, which functions in RNA polymerase 2 pause release. Indeed, Zfp609 and Nipbl co-localize at gene promoters containing paused RNA polymerase 2, and Integrator similarly regulates neuronal migration.

https://openalex.org/W2568482848,"Identification and classification of behavior states in animal movement data can be complex, temporally biased, time-intensive, scale-dependent, and unstandardized across studies and taxa. Large movement datasets are increasingly common and there is a need for efficient methods of data exploration that adjust to the individual variability of each track. We present the Residence in Space and Time (RST) method to classify behavior patterns in movement data based on the concept that behavior states can be partitioned by the amount of space and time occupied in an area of constant scale. Using normalized values of Residence Time and Residence Distance within a constant search radius, RST is able to differentiate behavior patterns that are time-intensive (e.g., rest), time & distance-intensive (e.g., area restricted search), and transit (short time and distance). We use grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma) GPS tracks to demonstrate RST's ability to classify behavior patterns and adjust to the inherent scale and individuality of each track. Next, we evaluate RST's ability to discriminate between behavior states relative to other classical movement metrics. We then temporally sub-sample albatross track data to illustrate RST's response to less resolved data. Finally, we evaluate RST's performance using datasets from four taxa with diverse ecology, functional scales, ecosystems, and data-types. We conclude that RST is a robust, rapid, and flexible method for detailed exploratory analysis and meta-analyses of behavioral states in animal movement data based on its ability to integrate distance and time measurements into one descriptive metric of behavior groupings. Given the increasing amount of animal movement data collected, it is timely and useful to implement a consistent metric of behavior classification to enable efficient and comparative analyses. Overall, the application of RST to objectively explore and compare behavior patterns in movement data can enhance our fine- and broad- scale understanding of animal movement ecology."

Methods In a population-based cohort from southern Sweden, women with at least one delivery registered in the Swedish Medical Birth Register ten or more years before answering a health questionnaire were identified (n = 13,608). Complete data were found in 3,539 women. Results Women with BMI >25 at start of pregnancy had increased risk of developing obesity (OR 21.9), diabetes (OR 6.4), cardiac disease (OR 2.7), endocrine diseases (OR 2.3), and other morbidity (OR 1.4), compared with women of normal weight. A high weight gain (>15 kg) during pregnancy was associated to later risk of overweight (OR 2.0) and obesity (OR 2.2), but not diabetes, cardiac disease, or endocrine diseases. A positive association was found between low weight gain and the risk of developing psychiatric disorders (OR 1.6). Conclusions A high BMI at start of pregnancy significantly increased the risk of several diseases later in life. However, a high weight gain during pregnancy was only significant for future overweight and obesity. These findings have implications for both pregestational intervention and post gestational follow up of obese and overweight women."

We report that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), independent of source and age, improve the engraftment of endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). MSC coculture altered ECFC appearance to an elongated mesenchymal morphology with reduced proliferation. ECFC primed via MSC contact had reduced self-renewal potential, but improved capacity to form tube structures in vitro and engraftment in vivo. Primed ECFCs displayed major differences in transcriptome compared to ECFCs never exposed to MSCs, affecting genes involved in the cell cycle, up-regulating of genes influencing mesenchymal transition, adhesion, extracellular matrix. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling, a potential upstream regulator of mesenchymal transition, in large part modulated this gene expression pattern and functionally reversed the mesenchymal morphology of ECFCs.

Thus, antigenicity and immunogenicity analyses of the mutated HBsAg are necessary to develop novel diagnostic tools and efficient vaccinations. Here, the in vitro antigenicity of three wild-type HBsAg open reading frames (ORFs) (adr4, W1S [subtype adr] and W3S [subtype adr]) isolated from clinically infected patients and nineteen synthesized single/double/multiple amino acid-substituted mutants were tested with commercial ELISA kits. Immunofluorescence staining of transfected cells and Western blot analysis confirmed that these ORFs were expressed at comparable levels in HEK-293 cells. W1S and adr4 were clearly detected, whereas W3S could not be detected. Using the same commercial immunoassay kit, we found that the single mutants, K120P and D123T, were marginally reactive, whereas W3S-aW1S and the double mutant, K120P/D123T, exhibited antigenicity roughly equivalent to the wild-type wako1S. On the other hand, the single mutants of W1S, P120K and T123D, significantly impaired the reactivity, while W1S-aW3S and the double mutant of W1S, P120K/T123D, resulted in a complete loss of antigenicity. In addition, ELISA revealed reduced HBs antigenicity of two mutants, W1S N146G and W1S Q129R/G145R. These commercial ELISA-based antigenic reactivities of HBsAg were also strongly correlated with the predicted Ai alterations of affected amino acids due to the specific mutation. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that lysine (K120) and aspartate (D123) simultaneously affected HBsAg antigenicity, leading to diagnostic failure. These findings will improve diagnostic assays and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2571290054,"Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke has become standard of care for patients with large artery occlusion. Early restoration of blood flow is crucial for a good clinical outcome. We introduced an interdisciplinary standard operating procedure (SOP) between neuroradiologists, neurologists and anesthesiologists in order to streamline patient management. This study analyzes the effect of optimized workflow on periprocedural timings and its potential influence on clinical outcome. Data were extracted from a prospectively maintained university hospital stroke database. The standard operating procedure was established in February 2014. Of the 368 acute stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment between 2008 and 2015, 278 patients were treated prior to and 90 after process optimization. Outcome measures were periprocedural time intervals and residual functional impairment. After implementation of the SOP, time from symptom onset to reperfusion was significantly reduced (median 264 min prior and 211 min after SOP-introduction (IQR 228–32 min and 161–278 min, respectively); P<0.001). Especially faster supply of imaging and prompt transfer of patients to the angiography suite contributed to this effect. Time between hospital admission and groin puncture was reduced by half after process optimization (median 64 min after versus 121 min prior to SOP-introduction (IQR 54–77 min and 96–161 min, respectively); P<0.001). Clinical outcome was significantly better after workflow optimization as measured with the modified Rankin Scale (common odds ratio (OR) 0.56; 95% CI 0.32–0.98; P = 0.038). Optimization of workflow and interdisciplinary teamwork significantly improved the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a significant reduction of in-hospital examination, transportation, imaging and treatment times."
https://openalex.org/W2570375830,"Incipient Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by a slow onset of clinical symptoms, with pathological brain changes starting several years earlier. Consequently, it is necessary to first understand and differentiate age-related changes in brain regions in the absence of disease, and then to support early and accurate AD diagnosis. However, there is poor understanding of the initial stage of AD; seemingly healthy elderly brains lose matter in regions related to AD, but similar changes can also be found in non-demented subjects having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By using a Linear Mixed Effects approach, we modelled the change of 166 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers available at a 5-year follow up on healthy elderly control (HC, n = 46) subjects. We hypothesized that, by identifying their significant variant (vr) and quasi-variant (qvr) brain regions over time, it would be possible to obtain an age-based null model, which would characterize their normal atrophy and growth patterns as well as the correlation between these two regions. By using the null model on those subjects who had been clinically diagnosed as HC (n = 161), MCI (n = 209) and AD (n = 331), normal age-related changes were estimated and deviation scores (residuals) from the observed MRI-based biomarkers were computed. Subject classification, as well as the early prediction of conversion to MCI and AD, were addressed through residual-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) modelling. We found reductions in most cortical volumes and thicknesses (with evident gender differences) as well as in sub-cortical regions, including greater atrophy in the hippocampus. The average accuracies (ACC) recorded for men and women were: AD-HC: 94.11%, MCI-HC: 83.77% and MCI converted to AD (cAD)-MCI non-converter (sMCI): 76.72%. Likewise, as compared to standard clinical diagnosis methods, SVM classifiers predicted the conversion of cAD to be 1.9 years earlier for females (ACC:72.5%) and 1.4 years earlier for males (ACC:69.0%)."
https://openalex.org/W2568324590,"Membrane vesicles (MVs) produced by Gram-negative bacteria are being explored for novel clinical applications due to their ability to deliver active molecules to distant host cells, where they can exert immunomodulatory properties. MVs released by the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) are good candidates for testing such applications. However, a drawback for such studies is the low level of MV isolation from in vitro culture supernatants, which may be overcome by the use of mutants in cell envelope proteins that yield a hypervesiculation phenotype. Here, we confirm that a tolR mutation in EcN increases MV production, as determined by protein, LPS and fluorescent lipid measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of negatively stained MVs did not reveal significant differences with wild type EcN MVs. Conversely, TEM observation after high-pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution of bacterial samples, together with cryo-TEM observation of plunge-frozen hydrated isolated MVs showed considerable structural heterogeneity in the EcN tolR samples. In addition to common one-bilayer vesicles (OMVs) and the recently described double-bilayer vesicles (O-IMVs), other types of MVs were observed. Time-course experiments of MV uptake in Caco-2 cells using rhodamine- and DiO-labelled MVs evidenced that EcN tolR MVs displayed reduced internalization levels compared to the wild-type MVs. The low number of intracellular MVs was due to a lower cell binding capacity of the tolR-derived MVs, rather than a different entry pathway or mechanism. These findings indicate that heterogeneity of MVs from tolR mutants may have a major impact on vesicle functionality, and point to the need for conducting a detailed structural analysis when MVs from hypervesiculating mutants are to be used for biotechnological applications."

However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to gemcitabine inevitably occurs. The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of the combination of src inhibition and gemcitabine in gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer cells.By using colony formation, sphere forming, flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays, 231/GEM-res (gemcitabine-resistant) cell line, which was 10 times more resistant, was shown to have elevated drug tolerance, enhanced proliferative and self-renewal abilities, compared with its parental cells. Inhibition of src by both saracatinib (AZD0530) and siRNA could partially reverse gemcitabine resistance and attenuate resistance-associated anti-apoptosis, migration and stem cell capacities. In addition, the combination of src inhibition and gemcitabine had synergistic antitumor effects. Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein BAX, along with the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-XL, Survivin), migration associated proteins (p-FAK, MMP-3) and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD44, Oct-4), which was probably mediated by AKT/c-Jun pathway.In highly gemcitabine-resistant 231 cells, src inhibition can synergize with gemcitabine, reverse drug resistance, inhibit tumor growth/metastasis/stemness of cancer stem cells, possibly via the AKT/c-Jun pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2567542964,"Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria use the type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. In Yersinia, the switch to secretion of effector proteins is induced first after intimate contact between the bacterium and its eukaryotic target cell has been established, and the T3SS proteins YscP and YscU play a central role in this process. Here we identify the molecular details of the YscP binding site on YscU by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The binding interface is centered on the C-terminal domain of YscU. Disrupting the YscU-YscP interaction by introducing point mutations at the interaction interface significantly reduced the secretion of effector proteins and HeLa cell cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the binding of YscP to the slowly self-cleaving YscU variant P264A conferred significant protection against autoproteolysis. The YscP-mediated inhibition of YscU autoproteolysis suggests that the cleavage event may act as a timing switch in the regulation of early versus late T3SS substrates. We also show that YscUC binds to the inner rod protein YscI with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.8 μm and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The significant similarity among different members of the YscU, YscP, and YscI families suggests that the protein-protein interactions discussed in this study are also relevant for other T3SS-containing Gram-negative bacteria.

Here we identify the molecular details of the YscP binding site on YscU by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The binding interface is centered on the C-terminal domain of YscU. Disrupting the YscU-YscP interaction by introducing point mutations at the interaction interface significantly reduced the secretion of effector proteins and HeLa cell cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the binding of YscP to the slowly self-cleaving YscU variant P264A conferred significant protection against autoproteolysis. The YscP-mediated inhibition of YscU autoproteolysis suggests that the cleavage event may act as a timing switch in the regulation of early versus late T3SS substrates. We also show that YscUC binds to the inner rod protein YscI with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.8 μm and with 1:1 stoichiometry. The significant similarity among different members of the YscU, YscP, and YscI families suggests that the protein-protein interactions discussed in this study are also relevant for other T3SS-containing Gram-negative bacteria. Yersinia spp. share a common virulence plasmid that encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) 3The abbreviations used are: T3SStype III secretion systemYopYersinia outer proteinHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceITCisothermal titration calorimetryKddissociation constantTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideMBPmaltose-binding protein. supporting the secretion of the Yersinia outer protein (Yop) effectors from the bacterium into eukaryotic host cells (1Portnoy D.A.

Immun. 1984; 43: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After translocation into the host cells, Yop effectors counteract immune defense mechanisms such as phagocytosis or apoptosis and thereby promote the survival and propagation of the extracellular bacteria (2Rosqvist R.

Microbiol. 1990; 4: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Many pathogenic and symbiotic Gram-negative bacteria also utilize the T3SS to deliver proteins during the interactions with their hosts (3Hueck C.J.

The T3SS (also referred to in the literature as the non-flagellar T3SS) evolved from the flagellum, and both systems present a similar architecture (5Cornelis G.R.

The type III secretion injectisome.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). However, the basal body of the flagellum is connected to an extracellular hook that forms a link with the flagellar filament. In contrast, the T3SS basal body is attached to a needle (in animal pathogens) or a pilus (in plant pathogens) that protrudes from the bacterial surface (5Cornelis G.R.

The basal body and the needle/pilus together form the so-called needle complex that is the hallmark of the T3SS. type III secretion system Yersinia outer protein heteronuclear single quantum coherence isothermal titration calorimetry dissociation constant N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside maltose-binding protein. It is accepted that the needle complex is assembled in a stepwise manner, and in Yersinia spp., it has been shown that the inner membrane platform (formed by YscR, -S, -T, -U, and -V) is assembled independently of the outer membrane ring-forming proteins (YscC, -J, and -D) (9Diepold A.

Microbiol. 2011; 82: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After association of the inner and outer rings (mediated by YscJ), the secretion of the so-called early substrates such as the needle subunit YscF begins, which results in elongation of the needle complex. Activation of the T3SS impairs the secretion of the early substrates but triggers the secretion of the Yop effectors (late substrates) (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A.

It has been shown that YscP plays a critical role in regulating the needle length (15Makishima S. Komoriya K. Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S.-I.

Rev. 2012; 76: 262-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). An YscP-null mutant or insertions within the YscP sequence triggered the formation of long needles. in contrast, shorter needles were produced when deletions were introduced in the YscP sequence (19Agrain C. Sorg I. Paroz C. Cornelis G.R. Secretion of YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica is essential to control the length of the injectisome needle but not to change the type III secretion substrate specificity.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1415-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a minimal needle length is required to support Yop secretion (17Mota L.J. Journet L. Sorg I. Agrain C. Cornelis G.R. Bacterial injectisomes: needle length does matter.Science. 2005; 307: 1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the needle length is tightly regulated and that YscP functions as a molecular ruler (16Journet L. Agrain C. Broz P. Cornelis G.R. The needle length of bacterial injectisomes is determined by a molecular ruler.Science. 2003; 302: 1757-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although the ruler model has attracted significant interest, alternative models of needle length control such as the measuring cup model (15Makishima S. Komoriya K. Yamaguchi S. Aizawa S.-I. Length of the flagellar hook and the capacity of the type III export apparatus.Science. 2001; 291: 2411-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the molecular clock model (20Marlovits T.C. Kubori T. Lara-Tejero M. Thomas D. Unger V.M. Galán J.E. Assembly of the inner rod determines needle length in the type III secretion injectisome.Nature. 2006; 441: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have also been proposed, and there is currently no consensus regarding the true nature of the needle length control mechanism. A systematic deletion analysis of YscP in Yersinia enterocolitica led to the identification of domains with specific functions (11Agrain C. Callebaut I. Journet L. Sorg I. Paroz C. Mota L.J. Cornelis G.R. Characterization of a Type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain in YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica.Mol.

Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1415-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), including two distinct secretion signals (residues 1–35 and residues 97–137) and a substrate specificity switch domain located between residues 385 and 500 (11Agrain C. Callebaut I. Journet L. Sorg I. Paroz C. Mota L.J. Cornelis G.R. Characterization of a Type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain in YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Homologues of YscP with similar functions are found in the flagella and T3SSs of diverse bacterial species (21Mizuno S. Amida H.

Chem. 2016; 291: 1676-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). YscU in Yersinia spp. and FlhB in the flagellum have also been linked to the substrate specificity switch (23Sorg I. Wagner S. Amstutz M. Müller S.A. Broz P. Lussi Y. Engel A. Cornelis G.R. YscU recognizes translocators as export substrates of the Yersinia injectisome.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3015-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). YscU is anchored in the inner membrane via four transmembrane helices and possesses a large C-terminal cytoplasmic domain named YscUC (Fig. 1) (24Wiesand U. Sorg I. Amstutz M. Wagner S. van den Heuvel J. Lührs T. Cornelis G.R. Heinz D.W. Structure of the type III secretion recognition protein YscU from Yersinia enterocolitica.J. Mol.

Atomic resolution structure of the cytoplasmic domain of Yersinia pestis YscU, a regulatory switch involved in type III secretion.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). YscUC is characterized by a conserved NPTH motif that undergoes an autoproteolytic process (between Asp263 and Pro264) to generate a C-terminal peptide named YscUCC that form a stable complex with the N-terminal part of the cytoplasmic domain named YscUCN. Previous results obtained in our laboratories suggest that the positively charged residues within the linker between YscUC and the membrane domain interact with the membrane lipids to associate YscUC with the inner membrane (26Weise C.F. Login F. H. Ho O. Gröbner G. Wolf-Watz H. Wolf-Watz M. Negatively charged lipid membranes promote a disorder-order transition in the Yersinia YscU protein.Biophys. J. 2014; 107: 1950-1961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been shown that mutations at Asp263 or Pro264 that block YscU autoproteolysis interfere with both needle formation and Yop secretion (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU regulate substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system.J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, we have shown that the dissociation of YscUC is required for Yop effector secretion (28Frost S. Ho O. Login F.H. Weise C.F. Wolf-Watz H. Wolf-Watz M. Autoproteolysis and intramolecular dissociation of Yersinia YscU precedes secretion of its C-terminal polypeptide YscU(CC).PLoS One. 2012; 7e49349Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that YscUC contains a C-terminal secretion signal domain (29Login F.H. Wolf-Watz H.

The deletion of the last 15 residues of YscU triggered an increase in YscF secretion without affecting Yop secretion (29Login F.H. Wolf-Watz H.

Thus, like YscP, YscU is involved in the substrate specificity switch. Similar results were reported for FliK and FlhB, which are the flagellar homologues of YscP and YscU, respectively (30Kutsukake K. Minamino T. Yokoseki T.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phenotype observed in a yscP-null mutant was partially suppressed by single amino acid substitutions within YscU (YscUA268F, YscUY287G, and YscUV292T) (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU regulate substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that these suppressor mutants are less stable and exhibit faster dissociation kinetics than the wild-type protein, which enabled Yop secretion to occur in the absence of YscP (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU regulate substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system.J.

Autoproteolysis and intramolecular dissociation of Yersinia YscU precedes secretion of its C-terminal polypeptide YscU(CC).PLoS One. 2012; 7e49349Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Direct interactions have been observed between FlhB and FliK (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) and between the homologous proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PscU and PscP (residues 31–36), supporting the proposed functional link between YscU and YscP homologues (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU regulate substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system.J.

The homologue of YscI in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, PrgJ, has been proposed to form the inner rod, a structure that connects the needle to the basal body (20Marlovits T.C. Kubori T. Lara-Tejero M. Thomas D. Unger V.M. Galán J.E. Assembly of the inner rod determines needle length in the type III secretion injectisome.Nature. 2006; 441: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Sukhan A. Kubori T. Galán J.E. Synthesis and localization of the Salmonella SPI-1 type III secretion needle complex proteins PrgI and PrgJ.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3480-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A study on Yersinia pseudotuberculosis showed that both YscP and YscU regulate YscI export (33Wood S.E. Jin J. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU switch the substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system by regulating export of the inner rod protein YscI.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4252-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Indeed, YscI secretion by the T3SS is increased in a yscP-null mutant, whereas mutations in YscUC reduced the secretion level of YscI in a ΔyscP strain. Interestingly, it was also recently shown that in Y. enterocolitica YscI is required for the export of YscP-PhoA hybrid into the periplasm (34Diepold A. Wiesand U. Amstutz M. Cornelis G.R. Assembly of the Yersinia injectisome: the missing pieces.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, an interaction between EscI and EscU (homologues of YscI and YscU, respectively) in Escherichia coli has been reported (35Sal-Man N. Deng W. Finlay B.B. EscI: a crucial component of the type III secretion system forms the inner rod structure in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.Biochem. J. 2012; 442: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we report data regarding the interactions among YscU and the two proteins YscP and YscI. Using NMR spectroscopy, we showed that YscP binds to the C-terminal helix of YscU. The A335N point mutation within the YscP binding interface of YscUC disrupted YscU-YscP interaction without affecting the YscUC structure. The interaction was found to be functionally significant, and a yscU-null mutant expressing the YscUA335N variant did not secrete Yops into the culture supernatant and did not induce cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. Furthermore, unlike a ΔyscP mutant or YscU mutants in the NPTH motif, YscUA335N did not promote secretion of the needle subunit YscF. These results suggest that the YscU-YscP interaction is critical for secretion of both early and late substrates. In addition, we found that binding of YscP to the slowly autocleaving mutant YscUCP264A reduced the rate constant of the autocleavage event in vitro. This finding suggests that the binding of YscP to YscUC can regulate the autocatalytic event, which in turn would affect the ability of YscUC to dissociate and the subsequent secretion of its C-terminal polypeptide (YscUCC). Finally, data from isothermal titration calorimetry and pulldown assays show that YscI interacts with YscUC but not with either of the polypeptides resulting from autoproteolysis and dissociation (YscUCN and YscUCC). Previous genetic analysis showed that yscP deletion abolishes Yop secretion and that the wild-type phenotype can be partially rescued by the A268F, Y287G, and V292T suppressor mutations within YscU (10Edqvist P.J. Olsson J. Lavander M. Sundberg L. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Lloyd S.A. YscP and YscU regulate substrate specificity of the Yersinia type III secretion system.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that an interaction between YscP and YscU was critical for Yop secretion. Here we characterize the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of YscU (YscUC) and YscP using NMR spectroscopy. A direct interaction between YscP and YscUC homologues in P. aeruginosa (denoted PscP and PscUC, respectively) has been observed previously by NMR (22Bergeron J.R. Fernández L. Wasney G.A. Vuckovic M. Reffuveille F. Hancock R.E. Strynadka N.C. The structure of a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) ruler protein suggests a molecular mechanism for needle length sensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1676-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); it was shown that a conserved N-terminal segment of PscP was responsible for its interaction with PscUC. The domain architecture of PscP has been described as a “ball-and-chain” topology where the “ball”, i.e. the C-terminal domain, is folded and believed to function as a substrate switch, whereas the N-terminal “chain” polypeptide is disordered and flexible in solution (22Bergeron J.R. Fernández L. Wasney G.A. Vuckovic M. Reffuveille F. Hancock R.E. Strynadka N.C. The structure of a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) ruler protein suggests a molecular mechanism for needle length sensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 1676-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A similar architecture has been determined for the YscP homologue FliK from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (21Mizuno S. Amida H. Kobayashi N. Aizawa S. Tate S. The NMR structure of FliK, the trigger for the switch of substrate specificity in the flagellar type III secretion apparatus.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 558-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence and structural alignment of YscP with FliK, PscP, and other homologues (supplemental Fig. 1) suggests that YscP has a structural topology resembling those described for FliK and PscP. To investigate the domain architecture of YscP, we used three constructs (Fig. 2A) that were designed based on the results of a limited proteolysis experiment of YscP (supplemental Fig. 2) and a multiple sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. 1). These YscP variants were subjected to structural analysis using NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. First, size exclusion chromatography was used to determine the oligomeric state of YscP, YscP(342–442), and YscP(203–455) in solution. Interestingly, although the full-length YscP migrated as a 50-kDa monomer, YscP(342–442) and YscP(203–455) eluted with the column void volume, suggesting that both truncated variants aggregated in solution (supplemental Fig. 3). A CD spectrum of full-length YscP (Fig. 2B) indicated that the protein contained both unstructured and structured regions, and this was confirmed by the observation of bands at 205 and 220 nm in their CD spectra. The structured region of YscP was assigned to the C terminus of the protein by analyzing the CD spectra of the two truncated variants (YscP(203–455) and YscP(342–442)). To confirm that YscP(342–442) contained a structured domain, we acquired a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of a sample of the protein that was isotopically enriched with 15NH4Cl. This NMR spectrum conclusively demonstrated that YscP(342–442) is a folded domain because it exhibits the large chemical shift dispersion typical of well folded proteins (supplemental Fig. 4). Although folded, the domain displayed tendencies to aggregate. The NMR spectrum was acquired at a concentration of 50 μm, and any increase in concentration resulted in precipitation of the protein. These results together demonstrate that YscP has a ball-and-chain domain architecture like its homologues. Next, we investigated the interaction between YscP and YscUC by observing perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-isotopically enriched YscUC upon addition of the different YscP constructs. In general, interactions between partners in such cases induce changes in the chemical shifts or the line width of the peaks in the spectrum depending on the molecular masses of the interacting partners. The addition of YscP(342–442) did not trigger any changes in the NMR spectrum of YscUC (Fig. 2C), suggesting that this YscP segment does not harbor the YscUC interaction interface. In contrast, we observed extensive line broadening of the YscUC resonances when YscP(203–455) was added (Fig. 2D), indicating that YscUC becomes integrated into a high molecular weight complex following the addition of YscP(203–455). Based on this analysis, we propose that the YscUC binding segment on YscP is localized between residues Glu203 and Arg341. Despite intensive studies on YscP and YscU homologues, there are no high resolution structural data on the interaction interface on YscUC responsible for its interaction with YscP. We identified this interaction interface using NMR spectroscopy by titrating unlabeled YscP to 15N-labeled YscUC. The stepwise addition of unlabeled YscP to 15N-labeled YscUC caused localized perturbations in the chemical shifts of the amide proton and nitrogen resonances of several YscUC residues in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the protein (Fig. 3A). The binding interface was identified by displaying the residues with significant compounded chemical shift perturbations on the YscUC structure (Fig. 3B). As expected for a well defined interaction interface, the YscP-interacting residues on YscUC cluster to form a contiguous surface; the solvent-exposed residues Leu280, Ala328, Glu332, Ala335, and Glu336 seem to form the YscP interaction interface. Interestingly, the interaction interface is centered on the C-terminal α helix of the YscU C-terminal domain (YscUCC) (Fig. 3C). The titration experiment also enabled us to estimate the binding affinity (dissociation constant (Kd)) of the YscP-YscUC interaction by monitoring changes in the chemical shifts of the methyl resonances of YscUC as the concentration of YscP increased (Fig. 3D). These data were then fitted to an analytical function based on an assumed two-state binding reaction. The best fitted binding isotherm gave a Kd value of 430 ± 293 μm. Although the estimated Kd value suggests that the YscU-YscP interaction is relatively weak under our experimental conditions, this interaction may be modulated in vivo by other factors such as membrane anchoring (26Weise C.F.

Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy is used to treat breast cancer patients; however, neutropenia is a common hematologic side effect and can be life-threatening. The ABCB1 and SLC22A16 genes encode proteins that are essential for doxorubicin transport. In this study, we explored the effect of 2 common polymorphisms in ABCB1 (rs10276036 C/T) and SLC22A16 (rs12210538 A/G) on the development of grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia in Iranian breast cancer patients. Our results showed no significant association between these polymorphisms and grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia; however, allele C of ABCB1 (rs10276036 C/T) (p = 0.315, OR = 1.500, 95% CI = 0.679–3.312) and allele A of SLC22A16 (rs12210538 A/G) (p = 0.110, OR = 2.984, 95% CI = 0.743–11.988) tended to have a greater association with grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia, whereas allele T of ABCB1 (rs10276036) (p = 0.130, OR = 0.515, 95% CI = 0.217–1.223) and allele G of SLC22A16 (rs12210538) (p = 0.548, OR = 0.786, 95% CI = 0.358–1.726) tended to protect against this condition. In addition to breast cancer, a statistically significant association was also observed between the development of grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia and other clinical manifestations such as stage IIIC cancer (p = 0.037) and other diseases (p = 0.026). Our results indicate that evaluation of the risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia development and consideration of molecular and clinical findings may be of value when screening for high-risk breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2570203416,"A thorough search for bat herpesviruses was carried out in oropharyngeal samples taken from most of the bat species present in the Iberian Peninsula from the Vespertilionidae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae and Rhinolophidae families, in addition to a colony of captive fruit bats from the Pteropodidae family. By using two degenerate consensus PCR methods targeting two conserved genes, distinct and previously unrecognized bat-hosted herpesviruses were identified for the most of the tested species. All together a total of 42 potentially novel bat herpesviruses were partially characterized. Thirty-two of them were tentatively assigned to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily while the remaining 10 were allocated into the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily. Significant diversity was observed among the novel sequences when compared with type herpesvirus species of the ICTV-approved genera. The inferred phylogenetic relationships showed that most of the betaherpesviruses sequences fell into a well-supported unique monophyletic clade and support the recognition of a new betaherpesvirus genus. This clade is subdivided into three major clades, corresponding to the families of bats studied. This supports the hypothesis of a species-specific parallel evolution process between the potentially new betaherpesviruses and their bat hosts. Interestingly, two of the betaherpesviruses’ sequences detected in rhinolophid bats clustered together apart from the rest, closely related to viruses that belong to the Roseolovirus genus. This suggests a putative third roseolo lineage. On the contrary, no phylogenetic structure was detected among several potentially novel bat-hosted gammaherpesviruses found in the study. Remarkably, all of the possible novel bat herpesviruses described in this study are linked to a unique bat species."

From 910 patient records, 627 patients met the inclusion criteria. We investigated the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and mortality. Further, we studied the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and ICU length of stay (LOS).Metabolic alkalosis was associated with decreased 30-day and 12-month mortalities. This effect was however lost when a multivariate analysis was conducted, correcting for age, gender, pH on admission, base excess (BE) on admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) and acute kidney injury (AKI). We then analyzed for any dose-response effect between the severity of metabolic alkalosis and mortality and found no relationship. Bivariate analysis showed that metabolic alkalosis had a significant effect on the length of ICU stay. When adjusting for age, sex, pH at admission, BE at admission, SAPS III and AKI in a multivariate analysis, metabolic alkalosis significantly contributed to prolonged ICU length of stay. In two separate sensitivity analyses pure metabolic alkalosis and late metabolic alkalosis (time of onset >48 hours) were the only significant predictor of increased ICU length of stay.Metabolic alkalosis did not have any effect on 30-day and 12-month mortalities after adjusting for age, sex, SAPS III-score, pH and BE on admission and AKI in a multivariate analysis. The presence of metabolic alkalosis was independently associated with an increased ICU length of stay."

Therefore, we evaluated the association between SHSE and depressive symptoms among Korean adolescents.The JS High School Study enrolled 1071 high school freshmen from a rural community of South Korea. The current analysis was limited to 989 adolescents (495 male and 494 female adolescents), after excluding 48 ever-smokers, 3 students with physician-diagnosed depression, and 31 students who did not complete the depression questionnaire. SHSE was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire and was classified into three groups: none, occasional exposure, and regular exposure. Depressive symptoms were assessed according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score, ranging from 0 to 63, and the presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a BDI score ≥10.Overall, adolescents with SHSE were more likely to have depressive symptoms than those without SHSE (p = 0.042).In a sex-specific analysis treating the BDI score as a continuous variable, regular SHSE was independently associated with higher BDI scores in male adolescents (β = 2.25, p = 0.026), but not in female adolescents (β = 1.11, p = 0.253). Compared to no SHSE, the odds ratio for having depressive symptoms among male adolescents with regular SHSE was 2.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 4.25) after adjusting for age, body mass index, and study year, and 3.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.52 to 8.73) after adjusting for age, body mass index, study year, exercise, and household income.Regular exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with having depressive symptoms among Korean male adolescents."

Secondary, to determine whether reducing the length of the checklist compromises diagnostic value.All children (<18 years) attending one of the participating OPCs in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient file. CPS provided data on all checklist positives and a sample of 5500 checklist negatives (dataset). The checklist outcome was compared with a report to CPS in 10 months follow up after the OPC visit.The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0.2%) checklists were positive. Within the dataset, 61 children were reported to CPS, with emotional neglect as the most frequent type of abuse (32.8%). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the checklist for child abuse was 8.3 (95% CI 3.9-15.2). The negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.1 (98.8-99.3), with 52 false negatives. When the length of the checklist was reduced to two questions closely related to the medical process (SPUTOVAMO-R3), the PPV was 9.1 (3.7-17.8) and the NPV 99.1 (98.7-99.3). These two questions are on the injury in relation to the history, and the interaction between child and parents.The checklist SPUTOVAMO-R2 has a low detection rate of child abuse within the OPC setting, and a high false positive rate. Therefore, we recommend to use the shortened checklist only as a tool to increase the awareness of child abuse and not as a diagnostic instrument."
https://openalex.org/W2568825134,"Currently, colour-coded duplex sonography (2D-CDS) is clinical standard for detection and grading of internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). However, unlike angiographic imaging modalities, 2D-CDS assesses ICAS by its hemodynamic effects rather than luminal changes. Aim of this study was to evaluate freehand 3D ultrasound (3DUS) for direct visualisation and quantification of ICAS.Thirty-seven patients with 43 ICAS were examined with 2D-CDS as reference standard and with freehand B-mode respectively power-mode 3DUS. Stenotic value of 3D reconstructed ICAS was calculated as distal diameter respectively distal cross-sectional area (CSA) reduction percentage and compared with 2D-CDS.There was a trend but no significant difference in successful 3D reconstruction of ICAS between B-mode and power mode (examiner 1 {Ex1} 81% versus 93%, examiner 2 {Ex2} 84% versus 88%). Inter-rater agreement was best for power-mode 3DUS and assessment of stenotic value as distal CSA reduction percentage (intraclass correlation coefficient {ICC} 0.90) followed by power-mode 3DUS and distal diameter reduction percentage (ICC 0.81). Inter-rater agreement was poor for B-mode 3DUS (ICC, distal CSA reduction 0.36, distal diameter reduction 0.51). Intra-rater agreement for power-mode 3DUS was good for both measuring methods (ICC, distal CSA reduction 0.88 {Ex1} and 0.78 {Ex2}; ICC, distal diameter reduction 0.83 {Ex1} and 0.76 {Ex2}). In comparison to 2D-CDS inter-method agreement was good and clearly better for power-mode 3DUS (ICC, distal diameter reduction percentage: Ex1 0.85, Ex2 0.78; distal CSA reduction percentage: Ex1 0.63, Ex2 0.57) than for B-mode 3DUS (ICC, distal diameter reduction percentage: Ex1 0.40, Ex2 0.52; distal CSA reduction percentage: Ex1 0.15, Ex2 0.51).Non-invasive power-mode 3DUS is superior to B-mode 3DUS for imaging and quantification of ICAS. Thereby, further studies are warranted which should now compare power-mode 3DUS with the angiographic gold standard imaging modalities for quantification of ICAS, i.e. with CTA or CE-MRA."
https://openalex.org/W2570524300,"Background The alterations in cortical morphology, such as cortical thinning, observed in psychotic disorder, may be the outcome of interacting genetic and environmental effects. It has been suggested that urban upbringing may represent a proxy environmental effect impacting cortical thickness (CT). Therefore, the current study examined whether the association between group as a proxy genetic variable (patients with psychotic disorder [high genetic risk], healthy siblings of patients [intermediate risk] and healthy control subjects [average risk]) and CT was conditional on different levels of the childhood urban environment and whether this was sex-dependent. Methods T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired from 89 patients with a psychotic disorder, 95 non-psychotic siblings of patients with psychotic disorder and 87 healthy control subjects. Freesurfer software was used to measure CT. Developmental urban exposure was classified as low, medium, and high, reflecting the population density and the number of moves between birth and the 15th birthday, using data from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics and the equivalent database in Belgium. Multilevel regression analyses were used to examine the association between group, sex, and urban upbringing (as well as their interactions) and cortical CT as the dependent variable. Results CT was significantly smaller in the patient group compared to the controls (B = -0.043, p <0.001), but not in the siblings compared to the controls (B = -0.013, p = 0.31). There was no main effect of developmental urbanicity on CT (B = 0.001, p = 0.91). Neither the three-way group × urbanicity × sex interaction (χ2 = 3.73, p = 0.16), nor the two-way group × urbanicity interaction was significant (χ2 = 0.51, p = 0.77). Conclusion The negative association between (familial risk for) psychotic disorder and CT was not moderated by developmental urbanicity, suggesting that reduced CT is not the outcome of familial sensitivity to the proxy environmental factor ‘urban upbringing’."
https://openalex.org/W2583522538,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein, resulting in increased production of a self-aggregating form of beta amyloid (Aβ). Several lines of work on AD patients and transgenic mice with high Aβ levels exhibit altered rhythmicity, aberrant neuronal network activity and hyperexcitability reflected in clusters of hyperactive neurons, and spontaneous epileptic activity. Recent studies highlight that abnormal accumulation of Aβ changes intrinsic properties of inhibitory neurons, which is one of the main reasons underlying the impaired network activity. However, specific cellular mechanisms leading to interneuronal dysfunction are not completely understood. Using extended Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism in conjunction with patch-clamp experiments, we investigate the mechanisms leading to the impaired activity of interneurons. Our detailed analysis indicates that increased Na+ leak explains several observations in inhibitory neurons, including their failure to reliably produce action potentials, smaller action potential amplitude, increased resting membrane potential, and higher membrane depolarization in response to a range of stimuli in a model of APPSWE/PSEN1DeltaE9 (APdE9) AD mice as compared to age-matched control mice. While increasing the conductance of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel could account for most of the observations, the extent of increase required to reproduce these observations render such changes unrealistic. Furthermore, increasing the conductance of HCN does not account for the observed changes in depolarizability of interneurons from APdE9 mice as compared to those from NTG mice. None of the other pathways tested could lead to all observations about interneuronal dysfunction. Thus we conclude that upregulated sodium leak is the most likely source of impaired interneuronal function."

Arbovirus surveillance, observational studies and experimental studies have implicated passerine birds (songbirds, e.g., crows, American robins, house sparrows, and house finches) as significant reservoirs of WNV in North America, yet we lack a tractable passerine animal model for controlled studies of the virus. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) serves as a model system across a diversity of fields, and here we develop the zebra finch a songbird model for WNV. Like many natural hosts of WNV, we found that zebra finches developed sufficient viremia to serve as a competent host, yet in general resisted mortality from infection. In the Australian zebra finch (AZF) T. g. castanotis, we detected WNV in the majority of sampled tissues by 4 days post injection (dpi). However, WNV was not detected in tissues of sacrificed birds at 14 dpi, shortly after the development of detectable anti-WNV antibodies in the majority of birds indicating successful viral clearance. We compared susceptibility between the two zebra finch subspecies AZF and Timor zebra finch (TZF) T. g. guttata. Compared to AZF, WNV RNA was detected in a larger proportion of challenged TZF and molecular detection of virus in the serum of TZF was significantly higher than in AZF. Given the observed moderate host competence and disease susceptibility, we suggest that zebra finches are appropriate as models for the study of WNV and although underutilized in this respect, may be ideal models for the study of the many diseases carried and transmitted by songbirds."

Eight fermenters (1,223 ± 21 mL) were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with periods lasting 12 d each (8 d for adaptation and 4 d for sampling). Dietary treatments were: 1) 10% CP, 2) 12% CP, 3) 14% CP, and 4) 10 and 14% CP diets oscillating at 48-h intervals. Experimental diets consisted of 50% orchard hay and 50% concentrate. Fermenters were fed 72 g/d and solid and liquid dilution rates were adjusted to 5.5 and 11%/h, respectively. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with α = 0.05. Apparent and true ruminal digestibilities of dry matter and organic matter were not affected (P > 0.05) by increasing dietary CP, nor by oscillating dietary CP. Total volatile fatty acids concentration and molar proportions of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-butyrate and iso-valerate were not affected (P > 0.05) by increasing or oscillating dietary CP. Ruminal NH3-N concentration increased linearly (P < 0.01) in response to increasing dietary CP. Total N, non-ammonia N, and rumen undegraded protein flows did not differ among treatments or between oscillating dietary CP and static 12% CP. Microbial N and NH3-N flows and microbial efficiency did not differ when comparing oscillating versus static CP (P > 0.05). However, there was a quadratic effect (P < 0.05) for these variables when dietary CP was increased. These results indicate that either ruminal microorganisms do not respond to oscillating CP levels or are capable of coping with 48-h periods of undernourishment."
https://openalex.org/W2569620070,"Brachial plexus injury (BPI) is a devastating type of nerve injury, potentially causing loss of motor and sensory function. Principally, BPI is either categorized as preganglionic or postganglionic, with the early establishment of injury level being crucial for choosing the correct treatment strategy. Despite diagnostic advances, the need for a reliable, non-invasive method for establishing the injury level remains. We studied the usefulness of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord for determination of injury level. The findings were related to neuronal and glial changes. Rats underwent unilateral L4 & L5 ventral roots avulsion or sciatic nerve axotomy. The injuries served as models for pre- and postganglionic BPI, respectively. MRI of the L4/L5 spinal cord segments 4 weeks after avulsion showed ventral horn (VH) shrinkage on the injured side compared to the uninjured side. Axotomy induced no change in the VH size on MRI. Following avulsion, histological sections of L4/L5 revealed shrinkage in the VH grey matter area occupied by NeuN-positive neurons, loss of microtubular-associated protein-2 positive dendritic branches (MAP2), pan-neurofilament positive axons (PanNF), synaptophysin-positive synapses (SYN) and increase in immunoreactivity for the microglial OX42 and astroglial GFAP markers. Axotomy induced no changes in NeuN-reactivity, modest decrease of MAP2 immunoreactivity, no changes in SYN and PanNF labelling, and a modest increase in OX42 and SYN labeling. Histological and radiological findings were congruent when assessing changes after axotomy, while MRI somewhat underestimated the shrinkage. This study indicates a potential diagnostic value of structural spinal cord MRI following BPI."
https://openalex.org/W2571529394,"Background/objectives It has been suggested that subfertility and testicular cancer share genetic and environmental risk factors. We studied both subfertility and the strongest known testicular cancer susceptibility gene, the c-KIT ligand (KITLG), whose pathway is involved in spermatogenesis. Methods The EPSAM case-control study is comprised of testicular cancer patients from the Province of Turin, Italy, diagnosed between 1997 and 2008. The present analysis included 245 cases and 436 controls from EPSAM, who were aged 20 years or older at diagnosis/recruitment. The EPSAM questionnaire collected information on factors such as number of children, age at first attempt to conceive, duration of attempt to conceive, use of assisted reproduction techniques, physician-assigned diagnosis of infertility, number of siblings, and self-reported cryptorchidism. Genotyping of the KITLG single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs995030 was performed on the saliva samples of 202 cases and 329 controls. Results Testicular cancer was associated with the number of children fathered 5 years before diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) per additional child: 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58–1.04) and sibship size (OR per additional sibling: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.88). When considering the reproductive history until 1 year before diagnosis, attempting to conceive for at least 12 months or fathering a child using assisted reproduction techniques was not associated with the risk of testicular cancer, nor was age at first attempt to conceive or physician-assigned diagnosis of infertility. The SNP rs995030 was strongly associated with risk of testicular cancer (per allele OR: 1.83; 95%CI: 1.26–2.64), but it did not modify the association between number of children and the risk of testicular cancer. Conclusion This study supports the repeatedly reported inverse association between number of children and risk of testicular cancer, but it does not find evidence of an association for other indicators of subfertility."
https://openalex.org/W2568380057,"The escape behavior of a cockroach may not occur when it is either in a quiescent state or after being stung by the jewel wasp (Ampulex compressa). In the present paper, we show that quiescence is an innate lethargic state during which the cockroach is less responsive to external stimuli. The neuronal mechanism of such a state is poorly understood. In contrast to quiescence, the venom-induced lethargic state is not an innate state in cockroaches. The Jewel Wasp disables the escape behavior of cockroaches by injecting its venom directly in the head ganglia, inside a neuropile called the central complex a ‘higher center’ known to regulate motor behaviors. In this paper we show that the coxal slow motoneuron ongoing activity, known to be involved in posture, is reduced in quiescent animals, as compared to awake animals, and it is further reduced in stung animals. Moreover, the regular tonic firing of the slow motoneuron present in both awake and quiescent cockroaches is lost in stung cockroaches. Injection of procaine to prevent neuronal activity into the central complex to mimic the wasp venom injection produces a similar effect on the activity of the slow motoneuron. In conclusion, we speculate that the neuronal modulation during the quiescence and venom-induced lethargic states may occur in the central complex and that both states could share a common neuronal mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2568914526,"Recent studies on logical reasoning have suggested that people are intuitively aware of the logical validity of syllogisms or that they intuitively detect conflict between heuristic responses and logical norms via slight changes in their feelings. According to logical intuition studies, logically valid or heuristic logic no-conflict reasoning is fluently processed and induces positive feelings without conscious awareness. One criticism states that such effects of logicality disappear when confounding factors such as the content of syllogisms are controlled. The present study used abstract propositions and tested whether people intuitively detect logical value. Experiment 1 presented four logical propositions (conjunctive, biconditional, conditional, and material implications) regarding a target case and asked the participants to rate the extent to which they liked the statement. Experiment 2 tested the effects of matching bias, as well as intuitive logic, on the reasoners' feelings by manipulating whether the antecedent or consequent (or both) of the conditional was affirmed or negated. The results showed that both logicality and matching bias affected the reasoners' feelings, and people preferred logically true targets over logically false ones for all forms of propositions. These results suggest that people intuitively detect what is true from what is false during abstract reasoning. Additionally, a Bayesian mixed model meta-analysis of conditionals indicated that people's intuitive interpretation of the conditional ""if p then q"" fits better with the conditional probability, q given p."
https://openalex.org/W2569278859,"The provision of NaCl, according to current recommendations, to horses in moderate work has been shown to induce immediate postprandial acidosis. The present study aimed to clarify whether this NaCl induced acidosis i) persists beyond the immediate postprandial period, and ii) is still present after a 2 week adaptation period. Six adult warmblood mares in moderate work received daily 1.00 kg hay per 100 kg body weight (bwt) only together with 0.64 kg unprocessed cereal grains/100 kg bwt.d as fed basis. Using a 3x3 Latin Square, either 0 (NaCl-0), 50 (NaCl-50) or 100 (NaCl-100) g NaCl/d were fed together with the concentrates in two equal doses for 3 weeks. During the final week, a mineral digestibility trial was undertaken. The middle sodium and chloride intake (NaCl-50) at least met the most common recommendations for moderate work. Morning (7:00 AM) urine and venous blood samples were collected on days 0, 1–4, 8, and 15, and analysed for pH, acid-base status, creatinine and electrolyte concentrations. Fractional electrolyte clearances (FC) were determined. Mean apparent sodium digestibility ranged between 60–62% whereas chloride digestibility was consistently above 94%. Supplementing 100 g but not 50 g of NaCl resulted in significant reduction of blood pH and base excess as well as urinary pH and urine acid excretion. Both 50 g and 100 g NaCl supplementation caused a significant reduction in base and net acid-base excretion, urine density and potassium concentration, but increased urine sodium concentration and the FC of sodium and chloride (P < 0.05). This suggests that a high proportion of the recommended salt doses is excreted renally. The above effects of NaCl supplementation persisted over the 2 week measurement period. Results suggest that feeding 100 g NaCl to moderately exercising horses results in mild metabolic acidosis, whereas feeding 50 g according to current recommendations resulted in compensated acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2562263220,"The survival and proliferation of CLL cells depends on microenvironmental contacts in lymphoid organs. CD38 is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in survival and proliferation signaling in CLL. In this study we demonstrate SYK's direct involvement in the CD38 signaling pathway in primary CLL samples. CD38 stimulation of CLL cells revealed SYK activation. SYK downstream target AKT was subsequently induced and MCL-1 expression was increased. Concomitant inhibition of SYK by the SYK inhibitor R406 resulted in reduced activation of AKT and prevented upregulation of MCL-1. Moreover, short-term CD38 stimulation enhanced BCR-signaling, as indicated by increased ERK phosphorylation. CXCL12-dependent migration was increased after CD38 stimulation. Treating CLL cells with R406 inhibited CD38-mediated migration. In addition, we observed marked downregulation of CD38 expression for CLL cells treated with R406 compared to vehicle control. Finally, we observed a clear correlation between CD38 expression on CLL cells and SYK-inhibitor efficacy. In conclusion, our study provides deeper mechanistic insight into the effect of SYK inhibition in CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2569694780,"We present a virtual reality (VR) framework for the analysis of whole human body surface area. Usual methods for determining the whole body surface area (WBSA) are based on well known formulae, characterized by large errors when the subject is obese, or belongs to certain subgroups. For these situations, we believe that a computer vision approach can overcome these problems and provide a better estimate of this important body indicator. Unfortunately, using machine learning techniques to design a computer vision system able to provide a new body indicator that goes beyond the use of only body weight and height, entails a long and expensive data acquisition process. A more viable solution is to use a dataset composed of virtual subjects. Generating a virtual dataset allowed us to build a population with different characteristics (obese, underweight, age, gender). However, synthetic data might differ from a real scenario, typical of the physician’s clinic. For this reason we develop a new virtual environment to facilitate the analysis of human subjects in 3D. This framework can simulate the acquisition process of a real camera, making it easy to analyze and to create training data for machine learning algorithms. With this virtual environment, we can easily simulate the real setup of a clinic, where a subject is standing in front of a camera, or may assume a different pose with respect to the camera. We use this newly designated environment to analyze the whole body surface area (WBSA). In particular, we show that we can obtain accurate WBSA estimations with just one view, virtually enabling the possibility to use inexpensive depth sensors (e.g., the Kinect) for large scale quantification of the WBSA from a single view 3D map."

Inactivation of estC results in a small increase in the resistance to organic hydroperoxides, whereas a high level of expression of estC from an expression vector leads to a reduction in the resistance to organic hydroperoxides and menadione. The estC gene is transcribed divergently from its regulator, estR. Expression analysis showed that only high concentrations of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP, 1 mM) induced expression of both genes in an EstR-dependent manner. The EstR protein acts as a CHP sensor and a transcriptional repressor of both genes. EstR specifically binds to the operator sites OI and OII overlapping the promoter elements of estC and estR. This binding is responsible for transcription repression of both genes. Exposure to organic hydroperoxide results in oxidation of the sensing cysteine (Cys16) residue of EstR, leading to a release of the oxidized repressor from the operator sites, thereby allowing transcription and high levels of expression of both genes. The estC is the first organic hydroperoxide-inducible esterase-encoding gene in alphaproteobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2569610682,"Policy and Program evaluation for maternal, newborn and child health is becoming increasingly complex due to changing contexts. Monitoring and evaluation efforts in this area can take advantage of large nationally representative household surveys such as DHS or MICS that are increasing in size and frequency, however, this analysis presents challenges on several fronts. We propose an approach with hierarchical models for cross-sectional survey data to describe evidence relating to program evaluation, and apply this approach to the recent scale up of iCCM in Malawi. We describe careseeking for children sick with diarrhea, pneumonia, or malaria with empirical Bayes estimates for each district of Malawi at two time points, both for careseeking from any source, and for careseeking only from health surveillance assistants (HSA). We do not find evidence that children in areas with more HSA trained in iCCM are more likely to seek care for pneumonia, diarrhea, or malaria, despite evidence that many indeed are seeking care from HSA. Children in areas with more HSA trained in iCCM are more likely to seek care from a HSA, with 100 additional trained health workers in a district corresponding to a 2% average increase in careseeking from HSA. The hierarchical models presented here provide a flexible set of methods that describe the primary evidence for evaluating iCCM in Malawi and which could be extended to formal causal analyses, and to analysis for other similar evaluations with national survey data."
https://openalex.org/W2569678387,"Protein kinase B-β (PKBβ/Akt2) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that has emerged as one of the most important regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and division. Upregulation of Akt2 in various human carcinomas, including ovarian, breast, and pancreatic, is a well-known tumorigenesis phenomenon. Early on, the concept of the simultaneous administration of anticancer drugs with inhibitors of Akt2 was advocated to overcome cell proliferation in the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. However, clinical studies have not lived up to the high expectations, and several phase II and phase III clinical studies have been terminated prematurely because of severe side effects related to the non-selective isomeric inhibition of Akt2. The notion that the sequence identity of pleckstrin homology (PH) domains within Akt-isoforms is less than 30% might indicate the possibility of the development of selective antagonists against the Akt2 PH domain. Therefore, in this study, various in silico tools were utilized to explore the hypothesis that quinoline-type inhibitors bind in the Akt2 PH domain. A Grid-Independent Molecular Descriptor (GRIND) analysis indicated that two hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrogen bond donors and one hydrophobic feature at a certain distance from each other were important for the selective inhibition of Akt2. Our docking results delineated the importance of Lys30 as an anchor point for mapping the distances of important amino acid residues in the binding pocket, including Lys14, Glu17, Arg25, Asn53, Asn54 and Arg86. The binding regions identified complement the GRIND-based pharmacophoric features."
https://openalex.org/W2571203596,"Many studies have shown that the mycoplasmal membrane protein p37 enhances cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Previously, we generated 6 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the mycoplasmal protein p37 and showed the presence of mycoplasma-infected circulating tumor cells in the blood of hepatocellular carcinoma patients by using CA27, one of the six MAbs. When mycoplasmas were incubated with cancer cells in the presence of CA27, mycoplasma infection was completely inhibited, suggesting that CA27 is a neutralizing antibody inhibiting mycoplasma infection. To examine the neutralizing epitope of CA27, we generated a series of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused p37 deletion mutant proteins in which p37 was partly deleted. To express p37-coding sequences in E.coli, mycoplasmal TGA codons were substituted with TGG in the p37 deletion mutant genes. GST-fused p37 deletion mutant proteins were then screened to identify the epitope targeted by CA27. Western blots showed that CA27 bound to the residues 216-246 on the middle part of the p37 protein while it did not bind to the residues 183-219 and 216-240. Fine mapping showed that CA27 was able to bind to the residues 226-246, but its binding activity was relatively weakened as compared to that to the residues 216-246, suggesting that the residues 226-246 is essential for optimal binding activity of CA27. Interestingly, the treatment of the purified GST-tagged epitopes with urea showed that CA27 binding to the epitope was sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant but urea-sensitive. The same 226-246 residues were also recognized by two other anti-p37 MAbs, suggesting that the epitope is immunodominant. The identification of the novel neutralizing epitope may provide new insight into the interaction between the p37 protein and host receptors."
