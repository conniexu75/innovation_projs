https://openalex.org/W2064816004,"Data on the time- and space-dependence of trapped particles in three categories were obtained by detectors on the Explorer XV satellite. An unexpected secondary peak in the distribution of high-energy protons was found. The fluxes of high-energy protons slowly increased with time but apparently were not affected by geomagnetic events that caused perturbation of the electron fluxes on the same lines of force. About 1 or 2% of the electrons generated by the nuclear detonation of July 9, 1962 were found to be present in the geomagnetic field 125 days later. The electron fluxes in the region between L = 1.25 and 1.65 earth radii varied by less than 35% over the period from day 110 to day 206 after the detonation of 9 July. The spatial distributions of high- and low-energy electrons are quite different. Electrons in the region above L = 1.7 earth radii are strongly perturbed by magnetic disturbances. A new outer zone of both high- and low-energy electrons was formed by the magnetic storm which began December 18, 1962. (P.C.H.)"

 for the growth and multiplication of malarial parasites in vitro. By studying the parasites in vitro, the team believed that
 researchers could better address the many biochemical, biological, immunological, and chemotherapeutic aspects of this infectious
 disease."
https://openalex.org/W2053404792,"Ten new determinations on volcanic extrusions in the Sierra Nevada with potassium-argon ages of 3.1 million years or less indicate that the remanent magnetizations fall into two groups, a normal group in which the remanent magnetization is directed downward and to the north, and a reversed group magnetized up and to the south. Thermomagnetic experiments and mineralogic studies fail to provide an explanation of the opposing polarities in terms of mineralogic control, but rather suggest that the remanent magnetization reflects reversals of the main dipole field of the earth. All available radiometric ages are consistent with this field-reversal hypothesis and indicate that the present normal polarity epoch (N1) as well as the previous reversed epoch (R1) are 0.9 to 1.0 million years long, whereas the previous normal epoch (N2) was at least 25 percent longer."

https://openalex.org/W2012832912,"A soil fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus Fres., is effective in the degradation of the herbicide 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine). The degradation of both ring- and chain-labeled (C14) simazine was observed in an unamended and an amended (sucrose) basal medium. A loss of C14 occurred in all culture solutions containing either ring- or chain-labeled simazine, but the decrease in activity observed was greater with chain-labeled than with ring-labeled simazine. Chromatographic evidence indicates that A. fumigatus may possess a degradation mechanism unlike that which occurs in corn plants."

https://openalex.org/W1998872771,"The Holleford Crater, a circular depression in southern Ontario, is filled with Paleozoic sediments and underlain by brecciated Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. The presence of coesite in two core samples of this breccia has been established by petrographic and x-ray diflraction methods. Shattered quartz in the coesite-bearing samples exhibits planar fractures. The shocked quartz is the result of great shock pressures and the association of coesite with the shocked quartz strongly suggests that Holleford Crater originated from a hypervelocity impact."

https://openalex.org/W1968071877,"Reactive molecules and free radicals, when located in the cavities of the water clathrate lattice, can be prevented from recombining at temperatures almost up to the decomposition point of the lattice. The active species are produced by selective photochemical dissociation of the guest molecules in the clathrate compounds. Data taken from water clathrates of H2S, CH3SH, and C2H5SH suggest that S2, CH3S and C2H5S can be preserved in this way."

https://openalex.org/W2017318354,"Research is the backbone of the development of atomic energy. While the development of atomic energy also depends upon a host of technological improvements and upon the strength of industrial development and management, the guidance of research is a necessary requirement. Today, the research carried on under the atomic energy project ranges through physics, chemistry, metallurgy, the biological sciences, medicine, and most of the branches of engineering. The shortage of trained scientific and technical personnel, due at least in part to these greatly expanded activities, has prompted the Atomic Energy Commission to establish fellowship programs in the physical sciences and in biology and medicine and to set up technical training programs in radiation effects and the use of radio-active isotopes."
