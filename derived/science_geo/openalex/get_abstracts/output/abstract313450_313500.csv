https://openalex.org/W1965352627,Ethanol has been isolated from the tissues of several animal species in amounts ranging from 23 to 145 micromole/100 gm of tissue. Intestinal bacterial flora appear to be excluded as a source of this ethanol. Radioactivity from pyruvate-2-C(14) appeared in ethanol after incubation with liver slices; this finding indicates an endogenous synthesis.

The delta S(34) analyses of atmospheric SO(--)(4) vary from +3.2 to +15.6 per mil in contrast to +20.7 per mil for sea water SO(--)(4). Contrary to previous studies based on Cl(-)/SO(--)(4) ratios, sea spray SO(--)(4) is a minor source."

https://openalex.org/W2052206009,"An examination of 12 species of mosses has indicated that three produce substances capable of inhibiting the growth of various bacteria and other fungi. The method of extraction included several solvents. The extracts were not consistent in their antagonistic activity against the various species of microorganisms, nor were those that displayed antibiotic action always effective against the same organisms. Results indicate unstable products as well as physiological variation in the mosses."

These animals laid from two to four clutches of eggs, with 4 to 7 weeks between clutches. Clutches contained two to four eggs. Additional light is believed to be more important than heat in causing this response."

https://openalex.org/W2010338688,Individuals of two migratory races of white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) caged under an open sky showed a pronounced orientation in their night restlessness during normal periods of migration for the species. In August and September 1958 most birds showed a southerly orientation at night; daytime activity was random to somewhat northerly. In April and May 1959 most birds showed a strong northerly orientation at night; daytime activity was random to somewhat southerly (1).
https://openalex.org/W2035984967,"A multiple-flowered, jointless pedicel, single plant appeared in the tomato variety 146 in 1958. The gene governing the jointless pedicel character was found to be identical with the j2 gene found in a tomato strain from the Galapagos Islands. The character is considered to be a mutant and of potential value in the development of mechanically harvestable tomatoes."

https://openalex.org/W2049912905,"Trifolium repens at low elevations expressed wide genetic variation in tendency to flower. Clones classified as flowering or nonflowering were subjected to temperatures associated with high elevations. Flowering in ""nonflowering"" clones was induced under warm-day-cool-night treatments. It is proposed that in the tropics, low temperatures associated with high elevations are an important factor in determining flowering, and therefore ability to persist, in plants which are long-day and temperature sensitive."

https://openalex.org/W1982769048,"Two additional interpretations are given for the important data of D. B. Ericson on the correlation of coiling directions of Globigerina pachyderma in late Pleistocene North Atlantic sediments with ocean surface temperatures. One interpretation relates the distribution of this species to the distribution and circulation of ocean water masses. On the basis of our ice-age theory, our second interpretation uses the data and correlations of Ericson to establish temperature limits of a thermal node, a line on which glacial and interglacial temperatures were equal, for the North Atlantic Ocean. This line crosses the strait between Greenland and Scandinavia. Further, Ericson's interpretation of the 7.2 degrees C isotherm implies that the glacial-stage surface waters of the Arctic Ocean were between 0 degrees and 3.5 degrees C."
