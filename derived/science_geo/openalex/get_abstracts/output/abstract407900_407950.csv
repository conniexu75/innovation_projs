Priority-setting is especially important for geographically widespread species with distinct populations subject to multiple threats that operate on different spatial and temporal scales. Marine turtles are widely distributed and exhibit intra-specific variations in population sizes and trends, as well as reproduction and morphology. However, current global extinction risk assessment frameworks do not assess conservation status of spatially and biologically distinct marine turtle Regional Management Units (RMUs), and thus do not capture variations in population trends, impacts of threats, or necessary conservation actions across individual populations. To address this issue, we developed a new assessment framework that allowed us to evaluate, compare and organize marine turtle RMUs according to status and threats criteria. Because conservation priorities can vary widely (i.e. from avoiding imminent extinction to maintaining long-term monitoring efforts) we developed a “conservation priorities portfolio” system using categories of paired risk and threats scores for all RMUs (n = 58). We performed these assessments and rankings globally, by species, by ocean basin, and by recognized geopolitical bodies to identify patterns in risk, threats, and data gaps at different scales. This process resulted in characterization of risk and threats to all marine turtle RMUs, including identification of the world's 11 most endangered marine turtle RMUs based on highest risk and threats scores. This system also highlighted important gaps in available information that is crucial for accurate conservation assessments. Overall, this priority-setting framework can provide guidance for research and conservation priorities at multiple relevant scales, and should serve as a model for conservation status assessments and priority-setting for widespread, long-lived taxa."

Thus, we hypothesized that T(3) is a major stimulant of cardiomyocyte maturation in vivo. We studied 3 groups of sheep fetuses on gestational days 125-130 (term ∼145 d): a T(3)-infusion group, to mimic fetal term levels (plasma T(3) levels increased from ∼0.1 to ∼1.0 ng/ml; t(1/2)∼24 h); a thyroidectomized group, to produce low thyroid hormone levels; and a vehicle-infusion group, to serve as intact controls. At 130 d of gestation, sections of left ventricular freewall were harvested, and the remaining myocardium was enzymatically dissociated. Proteins involved in cell cycle regulation (p21, cyclin D1), proliferation (ERK), and hypertrophy (mTOR) were measured in left ventricular tissue. Evidence that elevated T(3) augmented the maturation rate of cardiomyocytes included 14% increased width, 31% increase in binucleation, 39% reduction in proliferation, 150% reduction in cyclin D1 protein, and 500% increase in p21 protein. Increased expression of phospho-mTOR, ANP, and SERCA2a also suggests that T(3) promotes maturation and hypertrophy of fetal cardiomyocytes. Thyroidectomized fetuses had reduced cell cycle activity and binucleation. These findings support the hypothesis that T(3) is a prime driver of prenatal cardiomyocyte maturation."

To address this problem, we devised a system that tracks neuron-sized fluorescent targets in real time. The system can be used to create virtual environments by optogenetic activation of sensory neurons, or to image activity in identified neurons at high magnification. By recording activity in neurons of freely moving C. elegans, we tested the long-standing hypothesis that forward and reverse locomotion are generated by distinct neuronal circuits. Surprisingly, we found motor neurons that are active during both types of locomotion, suggesting a new model of locomotion control in C. elegans. These results emphasize the importance of recording neuronal activity in freely moving animals and significantly expand the potential of imaging techniques by providing a mean to stabilize fluorescent targets."
https://openalex.org/W1970432663,"The p21-activated kinase PAK1 is implicated in tumorigenesis, and efforts to inhibit PAK1 signaling as a means to induce tumor cell apoptosis are underway. However, PAK1 has also been implicated as a positive effector of mechanisms in clonal pancreatic beta cells and skeletal myotubes that would be crucial to maintaining glucose homeostasis in vivo. Of relevance, human islets of Type 2 diabetic donors contained ~80% less PAK1 protein compared with non-diabetics, implicating PAK1 in islet signaling/scaffolding functions. Mimicking this, islets from PAK1(-/-) knock-out mice exhibited profound defects in the second/sustained-phase of insulin secretion. Reiteration of this specific defect by human islets treated with the PAK1 signaling inhibitor IPA3 revealed PAK1 signaling to be of primary functional importance. Analyses of human and mouse islet beta cell signaling revealed PAK1 activation to be 1) dependent upon Cdc42 abundance, 2) crucial for signaling downstream to activate ERK1/2, but 3) dispensable for cofilin phosphorylation. Importantly, the PAK1(-/-) knock-out mice were found to exhibit whole body glucose intolerance in vivo. Exacerbating this, the PAK1(-/-) knock-out mice also exhibited peripheral insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was coupled to ablation of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle from PAK1(-/-) knock-out mice, and in sharp contrast to islet beta cells, skeletal muscle PAK1 loss was underscored by defective cofilin phosphorylation but normal ERK1/2 activation. Taken together, these data provide the first human islet and mammalian in vivo data unveiling the key and crucial roles for differential PAK1 signaling in the multi-tissue regulation of whole body glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2153077072,"The well-sampled Late Cretaceous fossil record of North America remains the only high-resolution dataset for evaluating patterns of dinosaur diversity leading up to the terminal Cretaceous extinction event. Hadrosaurine hadrosaurids (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) closely related to Edmontosaurus are among the most common megaherbivores in latest Campanian and Maastrichtian deposits of western North America. However, interpretations of edmontosaur species richness and biostratigraphy have been in constant flux for almost three decades, although the clade is generally thought to have undergone a radiation in the late Maastrichtian. We address the issue of edmontosaur diversity for the first time using rigorous morphometric analyses of virtually all known complete edmontosaur skulls. Results suggest only two valid species, Edmontosaurus regalis from the late Campanian, and E. annectens from the late Maastrichtian, with previously named taxa, including the controversial Anatotitan copei, erected on hypothesized transitional morphologies associated with ontogenetic size increase and allometric growth. A revision of North American hadrosaurid taxa suggests a decrease in both hadrosaurid diversity and disparity from the early to late Maastrichtian, a pattern likely also present in ceratopsid dinosaurs. A decline in the disparity of dominant megaherbivores in the latest Maastrichtian interval supports the hypothesis that dinosaur diversity decreased immediately preceding the end Cretaceous extinction event."
https://openalex.org/W2121889285,"Background The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically worldwide. The obesity epidemic begs for novel concepts and therapeutic targets that cohesively address “food-abuse” disorders. We demonstrate a molecular link between impairment of a central kinase (Akt) involved in insulin signaling induced by exposure to a high-fat (HF) diet and dysregulation of higher order circuitry involved in feeding. Dopamine (DA) rich brain structures, such as striatum, provide motivation stimuli for feeding. In these central circuitries, DA dysfunction is posited to contribute to obesity pathogenesis. We identified a mechanistic link between metabolic dysregulation and the maladaptive behaviors that potentiate weight gain. Insulin, a hormone in the periphery, also acts centrally to regulate both homeostatic and reward-based HF feeding. It regulates DA homeostasis, in part, by controlling a key element in DA clearance, the DA transporter (DAT). Upon HF feeding, nigro-striatal neurons rapidly develop insulin signaling deficiencies, causing increased HF calorie intake. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that consumption of fat-rich food impairs striatal activation of the insulin-activated signaling kinase, Akt. HF-induced Akt impairment, in turn, reduces DAT cell surface expression and function, thereby decreasing DA homeostasis and amphetamine (AMPH)-induced DA efflux. In addition, HF-mediated dysregulation of Akt signaling impairs DA-related behaviors such as (AMPH)-induced locomotion and increased caloric intake. We restored nigro-striatal Akt phosphorylation using recombinant viral vector expression technology. We observed a rescue of DAT expression in HF fed rats, which was associated with a return of locomotor responses to AMPH and normalization of HF diet-induced hyperphagia. Conclusions/Significance Acquired disruption of brain insulin action may confer risk for and/or underlie “food-abuse” disorders and the recalcitrance of obesity. This molecular model, thus, explains how even short-term exposure to “the fast food lifestyle” creates a cycle of disordered eating that cements pathological changes in DA signaling leading to weight gain and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1561220511,"TNF-α potently stimulates basal lipolysis in adipocytes, which may contribute to hyperlipidemia and peripheral insulin resistance in obesity. Recent studies show that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) act sequentially in catalyzing the first two steps of adipose lipolysis in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Here, we sought to determine their functional roles in TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Silencing of ATGL expression in adipocytes almost completely abolished basal and TNF-α-induced glycerol release. In comparison, the glycerol release under the same conditions was only partially decreased upon reduction in expression of either HSL or the ATGL coactivator CGI-58. Interestingly, overexpression of ATGL restored the lipolytic rates in cells with silenced HSL or CGI-58, indicating a predominant role for ATGL. While expression of ATGL, HSL and CGI-58 remains mostly unaffected, TNF-α treatment caused a rapid abrogation of the ATGL inhibitory protein G0S2. TNF-α drastically decreased the level of G0S2 mRNA, and the level of G0S2 protein could be maintained by inhibiting proteasomal protein degradation using MG-132. Furthermore, coexpression of G0S2 was able to significantly decrease TNF-α-stimulated lipolysis mediated by overexpressed ATGL or CGI-58. We propose that the early reduction in G0S2 content is permissive for TNF-α-induced lipolysis.

IntroductionDuring extended starvation and exercise, catecholamines stimulate the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) 2The abbreviations used are: TAGtriacylglycerolMAGmonoacylglycerolATGLadipose triglyceride lipaseHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseLDlipid dropletFFAfree fatty acidDAGdiacylglycerolPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorAdadenovirus. stores within the lipid droplets (LDs) in adipocytes. The so-called lipolysis makes available surplus fuel in the form of free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol for use by other organs and tissues. During the instances of nutritional overload such as obesity, elevated basal adipose lipolysis contributes to the increase of systemic FFA levels, thereby exacerbating peripheral lipotoxicity and insulin resistance (1Unger R.H.

Considering the importance of TAG turnover at both physiological and pathological levels, it is not surprising that enzymes governing lipolysis have attracted immense research interest over the years. Among many intracellular lipases identified thus far that possess in vitro capacity to hydrolyze TAG, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) are the most characterized functionally (5Lass A.

Care. 2010; 13: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A body of evidence has emerged recently, suggesting that ATGL and HSL act sequentially in mediating adipocyte lipolysis in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (7Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G.

In this newly established model, ATGL initiates lipolysis by specifically removing the first FA from TAGs to produce DAG substrates, which are then hydrolyzed by HSL to generate an additional FA and MAG substrates. MAGs are converted into FA and glycerol by MAG lipase in the final step of lipolysis.HSL was discovered nearly half a century ago due to its induction during fasting and by catabolic hormones (13Vaughan M. Berger J.E. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 401-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rizack M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 392-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has broad substrate specificity toward acylglycerols, including TAG, DAG, and MAG, as well as cholesteryl, retinyl, and lipoidal esters. Data from numerous previous studies suggested a key role for HSL in hydrolysis of both TAG and DAG in adipocytes (15Yeaman S.J. Smith G.M. Jepson C.A. Wood S.L. Emmison N. Adv.

However, animals deficient in HSL showed no obese phenotype though their adipocytes had a markedly blunted glycerol release upon β-adrenergic simulation (8Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M.

That these mice displayed an accumulation of DAG instead of TAG in several tissues led to the conclusion that HSL mainly functions as a rate-limiting enzyme for DAG hydrolysis (8Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol.

In 2004, three laboratories independently identified ATGL as a lipase with selective affinity for TAG (7Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A.

Analysis using cultured cells and mutant mouse lines has demonstrated that ATGL plays a governing role in both basal and adrenergically stimulated TAG breakdown in adipocytes (5Lass A. Zimmermann R. Oberer M. Zechner R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Most notably, ATGL-null mice showed enhanced adiposity along with impaired adipocyte lipolysis under both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated conditions (23Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice overexpressing ATGL specifically in adipose tissue were leaner with decreased TAG content in adipocytes and were resistant to diet-induced obesity with improved insulin sensitivity (24Ahmadian M. Duncan R.E. Varady K.A. Frasson D. Hellerstein M.K. Birkenfeld A.L. Samuel V.T. Shulman G.I. Wang Y. Kang C. Sul H.S. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).At the cell biology level, enzyme action of both ATGL and HSL is decided by their subcellular localization. HSL is a well known substrate for PKA downstream of β-adrenergic stimulation. Phosphorylation of HSL together with the lipid droplet coat protein perilipin promotes translocation of HSL from the cytoplasm to the surface of the LDs (25Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K.

Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the responsible mechanisms are unclear because PKA does not appear to directly phosphorylate ATGL (7Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). A major advance in understanding ATGL-mediated lipolysis is the discovery that ATGL activity is highly dependent on association with a co-activator protein called CGI-58 (comparative gene identification-58; also known as ABHD5 (α/β hydrolase fold-containing protein 5)) (28Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Recent reports have attributed the activation of ATGL in adipocytes to the dissociation of CGI-58 from perilipin (29Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S.

In the non-stimulated state, CGI-58 is in complex with perilipin at the surface of LDs and therefore is separated from ATGL. Upon stimulation, perilipin is phosphorylated on Ser-492 or Ser-517 by PKA, thereby releasing CGI-58 to act on ATGL. An earlier study has also demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser-517 in perilipin is an essential step for ATGL activation (32Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Recently, our laboratory identified a protein encoded by G0S2 (G0/G1 switch gene 2) as a selective inhibitor of ATGL (27Yang X. Lu X. Lombès M. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I. Guerin T.M. Smart E.J. Liu J. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). G0S2 is a small basic protein with 78% identity between mouse and human orthologs. It binds directly to ATGL and is capable of inhibiting its lipase activity both in the absence and the presence of CGI-58. Ectopic expression of G0S2 prevented LD degradation in HeLa cells mediated by ATGL/CGI-58. In cultured adipocytes and fat explants, overexpression of G0S2 decreased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. Knockdown of endogenous G0S2, on the other hand, enhanced lipolysis in mature adipocytes (27Yang X. Lu X. Lombès M. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I. Guerin T.M. Smart E.J. Liu J. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 194-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Moreover, G0S2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue as well as liver and heart. The expression of G0S2 was shown to increase in response to insulin, glucose, and ligands for the PPAR family of transcription factors (27Yang X. Lu X. Lombès M. Rha G.B. Chi Y.I. Guerin T.M.

Therefore, G0S2 likely controls TAG turnover in adipocytes as well as in nonadipocyte cells, and alteration of its expression may be a way via which nutritional and hormonal factors regulate the lipid homeostasis.In obesity, a major factor implicated in the stimulation of adipose lipolysis is TNF-α (36Cawthorn W.P.

Mechanistically, activation of TNF receptor-1-dependent pathways is both necessary and sufficient for such lipolytic induction (44Sethi J.K. Xu H. Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Scheja L.

Decreased expression of perilipin (48Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 221-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is proposed to promote lipolysis through augmentation of action of the lipases. In this respect, prevention of protein depletion using adenoviral-mediated expression of either perilipin or FSP27 was shown to protect against TNF-α-induced lipolysis. Other evidence has also suggested that the extracellular glucose is required for the lipolytic action of TNF-α (43Green A. Rumberger J.M. Stuart C.A. Ruhoff M.S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Although it becomes increasingly clear that multiple factors are involved in TNF-α-induced lipolysis, very few reports have directly addressed the contribution of relevant lipases and their regulators. In the present study, we examined the functional involvement of ATGL, HSL, CGI-58, and G0S2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with TNF-α. The differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been used extensively as the model system for investigation of hormone-stimulated lipolysis. We analyzed the expression pattern of aforementioned proteins, and performed both loss- and gain-of-function experiments via siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and adenovirus-mediated protein overexpression. Our results provide novel information on the molecular mechanisms by which TNF-α enhances lipolysis in adipocytes.DISCUSSIONTNF-α has long been recognized for its major roles in obesity by modulating fat deposition, energy homeostasis, and especially insulin resistance (36Cawthorn W.P. Sethi J.K. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 37Chen X. Xun K. Chen L. Wang Y. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2009; 27: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 52Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Of interest, TNF-α acts to increase the basal lipolytic rate in adipocytes, which contributes to the elevation of plasma FFA levels associated with lipotoxicity in peripheral tissues. The prevalence of lipotoxicity as a pathogenic mechanism in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has sharpened the research focus on lipolysis for the past decade. Regardless of the type of external stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways involved, lipolysis ultimately is dependent on the action of acylglycerol lipases and their regulators. ATGL and HSL are the two major lipases in adipocytes responsible for mediating adrenergically stimulated FFA and glycerol release (5Lass A. Zimmermann R. Oberer M. Zechner R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 6Kolditz C.I. Langin D. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2010; 13: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to gain new insights into their respective roles in adipocyte lipolysis induced by TNF-α. Although a previous report indicates that TNF-α down-regulates ATGL and HSL mRNA (53Kralisch S. Klein J. Lossner U. Bluher M. Paschke R. Stumvoll M. Fasshauer M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 240: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we find that TNF-α does not alter their protein levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Parallel observations were obtained from primary rat adipocytes treated with TNF-α (39Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 54Zu L. Jiang H. He J. Xu C. Pu S. Liu M. Xu G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we demonstrate that HSL and ATGL are both required for the lipolytic response to TNF-α. Our data show that the maximum stimulatory effect of TNF-α also depends on the ATGL coactivator CGI-58. Although CGI-58 expression remains mostly unaffected, TNF-α treatment causes a rapid abrogation of ATGL inhibitory protein G0S2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that early reduction in G0S2 content serves as a facilitative mechanism for TNF-α-induced lipolysis.The elevation of adipocyte lipolysis in response to TNF-α occurs in a progressive manner. Prolonged TNF-α exposure (>24 h) is known to suppress the expression of numerous proteins that prevent basal lipolysis. For example, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNF-α for 24–48 h have been shown previously to down-regulate expression of phosphordiesterase 3B (55Rahn Landström T. Mei J. Karlsson M. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the inhibitory Gi protein (22Gasic S. Tian B. Green A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6770-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The decrease in phosphordiesterase 3B and Gi expression correlates with activation of PKA and stimulation of lipolysis, presumably reflecting an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration. In addition, it has been proposed that lipolysis mediated by the chronic TNF-α treatment is also dependent on the down-regulation of perilipin (48Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Prevention of perilipin depletion via adenovirus-mediated overexpression was shown to be sufficient to protect TNF-α-induced lipolysis (48Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, by comparing the chronology of protein expression with glycerol release, we and others (54Zu L. Jiang H. He J. Xu C. Pu S. Liu M. Xu G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) find that during the early stage of treatment, TNF-α is able to induce a significant increase of lipolysis without affecting the protein level of perilipin in adipocytes. We observe that the basal lipolytic rate starts to go up as early as 4–6 h after TNF-α treatment and the increase precedes the decrease in perilipin content. For the purpose of avoiding the confounding effects resulted from decreased expression of perilipin and other proteins, we choose in this study to assess the function of ATGL and HSL during the early stage of TNF-α treatment.ATGL and HSL are both known to possess the in vitro capacity to cleave the first FA bond of a TAG molecule. Our gene silencing experiments demonstrate that ATGL and HSL together account for the majority of the hydrolytic activity toward TAG in adipocyte extracts when assayed in vitro against a triolein substrate. This is in accordance with a previous measurement of TAG hydrolase activity in white adipose tissue extracts of ATGL-null and HSL-null mice (11Schweiger M. Schreiber R. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Fledelius C. Jacobsen P. Tornqvist H. Zechner R. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40236-40241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). More importantly, we find that both enzymes contribute to the TAG breakdown induced by TNF-α because adipocytes with reduced levels of either ATGL or HSL exhibit decreased lipolytic rates in response to the drug. Cells with silenced expression of ATGL show a more profound reduction in glycerol release than those with silenced expression of HSL, indicating that ATGL plays a more prominent role in initiating TAG hydrolysis. Consistently, overexpression of HSL only partially restores lipolysis in the absence of ATGL, whereas overexpression of AGTL is more than sufficient to compensate for the loss of HSL during basal and TNF-α-induced lipolysis.Studies on the regulation of adrenergically stimulated lipolysis suggest that ATGL and HSL act sequentially in the first two steps of TAG breakdown (7Zimmermann R.

Chem. 2009; 284: 18282-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Specifically, ATGL is believed to be rate-limiting in converting TAG to DAG with the release of one FA during the first step of lipolysis. HSL, on the other hand, functions mainly in the hydrolysis of DAG to MAG and another FA. However, we find that overexpression of ATGL was fully capable of restoring glycerol release from cells with silenced expression of HSL. Considering that the glycerol release is strictly dependent on the completion of the hydrolytic process (i.e. TAG → DAG → MAG → glycerol), our results strongly suggest that ATGL may function in vivo to hydrolyze both TAG and DAG in the absence of HSL. With both enzymes expressed at endogenous levels, however, it remains highly likely that HSL is the major DAG lipase, whereas ATGL favors TAG substrates. Aside from being a TAG hydrolase, ATGL is known to possess activity as an acyl-CoA-independent transacylase, utilizing MAGs or DAGs as acyl donors/acceptors in the production of TAGs (21Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that ATGL at high levels promotes glycerol production as a result of acyl donation from MAGs to DAGs.The discovery of ATGL is relatively more recent. How the enzyme action of ATGL is regulated was largely unclear until the identification of CGI-58 as a coactivator (28Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweig"
https://openalex.org/W2007266898,"ERBB-2 overexpression is associated with the development and progression of cancer and mediates its resistance to therapy. It has been suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms control the overexpression of ERBB-2 in prostate cancer (PCa). We recently demonstrated that the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of ERBB-2 mRNA contains two specific target sites for binding of the microRNA miR-331-3p and that miR-331-3p represses ERBB-2 expression and signaling in PCa cells. Here we investigate a U-rich element situated in close proximity to the distal miR-331-3p target site in the ERBB-2 3′-UTR. Specific binding of HuR to this U-rich element promotes ERBB-2 expression in PCa cells. We show that HuR antagonizes the repressive action of miR-331-3p on its distal ERBB-2 3′-UTR target site. These results support a model in which the interplay between RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs controls the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and suggest that both HuR and miR-331-3p participate in the overexpression of ERBB-2 observed in some PCas.

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Canberra2010Google Scholar). Although anti-androgen therapy is generally effective in the initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic PCa, the disease ultimately transforms into a hormone-independent state that is associated with treatment resistance and a poor prognosis (2Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). A variety of agents have been tested for the treatment of hormone-independent PCa, but results to date have been disappointing, with only docetaxel-based chemotherapy being shown to improve the survival of this group of patients (3Stavridi F. Karapanagiotou E.M. Syrigos K.N. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2010; 36: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Yap T.A. Zivi A. Omlin A. de Bono J.S. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 8: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Consequently, there has been intense research toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that promote the development and progression of hormone-independent PCa and that mediate its aggressive behavior and treatment resistance. A recent meta-analysis of 5,976 PCa patients found a significant positive association between overexpression of the ERBB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as HER2/neu) and the risk of disease recurrence and death (5Neto A.S. Tobias-Machado M. Wroclawski M.L. Fonseca F.L. Teixeira G.K. Amarante R.D. Wroclawski E.R. Del Giglio A. J. Urol. 2010; 184: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a prognostic indicator in PCa, ERBB-2 inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials for this disease, albeit with disappointing results. Very limited anti-tumor activity was observed in a phase II trial of trastuzumab involving 18 patients with advanced hormone-independent PCa (6Ziada A. Barqawi A. Glode L.M. Varella-Garcia M. Crighton F. Majeski S. Rosenblum M. Kane M. Chen L. Crawford E.D. Prostate. 2004; 60: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas a phase II trial of the dual ERBB-1/ERBB-2 inhibitor lapatinib in patients with advanced, hormone naive PCa did not produce disease regression (7Sridhar S.S. Hotte S.J. Chin J.L. Hudes G.R. Gregg R. Trachtenberg J. Wang L. Tran-Thanh D. Pham N.A. Tsao M.S. Hedley D. Dancey J.E. Moore M.J. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 33: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms underlying the lack of response to ERBB-2 inhibitors in PCa are unclear; however, a majority of patients had tumors that did not express detectable levels of ERBB-2 protein. Nevertheless, it is possible that combining ERBB-2 inhibitors and cytotoxic agents might produce a better therapeutic effect. In support of this, trastuzumab potentiates the anti-tumor activity of docetaxel in a human PCa xenograft model (8Legrier M.E. Oudard S. Judde J.G. Guyader C. de Pinieux G. Boyé K. de Cremoux P. Dutrillaux B. Poupon M.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas a phase I trial of docetaxel, estramustine, and trastuzumab in metastatic androgen-independent PCa produced objective responses in a subset of patients (9Small E.J. Bok R. Reese D.M. Sudilovsky D. Frohlich M. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, strongly synergistic growth-inhibitory effects have been reported when inhibitors of the Hedgehog and ERBB-2 signaling pathways were used together in androgen-independent PCa cells (10Shaw G. Prowse D.M. Cancer Cell Int. 2008; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together, these results highlight the importance of selecting patients with measurable tumor ERBB-2 expression for ERBB-2 inhibitor treatment and the need to more effectively inhibit downstream signaling pathways in those patients with low or undetectable tumor ERBB-2 expression. prostate cancer microRNA quantitative RT-PCR U-rich element RNA-binding protein precursor miRNA androgen receptor AR element negative control miRNA non-targeting siRNA HuR siRNA RNA-induced silencing complex confidence interval RNA-protein complex LNCaP-FGC multiple cloning site luciferase 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol RNA electromobility shift assay heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. ERBB-2 and activation of its downstream oncogenic signaling networks (e.g. PI3K/Akt pathway) is thought to promote persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling in hormone-independent PCa (11Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). An understanding of the regulation of ERBB-2 expression in PCa might therefore enable the development of new strategies to effectively block ERBB-2 expression and downstream signaling, including cross-talk between ERBB-2 signaling and the AR signaling pathway. A recent study of more than 2,000 PCas found low level ERBB-2 overexpression in ∼20% of samples (12Minner S. Jessen B. Stiedenroth L. Burandt E. Köllermann J. Mirlacher M. Erbersdobler A.

Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although no significant difference in ERBB-2 expression was observed between hormone-dependent and hormone-independent tumors. Nevertheless, ERBB-2 gene amplification is extremely rare in PCa (12Minner S. Jessen B. Stiedenroth L. Burandt E. Köllermann J. Mirlacher M. Erbersdobler A. Eichelberg C. Fisch M. Brümmendorf T.H.

Recently, we demonstrated that microRNA-331-3p (miR-331-3p) down-regulates ERBB-2 expression in PCa cells (14Epis M.R. Giles K.M. Barker A. Kendrick T.S. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24696-24704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of short, endogenous, non-coding RNAs that bind with imperfect complementarity to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of specific target mRNAs, resulting in degradation or translational repression (15Bartel D.P.

Our work demonstrated that expression of miR-331-3p is decreased in PCa cells relative to matched normal adjacent prostate tissue and that miR-331-3p regulates ERBB-2 expression via direct binding to two miR-331-3p target sites within the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR (14Epis M.R.

As a result, miR-331-3p can also inhibit the AR signaling pathway in PCa cells, presumably at least in part via cross-talk between the PI3k/Akt pathway downstream of ERBB-2 and the AR pathway. Other studies have since confirmed the down-regulation of miR-331-3p in PCa (22Wang L. Tang H. Thayanithy V. Subramanian S. Oberg A.L. Cunningham J.M. Cerhan J.R. Steer C.J. Thibodeau S.N.

PLoS One. 2010; 5e15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence to support its role as a tumor suppressor miRNA in this system. In this study, we investigated the potential interplay between miR-331-3p and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that simultaneously target the ERBB-2 3′-UTR. We hypothesized that a U-rich element (URE) adjacent to a miR-331-3p target site within the ERBB-2 3′-UTR might represent a target for binding of the RBP HuR and that this binding might alter the activity of miR-331-3p upon its target site and hence modulate the expression of ERBB-2 mRNA in PCa cells. HuR is a member of the Hu family of RBPs that has diverse biological functions, including cell development, growth and proliferation, and stress responses (29Hinman M.N. Lou H. Cell Mol.

Trotta C.R. Peltz S.W. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 939-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and modulation of HuR expression alters the expression of ERBB-2 (39Scott G.K. Marx C. Berger C.E. Saunders L.R. Verdin E. Schäfer S. Jung M. Benz C.C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the importance of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the control of ERBB-2 expression in PCa is known, the role of HuR in this system has not been determined. Furthermore, it is unclear whether HuR is able to modulate action of miR-331-3p upon the ERBB-2 mRNA. Here, we present evidence showing that the ERBB-2 3′-UTR URE is a specific target for binding of HuR in PCa cells and demonstrate that HuR promotes ERBB-2 expression by antagonizing the repressive action of miR-331-3p upon its distal ERBB-2 3′-UTR target site. Our findings support a model of post-transcriptional control of gene expression involving the combined action of RBPs and miRNAs and suggest that both HuR and miR-331-3p participate in the development and progression of PCa by regulating ERBB-2 expression in prostate tumors. LNCaP-FGC (LNCaP) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Synthetic siRNA molecules corresponding to human HuR (ELAV-1 Silencer® Select siRNA, catalog nos. S4608, S4609, and S4610) and Negative Control (negative control 1 Silencer® Select siRNA) were sourced (Ambion). In addition, an established HuR siRNA (si-HuR-Sully) (40Sully G. Dean J.L. Wait R. Rawlinson L. Santalucia T. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 629-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained (Dharmacon). Synthetic miRNA precursor molecules corresponding to human miR-331-3p (pre-miR miRNA precursor product ID: PM10881) and a negative control miRNA (pre-miR miRNA precursor negative control 1 (miR-NC); catalog no. AM17110) were also sourced from Ambion. The dual luciferase reporter miRNA target clone for the ERBB-2 3′-UTR (HmiT004969) was sourced from Genecopoeia (Rockville, MD) and contained the full-length ERBB-2 3′-UTR inserted downstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene as well as a Renilla luciferase gene for data normalization. pmiR-REPORT luciferase vectors were constructed by ligating synthetic DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences within the ERBB-2 3′-UTR (wild type and mutant) into pmiR-REPORT (Ambion) using SpeI/HindIII restriction sites. Oligonucleotide sequences from the ERBB-2 3′-UTR are indicated in Table 1. The pGL3-ERBB-2 URE vector was constructed by cloning the ERBB-2 3′-UTR URE sequence using SpeI/ApaI restriction sites into a pGL3-control vector (Promega) that contained a multiple cloning site (MCS) downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-MCS) (41Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pGL3-ERBB-2 URE deletion mutant vector was constructed by amplifying fragments on either side of the ERBB-2 3′-UTR URE with MseI restriction sites added. Amplified MseI fragments were digested with MseI and fused in the sense orientation to form an ERBB-2 3′-UTR deletion mutant, which was inserted (SpeI/ApaI) into the pGL3-MCS control vector. The empty pGL3-MCS vector was used as a negative control in IP-RT-PCR experiments (see “Immunoprecipitation (IP)-RT-PCR” and “Plasmid DNA, siRNA, and miRNA Precursor Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays”). For riboprobe synthesis, the ERBB-2 3′-UTR URE element was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) using BamHI/HindIII restriction sites. The sequences of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1RNA sequences of probes used Open table in a new tab IP-RT-PCR assays were performed as described previously (15Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28615) Google Scholar) using extracts prepared from LNCaP cells. Antibodies used were against HuR (3A2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), catalog no. sc-5261), anti-mouse IgG (NA931V; GE Healthcare), or hnRNP E1 as an unrelated antibody control (T18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., catalog no. sc-16504). PCR primers for ERBB-2 or LUC were as described above. Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Promega) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA. For IP-RT-PCR analysis of ERBB-2 or luciferase (LUC) mRNA expression, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers and Thermoscript (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR for ERBB-2 or luciferase RNA was performed using a PTC-100 programmable thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.) with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers ERBB-2180-F (5′-GCT CCT CCT CGC CCT CTT GC-3′), ERBB-2670-R (5′-GCC AGC TGG TTG TTC TTG TG-3′), LUC-F (5′-TAC TGG GAC GAA GAC GAA CAC-3′), and LUC-R (5′-GTT CAC CGG CGT CAT CGT CG-3′). Expression of HuR mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR analysis of HuR and six reference genes (GAPDH, β-actin, K-alpha-1, ALAS-1, HPRT-1, and 18S rRNA (42Huggett J. Dheda K. Bustin S. Zumla A.

For qRT-PCR analysis of reference and target genes, 125 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers, oligo(dT) primers, and Quantiscript (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR for reference and target genes was performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time rotary analyzer (Corbett Life Science) using the Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Expression of HuR mRNA was normalized to GAPDH and β-actin mRNA expression, and relative HuR mRNA expression was determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method (44Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were transfected with siRNA to HuR (ELAV-1 Silencer® Select siRNA catalog no. S4608; ELAV-1 Silencer® Select siRNA catalog no. S4610 or si-HuR-Sully) or negative control (negative control 1 Silencer® Select siRNA) at a final concentration of 5 nm, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Initial experiments confirmed that si-HuR-Sully was effective to silence HuR expression in LNCaP cells. ELAV-1 Silencer® Select siRNAs S4608 and s4610 were also confirmed as the most effective HuR siRNAs from a set of three ELAV-1 siRNAs (catalog nos. S4608, S4609, and S4610) in optimization experiments (data not shown). miRNA transfection experiments were performed as described (45Giles K.M. Barker A. Zhang P.M. Epis M.R. Leedman P.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 676: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with miR-331-3p or miR-NC precursor at 2 nm (reporter gene assays, 24 h) or 30 nm (target validation, 3 days), respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For reporter gene assays, 3 days after miRNA or siRNA transfection, LNCaP cells were retransfected using 100 ng of pmiR-REPORT vectors and a 5-ng Renilla luciferase vector. Lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities 24 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Fluostar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as described (41Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C.

Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk/TBST and probed with anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10,000; Abcam catalog no. ab6276-100), anti-tubulin rat polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Abcam catalog no. ab6161-100), anti-HuR (3A-2) (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-5261), anti-ERBB-2 (CB-11) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Abcam catalog no. ab8054-1), or anti-AR (H-280) rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-13062). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse-IgG (NA931V; GE Healthcare), anti-rabbit-IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare), or anti-rat-IgG (ab6734–1; Abcam) antibodies were used at 1:10,000 prior to detection with ECL Plus detection reagent and ECL-Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). Protein bands of interest were quantitated by obtaining pixel densities of each band and correcting with a background pixel density using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Overexpression and purification of GST-HuR was performed as described previously (41Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol.

DNA analogues used to probe miR-331-3p interactions with the ERBB-2 URE were as follows: 331-3p DNA (5′-GCC CCT GGG CCT ATC CTA GAA-3′) and URE-Comp DNA (a perfectly complementary DNA to the ERBB-2 miR-331b site; 5′-CCC CCT GGG TCT TTA TTT CAT-3′). A 10-fold excess of DNA was mixed with probe RNA in water, heated to 75 °C for 5 min prior to dilution to 2× final concentration in 2× binding buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to the addition to binding reactions. RNase H digestions (0.01 unit of RNase H from Invitrogen/reaction) were performed in a manner comparable with other RNase digestions.4 The statistical significance of differences in luciferase expression data were evaluated using paired (one-tailed or two-tailed, as indicated) Student's t test. Synergy in combined reporter mutations was assessed according to the method of Bliss (48Bliss C. Ann. Appl. Biol. 1939; 26: 585-615Crossref Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), where synergy occurs when EBliss < EObserved. Statistical analysis of qRT-PCR data was performed using GENEX software (MultiD). All analyses were performed at a minimum confidence interval of 95% (CI = 0.95) and normality of data were confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Previously, we demonstrated that the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR contains two specific target sites for direct binding of miR-331-3p (14Epis M.R. Giles K.M. Barker A. Kendrick T.S. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24696-24704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the ERBB-2 3′-UTR sequence identified a URE (nucleotides 4467–4511 of GenBankTM accession number NM_004448) immediately adjacent to the distal miR-331-3p target site (331b; Fig. 1A), raising the possibility that this U-rich sequence was a target for specific binding of HuR, an AU- and U-rich RBP implicated in regulating expression of oncogenic mRNAs (49Barreau C.

Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 1250-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction, we performed IP-RT-PCR assays using LNCaP cells (Fig. 1B). These demonstrated co-immunopurification of ERBB-2 mRNA with HuR (Fig. 1B, lane 4), providing evidence for an in vivo interaction between HuR and ERBB-2 mRNA in PCa cells. To determine whether the ERBB-2 3′-UTR URE was a specific target for HuR binding, we transfected LNCaP cells with pGL3-control or pGL3-ERBB-2-URE luciferase reporter constructs, immunoprecipitated cell lysates with HuR or unrelated antibody (mouse IgG or hnRNP E1), and used RT-PCR to detect exogenous luciferase mRNA. Marked enrichment of luciferase mRNA was observed from HuR immunoprecipitates of LNCaP cells transfected with pGL3-ERBB-2-URE (Fig. 1C, lane 11) but not with pGL3-control-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 7–9) or with unrelated antibodies (Fig. 1C, lanes 10 and 12). This suggested that HuR was directly associated with the ERBB-2 URE element in PCa cells. To confirm this finding, we performed REMSA experiments with recombinant GST-HuR and 32P-labeled riboprobes (Fig. 1D). RNA-protein complexes (RPCs) formed when GST-HuR was incubated with 32P-pBlue-ERBB-2-URE (lane 8) but not with 32P-pBlue (lane 3). GST did not bind to either riboprobe (lanes 2 and 7), validating the specificity of the GST-HuR/32P-pBlue-ERBB-2-URE interaction. Furthermore, an anti-HuR antibody shifted the GST-HuR/32P-pBlue-ERBB-2-URE RPCs, wh"

Two separate analyses identified the same seven positively selected sites in ND5. A strong signal was also detected at three sites of ND2. An energetic coupling analysis revealed several structures in the ND5 protein that may have co-evolved with the selected sites. These data implicate Complex I, specifically the piston arm of ND5 where it connects the proton pumps, as important in the evolution of Pacific salmon. Lastly, the lineage to Chinook experienced rapid evolution at the piston arm."
https://openalex.org/W2142407602,"Objectives Successful control of the HIV/AIDS pandemic requires reduction of HIV-1 transmission at sexually-exposed mucosae. No prevention studies of the higher-risk rectal compartment exist. We report the first-in-field Phase 1 trial of a rectally-applied, vaginally-formulated microbicide gel with the RT-inhibitor UC781 measuring clinical and mucosal safety, acceptability and plasma drug levels. A first-in-Phase 1 assessment of preliminary pharmacodynamics was included by measuring changes in ex vivo HIV-1 suppression in rectal biopsy tissue after exposure to product in vivo. Methods HIV-1 seronegative, sexually-abstinent men and women (N = 36) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing UC781 gel at two concentrations (0.1%, 0.25%) with placebo gel (1∶1∶1). Baseline, single-dose exposure and a separate, 7-day at-home dosing were assessed. Safety and acceptability were primary endpoints. Changes in colorectal mucosal markers and UC781 plasma drug levels were secondary endpoints; ex vivo biopsy infectibility was an ancillary endpoint. Results All 36 subjects enrolled completed the 7–14 week trial (100% retention) including 3 flexible sigmoidoscopies, each with 28 biopsies (14 at 10 cm; 14 at 30 cm). There were 81 Grade 1 adverse events (AEs) and 8 Grade 2; no Grade 3, 4 or procedure-related AEs were reported. Acceptability was high, including likelihood of future use. No changes in mucosal immunoinflammatory markers were identified. Plasma levels of UC781 were not detected. Ex vivo infection of biopsies using two titers of HIV-1BaL showed marked suppression of p24 in tissues exposed in vivo to 0.25% UC781; strong trends of suppression were seen with the lower 0.1% UC781 concentration. Conclusions Single and 7-day topical rectal exposure to both concentrations of UC781 were safe with no significant AEs, high acceptability, no detected plasma drug levels and no significant mucosal changes. Ex vivo biopsy infections demonstrated marked suppression of HIV infectibility, identifying a potential early biomarker of efficacy. (Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; #NCT00408538)"
https://openalex.org/W2052338745,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a multifunctional ecto-type phosphodiesterase that converts lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine, to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by its lysophospholipase D activity. LPA is a lipid mediator with diverse biological functions, most of which are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors specific to LPA (LPA1-6). Recent studies on ATX knock-out mice revealed that ATX has an essential role in embryonic blood vessel formation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be solved. A data base search revealed that ATX and LPA receptors are conserved in wide range of vertebrates from fishes to mammals. Here we analyzed zebrafish ATX (zATX) and LPA receptors both biochemically and functionally. zATX, like mammalian ATX, showed lysophospholipase D activity to produce LPA. In addition, all zebrafish LPA receptors except for LPA5a and LPA5b were found to respond to LPA. Knockdown of zATX in zebrafish embryos by injecting morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) specific to zATX caused abnormal blood vessel formation, which has not been observed in other morphant embryos or mutants with vascular defects reported previously. In ATX morphant embryos, the segmental arteries sprouted normally from the dorsal aorta but stalled in midcourse, resulting in aberrant vascular connection around the horizontal myoseptum. Similar vascular defects were not observed in embryos in which each single LPA receptor was attenuated by using MOs. Interestingly, similar vascular defects were observed when both LPA1 and LPA4 functions were attenuated by using MOs and/or a selective LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425. These results demonstrate that the ATX-LPA-LPAR axis is a critical regulator of embryonic vascular development that is conserved in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2078497867,"Embryonic stem (ES) cells are distinguished by their ability to undergo unlimited self-renewal although retaining pluripotency, the capacity to specify cells of all germ layers. Alternative splicing contributes to these biological processes by vastly increasing the protein coding repertoire, enabling genes to code for novel variants that may confer different biological functions. The homeodomain transcription factor Nanog acts collaboratively with core factors Oct4 and Sox2 to govern the maintenance of pluripotency. We have discovered that Nanog is regulated by alternative splicing. Two novel exons and six subexons have been identified that extend the known Nanog gene structure and protein coding capacity. Alternative splicing results in two novel Nanog protein variants with attenuated capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells. Our previous results have implicated the C-terminal domain, including the tryptophan-rich (WR) domain of Nanog, to be important for the function of Nanog (Wang, J., Levasseur, D. N., and Orkin, S. H. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 6326-6331). Using point mutation analyses, serine 2 (Ser-2) of Nanog has been identified as critical for ES cell self-renewal and for stabilizing a pluripotent gene signature. An inducible conditional knock-out was created to test the ability of new Nanog variants to genetically complement Nanog null ES cells. These results reveal for the first time an expanded Nanog protein coding capacity. We further reveal that a short region of the N-terminal domain and a single phosphorylatable Ser-2 is essential for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency, demonstrating that this region of the protein is highly regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1998735841,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a family C G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by elevated levels of extracellular divalent cations. The CaSR couples to members of the G(q) family of G proteins, and in the endocrine system this receptor is instrumental in regulating the release of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid gland and calcitonin from thyroid cells. Here, we demonstrate that in medullary thyroid carcinoma cells, the CaSR promotes cellular adhesion and migration via coupling to members of the integrin family of extracellular matrix-binding proteins. Immunopurification and mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization studies showed that the CaSR and β1-containing integrins are components of a macromolecular protein complex. In fibronectin-based cell adhesion and migration assays, the CaSR-positive allosteric modulator NPS R-568 induced a concentration-dependent increase in cell adhesion and migration; both of these effects were blocked by a specific CaSR-negative allosteric modulator. These effects were mediated by integrins because they were blocked by a peptide inhibitor of integrin binding to fibronectin and β1 knockdown experiments. An analysis of intracellular signaling pathways revealed a key role for CaSR-induced phospholipase C activation and the release of intracellular calcium. These results demonstrate for the first time that an ion-sensing G protein-coupled receptor functionally couples to the integrins and, in conjunction with intracellular calcium release, promotes cellular adhesion and migration in tumor cells. The significance of this interaction is further highlighted by studies implicating the CaSR in cancer metastasis, axonal growth, and stem cell attachment, functions that rely on integrin-mediated cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2091624445,"Skeletal muscles express estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ. However, the roles of estrogens acting through the ERs in skeletal muscles remain unclear. The effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on myogenesis were studied in C2C12 myoblasts. E2 and an ERα-selective agonist propylpyrazole-triol depressed myosin heavy chain (MHC), tropomyosin, and myogenin levels and repressed the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. ER antagonist ICI 182,780 cancelled E2-repressed myogenesis. E2 induced ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19 (USP19) expression during myogenesis. E2 replacement increased USP19 expression in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of ovariectomized mice. Knockdown of USP19 inhibited E2-repressed myogenesis. Mutant forms of USP19 lacking deubiquitinating activity increased MHC and tropomyosin levels. E2 decreased ubiquitinated proteins during myogenesis, and the E2-decreased ubiquitinated proteins were increased by knockdown of USP19. Propylpyrazole-triol increased USP19 expression, and ICI 182,780 inhibited E2-increased USP19 expression. Overexpression of ERα or knockdown of ERβ enhanced the effects of E2 on the levels of USP19, MHC, and tropomyosin, whereas knockdown of ERα, overexpression of ERβ, or an ERβ-selective agonist diarylpropionitrile abolished their effects. A mutant form of ERα that is constitutively localized in the nucleus increased USP19 expression and decreased MHC and tropomyosin expression in the presence of E2. Furthermore, in skeletal muscle satellite cells, E2 inhibited myogenesis and increased USP19 expression, and diarylpropionitrile repressed E2-increased USP19 expression. These results demonstrate that (i) E2 induces USP19 expression through nuclear ERα, (ii) increased USP19-mediated deubiquitinating activity represses myogenesis, and (iii) ERβ inhibits ERα-activated USP19 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2074289720,"Background The animal efficacy rule addressing development of drugs for selected disease categories has pointed out the need to develop alternative large animal models. Based on this rule, the pathophysiology of the disease in the animal model must be well characterized and must reflect that in humans. So far, manifestations of the acute radiation syndrome (ARS) have been extensively studied only in two large animal models, the non-human primate (NHP) and the canine. We are evaluating the suitability of the minipig as an additional large animal model for development of radiation countermeasures. We have previously shown that the Gottingen minipig manifests hematopoietic ARS phases and symptoms similar to those observed in canines, NHPs, and humans. Principal Findings We establish here the LD50/30 dose (radiation dose at which 50% of the animals succumb within 30 days), and show that at this dose the time of nadir and the duration of cytopenia resemble those observed for NHP and canines, and mimic closely the kinetics of blood cell depletion and recovery in human patients with reversible hematopoietic damage (H3 category, METREPOL approach). No signs of GI damage in terms of diarrhea or shortening of villi were observed at doses up to 1.9 Gy. Platelet counts at days 10 and 14, number of days to reach critical platelet values, duration of thrombocytopenia, neutrophil stress response at 3 hours and count at 14 days, and CRP-to-platelet ratio were correlated with survival. The ratios between neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets were significantly correlated with exposure to irradiation at different time intervals. Significance As a non-rodent animal model, the minipig offers a useful alternative to NHP and canines, with attractive features including ARS resembling human ARS, cost, and regulatory acceptability. Use of the minipig may allow accelerated development of radiation countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2000546875,"The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters (GATs) are located in the plasma membrane of neurons and astrocytes and are responsible for termination of GABAergic transmission. It has previously been shown that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates GAT-1-mediated GABA transport in nerve terminals and neuronal cultures. We now report that BDNF enhances GAT-1-mediated GABA transport in cultured astrocytes, an effect mostly due to an increase in the Vmax kinetic constant. This action involves the truncated form of the TrkB receptor (TrkB-t) coupled to a non-classic PLC-γ/PKC-δ and ERK/MAPK pathway and requires active adenosine A2A receptors. Transport through GAT-3 is not affected by BDNF. To elucidate if BDNF affects trafficking of GAT-1 in astrocytes, we generated and infected astrocytes with a functional mutant of the rat GAT-1 (rGAT-1) in which the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was incorporated into the second extracellular loop. An increase in plasma membrane of HA-rGAT-1 as well as of rGAT-1 was observed when both HA-GAT-1-transduced astrocytes and rGAT-1-overexpressing astrocytes were treated with BDNF. The effect of BDNF results from inhibition of dynamin/clathrin-dependent constitutive internalization of GAT-1 rather than from facilitation of the monensin-sensitive recycling of GAT-1 molecules back to the plasma membrane. We therefore conclude that BDNF enhances the time span of GAT-1 molecules at the plasma membrane of astrocytes. BDNF may thus play an active role in the clearance of GABA from synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and in this way influence neuronal excitability.

In addition, PlGF therapy stimulated Sca-1(+)/Lin(-) (SL) BM progenitor proliferation, enhanced their mobilization into peripheral blood, and promoted their recruitment into the peri-infarct borders. Moreover, PlGF enhanced endothelial progenitor colony formation of BM-derived SL cells, and induced a phenotypic switch of BM-SL cells, recruited in the infarct, to the endothelial, smooth muscle and cardiomyocyte lineage.Such pleiotropic effects of PlGF on cardiac repair and regeneration offer novel opportunities in the treatment of ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2017723064,"Precursor proteins that are imported from the cytosol into the matrix of mitochondria carry positively charged amphipathic presequences and cross the inner membrane with the help of vital components of the TIM23 complex. It is currently unclear which subunits of the TIM23 complex recognize and directly bind to presequences. Here we analyzed the binding of presequence peptides to purified components of the TIM23 complex. The interaction of three different presequences with purified soluble domains of yeast Tim50 (Tim50IMS), Tim23 (Tim23IMS), and full-length Tim44 was examined. Using chemical cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of purified Tim50IMS and Tim44 to interact directly with the yeast Hsp60 presequence. We also analyzed their interaction with presequences derived from precursors of yeast mitochondrial 70-kDa heat shock protein (mHsp70) and of bovine cytochrome P450SCC. Moreover, we characterized the nature of the interactions and determined their KDs. On the basis of our results, we suggest a mechanism of translocation where stronger interactions of the presequences on the trans side of the channel support the import of precursor proteins through TIM23 into the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2168537112,"The phenotype and fate of fetal microchimeric cells transfered into the maternal circulation during pregnancy are not well described. Since progenitors from distal sites mobilize during wound healing, we analyzed the recruitment and plasticity of fetal progenitors into maternal wounds. Wounds were generated on normal and bleomycin-induced fibrotic skin of parous or pregnant wild-type females with fluorescent GFP+ fetuses. Analyses were performed on skin and blood specimens through PCR, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Controls consisted of parous and pregnant females without wounds and virgin females with wounds. Fetal cells were detected in all skin specimens of parous mice as long as healing was not achieved. During early stages of wound healing, fetal cells expressed mainly leukocyte markers, while in later phases endothelial markers prevailed. Fetally derived vessels connected to maternal circulation were also found, demonstrating the transfer of fetal endothelial progenitor cells. Wounding mobilized fetal CD34 ckit− cells into the blood during pregnancy. Most of this population was CD11b−VEGFR2−. Another part was CD11b+ with a fraction expressing VEGFR2. VEGFa-spiked Matrigel plugs partially mimicked this fetal progenitor recruitment and mobilization into the blood. In summary, fetal cells that mobilize in response to wounding are mainly progenitor cells and participate in angiogenesis and inflammation.—Nassar, D., Droitcourt, C., Mathieu-d'Argent, E., Kim, M.

To assess predictors for previous HIV testing and the association between the yield of previously undiagnosed HIV and time of last negative HIV testA random sample of 10% of the adult population (≥15 years) were invited to attend a mobile HCT service. Study procedures included a questionnaire, HIV testing and CD4 counts. Predictors for previous testing were determined using a binominal model.1,144 (88.0%) of 1,300 randomly selected individuals participated in the study. 71.0% (68.3-73.6) had previously had an HIV test and 37.5% (34.6-40.5) had tested in the past 12 months. Men, migrants and older (>35 years) and younger (<20 years) individuals were less likely to have had a previous HIV test. Overall HIV prevalence was 22.7 (20.3-25.3) with peak prevalence of 41.8% (35.8-47.8) in women aged 25.1-35 years and 37.5% (26.7-48.3) in men aged 25.1-45 years. Prevalence of previously undiagnosed HIV was 10.3% (8.5-12.1) overall and 4.5% (2.3-6.6), 8.0% (CI 3.9-12.0) and 20.0% (13.2-26.8) in individuals who had their most recent HIV test within 1, 1-2 and more than 2 years prior to the survey.The high burden of undiagnosed HIV in individuals who had recently tested underscores the importance of frequent repeat testing at least annually. The high prevalence of previously undiagnosed HIV in individuals reporting a negative test in the 12 months preceding the survey indicates a very high incidence. Innovative prevention strategies are needed."

SGs are dynamic cytoplasmic foci at which stalled translation complexes accumulate. Under some conditions, SG assembly and translational arrest are initiated by the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α, which reduces the availability of the eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet ternary complex that is needed to initiate protein translation. Thereby, translationally stalled mRNAs are sequestered in dynamic cytoplasmic SGs. These granules represent a complex assembly of initiation factors, such as eIF3 or eIF4E; proteins involved in translation control, such as T-cell intracellular antigen or fragile X mental retardation protein; proteins implicated in RNA remodeling or degradation, such as HuR, tristetraprolin, or Staufen; and 40 S subunits (6Gilks N.

However, mRNAs encoding stress-induced proteins, such as heat shock proteins, are excluded from SGs and spared from translation inhibition. Importantly, stress defense and apoptotic dismantling tend to occur in a mutually exclusive fashion (12Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Apoptosis was induced by treating the cells with sodium arsenite for 2 h. 500 μl of 1× binding buffer (BioVision Research) and 5 μl of annexin V-Cy3 were added to each well, and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and monitored using a Nikon C1 Plus confocal microscope with a ×60 oil immersion objective. Wild-type and Mcpip1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with sodium arsenite for 2 h in a 6-well plate. The cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in 500 μl of 1× binding buffer. 5 μl of annexin V-Cy3 was added to the suspended cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 0.2% paraformaldehyde solution. Annexin V-Cy3-binding cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation = 543 nm and emission = 570 nm) using a phycoerythrin emission signal detector. The protein synthesis assay was conducted using the Click-iT AHA Alexa Fluor 488 protein assay kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded on 8-well chambered Lab-Tek slides. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without arsenite (0.1 or 0.5 mm) in methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μm l-azidohomoalanine (AHA; Invitrogen) for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then incubated in 3% BSA in PBS for 15 min, followed by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Proteins that incorporated AHA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated alkyne (Invitrogen) and costained with anti-FLAG antibody (1:200) and DyLight 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Labs). Images were taken with a Nikon C1 Plus confocal microscope, and immunofluorescence density were quantified using ImageJ software. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. For comparison between two groups, Student's unpaired test was used. For multiple comparisons, analysis of variance followed by Student's test unpaired were used. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. We observed previously that endogenous MCPIP1 protein is distributed in the cytoplasm and forms granule-like structures in THP-1 cells (18Liang J. Wang J.

Transfection of the MCPIP1-GFP expression plasmid into HeLa cells further confirmed that the MCPIP1-GFP fusion protein localized in the cytoplasm and formed many granules (Fig. 1a). To examine whether MCPIP1 protein is localized on mitochondria or Golgi bodies, HeLa cells were double-stained with anti-MCPIP1 antibody and MitoTracker or anti-TGN38 antibody (a marker of Golgi bodies). The results show that MCPIP1 overlapped with neither mitochondria nor Golgi bodies (Fig. 1b). We tested whether MCPIP1 protein is co-localized with lysosomes or endosomes. HeLa cells were transfected with MCPIP1-GFP and Lamp1-RFP (a marker of lysosomes) or RAB5-RFP (a marker of endosomes). The results show that MCPIP1 protein co-localized with neither lysosomes nor endosomes (Fig. 1b). Next, we transfected MCPIP1-GFP into HeLa cells and then treated the cells with or without cycloheximide. Again, MCPIP1-GFP protein formed granule-like structures in untreated cells. Interestingly, the granule-like structures of MCPIP1-GFP disappeared in cycloheximide-treated cells. As cycloheximide is an inhibitor of translation elongation, it can inhibit the formation of RNA granules, such as SGs and GW bodies (also called processing bodies (P bodies)), by fixing mRNA on the polysome (25Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that MCPIP1 protein may be localized on RNA granules, such as SGs or GW/P bodies. SG and GW/P bodies are the major RNA granules. We first examined whether MCPIP1 is localized on GW bodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with MCPIP1-GFP and then stained with anti-GW182 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2a, the granule-like structure overlapped perfectly with GW bodies as visualized by GW182 staining. As several studies reported (2Kedersha N. Anderson P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 4Buchan J.R. Parker R. Mol.

We tested whether MCPIP1 is also co-localized with hDCP1α. HEK293 cells were transfected with MCPIP1-GFP and hDCP1α-RFP. As shown in Fig. 2b, MCPIP1-GFP did not overlap with hDCP1α-RFP, although most of the granules were found in close juxtaposition with the DCP1 granules. Further experiments using Ge-1 and DDX6 staining also showed that, although a few MCPIP1 granules overlapped with P bodies, most of the MCPIP1 granules were juxtaposed with P bodies but not overlapped (Fig. 2, c and d). These results suggest that MCPIP1 is localized on GW bodies but not totally confined in P bodies. Next, we examined whether MCPIP1 is also localized on SGs under stress. HeLa cells transfected with MCPIP1-GFP were treated with arsenite (0.5 mmol/liter) for 60 min. The treated cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against several markers of SGs, such as G3BP, eIF3, eIF4E, and PABP. As shown in Fig. 3 (a–d), MCPIP1-GFP was not co-localized with SGs. Surprisingly, the cells expressing MCPIP1-GFP could not assembly SGs under arsenite-induced oxidative stress. To determine whether this phenomenon is stimulus-specific, the transfected cells were incubated with 1 μm/liter carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (an inhibitor of mitochondria) in no-glucose DMEM for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 3 (e–h), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone treatment induced SG formation. Similar to the above results, expression of MCPIP1-GFP totally blocked the formation of SGs. Similar results were also observed in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). As a control experiment, expression of GFP alone did not affect the formation of SGs under both oxidative stress and energy deprivation conditions (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the ability of splenocytes from Mcpip1−/− mice to form SGs. As shown in Fig. 4a, without stress, the cells from Mcpip1+/+ mice did not form SGs. However, the cells from Mcpip1−/− mice formed SGs even without stress, as visualized by immunofluorescence staining using anti-G3BP and anti-PABP antibodies. After oxidative stress induced by arsenite, MCPIP1-deficient cells formed many more and much larger SGs compared with Mcpip1+/+ cells. Fig. 4b shows the quantitative results from three independent experiments with G3BP staining. PABP staining showed similar results (data not shown). As characterized previously (19Liang J. Saad Y. Lei T. Wang J. Qi D. Yang Q. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), MCPIP1 is a multiple domain-containing protein that contains the ubiquitin-associated domain, DUB/RNase domains, the CCCH zinc-finger domain, the proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal conserved region. To analyze the domains that contribute to the repression of SG formation, FLAG-MCPIP1 and its serially truncated plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells. The transfected cells were then stimulated with 0.5 mm arsenite for 1 h. The SGs were visualized by immunofluorescence with anti-G3BP antibody. The expression of MCPIP1 and its truncated forms was visualized by immunofluorescence with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5a, the MCPIP1 truncation without the C-terminal conserved region and proline-rich and ubiquitin-associated domains lost granule-like structures but still maintained the ability to inhibit SG formation. Further deletion of a partial DUB/RNase domain or a mutated CCCH zinc-finger domain resulted in maintenance granule-like structures but loss of the ability to inhibit SG formation. The truncated MCPIP1 plasmids were constructed as indicated in Fig. 5b. As reported previously (19Liang J. Saad Y. Lei T. Wang J. Qi D. Yang Q. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Matsushita K. Takeuchi O. Standley D.M. Kumagai Y. Kawagoe T. Miyake T. Satoh T. Kato H. Tsujimura T. Nakamura H. Akira S. Nature. 2009; 458: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), MCPIP1 contains both DUB and RNase activities, by which it can block LPS- and cytokine-induced inflammatory signaling and promote inflammatory mRNA degradation, respectively. Both DUB and RNase active domains have been mapped on the N-terminal conserved and CCCH zinc-finger regions, which have some overlapping and distinct amino acid sites. The mutant MCPIP1-C157A lost DUB activity but maintained RNase activity. MCPIP1-D225A/D226A lost RNase activity but maintained DUB activity. MCPIP1-D141N lost both DUB and RNase activities (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, MCPIP1-C157A maintained the granule-like structures, but it lost the ability to inhibit SG formation. In contrast, MCPIP1-D225A/D226A lost the granule-like structures, but it maintained the ability to inhibit SG formation. MCPIP1-D141N appeared as different granule-like structures and also lost the ability to inhibit SG formation. Taken together, the results clearly suggest that the ability of MCPIP1 to repress SG formation is dependent on its DUB activity. On the other hand, its RNase activity may be responsible for its granule-like structures. It is known that cells form SGs to prevent apoptotic death under stress (14Tsai N.P. Wei L.N. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Arimoto K. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Saito H. Takekawa M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, actively disrupting SGs may result in the release of apoptosis-inducing components from SGs to trigger cell death. To test whether expression of MCPIP1 promotes cellular apoptosis, GFP or MCPIP1-GFP was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells. The transfected cells were treated with or without 0.5 mm arsenite for 2 h. Cell death was detected by annexin V-Cy3 staining. It appeared that a significantly increased cell population was annexin V-positive when the cells were transfected with MCPIP1-GFP and treated with arsenite (Fig. 6, a and b). In another experiment, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type or Mcpip1−/− mice were treated with or without 0.5 mm arsenite for 2 h. Cell death was detected by annexin V-Cy3 staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 6 (c and d), MCPIP1-deficient cells were resistant to stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that MCPIP1 expression sensitizes the cells for apoptosis under stress. To understand the molecular mechanism of MCPIP1 inhibition of SG formation, we investigated whether MCPIP1 expression suppresses stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation because some stresses, such as arsenite, induce SG formation by phosphorylation of eIF2α (5Anderson P. Kedersha N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with GFP or MCPIP1-GFP expression plasmids. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were left untreated or were treated with 0.5 mm arsenite for 30, 60, and 120 min. Protein extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting with phospho-eIF2α and other antibodies as indicated. As shown in Fig. 7a, arsenite-induced eIF2α phosphorylation peaked at 60 min. Overexpression of MCPIP1 completely blocked arsenite-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. We reported previously that MCPIP1 inhibits LPS- and cytokine-induced JNK signaling (19Liang J. Saad Y. Lei T. Wang J. Qi D. Yang Q. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and here, MCPIP1 expression also inhibited arsenite-induced JNK phosphorylation but did not affect p38 phosphorylation. Consistently, phosphorylated eIF2α was significantly increased in Mcpip1−/− cells under both normal and stress conditions compared with that in Mcpip1+/+ cells (Fig. 7b). As SG formation is accompanied by translational blockage, the effect of MCPIP1 expression on protein synthesis was investigated. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-MCPIP1 or an empty vector. The transfected cells were treated with or without arsenite (0.1 or 0.5 mm) in methionine-free medium. The newly translated proteins were labeled with the methionine analog AHA. Using click chemistry, these AHA-incorporating nascent proteins were then labeled with a fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 488) conjugated to an alkyne group (26Dieterich D.C. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9482-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 27Dieterich D.C. Lee J.J. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The images were taken by confocal microscopy and are shown in Fig. 8a. The fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ. As shown in Fig. 8b, arsenite treatment dose-dependently inhibited nascent protein synthesis. MCPIP1 expression released the stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. To analyze the dynamic expression of MCPIP1 protein under stress, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with 0.5 mm arsenite or subjected to heat shock (43 °C) for different times as indicated in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9a, MCPIP1 expression was significantly increased after 12 h of treatment with arsenite, and the high expression levels were maintained for up to 24 h. Interestingly, phospho-eIF2α and phospho-JNK were significantly increased after 1 h of treatment with arsenite but disappeared after 12 h, which is associated with the expression of MCPIP1 at that time. Under heat shock, MCPIP1 was induced after 4 h and declined at 6 and 12 h but increased again at 24 h. Similar to arsenite treatment, phospho-eIF2α and phospho-JNK were significant increased after 0.5 h of heat shock and disappeared after 4 h when MCPIP1 expression was increased (Fig. 9b). These results suggest that, during the early period of stress, cells quickly initiate defense mechanisms to form SGs and dictate survival; however, during the late period of stress, MCPIP1 is up-regulated, and feedback blocks stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and SG formation and dictates cellular apoptosis. It was reported previously that 15d-PGJ2 blocks translation through inactivation of translation initiation factor eIF4A and results in SG formation (28Kim W.J. Kim J.H. Jang S.K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5020-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To examine whether MCPIP1 also inhibits 15d-PGJ2-induced SG formation, HeLa cells transfected with MCPIP1-GFP were treated with 15d-PGJ2 (50 μmol/liter) for 1 h. The treated cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against several markers of SGs, such as G3BP, eIF3, eIF4E, and PABP. As shown in Fig. 10, a–d, MCPIP1 expression also blocked 15d-PGJ2-induced SG formation. Because 15d-PGJ2-induced SG formation is independent of eIF2α phosphorylation, these results suggest that MCPIP1 may also disassemble SGs through other mechanisms. In response to stress, cells form SGs to prevent damage that environmental forces inflict on DNA or proteins. However, if the stress is intense and sustained, SGs will be disassembled, and apoptosis will be initiated. The molecular mechanisms that coordinate the two opposite responses remain largely unknown. Our previous work demonstrated that MCPIP1 acts as a DUB to negatively regulate JNK and NF-κB signaling and macrophage inflammation (19Liang J. Saad Y. Lei T. Wang J. Qi D. Yang Q. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, its role in the cellular stress response remains unknown. In this study, we found that expression of MCPIP1 completely blocked SG formation and promoted macrophage apoptosis under stress conditions, including arsenite-induced oxidative stress, heat shock, and energy deprivation, which is dependent on its DUB activity. Consistently, MCPIP1-deficient cells spontaneously formed aggregation of SGs even in the absence of stress and were resistant to apoptosis under stress. Furthermore, MCPIP1 was induced by stress in macrophages during the late period, which is associated with the decrease in phosphorylation of eIF2α. These results suggest that MCPIP1 is critically involved in the coordination of SG formation and apoptosis under stress. In most cases, the stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to SG assembly by preventing or delaying translational initiation. Cells that express a non-phosphorylatable form of eIF2α (S51A) cannot assemble SGs in response to arsenite-induced oxidative stress and are hypersensitive to the toxic effect of low doses of arsenite (7Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W. Miller I.J. Stahl J. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MCPIP1 blocks arsenite-induced SG formation is probably by repressing stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. As evident in this study, overexpression of MCPIP1 significantly inhibited arsenite-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Conversely, stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation was significantly increased in MCPIP1-deficient cells. It was noted that MCPIP1 expression also inhibited 15d-PGJ2-induced SG formation. 15d-PGJ2 has been reported to inhibit translation by blocking the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G and results in SG formation (28Kim W.J. Kim J.H. Jang S.K. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5020-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MCPIP1 may modulate SG assembly by multiple mechanisms. One interesting finding is that overexpressed MCPIP1 forms many granule-like structures in the cytoplasm and overlaps perfectly with GW182, suggesting co-localization with GW/P bodies. Previous reports indicate that SGs and GW/P bodies are spatially, compositionally, and functionally linked. Overexpression of another CCCH zinc-finger domain-containing protein, tristetraprolin, promotes the interaction and composition interchanges between SGs and GW/P bodies (29Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). It is possible that overexpression of MCPIP1 promotes the formation of GW/P bodies, by which it interferes with the formation of SGs. MCPIP1 granules overlap perfectly with GW-182 but only partially with hDCP1α, Ge-1, and DDX6. GW182 has been identified as a major component of the RNA-induced silencing complex and is dynamically recruited into P bodies (30Jakymiw A. Lian S. Eystathioy T. Li S. Satoh M. Hamel J.C. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Sen G.L. Blau H.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), including hDCP1α, Ge-1, and DDX6. However, there are also many observations that the RNA-induced silencing complex does not completely overlap with P bodies (32Rossi J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 643-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Chang W.L. Tarn W.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 6600-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting the dynamic nature of fusion of the RNA-induced silencing complex and P bodies. Importantly, the granule-like structure of MCPIP1 is associated with its RNase activity. In addition, a previous report suggests that MCPIP1 promotes mRNA degradation of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines (20Matsushita K. Takeuchi O. Standley D.M. Kumagai Y. Kawagoe T. Miyake T. Satoh T. Kato H. Tsujimura T. Nakamura H. Akira S. Nature. 2009; 458: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MCPIP1 may be involved in the RNAi/microRNA functional pathway. How does MCPIP1 promote cellular apoptosis? As reported previously (14Tsai N.P. Wei L.N. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Arimoto K. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Saito H. Takekawa M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), actively disrupting SGs would result in the release of apoptosis-inducing components from SGs to trigger cell death. Thus, MCPIP1 may promote cellular apoptosis by disassembling SGs and releasing apoptosis-inducing components. Two reports showed that ROCK1 and RACK1 can be released from disassembled SGs and activate JNK to trigger cellular apoptosis (14Tsai N.P. Wei L.N. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Arimoto K. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Saito H. Takekawa M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1324-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In this study, MCPIP1 not only suppressed SG formation but also inhibited JNK phosphorylation, suggesting that cellular apoptosis may be triggered by other signaling pathways. As we and others have reported recently, MCPIP1 is a critical regulator for controlling the inflammatory response and immune homeostasis; this is demonstrated by the finding that mice with an Mcpip1 disruption spontaneously develop inflammatory syndrome and the autoimmune response (19Liang J. Saad Y. Lei T. Wang J. Qi D. Yang Q. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2959-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20Matsushita K. Takeuchi O. Standley D.M. Kumagai Y. Kawagoe T. Miyake T. Satoh T. Kato H. Tsujimura T. Nakamura H. Akira S. Nature. 2009; 458: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which MCPIP1 controls the inflammatory response may be involved in repressing inflammatory signaling through its DUB activity and promoting inflammatory mRNA degradation through its RNase activity. As apoptosis is also a major mechanism used to resolve inflammation, our study suggests another mechanism, that MCPIP1 may control inflammation by suppressing SG formation, which determines macrophage apoptosis under oxidative stress. In summary, we have reported here that MCPIP1 functions as a factor to coordinate formation and apoptosis during cellular stress, which may be implicated in the resolution of macrophage inflammation and immune homeostasis. We thank Drs. D. Weil, A. Helenius and W. Mothes for providing plasmids used in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2081648576,"In recent years, an increasing number of small molecules and short peptides have been identified that interfere with aggregation and/or oligomerization of the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). Many of them possess aromatic moieties, suggesting a dominant role for those in interacting with Aβ along various stages of the aggregation process. In this study, we attempt to elucidate whether interactions of such aromatic inhibitors with monomeric Aβ(12-28) point to a common mechanism of action by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at equilibrium. Our results suggest that, independently of the presence of inhibitors, monomeric Aβ(12-28) populates a partially collapsed ensemble that is largely devoid of canonical secondary structure at 300 K and neutral pH. The small molecules have different affinities for Aβ(12-28) that can be partially rationalized by the balance of aromatic and charged moieties constituting the molecules. There are no predominant binding modes, although aggregation inhibitors preferentially interact with the N-terminal portion of the fragment (residues 13-20). Analysis of the free energy landscape of Aβ(12-28) reveals differences highlighted by altered populations of a looplike conformer in the presence of inhibitors. We conclude that intrinsic disorder of Aβ persists at the level of binding small molecules and that inhibitors can significantly alter properties of monomeric Aβ via multiple routes of differing specificity."

Here, we demonstrate that NMD is inhibited by high Myc expression. We show that the phosphorylation of eIF2α, likely due to the ability of Myc to generate reactive oxygen species and augment endoplasmic reticulum stress, is necessary for the inhibition of NMD by Myc. The inhibition of NMD both stabilizes and up-regulates multiple Myc targets, suggesting that the inhibition of NMD may play an important role in the dynamic regulation of genes by Myc.

https://openalex.org/W1987012315,"3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Although binding of 3'-phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PDK1 is known to be essential for its interaction with and activation of downstream kinases, the mechanism by which PDK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane remains controversial. Our surface plasmon resonance analysis of the PDK1 PH domain and selected mutants shows that the PH domain specifically binds phosphatidylserine using a site that is separate from the canonical phosphoinositide-binding site. Further cell studies show that this specific phosphatidylserine binding is important for the plasma membrane localization and signaling function of PDK1."
https://openalex.org/W2022324397,"Impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is implicated in several metabolic disorders. Even though mitochondrial DNA encodes several subunits critical for OXPHOS, the metabolic consequence of activating mitochondrial transcription remains unclear. We show here that LRP130, a protein involved in Leigh syndrome, increases hepatic β-fatty acid oxidation. Using convergent genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate LRP130 complexes with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase to activate mitochondrial transcription. Activation of mitochondrial transcription is associated with increased OXPHOS activity, increased supercomplexes, and denser cristae, independent of mitochondrial biogenesis. Consistent with increased oxidative phosphorylation, ATP levels are increased in both cells and mouse liver, whereas coupled respiration is increased in cells. We propose activation of mitochondrial transcription remodels mitochondria and enhances oxidative metabolism."

To load clamps onto DNA, an open clamp loader-clamp complex must form. An unresolved question is whether clamp loaders capture clamps that have transiently opened or whether clamp loaders bind closed clamps and actively open clamps. A simple fluorescence-based clamp opening assay was developed to address this question and to determine how ATP binding contributes to clamp opening. A direct comparison of real time binding and opening reactions revealed that the Escherichia coli γ complex binds β first and then opens the clamp. Mutation of conserved ""arginine fingers"" in the γ complex that interact with bound ATP decreased clamp opening activity showing that arginine fingers make an important contribution to the ATP-induced conformational changes that allow the clamp loader to pry open the clamp."
https://openalex.org/W2086208786,"The epicardium is a sheet of epithelial cells covering the heart during early cardiac development. In recent years, the epicardium has been identified as an important contributor to cardiovascular development, and epicardium-derived cells have the potential to differentiate into multiple cardiac cell lineages. Some epicardium-derived cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and delaminate from the surface of the developing heart subsequently invade the myocardium and differentiate into vascular smooth muscle of the developing coronary vasculature. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated broadly in tissue patterning and development, including in the heart, but a role in epicardium is unknown. To examine the role of miRNAs during epicardial development, we conditionally deleted the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer in the proepicardium using Gata5-Cre mice. Epicardial Dicer mutant mice are born in expected Mendelian ratios but die immediately after birth with profound cardiac defects, including impaired coronary vessel development. We found that loss of Dicer leads to impaired epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and a reduction in epicardial cell proliferation and differentiation into coronary smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate a critical role for Dicer, and by implication miRNAs, in murine epicardial development."
https://openalex.org/W2049134317,"Background The Bangkok Tenofovir Study was launched in 2005 to determine if pre-exposure prophylaxis with tenofovir will reduce the risk of HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs). We describe recruitment, screening, enrollment, and baseline characteristics of study participants and contrast risk behavior of Tenofovir Study participants with participants in the 1999–2003 AIDSVAX B/E Vaccine Trial. Methods The Bangkok Tenofovir Study is an ongoing, phase-3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trial of daily oral tenofovir. The Tenofovir Study and the Vaccine Trial were conducted among IDUs at 17 drug-treatment clinics in Bangkok. Tenofovir Study sample size was based on HIV incidence in the Vaccine Trial. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect demographic, risk behavior, and incarceration data. The Tenofovir Study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number-NCT00119106. Results From June 2005 through July 2010, 4094 IDUs were screened and 2413 enrolled in the Bangkok Tenofovir Study. The median age of enrolled participants was 31 years (range, 20–59), 80% were male, and 63% reported they injected drugs during the 3 months before enrollment. Among those who injected, 53% injected methamphetamine, 37% midazolam, and 35% heroin. Tenofovir Study participants were less likely to inject drugs, inject daily, or share needles (all, p<0.001) than Vaccine Trial participants. Discussion The Bangkok Tenofovir Study has been successfully launched and is fully enrolled. Study participants are significantly less likely to report injecting drugs and sharing needles than participants in the 1999–2003 AIDSVAX B/E Vaccine Trial suggesting HIV incidence will be lower than expected. In response, the Bangkok Tenofovir Study enrollment was increased from 1600 to 2400 and the study design was changed from a defined 1-year follow-up period to an endpoint-driven design. Trial results demonstrating whether or not daily oral tenofovir reduces the risk of HIV infection among IDUs are expected in 2012."
https://openalex.org/W2112409268,"It is believed that depression impedes and motivation enhances functional recovery after neuronal damage such as spinal-cord injury and stroke. However, the neuronal substrate underlying such psychological effects on functional recovery remains unclear. A longitudinal study of brain activation in the non-human primate model of partial spinal-cord injury using positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a contribution of the primary motor cortex (M1) to the recovery of finger dexterity through the rehabilitative training. Here, we show that activity of the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which plays a critical role in processing of motivation, increased and its functional connectivity with M1 emerged and was progressively strengthened during the recovery. In addition, functional connectivities among M1, the ventral striatum and other structures belonging to neural circuits for processing motivation, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus were also strengthened during the recovery. These results give clues to the neuronal substrate for motivational regulation of motor learning required for functional recovery after spinal-cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2078123723,"Honeybee workers are essentially sterile female helpers that make up the majority of individuals in a colony. Workers display a marked change in physiology when they transition from in-nest tasks to foraging. Recent technological advances have made it possible to unravel the metabolic modifications associated with this transition. Previous studies have revealed extensive remodeling of brain, thorax, and hypopharyngeal gland biochemistry. However, data on changes in the abdomen is scarce. To narrow this gap we investigated the proteomic composition of abdominal tissue in the days typically preceding the onset of foraging in honeybee workers. In order to get a broader representation of possible protein dynamics, we used workers of two genotypes with differences in the age at which they initiate foraging. This approach was combined with RNA interference-mediated downregulation of an insulin/insulin-like signaling component that is central to foraging behavior, the insulin receptor substrate (irs), and with measurements of glucose and lipid levels. Our data provide new insight into the molecular underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity in the honeybee, invoke parallels with vertebrate metabolism, and support an integrated and irs-dependent association of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism with the transition from in-nest tasks to foraging."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying PHN remain unclear. Here, using a PHN rat model at 2 weeks after varicella zoster virus infection, we found that spinal astrocytes were dramatically activated. The mechanical allodynia and spinal central sensitization were significantly attenuated by intrathecally injected L-α-aminoadipate (astrocytic specific inhibitor) whereas minocycline (microglial specific inhibitor) had no effect, which indicated that spinal astrocyte but not microglia contributed to the chronic pain in PHN rat. Further study was taken to investigate the molecular mechanism of astrocyte-incudced allodynia in PHN rat at post-infection 2 weeks. Results showed that nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase mediated the development of spinal astrocytic activation, and activated astrocytes dramatically increased interleukin-1β expression which induced N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) phosphorylation in spinal dorsal horn neurons to strengthen pain transmission. Taken together, these results suggest that spinal activated astrocytes may be one of the most important factors in the pathophysiology of PHN and “NO-Astrocyte-Cytokine-NMDAR-Neuron” pathway may be the detailed neural mechanisms underlying PHN. Thus, inhibiting spinal astrocytic activation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for clinical management of PHN."

A conformational analysis showed that the designed peptide adopts the expected fold in pure water. Moreover, a combination of NMR interaction analysis and cell binding studies were used to demonstrate that the peptide targets VEGF receptors. The VEGF receptor 1(D2)-interacting residues were characterized at the molecular level, and they correspond to the residues recognizing the placental growth factor sequence Gln(87)-Val(100). Finally, the peptide biological activity was characterized in vitro and in vivo, and it showed a VEGF-like behavior. Indeed, the peptide activated VEGF-dependent intracellular pathways, induced endothelial cell proliferation and rescue from apoptosis, and promoted angiogenesis in vivo. This compound is one of the few peptides known with proangiogenic activity, which makes it a candidate for the development of a novel peptide-based drug for medical applications in therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964936343,"We suggest a control based approach to topology estimation of networks with N elements. This method first drives the network to steady states by a delayed feedback control; then performs structural perturbations for shifting the steady states M times; and finally infers the connection topology from the steady states' shifts by matrix inverse algorithm (M = N) or l(1)-norm convex optimization strategy applicable to estimate the topology of sparse networks from M << N perturbations. We discuss as well some aspects important for applications, such as the topology reconstruction quality and error sources, advantages and disadvantages of the suggested method, and the influence of (control) perturbations, inhomegenity, sparsity, coupling functions, and measurement noise. Some examples of networks with Chua's oscillators are presented to illustrate the reliability of the suggested technique."
https://openalex.org/W1977657173,"Pathological angiogenesis contributes to a number of diseases including cancer and macular degeneration. Although angiogenesis inhibitors are available in the clinic, their efficacy against most cancers is modest due in part to the existence of alternative and compensatory signaling pathways. Given that angiogenesis is dependent on multiple growth factors and a broad signaling network in vivo, we sought to explore the potential of multidrug cocktails for angiogenesis inhibition. We have screened 741 clinical drug combinations for the synergistic inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. We focused specifically on existing clinical drugs since the re-purposing of clinical drugs allows for a more rapid and cost effective transition to clinical studies when compared to new drug entities. Our screen identified cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant, and itraconazole, an antifungal drug, as a synergistic pair of inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation. In combination, the IC(50) dose of each drug is reduced by 3 to 9 fold. We also tested the ability of the combination to inhibit endothelial cell tube formation and sprouting, which are dependent on two essential processes in angiogenesis, endothelial cell migration and differentiation. We found that CsA and itraconazole synergistically inhibit tube network size and sprout formation. Lastly, we tested the combination on human foreskin fibroblast viability as well as Jurkat T cell and HeLa cell proliferation, and found that endothelial cells are selectively targeted. Thus, it is possible to combine existing clinical drugs to synergistically inhibit in vitro models of angiogenesis. This strategy may be useful in pursuing the next generation of antiangiogenesis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039138264,"CRF14_BG isolates, originally found in Spain, are characterized by CXCR4 tropism and rapid disease progression. This study aimed to identify the origin of CRF14_BG and reconstruct its epidemiological history based on new isolates from Portugal.C2V3C3 env gene sequences were obtained from 62 samples collected in 1993-1998 from Portuguese HIV-1 patients. Full-length genomic sequences were obtained from three patients. Viral subtypes, diversity, divergence rate and positive selection were investigated by phylogenetic analysis. The molecular structure of the genomes was determined by bootscanning. A relaxed molecular clock model was used to date the origin of CRF14_BG. Geno2pheno was used to predict viral tropism. Subtype B was the most prevalent subtype (45 sequences; 73%) followed by CRF14_BG (8; 13%), G (4; 6%), F1 (2; 3%), C (2; 3%) and CRF02_AG (1; 2%). Three CRF14_BG sequences were derived from 1993 samples. Near full-length genomic sequences were strongly related to the CRF14_BG isolates from Spain. Genetic diversity of the Portuguese isolates was significantly higher than the Spanish isolates (0.044 vs 0.014, P<0.0001). The mean date of origin of the CRF14_BG cluster was estimated to be 1992 (range, 1989 and 1996) based on the subtype G genomic region and 1989 (range, 1984-1993) based on the subtype B genomic region. Most CRF14_BG strains (78.9%) were predicted to be CXCR4. Finally, up to five amino acids were under selective pressure in subtype B V3 loop whereas only one was found in the CRF14_BG cluster.CRF14_BG emerged in Portugal in the early 1990 s soon after the beginning of the HIV-1 epidemics, spread to Spain in late 1990 s as a consequence of IVDUs migration and then to the rest of Europe. CXCR4 tropism is a general characteristic of this CRF that may have been selected for by escape from neutralizing antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W2076623127,"Fetal cardiac gene reactivation is a hallmark of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (PCH) driven by cardiac transcription factors (TFs) such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs). Nuclear import of dephosphorylated NFATs catalyzed by calcineurin (CaN) is a well-established hypertrophic mechanism. Here we report that NFATc4 expression is also up-regulated by newly expressed protein kinase D3 (PKD3) to induce PCH. In both in vitro and in vivo cardiac hypertrophic models, the normally undetectable PKD3 was profoundly up-regulated by isoproterenol followed by overt expression of cardiac TFs including NFATc4, NK family of transcription factor 2.5 (Nkx2.5), GATA4 and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Using gene silencing approaches, we demonstrate PKD3 is required for increasing the expression of NFATc4, Nkx2.5, and GATA4 while PKD1 is required for the increase in MEF2D expression. Upstream induction of PKD3 is driven by nuclear entry of CaN-activated NFATc1 and c3 but not c4. Therefore, PKD3 is a pivotal mediator of the CaN-NFATc1/c3-PKD3-NFATc4 hypertrophic signaling cascade and a potential new drug target for the PCH."
https://openalex.org/W2004506334,"The success of combination antiretroviral therapies for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has resulted in prolonged life expectancy (over 40 years from diagnosis) and an improved quality of life for people living with HIV. The risk of vertical HIV transmission during pregnancy has been reduced to less than 1%. As a result of these breakthroughs and as many of these individuals are of reproductive age, fertility issues are becoming increasingly important for this population. One population in which conception planning and reduction of horizontal HIV transmission warrants further research is HIV-discordant couples where the male partner is HIV-positive and the female partner is HIV-negative. Sperm washing is a technique carried out in a fertility clinic that separates HIV from the seminal fluid. Although sperm washing followed by intrauterine insemination significantly reduces the risk of horizontal HIV transmission, there has been limited access to the procedure in North America. Furthermore, little is known about the conception decision-making experiences of HIV-discordant couples who might benefit from sperm washing. Chart reviews and semi-structured interviews were completed with 12 HIV-discordant couples in Ontario, Canada. Couples were recruited through HIV clinics and one fertility clinic that offered sperm washing. Participants identified a number of factors that affected their decision-making around pregnancy planning. Access to sperm washing and other fertility services was an issue (cost, travel and few clinics). Participants identified a lack of information on the procedure (availability, safety). Sources of support (social networks, healthcare providers) were unevenly distributed, especially among those who did not disclose their HIV status to friends and family. Finally, the stigmatisation of HIV continues to have a negative affect on HIV-discordant couples and their intentions to conceive. Access to sperm washing and fertility service is significantly limited for this population and is accompanied with a number of challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2121406866,"Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder caused by concomitant impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells and of insulin action in peripheral target tissues. Studies with inhibitors and agonists established a role for PLC in the regulation of insulin secretion but did not distinguish between effects due to nuclear or cytoplasmic PLC signaling pathways that act in a distinct fashion. We report that in MIN6 β cells, PLCβ1 localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm, PLCδ4 in the nucleus, and PLCγ1 in the cytoplasm. By silencing each isoform, we observed that they all affected glucose-induced insulin release both at basal and high glucose concentrations. To elucidate the molecular basis of PLC regulation, we focused on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor transcription factor that regulates genes critical to β-cell maintenance and functions. Silencing of PLCβ1 and PLCδ4 resulted in a decrease in the PPARγ mRNA level. By means of a PPARγ-promoter-luciferase assay, the decrease could be attributed to a PLC action on the PPARγ-promoter region. The effect was specifically observed on silencing of the nuclear and not the cytoplasmic PLC. These findings highlight a novel pathway by which nuclear PLCs affect insulin secretion and identify PPARγ as a novel molecular target of nuclear PLCs.—Fiume, R., Ramazzotti, G., Faenza, I., Piazzi, M., Bavelloni, A., Billi, A.

https://openalex.org/W2034086354,"In Saccharomyces cerevisae, expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) fragments are assembled into discrete cytosolic aggregates in a process regulated by the molecular chaperones Hsp26, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp104. To better understand how the different chaperones might cooperate during polyQ aggregation, we used sequential immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry to identify proteins associated with either soluble (Q25) or aggregation-prone (Q103) fragments at both early and later times after induction of their expression. We found that Hsp26, Hsp70, Hsp90, and other chaperones interact with Q103, but not Q25, within the first 2 h. Further, Hsp70 and Hsp90 appear to be partially released from Q103 prior to the maturation of the aggregates and before the recruitment of Hsp104. To test the importance of this seemingly ordered process, we used a chemical probe to artificially enhance Hsp70 binding to Q103. This treatment retained both Hsp70 and Hsp90 on the polyQ fragment and, interestingly, limited subsequent exchange for Hsp26 and Hsp104, resulting in incomplete aggregation. Together, these results suggest that partial release of Hsp70 may be an essential step in the continued processing of expanded polyQ fragments in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1995338471,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small RNAs that regulate expressions of most genes. miRNAs play important roles in the pituitary, the ""master"" endocrine organ.However, we still don't know which role miRNAs play in the development of pituitary tissue or how much they contribute to the pituitary function. By applying a combination of microarray analysis and Solexa sequencing, we detected a total of 450 miRNAs in the porcine pituitary. Verification with RT-PCR showed a high degree of confidence for the obtained data. According to the current miRBase release17.0, the detected miRNAs included 169 known porcine miRNAs, 163 conserved miRNAs not yet identified in the pig, and 12 potentially new miRNAs not yet identified in any species, three of which were revealed using Northern blot. The pituitary might contain about 80.17% miRNA types belonging to the animal. Analysis of 10 highly expressed miRNAs with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) indicated that the enriched miRNAs were involved not only in the development of the organ but also in a variety of inter-cell and inner cell processes or pathways that are involved in the function of the organ. We have revealed the existence of a large number of porcine miRNAs as well as some potentially new miRNAs and established for the first time a comprehensive miRNA expression profile of the pituitary. The pituitary gland contains unexpectedly many miRNA types and miRNA actions are involved in important processes for both the development and function of the organ."
https://openalex.org/W2109992888,"Little is known about the influence of visual characteristics other than colour on flavor perception, and the complex interactions between more than two sensory modalities. This study focused on the effects of recognizability of visual (texture) information on flavor perception of odorized sweet beverages. Participants rated the perceived sweetness of odorized sucrose solutions in the presence or absence of either a congruent or incongruent visual context. Odors were qualitatively reminiscent of sweet foods (strawberry and caramel) or not (savoury). Visual context was either an image of the same sweet foods (figurative context) or a visual texture derived from this product (non-figurative context). Textures were created using a texture synthesis method that preserved perceived food qualities while removing object information. Odor-taste combinations were rated sweeter within a figurative than a non-figurative context. This behaviour was exhibited for all odor-taste combinations, even in trials without images, indicating sustained priming by figurative visual context. A non-figurative context showed a transient sweetening effect. Sweetness was generally enhanced most by the strawberry odor. We conclude that the degree of recognizability of visual information (figurative versus non-figurative), influences flavor perception differently. Our results suggest that this visual context priming is mediated by separate sustained and transient processes that are differently evoked by figurative and non-figurative visual contexts. These components operate independent of the congruency of the image-odor-taste combinations."

MMP-2 is secreted as a pro-enzyme, which is activated by the membrane-bound proteins, and the polarized distribution of secretory and the membrane-associated MMP-2 has been investigated. However, the real-time visualizations of both MMP-2 secretion from the front edge of a migration cell and its distribution on the cell surface have not been reported.The method of video-rate bioluminescence imaging was applied to visualize exocytosis of MMP-2 from a living cell using Gaussia luciferase (GLase) as a reporter. The luminescence signals of GLase were detected by a high speed electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (EM-CCD camera) with a time resolution within 500 ms per image. The fusion protein of MMP-2 to GLase was expressed in a HeLa cell and exocytosis of MMP-2 was detected in a few seconds along the leading edge of a migrating HeLa cell. The membrane-associated MMP-2 was observed at the specific sites on the bottom side of the cells, suggesting that the sites of MMP-2 secretion are different from that of MMP-2 binding.We were the first to successfully demonstrate secretory dynamics of MMP-2 and the specific sites for polarized distribution of MMP-2 on the cell surface. The video-rate bioluminescence imaging using GLase is a useful method to investigate distribution and dynamics of secreted proteins on the whole surface of polarized cells in real time."
https://openalex.org/W2038907494,"Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, resides in the macrophages of the mammalian host. The aquaporin family of proteins form important components of the parasite-host interface. The parasite-host interface could be a potential target for chemotherapy. Analysis of L. major and L. infantum genomes showed the presence of five aquaporins (AQPs) annotated as AQP9 (230aa), AQP putative (294aa), AQP-like protein (279aa), AQP1 (314aa) and AQP-like protein (596aa). We report here the structural modeling, localization and functional characterization of the AQPs from L. donovani. LdAQP1, LdAQP9, LdAQP2860 and LdAQP2870 have the canonical NPA-NPA motifs, whereas LdAQP putative has a non-canonical NPM-NPA motif. In the carboxyl terminal to the second NPA box of all AQPs except AQP1, a valine/alanine residue was found instead of the arginine. In that respect these four AQPs are similar to tonoplast intrinsic proteins in plants, which are localized to intracellular organelles. Confocal microscopy of L. donovani expressing GFP-tagged AQPs showed an intracellular localization of LdAQP9 and LdAQP2870. Real-time PCR assays showed expression of all aquaporins except LdAQP2860, whose level was undetectable. Three-dimensional homology modeling of the AQPs showed that LdAQP1 structure bears greater topological similarity to the aquaglyceroporin than to aquaporin of E. coli. The pore of LdAQP1 was very different from the rest in shape and size. The cavity of LdAQP2860 was highly irregular and undefined in geometry. For functional characterization, four AQP proteins were heterologously expressed in yeast. In the fps1Δ yeast cells, which lacked the key aquaglyceroporin, LdAQP1 alone displayed an osmosensitive phenotype indicating glycerol transport activity. However, expression of LdAQP1 and LdAQP putative in a yeast gpd1Δ strain, deleted for glycerol production, conferred osmosensitive phenotype indicating water transport activity or aquaporin function. Our analysis for the first time shows the presence of subcellular aquaporins and provides structural and functional characterization of aquaporins in Leishmania donovani."
https://openalex.org/W2023581263,"Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded onto chromatin with the aid of Cdt1 and Cdc18/Cdc6 and form prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs) at multiple sites on each chromosome. Pre-RCs are essential for DNA replication and surviving replication stress. However, the mechanism by which pre-RCs contribute to surviving replication stress is largely unknown. Here, we isolated the fission yeast mcm6-S1 mutant that was hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and camptothecin (CPT), both of which cause forks to collapse. The mcm6-S1 mutation impaired the interaction with Cdt1 and decreased the binding of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins to replication origins. Overexpression of Cdt1 restored MCM binding and suppressed the sensitivity to MMS and CPT, suggesting that the Cdt1-Mcm6 interaction is important for the assembly of pre-RCs and the repair of collapsed forks. MMS-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and Rad22/Rad52 focus formation occurred normally, whereas cells containing Rhp54/Rad54 foci, which are involved in DNA strand exchange and dissociation of the joint molecules, were increased. Remarkably, G(1) phase extension through deletion of an S phase cyclin, Cig2, as well as Cdt1 overexpression restored pre-RC assembly and suppressed Rhp54 accumulation. A cdc18 mutation also caused hypersensitivity to MMS and CPT and accumulation of Rhp54 foci. These data suggest that an abundance of pre-RCs facilitates a late step in the recombinational repair of collapsed forks in the following S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2048888441,"Wood consumption is a rare behavior in frugivorous primates; however, it can be necessary for nutritional balancing as it may provide macro and/or micronutrients that are scarce in the most frequently eaten items (fruits). We tested this hypothesis in six spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) communities inhabiting continuous and fragmented rainforests in Lacandona, Mexico. We investigated the importance of both live and decayed wood in the diet of the monkeys, and assessed if wood consumption is related to the nutritional composition of these items. In general, wood consumption was focused on trees of Licania platypus (Chrysobalanaceae) and Ficus spp. (Moraceae), and was similar in continuous forest and in fragments (mean ± SD; 24±20% vs 18±16% of total feeding time, respectively), but marginally higher in females than in males (16±14% vs 5±4%, respectively). Live and decayed wood were both poorer in lipids, proteins, total nonstructural carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients compared to mature and immature fruits. Moreover, decayed wood of L. platypus showed consistently higher levels of sodium and calcium compared to fruits. In conclusion, our findings suggest that wood from decaying trees of L. platypus and Ficus spp. and young branch piths of L. platypus represents an important source of sodium and/or calcium in the diet of spider monkeys, particularly in the case of females. The protection of decaying trees within forests and fragments is therefore necessary for the appropriate management and conservation of this endangered primate species."
https://openalex.org/W2171408331,"The presence of new Streptococcus pneumoniae clones in dead wild chimpanzees from the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, with previous respiratory problems has been demonstrated recently by DNA sequence analysis from samples obtained from the deceased apes. In order to broadenour understanding on the relatedness of these pneumococcal clones to those from humans, the gene locus responsible for biosynthesis of the capsule polysaccharide (CPS) has now been characterized. DNA sequence analysis of PCR fragments identified a cluster named cps3Taï containing the four genes typical for serotype 3 CPS, but lacking a 5′-region of ≥2 kb which is degenerated in other cps3 loci and not required for type 3 biosynthesis. CPS3 is composed of a simple disaccharide repeat unit comprising glucose and glucuronic acid (GlcUA). The two genes ugd responsible for GlcUA synthesis and wchE encoding the type 3 synthase are essential for CPS3 biosynthesis, whereas both, galU and the 3′-truncated gene pgm are not required due to the presence of homologues elsewhere in the genome. The DNA sequence of cps3Taï diverged considerably from those of other cps3 loci. Also, the gene pgmTaï represents a full length version with a nonsense mutation at codon 179. The two genes ugdTaï and wchETaï including the promoter region were transformed into a nonencapsulated laboratory strain S. pneumoniae R6. Transformants which expressed type 3 capsule polysaccharide were readily obtained, documenting that the gene products are functional. In summary, the data indicate that cps3Taï evolved independent from other cps3 loci, suggesting the presence of specialized serotype 3 S. pneumoniae clones endemic to the Taï National Park area."
https://openalex.org/W2021432467,"Hepatitis B virus envelope glycoproteins Large (L), Middle (M) and Small (S) are targets of the host cellular immune system. The extent to which the host recognizes viral antigens presented by infected cells is believed to play a decisive role in determining if an infection will be resolved or become chronic. As with other antigens, HBV envelope polypeptides must be degraded, presumably by cellular proteasomes, to be presented by the MHC I pathway. We have used M as a model to study this process and determine how ER quality control monitors these foreign polymeric proteins and disposes of them through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Using both wild type and mutant HBV M protein, we found that unlike most ERAD substrates, which require ubiquitination for retrotranslocation and degradation, the HBV M protein, which only contains two lysine residues, can undergo rapid and complete, ubiquitin independent, proteasome dependent degradation. The utilization of this pathway had a functional consequence, since proteins degraded through it, were poorly presented via MHC I. To test the hypothesis that the level of ubiquitination, independent of protein degradation, controls the level of antigen presentation, we inserted two additional lysines into both the wild type and mutant M protein. Amazingly, while the addition of the lysine residues dramatically increased the level of ubiquitination, it did not alter the rate of degradation. However and remarkably, the increased ubiquitination was associated with a dramatic increase in the level of antigen presentation. In conclusion, using the HBV surface protein as a model, we have identified a novel ubiquitin independent degradation pathway and determined that this pathway can have implications for antigen presentation and potentially viral pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970672052,"We tested the principle of treating malignant ovarian tumors by vaccination against their ectopically expressed protein, zona pellucida glycoprotein (ZP) 3, using as the experimental model the granulosa cell tumors that develop in transgenic mice expressing the simian virus 40 T-antigen under the inhibin-α promoter (inhα/Tag). We found high ZP3 expression in granulosa cell tumors of the transgenic mice, in human surface ovarian cancer and granulosa cell lines, and in human granulosa cell tumors and their metastases. Early preventive immunization (between 2 and 5.5 mo of age) of transgenic mice with recombinant human (rh) ZP3 prevented ovarian tumorigenesis, and delayed therapeutic immunization (between 4.5 and 7 mo) reduced weights of existing tumors by 86 and 75%, respectively (P<0.001), compared to vehicle-treated control mice. No objective side effects of the immunizations were observed. Liver metastases were found in nontreated/vehicle-treated controls (n=7/39), but none following active rhZP3 immunizations (n=0/36; P<0.05). Immunization with rhZP3 was highly effective, as demonstrated by the induction of anti-ZP3 antibodies, as well as proliferative responses to the ZP3 antigen. These results signal rhZP3 immunization as a novel strategy to be developed for the immunotherapy of ovarian granulosa cell tumors, as well as for that of other malignancies that may express ZP3."
https://openalex.org/W2011583432,"Millennium Development Goal 4 calls for a reduction in the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, which corresponds to an annual rate of decline of 4.4%. The United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation estimates under-five mortality in every country to measure progress. For the majority of countries, the estimates within a country are based on the assumption of a piece-wise constant rate of decline.This paper proposes an alternative method to estimate under-five mortality, such that the underlying rate of change is allowed to vary smoothly over time using a time series model. Information about the average rate of decline and changes therein is exchanged between countries using a bayesian hierarchical model. Cross-validation exercises suggest that the proposed model provides credible bounds for the under-five mortality rate that are reasonably well calibrated during the observation period. The alternative estimates suggest smoother trends in under-five mortality and give new insights into changes in the rate of decline within countries.The proposed model offers an alternative modeling approach for obtaining estimates of under-five mortality which removes the restriction of a piece-wise linear rate of decline and introduces hierarchy to exchange information between countries. The newly proposed estimates of the rate of decline in under-5 mortality and the uncertainty assessments would help to monitor progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4."
