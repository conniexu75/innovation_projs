Klopsteg [Science 124, 965 (16 Nov. 1956)], the first sentence under the subhead Income taxes and individual giving on page 966 should read: Notwithstanding the apparent unqualified approval by government of the taxpayer's charitable inclinations, expressed by its permission to him to deduct up to 30 percent of his adjusted gross income for legal charities, he failed in 1954 by about billion to take advantage of this exemption. The printed version $20 million was a typographical error."

I t appears t h a t there has been a t remendous improvement in the scientific climate in the U.S.S.R. and that , to a considerable extent, freedom of science has been re-established there. I should like to make it clear t ha t when I refer to Soviet science, I am thinking chiefly of physics, the field in which I work and in which I made most of my observations during m y recent visit to the Soviet Union."
https://openalex.org/W2118938894,"Two corrections should be made in the item ""Blood groups and disease"" [Science 124, 674 (12 Oct. 1956)] which reports a paper on associations between blood groups and disease read to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The three diseases for which the evidence is overwhelming are (i) duodenal ulcer, (ii) gastric ulcer, (iii) cancer of the stomach. As is stated, the ulcers are commoner in persons of group O, and cancer of the stomach in persons of group A. There is fairly strong evidence in connection with diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia; but the incidence is raised in group A, not groups O and B. It should perhaps be added that practically all the data so far come from Western Europe and North America, and the associations might be different or absent in other peoples."
