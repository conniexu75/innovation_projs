https://openalex.org/W4281705033,"The development of the digital economy is conducive to the innovative development of foreign trade and the formation of a ""dual circulation"" development pattern in China. Based on the panel data of 285 prefecture-level cities in China from 2005 to 2019, this paper examines the influence of the digital economy on urban export trade and its heterogeneity. And we use a mediating effect model to explore the possible mediating role of technological progress in the above influences. The results find that: (1) The improvement of the digital economy can promote cities export; (2) The promotion of the digital economy to the growth of city export scale is heterogeneous, which is more significant in the western and northeastern cities with relatively remote geographical locations, and the third-tier and lower cities with relatively backward economic development. (3) Technological progress has played a significant role in promoting the growth of export for the digital economy. Thus, it's of great importance for China to increase investment in digital economy infrastructure and pay more attention to the differences in diverse city development processes. It should also support basic research and development in information technology to promote high-quality development of China's foreign trade through the digital economy."

Due to its complexity, our ability to predict which variants disrupt splicing is limited, meaning missed diagnoses for patients. The emergence of machine learning for targeted medicine holds great potential to improve prediction of splice disrupting variants. The recently published SpliceAI algorithm utilises deep neural networks and has been reported to have a greater accuracy than other commonly used methods. Methods and findings The original SpliceAI was trained on splice sites included in primary isoforms combined with novel junctions observed in GTEx data, which might introduce noise and de-correlate the machine learning input with its output. Limiting the data to only validated and manual annotated primary and alternatively spliced GENCODE sites in training may improve predictive abilities. All of these gene isoforms were collapsed (aggregated into one pseudo-isoform) and the SpliceAI architecture was retrained (CI-SpliceAI). Predictive performance on a newly curated dataset of 1,316 functionally validated variants from the literature was compared with the original SpliceAI, alongside MMSplice, MaxEntScan, and SQUIRLS. Both SpliceAI algorithms outperformed the other methods, with the original SpliceAI achieving an accuracy of ∼91%, and CI-SpliceAI showing an improvement at ∼92% overall. Predictive accuracy increased in the majority of curated variants. Conclusions We show that including only manually annotated alternatively spliced sites in training data improves prediction of clinically relevant variants, and highlight avenues for further performance improvements."
https://openalex.org/W4281613630,"In the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we collected data (N = 1,420) from Portugal and Spain in relation to personality (i.e., Dark Triad traits, Big Five traits, religiousness, and negative affect) and attitudes related to COVID-19 about its origins, opinions on how to deal with it, and fear of it. The most pervasive patterns we found were: (1) neurotic-type dispositions were associated with stronger opinions about the origins of the virus and leave people to have more fear of the virus but also more trust in tested establishments to provide help. (2): religious people were less trusting of science, thought prayer was answer, and attributed the existence of the virus to an act of God. We also found that sex differences and country differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 were mediate by sex/country differences in personality traits like emotional stability, religiousness, and negative affect. For instance, women reported more fear of COVID-19 than men did, and this was verified by women’s greater tendency to have negative affect and low emotional stability relative to men. Results point to the central role of neuroticism in accounting for variance in broad-spectrum attitudes towards COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4281693284,"Green roof systems, aimed at reducing anthropic impact on the environment, are considered environmental mitigation technologies and adopted by many countries across the world to strengthen urban ecosystem services. This study evaluates two mixtures of succulent: one of Crassulaceae and the other of Aizoaceae , used in the creation of a continuous and homogenous plant groundcover in Mediterranean environments. To assess the species mixtures, the parameters plant height, growth index, cover percentage and flowering were observed. Hydrological observations were also carried out to evaluate the rainfall retained by the test system in any given month. All data were subjected to analysis of variance. Growth indicators in the study showed trends characteristic of xeric plants, which tend to slow down in dry, summer climate conditions to the point of halting plant vertical growth and ground cover development completely. The Aizocaeae mix, during the initial stage, showed prevalent horizontal growth, confirmed by greater a greater growth index (13,21) and cover percentage (45%) compared to Sedum (Growth index: 3,61; Cover: 36%). In contrast, the Sedum mix recorded greater vertical growth at the beginning ( Sedum mixture: 7.53 cm; Aizoaceae mixture: 6,11 cm). During the final stages of observations, however, greater vertical growth in the Aizoaceae (7,88 cm) became apparent together with a recovery in horizontal growth in the Sedum (79%), albeit not sufficient to outperform the Aizoaceae mixture (87%). Flowering in the two mixtures occurred between late spring and late summer. The Sedum mixture guaranteed a longer flowering period (130 days) compared to the Aizoaceae (93 days), with a gradual start followed by steady flower emission. Regarding rainfall water retention, a comparison of the mixtures in late winter/early spring revealed that the Sedum performed best (44.9 L m 2 vs 37.4 L m 2 ), whilst the Aizoaceae outperformed the Sedum in Autumn (63 L m 2 vs 55 L m 2 ), in conjunction with favorable growth rates in both species mixtures. Both mixtures demonstrated satisfying results and are considered suited to a Mediterranean environment. Furthermore, based on the different growth rates of the species in the two test mixtures, this study suggests that new combinations of Sedum and Aizoaceae together might prove more resilient in Mediterranean environments."
https://openalex.org/W4281941944,"Introduction Few studies have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). We estimated the prevalence and severity of psychological distress and characterized predisposing risk factors among HCWs in KSA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 1,985 HCWs from 6 hospitals across the country designated with caring for COVID-19 patients between April 16 and June 21, 2020. Our data analysis was performed using logistic regressions. Ordered logistic regressions were also performed using forward stepwise model selection to explore the effects of risk factors on psychological distress. Results The prevalence of psychological distress reported by HCWs in KSA was high, ranging from mild-moderate to severe in severity. Younger HCWs, women, those in contact with COVID-19 patients, and those who either had loved ones affected or who were themselves affected by COVID-19 were the most at-risk of psychological distress. Risk factors such as insomnia, loneliness, fear of transmission, and separation from loved ones most significantly predicted elevated levels of distress among HCWs. Conclusions Increasing psychological distress was commonly reported by HCWs during the early months of COVID-19 pandemic in KSA. Public health policy makers and mental health professionals must give special attention to risk factors that predispose HCWs in KSA to psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4281634271,"Eimeria (E . ) maxima is one of the most pathogenic Eimeria spp persistently invading the middle jejunum and ileum, damaging the intestinal mucosa of chickens. Heat stress (HS) is a common stressor and equally contributes to inflammation and oxidative stress. We investigated the effect of E . maxima infection and HS on ileal digestibility, mRNA expression of nutrient transporters, and ileal tissue morphology in broiler chickens. There were four treatment groups: thermoneutral control (TNc), thermoneutral infected (TNi), heat stress control (HSc), and heat stress infected (HSi), 6 replicates each of 10 birds per treatment. Chickens were fed a diet containing 0.2% TiO 2 . At 6-day-post infection, ileal content and tissue were collected to quantify ileal digestibility of crude protein and fat, mRNA levels of nutrient transporters and histopathology. Growth and feed intake were reduced in all treatment groups, compared with the TNc. Contrary to expectation, the combination of two major stressors ( E . maxima and HS) in the TNi group exhibited almost normal digestibility while only the TNi birds expressed severe digestibility depression, compared with the TNc group. The TNi group showed the lowest mRNA expression of the transporters: SGLT1, GLUT2-5-8-10-12, FABP1-2-6, and PEPT1 compared with the other treatment groups. The expression of the absorptive enterocytes’ gene markers (ACSL5, IAP, and SGLT1) supported by the ileal tissue morphology indicated that the TNi group had the highest enterocytic destruction. The expression of oxidative genes (iNOS and CYBB) dramatically increased only in the TNi group compared with the other treatment groups. Our results showed that exposing broiler chickens to HS can mitigate the disruptive effect of E . maxima on the ileal digestibility and absorption by limiting the parasite-induced tissue injury and suppressing the enterocytic inducible oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W4281641842,"In the present study, white (Baegilmi), brown (hyunmi) and black (chalheugmi) Korean local rice varieties ethanol extracts were analyzed for in-vitro antioxidant assays (ABTS, FRAP and DPPH), cellular antioxidant activities (CAAs) and phenolic phytochemicals content. The highest antioxidant assays, phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanins content were identified among the free fractions of black rice. Phenolic phytochemicals were detected and quantified using the ultra-high-performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS2). Which indicated the richness of several phytochemicals like ascorbic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, catechin, epigallocatechin and quercetin in black rice than in other rice samples. The cellular antioxidant activities (CAA) of black rice were found equivalent to that of ascorbic acid, the standard employed in the assay. The CAAs of free fractions were as follows: white rice < brown rice < black rice. These findings are significant for enhancing human health through increased consumption of black and brown rice in the development of functional food products."
https://openalex.org/W4281779509,"The genetic diversity and genetic structure of P . armeniaca var. ansu were analyzed based on SSR markers. The aim was to provide scientific basis for conservation, efficient utilization, molecular marker assisted breeding and improved variety selection of P . armeniaca var. ansu germplasm resources. The results showed that the level of genetic diversity within the population was high. Among the 30 SSR markers, the mean number of observed alleles was 11.433, the mean number of effective alleles was 4.433, the mean of Shannon information index was 1.670, and the mean of polymorphic information content was 0.670. Among the eight provenances, Tuanjie Township, Xinyuan County, Xinjiang had the highest genetic diversity. The observed alleles, effective alleles, Shannon information index and Nei’s gene diversity index among provenances were higher than those within provenances. Based on Bayesian mathematical modeling and UPGMA cluster analysis, 86 P . armeniaca var. ansu accessions were divided into three subpopulations and four groups, which reflected individual differences in provenances. Subpopulations classified by Bayesian mathematical modeling and groups classified by UPGMA cluster analysis were significantly correlated with geographical provenance (Sig&lt;0.01) and the provenances significantly impacted classification of groups. The provenances played an important role in classification of groups. The genetic distance between Tuanjie Township of Xinyuan County and Alemale Township of Xinyuan County was the smallest, while the genetic relationship between them was the closest and the degree of genetic differentiation was small."
https://openalex.org/W4281851458,"The physiology and pathophysiology of the exocrine pancreas are in close connection to changes in intra-cellular Ca2+ concentration. Most of our knowledge is based on in vitro experiments on acinar cells or acini enzymatically isolated from their surroundings, which can alter their structure, physiology, and limit our understanding. Due to these limitations, the acute pancreas tissue slice technique was introduced almost two decades ago as a complementary approach to assess the morphology and physiology of both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas in a more conserved in situ setting. In this study, we extend previous work to functional multicellular calcium imaging on acinar cells in tissue slices. The viability and morphological characteristics of acinar cells within the tissue slice were assessed using the LIVE/DEAD assay, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence imaging. The main aim of our study was to characterize the responses of acinar cells to stimulation with acetylcholine and compare them with responses to cerulein in pancreatic tissue slices, with special emphasis on inter-cellular and inter-acinar heterogeneity and coupling. To this end, calcium imaging was performed employing confocal microscopy during stimulation with a wide range of acetylcholine concentrations and selected concentrations of cerulein. We show that various calcium oscillation parameters depend monotonically on the stimulus concentration and that the activity is rather well synchronized within acini, but not between acini. The acute pancreas tissue slice represents a viable and reliable experimental approach for the evaluation of both intra- and inter-cellular signaling characteristics of acinar cell calcium dynamics. It can be utilized to assess many cells simultaneously with a high spatiotemporal resolution, thus providing an efficient and high-yield platform for future studies of normal acinar cell biology, pathophysiology, and screening pharmacological substances."
https://openalex.org/W4281889103,"A meteorological drought refers to reduced rainfall conditions and is a great challenge to food security. Information of a meteorological drought in advance is important for taking actions in anticipation of its effects, but this can be difficult for areas with limited or sparse ground observation data available. In this study, a meteorological drought indicator was approached by applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to satellite-based precipitation products from multiple sources. The SPI based meteorological drought analysis was then applied to Java Island, in particular to the largest rice-producing districts of Indonesia. A comparison with ground observation data showed that the satellite products accurately described meteorological drought events in Java both spatially and temporally. Meteorological droughts of the eight largest rice-producing districts in Java were modulated by the natural variations in El Niño and a positive-phase Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The drought severity was found to be dependent on the intensity of El Niño and a positive-phase IOD that occurs simultaneously, while the duration seems to be modulated more by the positive-phase IOD. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of satellite-based precipitation monitoring to predicting meteorological drought conditions several months in advance and preparing for their effects."
https://openalex.org/W4281937805,"Evaluation of surgical skills during minimally invasive surgeries is needed when recruiting new surgeons. Although surgeons' differentiation by skill level is highly complex, performance in specific clinical tasks such as pegboard transfer and knot tying could be determined using wearable EMG and accelerometer sensors. A wireless wearable platform has made it feasible to collect movement and muscle activation signals for quick skill evaluation during surgical tasks. However, it is challenging since the placement of multiple wireless wearable sensors may interfere with their performance in the assessment. This study utilizes machine learning techniques to identify optimal muscles and features critical for accurate skill evaluation. This study enrolled a total of twenty-six surgeons of different skill levels: novice (n = 11), intermediaries (n = 12), and experts (n = 3). Twelve wireless wearable sensors consisting of surface EMGs and accelerometers were placed bilaterally on bicep brachii, tricep brachii, anterior deltoid, flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), and thenar eminence (TE) muscles to assess muscle activations and movement variability profiles. We found features related to movement complexity such as approximate entropy, sample entropy, and multiscale entropy played a critical role in skill level identification. We found that skill level was classified with highest accuracy by i) ECU for Random Forest Classifier (RFC), ii) deltoid for Support Vector Machines (SVM) and iii) biceps for Naïve Bayes Classifier with classification accuracies 61%, 57% and 47%. We found RFC classifier performed best with highest classification accuracy when muscles are combined i) ECU and deltoid (58%), ii) ECU and biceps (53%), and iii) ECU, biceps and deltoid (52%). Our findings suggest that quick surgical skill evaluation is possible using wearables sensors, and features from ECU, deltoid, and biceps muscles contribute an important role in surgical skill evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4281619770,"The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is composed of a population of stem cells giving rise to the aboveground parts of plants. It maintains itself by controlling the balance of cell proliferation and specification. Although knowledge of the mechanisms maintaining the SAM has been accumulating, the processes of cellular specification to form leaves and replenishment of unspecified cells in the SAM during a plastochron (the time interval between which two successive leaf primordia are formed) is still obscure. In this study, we developed a method to quantify the number of specified and unspecified cells in the SAM and used it to elucidate the dynamics of cellular specification in the SAM during a plastochron in rice. OSH1 is a KNOX (KNOTTED1-like homeobox) gene in rice that is expressed in the unspecified cells in the SAM, but not in specified cells. Thus, we could visualize and count the nuclei of unspecified cells by fluorescent immunohistochemical staining with an anti-OSH1 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate detection. By double-staining with propidium iodide (which stains all nuclei) and then overlaying the images, we could also detect and count the specified cells. By using these measurements in combination with morphological observation, we defined four developmental stages of SAM that portray cellular specification and replenishment of unspecified cells in the SAM during a plastochron. In addition, through the analysis of mutant lines with altered size and shape of the SAM, we found that the number of specified cells destined to form a leaf primordium is not affected by mild perturbations of meristem size and shape. Our study highlights the dynamism and flexibility in stem cell maintenance in the SAM during a plastochron and the robustness of plant development."
https://openalex.org/W4281622134,"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune systemic chronic inflammatory disorder, which is characterized by joint stiffness, damage, and destruction of bone. In RA patients, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased by 2–3 folds as compared to the general population. The major burden of RA is the development of cardiovascular diseases, including congestive heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Objectives Assessment of the association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein to evaluate CVD risk was one of the purposes of this study. In addition, the association of atherogenic indices with elevated levels of cardiovascular risk factors (LDL-C and TG) was another aim of this study. Methods The preferred study design for this study was a hospital based comparative cross-sectional study method. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi Data version 4.6 software, and exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis of atherogenic indices, C-reactive protein, and risk factors. The comparison of atherogenic indices and other variables among the case and control groups was estimated by the independent t-test statistical analysis method. All variables with a p-value less than 0.2 during binary linear regression analysis were selected for multinomial logistic regression analysis. The association of atherogenic indices with C-reactive protein and risk factors was computed using multiple logistic regressions. The data were presented using tables and figures for clarification of the study. Results The levels of atherogenic indices were computed for both RA patients and the control group. The values of atherogenic indices were significantly associated with cardiovascular risk factor (CRP ≥ 2mg/L). Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and TC/HDL-C ratio had a statistically significant association with an elevated levels of triglycerides (P&lt;0.01). The TC/HDL-Cratio value of the patient had 2.38 folds more likely to have an elevated low density lipoprotein level. In addition, AIP of RA patients had 57.51 and 23.65 folds more to have elevated low density lipoprotein and triglycerides respectively. Conclusions The result of this study showed that TC/HDL-C, LDL/HDL-C ratio values, and atherogenic index of plasma had a statistically significant association with elevated level of low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. In addition to this, they have a statistically significant association with the level of C-reactive protein. There was a highly significant statistical association between atherogenic indices, elevated low density lipoprotein, and triglycerides values. Therefore, the result of this finding confirmed that atherogenic indices have a potential role in the prediction and management of CVD risk in RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281625449,"Human-robot collaboration is the key component of the fourth industrial revolution concept. Workers' willingness to collaborate with industrial robots is a basic requirement for an efficient and effective interaction. The roles of human-robot trust and technology affinity as mediators in the relationship between robot usability and worker willingness were analyzed in this study. As other critical variables, the mediator roles of Age and STARA were also calculated.This study included 400 workers from a car company who interacted with industrial robots in their daily work activities. After examining the questionnaires' validity and reliability, the main variables were determined to be willingness to use robots and robot usability. AMOS software also considered human-robot trust and worker technology affinity as mediators. The bootstrapping method was used to evaluate indirect relationships. A set of goodness-of-fit indices were presented to determine the adequacy of the goodness of fit between the proposed model and the data.Based on model fit indices, an overall satisfactory model fit was obtained for the direct/indirect relationship between robot usability and worker willingness to use it (with mediating role of human-robot trust). Workers' age and fear of Smart Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Algorithms (STARA) were identified as moderators in the relationship between usability and willingness.Attention to the robot usability and the role of workers' trust in robots appears to be required to ensure workers' willingness to use robots and the success of human-robot collaboration in future workplaces. As the workers age and their fear of robots grows, usability can play a larger role in increasing their willingness to put robots to work."
https://openalex.org/W4281732241,"Distinguishing fire from non-fire objects in night videos is problematic if only spatial features are to be used. Those features are highly disrupted under low-lit environments because of several factors, such as the dynamic range limitations of the cameras. This makes the analysis of temporal behavior of night-time fire indispensable for classification. To this end, a BLSTM based night-time wildfire event detection from a video algorithm is proposed. It is shown in the experiments that the proposed algorithm attains 95.15% of accuracy when tested against a wide variety of actual recordings of night-time wildfire incidents and 23.7 ms per frame detection time. Moreover, to pave the way for more targeted solutions to this challenging problem, experiment-based thorough investigations of possible sources of incorrect predictions and discussion of the unique nature of night-time wildfire videos are presented in the paper."
https://openalex.org/W4281751946,"The outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020 had a significant impact on China's economy, society, and citizens; it also had a negative impact on the development of the construction industry. In particular, small and medium-sized construction enterprises with low ability to withstand risk have been strongly impacted, aggravating a crisis of survival among these firms. The focus of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the growth of small and medium-sized construction companies. Based on the characteristics of small and medium-sized construction enterprises, this paper establishes a growth evaluation index and builds a growth evaluation model based on factor analysis. Twenty-three construction enterprises listed on small and medium-sized enterprises board are selected as samples, and the quarterly data of 2019 and 2020 are used for empirical analysis. The results show that the epidemic has had a high short-term impact on construction enterprises, and the total output value of the construction industry in the first quarter of 2020 was 16% lower than that in the same period of last year. In the long run, the impact of the epidemic on the growth of small and medium-sized construction enterprises has been limited. In the first quarter of 2020, the growth score of enterprises decreased by only 1.95% year-over-year, and it was essentially flat in the second and third quarters. The epidemic has had little influence on solvency, tangible resources or intangible resources but a high short term influence on profitability, capital expansion and market expectations. The long-term impact is small; It is conducive to the improvement of enterprise operation ability. Finally, to both address the influence of the COVID-19 on small and medium-sized construction enterprises and to realize their transformation and upgrading, targeted suggestions are offered at the policy and enterprise levels. The results will help to understand the impact of the epidemic on the growth of construction enterprises, and provide decision support for the healthy and orderly development of the follow-up construction industry."

Understanding drivers of HIV acquisition in recently completed, prospective studies in which HIV was an endpoint may help inform the strategy and investments in national HIV prevention efforts and guide the design of future HIV prevention trials. We assessed HIV incidence and correlates of incidence among women enrolled in ECHO (Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes), a large, open-label randomized clinical trial that compared three highly effective. reversible methods of contraception and rates of HIV acquisition.During December 2015 to October 2018, ECHO followed sexually active, HIV-seronegative women, aged 16-35 years, seeking contraceptive services and willing to be randomized to one of three contraceptive methods (intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, copper intrauterine device, or levonorgestrel implant) for 12-18 months at nine sites in South Africa. HIV incidence based on prospectively observed HIV seroconversion events. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to define baseline cofactors related to incident HIV infection.5768 women were enrolled and contributed 7647 woman-years of follow-up. The median age was 23 years and 62.5% were ≤24 years. A total of 345 incident HIV infections occurred, an incidence of 4.51 per 100 woman-years (95%CI 4.05-5.01). Incidence was >3 per 100 woman-years at all sites. Age ≤24 years, baseline infection with sexually transmitted infections, BMI≤30, and having new or multiple partners in the three months prior to enrollment were associated with incident HIV.HIV incidence was high among South African women seeking contraceptive services. Integration of diagnostic management of sexually transmitted infections alongside delivery of HIV prevention options in health facilities providing contraception services are needed to mitigate ongoing risks of HIV acquisition for this vulnerable population.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02550067 was the main Clinical Trial from which this secondary, non-randomized / observational analysis was derived with data limited to just South African sites."
https://openalex.org/W4282032131,"Synthetic lethality in DNA repair pathways is an important strategy for the selective treatment of cancer cells without harming healthy cells and developing cancer-specific drugs. The synthetic lethal interaction between the mismatch repair (MMR) protein, MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), and the mitochondrial base excision repair protein, DNA polymerase γ (Pol γ) was used in this study for the selective treatment of MLH1 deficient cancers. Germline mutations in the MLH1 gene and aberrant MLH1 promoter methylation result in an increased risk of developing many cancers, including nonpolyposis colorectal and endometrial cancers. Because the inhibition of Pol γ in MLH1 deficient cancer cells provides the synthetic lethal selectivity, we conducted a comprehensive small molecule screening from various databases and chemical drug library molecules for novel Pol γ inhibitors that selectively kill MLH1 deficient cancer cells. We characterized these Pol γ inhibitor molecules in vitro and in vivo, and identified 3,3'-[(1,1'-Biphenyl)-4',4'-diyl)bis(azo)]bis[4-amino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid] (congo red; CR; Zinc 03830554) as a high-affinity binder to the Pol γ protein and potent inhibitor of the Pol γ strand displacement and one-nucleotide incorporation DNA synthesis activities in vitro and in vivo. CR reduced the cell proliferation of MLH1 deficient HCT116 human colon cancer cells and suppressed HCT116 xenograft tumor growth whereas it did not affect the MLH1 proficient cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. CR caused mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death by inhibiting Pol γ activity and oxidative mtDNA damage repair, increasing the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative mtDNA damage in MLH1 deficient cells. This study suggests that the Pol γ inhibitor, CR may be further evaluated for the MLH1 deficient cancers' therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4282053886,"Hierarchical modelling is essential to achieving complex, large-scale models. However, not all modelling schemes support hierarchical composition, and correctly mapping points of connection between models requires comprehensive knowledge of each model’s components and assumptions. To address these challenges in integrating biosimulation models, we propose an approach to automatically and confidently compose biosimulation models. The approach uses bond graphs to combine aspects of physical and thermodynamics-based modelling with biological semantics. We improved on existing approaches by using semantic annotations to automate the recognition of common components. The approach is illustrated by coupling a model of the Ras-MAPK cascade to a model of the upstream activation of EGFR. Through this methodology, we aim to assist researchers and modellers in readily having access to more comprehensive biological systems models."

https://openalex.org/W4281733042,"The feature ranking method of machine learning is applied to investigate the feature ranking and network properties of 21 world stock indices. The feature ranking is the probability of influence of each index on the target. The feature ranking matrix is determined by using the returns of indices on a certain day to predict the price returns of the next day using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. We find that the North American indices influence others significantly during the global financial crisis, while during the European sovereign debt crisis, the significant indices are American and European. The US stock indices dominate the world stock market in most periods. The indices of two Asian countries (India and China) influence remarkably in some periods, which occurred due to the unrest state of these markets. The networks based on feature ranking are constructed by assigning a threshold at the mean of the feature ranking matrix. The global reaching centrality of the threshold network is found to increase significantly during the global financial crisis. Finally, we determine Shannon entropy from the probabilities of influence of indices on the target. The sharp drops of entropy are observed during big crises, which are due to the dominance of a few indices in these periods that can be used as a measure of the overall distribution of influences. Through this technique, we identify the indices that are influential in comparison to others, especially during crises, which can be useful to study the contagions of the global stock market."
https://openalex.org/W4281746980,"The interplay between science and society takes place through a wide range of intertwined relationships and mutual influences that shape each other and facilitate continuous knowledge flows. Stylised consequentialist perspectives on valuable knowledge moving from public science to society in linear and recursive pathways, whilst informative, cannot fully capture the broad spectrum of value creation possibilities. As an alternative we experiment with an approach that gathers together diverse science-society interconnections and reciprocal research-related knowledge processes that can generate valorisation. Our approach to value creation attempts to incorporate multiple facets, directions and dynamics in which constellations of scientific and societal actors generate value from research. The paper develops a conceptual model based on a set of nine value components derived from four key research-related knowledge processes: production, translation, communication, and utilization. The paper conducts an exploratory empirical study to investigate whether a set of archetypes can be discerned among these components that structure science-society interconnections. We explore how such archetypes vary between major scientific fields. Each archetype is overlaid on a research topic map, with our results showing the distinctive topic areas that correspond to different archetypes. The paper finishes by discussing the significance and limitations of our results and the potential of both our model and our empirical approach for further research."
https://openalex.org/W4281759962,"The very similar appearance of pollen of the New Zealand Myrtaceous taxa Leptospermum scoparium s.l. (mānuka) and Kunzea spp. (kānuka) has led palynologists to combine them in paleoecological and melissopalynological studies. This is unfortunate, as differentiation of these taxa would improve understanding of past ecological change and has potential to add value to the New Zealand honey industry, where mānuka honey attracts a premium price. Here, we examine in detail the pollen morphology of the 10 Kunzea species and a number of Leptospermum scoparium morphotypes collected from around New Zealand, using light microscopy, SEM, and Classifynder (an automated palynology system). Our results suggest that at a generic level the New Zealand Leptospermum and Kunzea pollen can be readily differentiated, but the differences between pollen from the morphotypes of Leptospermum or between the species of Kunzea are less discernible. While size is a determinant factor-equatorial diameter of Leptospermum scoparium pollen is 19.08 ± 1.28 μm, compared to 16.30 ± 0.95 μm for Kunzea spp.-other criteria such as surface texture and shape characteristics are also diagnostic. A support vector machine set up to differentiate Leptospermum from Kunzea pollen using images captured by the Classifynder system had a prediction accuracy of ~95%. This study is a step towards future melissopalynological differentiation of mānuka honey using automated pollen image capture and classification approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4281874150,"The Megha Health Insurance Scheme (MHIS) was launched in 2013 in the North-East Indian state of Meghalaya to reduce household out-of-pocket expenditure on health and provide access to high-quality essential healthcare. Despite substantial expansion of the MHIS since the scheme's inception, there is a lack of comprehensive documentation and evaluation of the scheme's performance against its Universal Health Care (UHC) objectives.We analysed six years of enrolment and claims data (2013-2018) covering three phases of the scheme to understand the pattern of enrolment, utilisation and care provision under the MHIS during this period. De-identified data files included information on age, sex, district of residence, the district of provider hospital, type of hospital, date of admission, status at discharge, claimed category of care, package codes, and amount claimed. Descriptive statistics were generated to investigate key trends in enrolment, service utilisation, and Government health spending under the MHIS.Approximately 55% of the eligible population are currently enrolled in MHIS. Enrolment increased consistently from phase I through III and remained broadly stable across districts, gender, age group and occupation categories, with a small decline in males 19-60 years. Claims were disproportionately skewed towards private provision; 57% of all claims accrued to the 18 empanelled private hospitals and 39% to the 159 public sector facilities. The package 'General Ward Unspecified' was responsible for the highest volume of claims and highest financial dispensation across all three phases of the scheme. This likely indicates substantial administrative error and is potentially masking both true burden of disease and accurate financial provision for care under the MHIS. Anti-rabies injections for dog/cat bite contributed to 11% of total claims under MHIS III, and 1.6% of all claims under MHIS II. This warrants investigation to better understand the burden of animal bites on the Meghalayan population and inform the implementation of cost-effective strategies to reduce this burden.This paper describes the first analysis of health insurance enrolment and claims data in the state of Meghalaya. The analysis has generated an important evidence base to inform future MHIS enrolment and care provision policies as the scheme expands to provide Universal Health Coverage to the state's entire population."
https://openalex.org/W4281956750,"Although a wide range of intervention programs and methods have been implemented to increase health professionals' (HPs) adherence with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and decrease the incidence of healthcare associated infections (HAIs), a significant discrepancy remains between the guidelines and their implementation in practice.This study proposes an applied tool based on the integrated theoretical framework of the positive deviance (PD) approach for developing more effective interventions to mitigate this discrepancy.A qualitative study guided by the PD approach based on data from two sources: (1) in-depth archival analysis of systematic review articles, and (2) integration and synthesis of findings based on an extensive empirical study we conducted, involving 250 HPs (nurses, physicians, support staff and cleaning staff) from three governmental hospitals in Israel, over 35 months (January 2017 to November 2020).The barriers faced by HPs were classified into four main categories: (1) individual-motivational, (2) social-cultural, (3) organizational, and (4) work environment and resource-centered. For each barrier, we constructed a set of questions based on the PD approach. For each question, we adapted and applied methodological tools (e.g., in-depth interviews, focus groups, social network maps, video clips and simulations) to help solve the problem.Translating a theory-based approach into an applied tool that offers step-by-step actions can help researchers and practitioners adopt and implement the approach within intervention programs to mitigate barriers."
https://openalex.org/W4281966530,"Sleep disturbance has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study examined the course of sleep disturbance and associated factors in patients with ACS who were followed for one year.Study participants were 180 patients (mean age 59.6 years, 81.7% men) with ACS admitted to a tertiary hospital to undergo acute coronary intervention. Sleep disturbance was interviewer-assessed at admission (n = 180), at 3 months (n = 146), and at 12 months (n = 101) using the Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS)-4, with a total of 414 assessments over one year. Random linear mixed regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic factors, cardiac diseases severity, perceived distress during ACS, comorbidities, medication, health behaviors, and sleep disturbance over time.At admission, 3 months, and 12 months, 56.7%, 49.3%, and 49.5% of patients, respectively, scored above the mean value for sleep disturbance in the general population (JSS-4 score ≥5). There was a significant decrease in continuous JSS-4 scores over time [estimate (SE) = -0.211 (0.074), p = 0.005]. Female sex [0.526 (0.206), p = 0.012], greater fear of dying [0.074 (0.026), p = 0.004], helplessness during ACS [0.062 (0.029), p = 0.034], and a history of depression [0.422 (0.171), p = 0.015] were independently associated with higher JSS-4 scores over time.Despite a decrease from admission to 3 months, sleep disturbance is prevalent in the first year after ACS. Female sex, depression history, and distress during ACS identify patients at increased risk of developing persistent sleep disturbance and may inform interventions to prevent sleep disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W4282019809,"Previous investigations on valgus knee bracing have mostly used the external knee adduction moment. This is a critical limitation, as the external knee adduction moment does not account for muscle forces that contribute substantially to the medial tibiofemoral contact force (MTCF) during walking. The aims of this pilot study were to: 1) determine the effect of a valgus knee brace on MTCF; 2) determine whether the effect is more pronounced after 8 weeks of brace use; 3) assess the feasibility of an 8-week brace intervention.Participants with medial radiographic knee OA and varus malalignment were fitted with an Össur Unloader One© brace. Participants were instructed to wear the brace for 8 weeks. The MTCF was estimated via an electromyogram-assisted neuromuscular model with and without the knee brace at week 0 and week 8. Feasibility outcomes included change in symptoms, quality of life, confidence, acceptability, adherence and adverse events.Of the 30 (60% male) participants enrolled, 28 (93%) completed 8-week outcome assessments. There was a main effect of the brace (p<0.001) on peak MTCF and MTCF impulse, but no main effect for time (week 0 and week 8, p = 0.10), and no interaction between brace and time (p = 0.62). Wearing the brace during walking significantly reduced the peak MTCF (-0.05 BW 95%CI [-0.10, -0.01]) and MTCF impulse (-0.07 BW.s 95%CI [-0.09, -0.05]). Symptoms and quality of life improved by clinically relevant magnitudes over the 8-week intervention. Items relating to confidence and acceptability were rated relatively highly. Participants wore the brace on average 6 hrs per day. Seventeen participants reported 30 minor adverse events over an 8-week period.Although significant, reductions in the peak MTCF and MTCF while wearing the knee brace were small. No effect of time on MTCF was observed. Although there were numerous minor adverse events, feasibility outcomes were generally favourable.Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (12619000622101)."
https://openalex.org/W4281617934,"Evaluating novel compounds for neuroprotective effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a protracted, labor-intensive and costly effort. However, the present lack of effective treatment options for TBI, despite decades of research, shows the critical need for alternative methods for screening new drug candidates with neuroprotective properties. Because natural products have been a leading source of new therapeutic agents for human diseases, we used an in vitro model of stretch injury to rapidly assess pro-survival effects of three bioactive compounds, two isolated from natural products (clovanemagnolol [CM], vinaxanthone [VX]) and the third, a dietary compound (pterostilbene [PT]) found in blueberries. The stretch injury experiments were not used to validate drug efficacy in a comprehensive manner but used primarily, as proof-of-principle, to demonstrate that the neuroprotective potential of each bioactive agent can be quickly assessed in an immortalized hippocampal cell line in lieu of comprehensive testing in animal models of TBI. To gain mechanistic insights into potential molecular mechanisms of neuroprotective effects, we performed a pathway-specific PCR array analysis of the effects of CM on the rat hippocampus and microRNA sequencing analysis of the effects of VX and PT on cultured hippocampal progenitor neurons. We show that the neuroprotective properties of these natural compounds are associated with altered expression of several genes or microRNAs that have functional roles in neurodegeneration or cell survival. Our approach could help in quickly assessing multiple natural products for neuroprotective properties and expedite the process of new drug discovery for TBI therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4281629424,"Cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer in Ghana. The disease and its treatment significantly affect survivors' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We determined the overall quality of life (QoL) and identified its predictors among cervical cancer survivors after treatment.A hospital-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 153 disease-free cervical cancer survivors who completed curative treatment between January 2004 and December 2018 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana. We used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core-30 item (EORTC QLQ-C30) and cervical cancer module (EORTC QLQ-CX24) to assess the survivors' overall QoL. QoL domain scores were dichotomised as affected or unaffected by disease and its treatment. Significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups within each QoL domain were determined using the student T-test. We used Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests to examine the difference in QoL domains between treatment types, with significance based on Bonferroni corrections. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of overall QoL. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.One hundred and fifty-three (153) women having a mean age of 58.3 (SD 11.4) years were studied. The overall QoL score was 79.6 (SD 16.0), and 74.5% of survivors reported good QoL score within the median follow up time of 41.8 months (interquartile range [IQR], 25.5-71.1 months) after cervical cancer diagnosis. Although the majority (66.0-84.3%) of the QoL functioning scale were unaffected, about a fifth (22.2%) to a third (34.5%) of the subjects had perceptual impairment in cognitive and role functioning. Financial difficulties, peripheral neuropathy and pain were most common symptoms reported as affected. A third of the survivors were worried that sex would be painful, and 36.6% indicated that their sexual activity as affected. The overall QoL scores for survivors who had surgery, chemoradiation and radiation-alone were 86.1 (SD 9.7), 76.9 (SD 17.7), and 80.7 (SD 14.7), respectively (p = 0.025). The predictors of survivor's overall QoL were loss of appetite [Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR) = 9.34, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 2.13-35.8, p = 0.001], pain (AOR = 3.53, 95% CI = 1.25-9.31, p = 0.017) and body image (AOR = 5.89, 95% CI = 1.80-19.27, p = 0.003).About 75% of the survivors had a good overall quality of life. Primary surgical treatment affords the best prospects for quality of life with the least symptom complaints and financial burden. Loss of appetite, pain or diminution in body image perception predicted the overall quality of life of cervical cancer survivors after treatment."

We included adults who self-identified their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or asexual/others. Both the exposure and dependent variables were self-reported by the participants. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to determine the association by calculating adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Out of 9760 respondents, more than two-thirds of the participants reported having been discriminated against or having experienced violence at some time in their lives (70.3%) and one-fourth reported having mental health problems (23.8%). In the multivariable regression model, the prevalence of mental health problems in the last 12 months was 72% higher for the group of individuals who experienced discrimination when compared with the group that did not experience discrimination (APR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.57-1.88). The association was stronger among who self-identified lesbians (APR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.65-2.64).The prevalence of mental health problems and discrimination was high in this population. In addition, we found a statistically significant association between discrimination and the occurrence of mental health problems in the last 12 months."

Participants had to be 'fully registered' with the Malaysian Pharmacy Board and work full-time at a community pharmacy.MedReview was developed as a web app. It was validated among 100 community pharmacists from May-July 2021 using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). There was acceptable content validity and fair inter-rater agreement, and good convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in five domains to determine the attitude of pharmacists about using MedReview: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention to use, trust, and personal initiatives and characteristics; the total variance explained by five factors was 76.36%. The survey questionnaire had a high overall reliability value of 0.96. Evaluation of MedReview was based on mean scores of survey items. Of all items included in the survey, the highest mean score (out of 7) was achieved for 'I could use MedReview if it is meaningful/relevant to my daily tasks' (5.78 ± 1.10), followed by 'I could use MedReview if I feel confident that the data returned by MedReview is reliable' (5.77 ± 1.21), and 'I could use MedReview if it protects the privacy of its users' (5.73 ± 1.20).Community pharmacists generally had a positive attitude towards MedReview. They found that MedReview is trustworthy and they had the intention to use it when conducting medication reviews. The adaptation of the TAM in the survey instrument was reliable and internally valid."

This study employs a mixed sequential approach, starting with six focal groups, and finishing with a quantitative validation exercise that uses exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis as well as regression models. Findings reveal that student perception is elicited along three dimensions: concerns related to academic quality, teaching strategies applied by professors, and access limitations. Moderation analysis shows that the relationship between teaching strategies and the concerns related to academic quality varies and that it even gets stronger when access limitations are reduced. Consequently, perception is limited by student access to maintain the teaching-learning process."
https://openalex.org/W4281727126,"Background Unintended pregnancy due to disuse of family planning is the main cause of abortion globally. Women with a history of abortion are at higher risk of developing another unintended pregnancy, which may lead to repeated abortions and life-threatening complications. The immediate post-abortion period before women leave health institutions is a crucial time to provide family planning services. In Ethiopia, many women leave health facilities without using family planning methods. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the utilization of post-abortion family planning and its associated factors in health institutions in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods Facility-based mixed cross sectional study was conducted between April 1 and June 30, 2018. A systematic sampling method was used to select the 408 participants. Seven key informants were selected for in-depth interviews and observations were made using a checklist. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI INFO 3.5.1 and exported to SPSS 21 for cleaning and analysis. Bivariate analysis was employed and a P-value &lt;0.25 was considered for the multivariable analysis. Qualitative data were coded and thematically analyzed to support the quantitative findings. Results Data were obtained from 400 participants (response rate, 98%). The magnitude of post-abortion family planning was 67.3% [95% CI (62.8, 71.8)]. Marital status [AOR 95% CI 3.86(1.9, 7.8)], Good knowledge about post-abortion family planning [AOR 95% CI 2.48(1.22, 5.03)], Non-governmental health facility [AOR 95% CI 6.62(3.47, 12.6)] Counseling [AOR 95% CI 3.6(2.02, 6.4)] and husbands’ support [AOR 95% CI 3.21(1.81–5.7)] were significantly associated with Post-abortion family planning utilization. Conclusion The utilization of post-abortion family planning was low in Wolaita Sodo health institutions. Marital status, knowledge of post-abortion family planning, use of services at non-governmental health facilities, counseling, and husbands’ support were determinants of post-abortion family planning."
https://openalex.org/W4281732992,"Bone metastases in breast cancer patients are a common concern for medical doctors and dentists. Bone-modifying agents, which are necessary to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs), are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw as an adverse side effect. Hypersensitivity to alcohol is an unfavorable response caused by deficiency of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) activity. Inactive ALDH2 is associated with osteoporosis, but its influence on bone metastases is unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of alcohol sensitivity on bone metastases and SREs in primary operable breast cancer patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients who were administered docetaxel, an anti-tumor agent, for histologically diagnosed breast cancer between April 2004 and September 2015. Alcohol sensitivity was assessed based on medical records of hypersensitivity to alcohol. The primary endpoint was time to bone metastases and the secondary endpoint was time to first SRE from the initial docetaxel administration. Data were stratified by alcohol sensitivity and tumor stages, and differences were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic risk factors were analyzed by the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.The median follow-up period of patients with high sensitivity to alcohol (n = 45) was 54 months and that for those with low sensitivity (n = 287) was 64 months. Stratification by alcohol sensitivity revealed that tumor stage exhibited significant correlations with the cumulative incidence of bone metastases in low-sensitivity patients; however, no differences were found in high-sensitivity patients. In multivariate analysis, alcohol sensitivity was a significant prognostic risk factor for bone metastases (HR 2.721, 95% CI 1.268-5.841, P = 0.010).Alcohol sensitivity may be a prognostic risk factor for bone metastases.

https://openalex.org/W4281780459,"Pollen-parent effects on fruit size and quality have been found previously among competing self-pollinated and cross-pollinated fruit on the same Redlands Joy strawberry plant. These effects occur independently of the percentage of fertilized seeds on the fruit, but the expression of these effects on fruit size and some aspects of quality are greatest when calcium is in shortest supply. Here, we aimed to clarify at what developmental stages the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated fruit diverge in size and quality and whether differences between self-pollinated and cross-pollinated fruit are due to early differences in nutrient accumulation. Fruit were harvested at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after hand-pollination and at full ripeness, approximately 4 weeks after hand-pollination. We measured fruit mass, length, diameter, colour, and the concentrations of aluminium, boron, calcium, copper, iron, nitrogen, magnesium, manganese, sodium, phospho-rous, potassium and zinc. Temporary increases in fruit mass, length or diameter due to cross-pollination were evident at 1 or 2 weeks after pollination. Consistent increases in size and skin darkness from cross-pollination emerged in the final week of fruit development. We found little evidence that self-pollinated and cross-pollinated fruit differed in mineral nutrient accumulation at any stage of fruit development. The results demonstrate that cross-pollination effects on strawberry fruit size are evident briefly during early fruit growth but emerge mainly during the final week of fruit development. The effects of cross-pollination on fruit size are not the result of early differences in mineral nutrient accumulation between self-pollinated and cross-pollinated fruit."

This paper analyses the childhood morbidity effects of the Ghana Essential Heath Interventions Program (GEHIP), a community-based health systems strengthening in rural northern Ghana. GEHIP was a five-year embedded implementation science plausibility trial that implemented a set of health systems strengthening strategies and tested the proposition that their combined effect at the district, subdistrict and community levels could foster effective community engagement and thereby improve maternal and child health outcomes.A two stage random sample survey of reproductive-aged women residing in treatment and comparison districts at the GEHIP baseline and end line was used for Heckman Difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models for estimating the incremental effect of GEHIP exposure on three child morbidity conditions (diarrhea, fever and cough), as recalled by maternal respondents in the course of survey interviews.After controlling for child age and gender, maternal age, education, marital status, health insurance status, religion, ethnicity, occupation and household wealth index, regression results show that GEHIP had a statistically significant 45% reduction in fever (OR = 0.55, CI = 0.31-0.98) and 47% reduction in cough (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.30-0.94), over and above temporal reductions that prevailed in study districts. Although not significant, GEHIP also had 38% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea.Previous research has shown that GEHIP had a pronounced positive effect with a reduction in mortality. Our results show that household location in GEHIP districts also led to a significant reduction in morbidity due to cough and fever among under-five children. This association is a likely outcome of GEHIP's impact on the accessibility of primary health care services. Results lend further support to the growing body of evidence that strengthening health systems in rural Africa through the provision of community-based strategies enhances prospects for achieving the United Nations child health SDGs."

Failure to recognize such pre-analytical variables results in the analysis of poor quality specimens and the authorization of spurious test results.To determine the impact of a laboratory staff training workshop on coagulation specimen rejection rates and to ascertain the level of knowledge of laboratory personnel concerning coagulation specimen rejection criteria before and after the workshop.A retrospective three-month audit was performed with rejection data of incorrect blood to additive ratio, clotted, aged and haemolysed specimens collected. Training workshops and evaluation sessions were subsequently presented. A revised standard operating procedure delineating coagulation specimen rejection criteria was implemented and a repeat three-month audit was conducted.In total, 13 162 coagulation specimens were received during the initial audit with 1 104 specimens (8.39%) rejected.

https://openalex.org/W4281644596,"The engineering of switchable or activatable dCas9 proteins would benefit from a single system for both positive and negative selection of dCas9 activity. Most systems that are used to interrogate dCas9 libraries use a fluorescent protein screen or an antibiotic selection for active dCas9 variants. To avoid some of the limitations of these systems, we have developed a single system capable of selecting for either active or inactive dCas9 variants. E. coli expressing active dCas9 variants are isolated in the positive selection system through growth in the presence of ampicillin. The negative selection can isolate cells lacking dCas9 activity through two separate mechanisms: growth in M9 minimal media or growth in media containing streptomycin. This system is capable of enriching for rare dCas9 variants up to 9,000-fold and possesses potential utility in directed evolution experiments to create switchable dCas9 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4281669309,"Telomere length (TL) is widely studied as a possible biomarker for stress-related cellular aging and decreased longevity. There have been conflicting findings about the relationship between family caregiving stress and TL. Several initial cross-sectional studies have found associations between longer duration of caregiving or perceived stressfulness of caregiving and shortened TL, suggesting that caregiving poses grave risks to health. Previous reviews have suggested the need for longitudinal methods to investigate this topic. This study examined the association between the transition to family caregiving and change in TL across ~9 years. Data was utilized from the Caregiving Transitions Study, an ancillary study to the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. TL was assayed using qPCR and analyzed as the telomere-to-single copy gene ratio for each participant at baseline and follow-up. General linear models examined the association between caregiving status and the change in TL for 208 incident caregivers and 205 controls, as well as associations between perceived stress and TL among caregivers. No association was found between TL change and caregiving ( p = 0.494), and fully adjusted models controlling for health and socioeconomic factors did not change the null relationship ( p = 0.305). Among caregivers, no association was found between perceived caregiving stress and change in TL ( p = 0.336). In contrast to earlier cross-sectional studies, this longitudinal, population-based study did not detect a significant relationship between the transition into a family caregiving role and changes in TL over time. Given the widespread citation of previous findings suggesting that caregiving shortens telomeres and places caregivers at risk of early mortality, these results demonstrate the potential need of a more balanced narrative about caregiving."
https://openalex.org/W4281675118,"The depletion of fossil fuels, associated pollution, and resulting health hazards are of concern worldwide. Woody biomass constitutes an alternative source of cleaner and renewable energy. The efficient use of woody biomass depends on xylan depolymerisation as the endo-β-1,4-xylopyranosyl homopolymer is the main component of hemicellulose, the second most abundant component of wood. Xylan depolymerisation is achieved by hemicellulolytic xylanases of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 5, 8, 10, 11, 30 and 43 of the CAZY database. We analysed a multidomain xylanase (Xyl) from the hindgut metagenome of the snouted harvester termite Trinervitermes trinervoides that releases xylobiose and xylotriose from beech and birch xylan and wheat arabinoxylan. The four domains of Xyl include an N-terminal GH11 xylanase domain, two family 36-like carbohydrate-binding domains CBM36-1 and 2, and a C-terminal CE4 esterase domain. Previous analyses indicated that CBM36-1 deletion slightly increased GH11 catalysis at low pH whereas removal of both CBMs decreased xylanase activity at 60°C from 90 to 56%. Possible cooperativity between the domains suggested by these observations was explored. A crystal structure of the two-domain construct, GH11-CBM36-1, confirmed the structure of the GH11 domain whereas the CBM36-1 domain lacked electron density, possibly indicating a random orientation of the CBM36-1 domain around the GH11 domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments similarly did not indicate specific interactions between the individual domains of Xyl supporting a ""beads-on-a-string"" model for Xyl domains."
https://openalex.org/W4281677783,"Cardiovascular diseases associated with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) levels are significant contributors to total mortality in developing and developed countries. Mathematical modeling of LDL metabolism is an important step in the development of drugs for hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this work was to develop and to analyze an integrated mathematical model of cholesterol metabolism in liver cells and its interaction with two types of drugs, statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. The model consisted of 21 ordinary differential equations (ODE) describing cholesterol biosynthesis and lipoprotein endocytosis in liver cells in vitro. The model was tested for its ability to mimic known biochemical effects of familial hypercholesterolemia, statin therapy, and PCSK9 inhibitors. The model qualitatively reproduced the well-known biology of cholesterol regulation, which confirms its potential for minimizing cellular research in initial testing of new drugs for cardiology."
https://openalex.org/W4281697586,"To evaluate the effects of eight weeks of mat Pilates training on selected hematological parameters, i.e. white blood cell, neutrophils, monocyte, lymphocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin as well as plasma volume variations in healthy, active women.Twenty-eight women physical education students volunteered to participate in the present investigation. They were assigned to two groups: a Pilates training group (n = 14) that followed an 8-week Pilates training program, and a control group (n = 14). Blood samples were collected at rest at two separate occasions before and after Pilates training.The Pilates training group had higher values of plasma volume variations and lower values of white blood cell (19.4%), neutrophils (32%), hematocrit (4.3%) and hemoglobin (4.6%) compared to control group (p<0.05).The results of the present study suggested that Pilates training could be an effective strategy for increasing plasma volume variations and boosting immune system in healthy active women."
https://openalex.org/W4281717204,"Snus usage is commonly touted as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking. However, recent studies have demonstrated possible adverse cardiovascular effects in chronic snus users. The present study evaluates the effects of chronic snus use on vascular function by assessing central arterial stiffness and endothelial vasodilatory function in healthy chronic snus users as compared to matched non-users.Fifty healthy males (24 snus users, 26 age-matched controls) with a mean age of 44 years were included in the study. Arterial stiffness was assessed employing both pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis. Endothelial vasodilatory function was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, utilizing intra-arterial administration of acetylcholine, glyceryl trinitrate and bradykinin to further gauge endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatory function. Arterial stiffness was significantly higher in chronic snus users as compared to controls: pulse wave velocity [m/s]: 6.6±0.8 vs 7.1±0.9 resp. (p = 0.026), augmentation index corrected for heart rate [%]: 0.1±13.2 vs 7.3±7.8 resp. (p = 0.023). Endothelial independent vasodilation, i.e. the reaction to glyceryl trinitrate, was significantly lower in snus users as measured by venous occlusion plethysmography.The results of this study show an increased arterial stiffness and an underlying endothelial dysfunction in daily snus users as compared to matched non-tobacco controls. These findings indicate that long-term use of snus may alter the function of the endothelium and therefore reinforces the assertion that chronic snus use is correlated to an increased risk of development of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281729455,"Reform efforts to improve turnout typically focus on reducing the costs of participation or strengthening appeals to civic duty. While these efforts generate modest effects, this paper explores whether citizens might respond to extrinsic rewards to encourage voting. We conduct a field experiment offering lottery prizes to undergraduate students in conjunction with a student government election at a major public university. We find that extrinsic rewards appear to boost voting significantly in these low turnout elections and that the effects of a lottery appear to be especially strong among those of lower socio-economic status."
https://openalex.org/W4281756049,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. Home confinement and movement restrictions can affect lifestyle changes and may lead to non-communicable diseases (NCD). This systematic review will provide a detailed summary of changing patterns of physical activities, diet and sleep among the general public in COVID-19.PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Science Direct, and Scopus will be, among eight bibliographic databases, applied and search work will take one month (from January 2021 until February 2021). Key search terms will include common characteristics of physical activity, dietary pattern, sleeping pattern, and COVID-19. The reviewers will fully apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria framed by PICOS as well as the screening form and the PRISMA flow for selecting the papers eligible for this review. Moreover, the reviewers will use a self-developed excel table to extract the required information on dietary pattern changes, physical activities and sleep patterns changes, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS) for practicing quality assessment. We will include only observational studies and analyze the extracted information qualitatively and the review output will be based on the eligible studies' outcomes.Changes in physical activity, dietary and sleep patterns are challenging to the public health professionals regarding the risk factors for NCD, and long-term effects might impact the controlling of the NCD. Evidence-based research information is needed regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are a few global data on changes in physical activity, dietary and sleep patterns. Furthermore, innovative public health interventions or implementations are needed to maintain the positive health status of the population in the long run as the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.This systematic review is based on a protocol registered with PROSPERO CRD42021232667."
https://openalex.org/W4281762194,"Southern Flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) populations are declining in the Gulf of Mexico basin. This is particularly true in Texas, where this unique and culturally important fishery has been in decline since the 1980s despite increasingly stringent regulatory measures. Current angler-intercept creel surveys used to estimate recreational flounder harvest levels are conducted during daylight hours and do not account for the high levels of nighttime flounder gigging (spearing) activity, a popular and efficient harvest method for this fishery. There are legitimate scientific and logistical concerns that have prevented the use of wide-spread nighttime creel surveys to monitor the flounder gigging fishery in the past, however this has made accurate catch and effort estimates difficult to obtain. Given the concern about this economically important fishery's status, we adopted a unique approach utilizing social media to provide unprecedented information into this fishery's impact during periods that are not traditionally monitored. Specifically, we reconstructed seasonal flounder harvest and effort metrics stemming from the nighttime recreational guided flounder gigging sector over 2.6 years using guided flounder gigging charter photo archives publicly available through Facebook. These metrics show large average client party sizes, large trip harvests, and near-perfect bag limit efficiencies. Temporal trends indicated peak recreational guided flounder gigging effort and harvest occurs during the summer months, a time not traditionally associated with flounder gigging. The addition of nighttime guided-gigging recreational harvest estimates from this study to traditional daytime harvest estimates and commercial harvest estimates resulted in total annual harvest estimates nearly two times greater than current estimates. Overall, this study demonstrates the high pressure guided-gigging charters are placing on Texas' flounder fishery and illustrates the critical need for additional information on the nighttime recreational flounder fishery for both guided and private gigging anglers. Moreover, our results also demonstrate the usefulness of mining social media platforms to capture catch and effort data that are otherwise unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W4282019645,"Live-cell microscopy imaging typically involves the use of high-quality glass-bottom chambers that allow cell culture, gaseous buffer exchange and optical properties suitable for microscopy applications. However, commercial sources of these chambers can add significant annual costs to cell biology laboratories. Consumer products in three-dimensional printing technology, for both Filament Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Masked Stereo Lithography (MSLA), have resulted in more biomedical research labs adopting the use of these devices for prototyping and manufacturing of lab plastic-based items, but rarely consumables. Here we describe a modular, live-cell chamber with multiple design options that can be mixed per experiment. Single reusable carriers and the use of biodegradable plastics, in a hybrid of FDM and MSLA manufacturing methods, reduce plastic waste. The system is easy to adapt to bespoke designs, with concept-to-prototype in a single day, offers significant cost savings to the users over commercial sources, and no loss in dimensional quality or reliability."
https://openalex.org/W4282025844,"A space-dependent mortality assay was performed on thirty-one short-horned adult grasshopper species (Acridoidea: Orthoptera) to estimate the space required for mass culture of acridids in captivity. Our findings show that acridids have a multidimensional mortality mode at different densities. The correlations between density and mortality of acridids in rearing units follow a sigmoidal curve. Acridid mortality significantly increases with individual numbers up to a threshold, after which mortality does not change even if the density increases further. A log-logistic sigmoidal function expresses the dose (density)-response (mortality) relationship in the majority of acridid species. Mortality of acridids at variable densities does not necessarily correspond with the body-mass of the insects, indicating that mortality is a body-mass independent event. As a ready reference, a utility chart has been prepared, providing the necessary conversion factor for estimating space for a given number of acridids. The present information will be helpful for commercial grasshopper farming in captivity."
