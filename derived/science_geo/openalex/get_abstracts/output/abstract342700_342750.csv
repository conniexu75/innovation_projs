https://openalex.org/W2006269710,"Measurement of the long-wave infrared radiation from the top 0.1 mm of the evaporating ocean demonstrates the existence of a cool surface layer characterized by departures of as much as 0.6 degrees C from the ""surface temperature"" found by conventional methods. Being very thin, the layer cools sufficiently rapidly to reestablish itself in less than 12 seconds after disruption by a breaking wave."

https://openalex.org/W2037697866,"Temperature measurements were made at localized sites in bentonite, kaolinite, and small glass beads during infiltration. The temperature of the medium was observed to rise gradually and then to drop sharply as the infiltrating water approached and reached the measurement site. Temperature fluctuations were observed to be about 9°C for bentonite, 4°C for kaolinite, and 0.1°C for the glass beads."

https://openalex.org/W1989537182,"Bacillus megaterium spores have a characteristic polar knob and equatorial ridge, or groove. During germination, the spore case appears to split along this ridge, and thus allows the new cell to emerge. Mechanically ground spores also split along this ridge, one part of the spore case being hinged to the other, the ridge being evident along a free edge. The equatorial ridge appears to be an area of suspectibility to mechanical pressures and, perhaps, in normal germination, to enzymic action as well."

https://openalex.org/W2001184314,An attack by Martesia striata Linnaeus on the lead sheathing of a power cable is described. This is the third such attack recorded and all have occurred in Florida waters. A guide for describing future attacks is recommended with the hope that the specific conditions under which attacks occur can be learned.
