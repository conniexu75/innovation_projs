https://openalex.org/W1582388915,"Approximately 10% of the albumin in normal human serum is modified by nonenzymatic glycosylation, primarily at the epsilon-amino group of lysine residue 525. Incubation of albumin with glucose under physiological conditions in vitro resulted in glycosylation of the same residue. After separation of glycosylated human serum albumin from the nonglycosylated form by boronate affinity chromatography, the fluorescence emission characteristics of the sole tryptophan residue (Trp 214) were monitored. The quantum yield of tryptophan fluorescence for both in vivo and in vitro glycosylated albumin was reduced 30% relative to nonglycosylated albumin, and the maximal wavelength of the fluorescence emission band was shifted to shorter wavelengths. These observations show that nonenzymatic glycosylation induces a conformational change in human serum albumin. Ligand binding properties of glycosylated and unmodified albumin were compared. Hemin affinity was unaltered by glycosylation of albumin in vivo, whereas the affinity of bilirubin for glycosylated albumin was about 50% its value for the nonglycosylated form. The affinity of the long chain fatty acid cis-parinaric acid for albumin glycosylated in vivo and in vitro was reduced approximately 20-fold relative to nonglycosylated albumin. These differences in affinity suggest that lysine 525 plays a key role in the binding of physiologically important ligands to albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1587329961,"A novel siderophore (microbial iron transport compound) has been isolated from low iron cultures of Vibrio cholerae. Belonging to the catecholamide family of chelators, it has been shown to contain three residues of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid and two residues of threonine. Both threonine moieties are present in the form of oxazoline rings. Furthermore, the polyamine backbone of the molecule was proved to be not spermidine, but the rare N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane, norspermidine. The structure of the new siderophore has been determined to be N-[3-(2,3-dihydroxybenzamido)propyl]-1, 3-bis[2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-trans-5-methyl-2-oxazoline-4-carboxamido]prop ane. The compound has been given the trivial name vibriobactin. Mutants defective in the synthesis and utilization of vibriobactin were isolated. In an iron-limited environment V. cholerae was found to respond more strongly to vibriobactin, agrobactin, and ferrichrome than to enterobactin."
https://openalex.org/W1562066535,"The relationship between the intracellular GSSG level and the rate of GSSG release was studied in the isolated perfused heart. GSSG and GSH were released from the heart into the effluent perfusion fluid at rates of 110 and 370 pmol X min-1 X g of heart-1, respectively, much lower than for similar conditions in liver. Perfusion with t-butyl hydroperoxide led to an increase in GSSG release associated with an elevated level of intracellular GSSG. Saturation kinetics was found for the rate of GSSG release with respect to the intracellular GSSG level with an apparent Km value of 30 nmol X g of heart-1 and a maximal rate of 7.5 nmol X min-1 X g of heart-1. The maximal rate of GSSG release was temperature-sensitive with a temperature coefficient of 1.8. When 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was infused during perfusion with t-butyl hydroperoxide, mutual competition was found in the release of GSSG and the glutathione-S-conjugate, S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione. The maximal rate for the glutathione-S-conjugate transport was estimated to be 40 nmol X min-1 X g of heart-1. These results are consistent with the existence of a transport system for GSSG in rat heart, its capacity being substantially lower than that for the S-conjugate in heart and that for GSSG in liver. Thus, the sensitivity of heart to oxidative stress may be explained, in part, by a low capacity of GSSG export."
https://openalex.org/W1604900522,"The distribution of phospholipids across erythrocyte membrane bilayer is asymmetrical. The present study reports the effect of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), a product of fatty acid peroxidation, on the organization of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in human erythrocytes using a nonpermeable bee venom phospholipase A2 and trinitrobenzene-sulfonilic acid. MDA accumulation in the erythrocytes was accomplished both by its increased endogenous generation after exposure of cells to H2O2, as well as by the treatment of erythrocytes with exogenous authentic MDA. The above treatments resulted in a significantly increased movement of PS and PE from inner bilayer to outer bilayer, which had a highly positive correlation with the concentration of MDA in the erythrocyte membranes. Antioxidants vitamin E, butylated hydroxytoluene, and butylated hydroxyanisole inhibited the effect of H2O2 treatment on erythrocyte membrane lipid organization by scavenging fatty acid peroxidation and formation of MDA. Thus, lipid peroxidation and MDA accumulation can disturb organization of PS and PE in the human erythrocyte membrane bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1587506196,"Human neutrophils were fractionated by nitrogen cavitation and Percoll density centrifugation, and the subcellular localization of FAD-flavoprotein, b-cytochrome, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, and NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase were determined in normal cells, cells from two patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and normal cells that had been stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. In normal cells, a FAD-flavoprotein is found in a 1:2 molar ratio, with cytochrome b in the fractions containing the specific granules. Triton X-114 phase distribution indicates that the b-cytochrome but not the b-cytochrome-associated flavoprotein is an integral membrane protein. 80% of this flavoprotein, as well as all the b-cytochrome, was absent in these fractions from 2 CGD patients, although these patients had normal quantities of FAD in the fractions containing plasma membranes and cytosol. During stimulation the b-cytochrome-associated flavoprotein of the granules translocates with the b-cytochrome to the plasma membrane where NADPH oxidase is localized. Definition of the role of these NADPH oxidase constituents may provide a molecular description of the normal neutrophil respiratory burst and the molecular defect(s) in CGD."
https://openalex.org/W1566431186,"An acidic glycoconjugate containing mannose, galactose and phosphate in approximately equimolar amounts was extracted from Leishmania donovani promastigotes and partially characterized. The glycoconjugate could be metabolically labeled with either [3H]mannose or [3H]galactose and was extractable from a delipidated residue fraction with water/ethanol/diethyl ether/pyridine/concentrated NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.017) at 25 degrees C. The radioactively labeled glycoconjugate was found to possess the following characteristics: 1) comprised 45-60% of the total [3H]mannose label incorporated into macromolecules; 2) was soluble in alkaline solvents and 0.5% Triton X-100; 3) migrated as a broad band upon electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an approximate molecular weight of 15,000-30,000; 4) bound to DE52 cellulose and was eluted with a salt gradient of 0-0.1 M NaCl; 5) was insensitive to Pronase, hyaluronidase, chondroitinase, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and endo-beta-galactosidase; and 6) possessed hydrophobic properties. An unusual feature of the glycoconjugate was its lability to mild acid hydrolysis (0.02 N HCl, 15 min, 60 degrees C). As determined by alkaline phosphatase and glycosidase digestion and paper chromatographic analysis, the major fragment generated by mild acid hydrolysis was found to be a phosphorylated galactosyl-beta-mannose disaccharide. All of these characteristics suggest that the glycoconjugate may be a polysaccharide and, possibly, may be important in parasite-host cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1519277389,"Abstract Spleen cells from a BALB/cByJ mouse previously immunized with purified rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450c were fused with myeloma cells (P3X63Ag8.653) and 10 hybridoma clones secreting antibody against cytochrome P-450c were selected for characterization. The monoclonal antibodies (C1-C10) were purified from mouse ascites fluid and nine were determined to be distinct immunoglobulins. C6 was an IgG2b, whereas the rest were of the IgG1 subclass. A competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to show that the antibodies were directed against at least five spatially distinct epitopes on cytochrome P-450c. Additional evidence for the recognition of distinct epitopes was provided by Ouchterlony immunoprecipitation of cytochrome P-450c with mixtures of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Differences in antibody reactivity provided evidence for a sixth overlapping epitope that was recognized by two antibodies (C4 and C6). Three monoclonal antibodies to the same epitope on cytochrome P-450c, (CD2, CD3, and CD5) cross-reacted strongly with cytochrome P-450d, another isozyme induced by 3-methylcholanthrene treatment of rats. The antibodies that did not cross-react with cytochrome P-450d contained kappa light chains, whereas the three cross-reacting antibodies contained lambda light chains. None of the monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with purified cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, P-450e, P-450f, P-450g, or P-450h or any other cytochrome P-450 in Western blots of liver microsomes from untreated or 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. C8 was a potent inhibitor of metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P-450c in a reconstituted system as well as microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. This antibody effected maximal inhibition of catalytic activity at an approximately 0.5:1 molar ratio of IgG to cytochrome P-450c, i.e. one antibody-binding site per epitope on cytochrome P-450c."
https://openalex.org/W1520024145,"The metabolic and developmental properties that differentiate five H1 subtypes of the mouse, H1a-H1e, are shown to have been conserved in the course of mammalian evolution. The structures of the subtypes, however, as judged by their mobilities in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, have been conserved to varying extents. H1a and H1c have undergone the most structural variation, each having a different electrophoretic mobility in every species examined. H1b is much less varied, while H1d and H1e are invariant by these electrophoretic criteria. These results suggest that H1a and -c differ fundamentally from H1b, -d, and -e in their interactions with other chromatin components. It is suggested that this difference is in the ability to promote the coiling of 10-nm chromatin fibers into higher order chromatin structures."
https://openalex.org/W1497413948,"Anaerobic treatment of maize seedlings results in the selective expression of 10 major and 10 minor polypeptides designated as anaerobic polypeptides (ANPs) (Sachs, M. M., Freeling, M., and Okimoto, R. (1980) Cell 20, 761-767). Enzymatic functions have been ascribed to two of these polypeptides, alcohol dehydrogenases I and II. This report identifies a third anaerobic polypeptide, a maize glucose phosphate isomerase. Glucose phosphate isomerase specific activity increased 60% in 24 h of anaerobiosis and to more than twice its original level in 72 h. Antiserum to spinach cytoplasmic glucose phosphate isomerase 1) was monospecific against maize protein, 2) reduced glucose phosphate isomerase activity in maize extracts by 60%, and 3) recognized a single polypeptide selectively labeled with [35S]methionine during anaerobiosis. This polypeptide co-purified with the major glucose phosphate isomerase of maize. Maize glucose phosphate isomerase co-migrated on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels with ANP55, the anaerobic polypeptide with a molecular weight of 55,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretically distinguishable alleles of Phi 1 (phosphohexoisomerase-1 gene located at maize chromosome 1L-140) predictably altered the electrophoretic behavior of ANP55, thus proving that Phi 1 encodes ANP55 and that ANP55 is a glucose phosphate isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1893709048,"The stoichiometry of the copper requirement for the dopamine beta-monooxygenase-catalyzed conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine has been investigated by rapid chemical-quench techniques. This approach, which employs concentrated samples of enzyme, overcomes ambiguities of interpretation arising from levels of trace copper in excess of enzyme concentrations normally added to steady state kinetic assays. Low turnover numbers are observed when rapid quench kinetic studies are performed under conditions in which enzyme concentrations (2.5-7.1 microM) are in excess over trace copper levels (about 0.7 microM). The addition of exogenous Cu(II) results in full restoration of activity, which is maximal at a stoichiometry of 2 mol of copper/mol of enzyme subunit. From the dependence of catalytic activity on copper levels we conclude that both coppers are required for catalysis. No stimulation of activity was observed upon addition of the following metal ions: Ni(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Fe(III), and Zn(II). In addition, the magnitude of the tritium isotope effect for [2-3H]dopamine hydroxylation is invariant over a large range of enzyme activities accompanying changes in the ratio of copper to enzyme concentration. These results appear to rule out an effector role for the second mole of copper/subunit, implicating both copper atoms in active site redox chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1577380121,"We have examined changes in translatable liver mRNAs during the acute phase response in several inbred mouse strains. Induction of mRNAs for the known acute phase reactants serum amyloid A, hemopexin, haptoglobin, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was observed. Two alpha 1-acid glycoproteins, termed AGP-1 and AGP-2, differing in size and charge, were found in all mice and appear to derive from distinct yet closely related mRNAs. Polymorphism in the structure of AGP-1 among strains was used to map the structural gene, Agp-1, to chromosome 4 near the b locus. Structural variation for serum amyloid A enabled mapping its structural gene, S alpha alpha, to chromosome 7, near Gpi-1. A wild-derived population of mice, Mus spretus, contains several variations of interest, including structural variations in many acute phase proteins and a putative regulatory variation specific to AGP-1. Further analysis of these genetic variants should provide novel insights into the acute phase response and the factors that mediate it."
https://openalex.org/W1483486467,"We have used the method of heavy isotope labeling to study the metabolic turnover of acetylcholinesterase forms in the neuroblastoma-derived T 28 hybrid cells in their differentiated state. These cells contain mostly G1 and G4 forms, together with a small proportion of G2, and secrete all these forms into the culture medium. The cells maintained constant and equal levels of acetylcholinesterase, with the same proportions of molecular forms, in a medium containing heavy isotope-labeled amino acids and in a control light medium of similar composition. In addition, they secreted acetylcholinesterase at the same rate in both media. After transfer of the cells into the heavy medium, heavy isotope-labeled acetylcholinesterase molecules progressively replace preexisting light molecules. We analyzed heavy and light components of acetylcholinesterase for each of the two major G1 and G4 forms, by reconstructing the pattern obtained in sucrose gradient differential sedimentation, using combinations of weighted elementary distributions. Heavy molecules were detected in cellular extracts after about 30 min for G1 and 3 h for G4. Both heavy forms also appeared in the medium after a lag of about 3 h. The cellular complement of G1 was renewed much faster than that of G4, the levels of the light forms being reduced to 50% of the original level after 3.5 and 40 h, respectively. Each of these forms appeared to consist of several metabolic pools, and we present simplified models which describe their possible relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1556116416,"The translocation of adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) across rat liver Golgi-derived vesicles has been studied. Vesicles of the same topographical orientation as in vivo were incubated with a mixture of [adenine-8-3H]PAPS and [35S]PAPS. The tritium to radiolabeled sulfur ratio of the incubation medium was 1.73 +/- 0.03 while that in the vesicles was 1.82 +/- 0.13. This strongly suggests that the entire PAPS molecule was being translocated across the Golgi vesicle membrane even though intact PAPS could not be detected within the vesicles. Translocation of PAPS resulted in accumulation of solutes within vesicles. This accumulation was temperature dependent, saturable (apparent Km = 0.7 microM; Vmax = 25 pmol/mg of protein/10 min), and inhibited by the substrate analogue 3',5'-ADP but not by 2',5'-ADP. Translocation of PAPS was inhibited following treatment of Golgi vesicles with Pronase under conditions in which the activity of a lumenal Golgi membrane marker such as sialyltransferase was not. This result is consistent with the existence of a PAPS carrier protein, portions of which face the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1491983133,"Abstract The reassociation of the extracellular hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris (Mr approximately 3.9 X 10(6) ) at neutral pH, subsequent to its dissociation at pH above 8.0, was examined using gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 at pH 6.8 of the hemoglobin exposed to pH above 8 showed the presence of four peaks: Ia, consisting of whole molecules, undissociated and reassociated, and smaller heme-containing fragments Ib (Mr approximately 3.0 X 10(5) ), II (Mr approximately 6.5 X 10(4) ), and III (Mr approximately 1.8 X 10(4) ). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that although the pattern of Ia was identical with that of the native hemoglobin, consisting of six polypeptide chains (I-VI), Ib appeared to have less of chains V and VI; II consisted of polypeptide chains II-VI, and III was identified as chain I. Lumbricus hemoglobin exposed to pH over the range 8.4 to 10.2 was subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B and resolved into undissociated and dissociated fractions. The combined dissociated fractions, when brought back to pH 6.8 and subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B and Sephacryl S-200, demonstrated that the extent of reassociation into whole molecules (IaR) varied from about 50% at pH 8 to 30% at pH 10.2. IaR possessed a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern identical with that of the native hemoglobin. Ia, IaR, and Ib dissociated when exposed to alkaline pH; upon return to neutral pH, both Ia and IaR reassociated partially to whole molecules but Ib did not. These results suggest that reassociation comprises two pathways: one leading to the formation of IaR and a dead-end pathway, along which reassociation stops at the level of Ib. Digital image processing of scanning transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained native hemoglobin and IaR showed that the two molecules were very similar."
https://openalex.org/W1591221070,"A mammary-uterine-pituitary tumor cell growth factor has been purified from lyophilized powders of pregnant sheep uteri by a five-step procedure. Uterine-derived growth factor (UDGF) was extracted from the powders with 0.1 M acetic acid, heated at 95 degrees C, and further purified by sulfopropyl-Sephadex C-25, Sephadex G-50, and carboxymethyl-Sephadex C-25 chromatography. From 500 g of uterine powder, 40 to 50 mg of UDGF can be isolated at an overall yield of 33%. The degree of homogeneity of the final preparations was estimated by 8 M urea, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and by PAGE under nondissociating conditions at either pH 8.5 or 4.5. In all PAGE experiments, the purified UDGF preparation showed a single Coomassie blue-stained band that directly corresponded to the only area of elution of UDGF activity from duplicate unstained gels. Molecular sieve high performance liquid chromatography HPLC, reverse phase HPLC on an octylsilyl (C8) column, and hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-Sepharose CL-4B all confirm a similar degree (i.e. greater than 90%) of homogeneity. The Mr of UDGF estimated by urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE was 4200 +/- 500 and, by molecular sieve HPLC, 6200 +/- 1000. The isoelectric point of UDGF was estimated as pI = 7.3. The UDGF isolated showed marked cell-type specificity for established cell lines that were derived from estrogen-responsive tumors; purified sheep UDGF was mitogenic for MTW9/PL rat mammary tumor cells (at 10(-10) to 10(-9) M concentrations) while showing no mitogenic activity toward normal rat diploid fibroblasts. UDGF also promoted growth of uterine-derived tumor cells and the GH3/C14 rat pituitary line. Measuring growth as an increase in cell number, UDGF supported the logarithmic growth of the MTW9/PL rat mammary tumor cells over 6 days; other known hormones and growth factors were not able to substitute for the UDGF mitogenic action on MTW9/PL cells. It is concluded that a rapid, high-yield method of purification of a new uterine-derived growth factor activity has been developed."
https://openalex.org/W1495132646,"The hydrophobic cytochrome b-559, purified from unstacked, ethanol-washed spinach thylakoid membranes, using extraction with 2% Triton X-100 in 4 M urea and three chromatographic steps in the presence of protease inhibitors, has a dominant band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gels corresponding to Mr = 10,000. The yield of this preparation is 30-50% (5-10 mg) starting with 600 mg of chlorophyll. The heme content yields a calculated molecular weight of no more than 17,500/heme, and perhaps somewhat smaller after correction for impurities. The Mr = 10,000 band is stained by the tetramethylbenzidine-H2O2 heme reagent on lithium dodecyl sulfate gels run at 0 degrees C. The Mr = 10,000 protein, further separated by high performance liquid chromatography, contains a unique NH2 terminus that is not blocked, and the amino acid sequence for the first 27 residues is NH2-Ser-Gly-Ser-Thr-Gly-Glu-Arg-Ser-Phe-Ala-Asp-Ile-Ile-Thr-Ser-Ile-Arg-Tyr-Trp -Val-Ile-X-Ser-Ile-Thr-Ile-Pro. . . COOH. Approximately 55% of the amino acids are hydrophobic, based on amino acid analysis of the Mr = 10,000 peptide, which also indicated the presence of at least one histidine. Only one cytochrome b-559 component could be identified, whose yield indicated that it arises from a single b-559 protein in chloroplasts corresponding to the in situ high potential cytochrome of the chloroplast photosystem II."
https://openalex.org/W1538116819,"The primary translation product of human intestinal apolipoprotein A-IV mRNA was purified from ascites and wheat germ cell-free systems. Comparison of its NH2-terminal sequence with mature, chylomicron-associated apo-A-IV revealed that apo-A-IV was initially synthesized with a 20-amino acid long NH2-terminal extension: Met-X-Leu-X-Ala-Val-Val-Leu-X-Leu-Ala-Leu-Val-Ala-Val-Ala-Leu-X-X-Ala. Co-translational cleavage of the cell-free product as well as Edman degradation of the stable intracellular form of the protein recovered from Hep G2 cells indicated that this entire 20-amino acid sequence behaved as a signal peptide. There is at least 55% sequence homology between the rat and human apo-A-IV signal peptides and 33% homology between the human A-I and A-IV presegments. Agarose gel chromatography of Hep G2 culture media indicated that neither apo-A-IV nor -A-I is associated with particles that have physical properties resembling any of the plasma lipoprotein density classes. Incubation of plasma with Hep G2 media resulted in transfer of A-I but not A-IV to lipoproteins. Since the NH2 termini of co-translationally cleaved and chylomicron-associated apo-A-IV are identical, it is apparent that 1) this polypeptide does not undergo NH2-terminal post-translational proteolysis like proapo-A-II or proapo-A-I, and 2) regulation of A-IV-lipoprotein interaction is not dependent on any NH2-terminal proteolytic processing event."
https://openalex.org/W1512322543,"A cAMP-dependent protein kinase was isolated and partially purified from Dictyostelium discoideum. The cytosolic holoenzyme has an apparent Mr = 160,000-180,000; its activity was stimulated significantly by cAMP when Kemptide served as substrate. The enzyme was dissociated and the regulatory subunit purified by affinity chromatography on 8-aminoethylamino-cAMP. Only one type of regulatory subunit was found; it has an apparent Mr = 41,000 and is a substrate for the in vitro phosphorylation by the homologous catalytic subunit and by purified bovine catalytic subunit. Antibody against the regulatory subunit was prepared. The D. discoideum catalytic subunit was separated from cAMP-independent protein kinase by chromatofocusing. The apparent molecular weight of the catalytic subunit of the D. discoideum cAMP-dependent protein kinase is 33,000 and its pI is 6.4. The enzyme catalyzed the phosphorylation of bovine RII but not of RI regulatory subunit and was inhibited by high concentrations of the inhibitor of mammalian cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The evolution of the functional domains of cAMP-dependent protein kinases is discussed on the basis of a comparison of the analogous D. discoideum and vertebrate enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1568864185,"The effect of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside on proteoglycan synthesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation by cultured bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells was investigated. BCE cells actively proliferating on plastic dishes produced in the absence of xyloside an ECM containing various proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate was the main 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan component (83%). Dermatan sulfate (14%) and chondroitin sulfate (3%) were also present. Exposure of actively proliferating BCE cells to xyloside totally inhibited synthesis of proteoglycans containing dermatan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate and caused an 86% inhibition of heparan sulfate proteoglycan synthesis. The heparan sulfate proteoglycans that were extracted from the ECM produced by BCE cells exposed to xyloside had a smaller size and a reduced charge density compared to their counterparts extracted from the ECM of cultures not exposed to xyloside. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of the xyloside on proteoglycan synthesis, exposure of actively proliferating BCE cells to xyloside stimulated synthesis of free chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains. All of the xyloside-initiated glycosaminoglycan chains were secreted into the culture medium. The proteoglycan-depleted matrices produced by BCE cells exposed to xyloside were used to study the effect of these matrices on proteoglycan synthesis by BCE cells. BCE cells growing on proteoglycan-depleted ECM showed a considerable increase in the rate of proteoglycan synthesis compared to BCE cells growing on normal ECM. Moreover, the pattern of glycosaminoglycan synthesis by BCE cells growing on proteoglycan-depleted ECM was changed to one which resembled that of BCE cells actively proliferating on plastic dishes. It is postulated that BCE cells are able to recognize when an ECM is depleted of proteoglycan and to respond to it by increasing their rate of proteoglycan synthesis and incorporation into the ECM."
https://openalex.org/W1579806865,"Our model of the animal fatty acid synthetase describes a head-to-tail arrangement of two identical subunits and predicts the presence of two centers for fatty acid synthesis. Current experiments which support this conclusion were conducted using the following approach. The thioesterase component of chicken liver fatty acid synthetase was either inhibited using phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or diisopropyl fluorophosphate, or released from the synthetase by limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin, thus ensuring that the fatty acyl products remain bound to the enzyme. Employing such preparations, the amount of NADPH oxidized in the initial burst of fatty acid synthesis was determined by stopped flow techniques. Gas-liquid chromatography showed that C20:0 and C22:0 constituted 85% of the fatty acids formed de novo, a result that was confirmed using [14C]acetyl-CoA in the reaction. These data showed that 1.0 mol of fatty acyl-enzyme product was formed per mol of phosphopantetheine; in addition, the measured stoichiometry of NADPH oxidation was sufficient to account for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Altogether, these results indicate that the two sites for fatty acid synthesis are active and function simultaneously. They also indicate that the thioesterase plays a key role in determining the chain specificity of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1586592493,"We investigated the biosynthesis of cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) in a cell-free translation system programmed with rat liver mRNA and in slices of rat liver. The enzyme was recovered by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Only a single mRNA species, coding for a 63,000-dalton polypeptide, was detected when rat liver mRNA was assayed by cell-free translation. On the other hand, two polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation from fresh liver extracts: a predominant Mr = 63,000 polypeptide and a minor Mr = 48,000 polypeptide. When such extracts were incubated at 4 degrees C for 7 days, the synthase activity increased 2-3-fold with a concomitant disappearance of the Mr = 63,000 polypeptide and some increase of the Mr = 48,000 polypeptide. Moreover, the specific activity of synthase containing the smaller subunits was now found to be approximately 60-fold higher than that containing the larger ones. At least in part, this increased specific activity reflected a 30-fold greater affinity for homocysteine. The changes in subunit size and activity could be prevented in vitro by protease inhibitors such as N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, antipain, and leupeptin, but not by several other protease inhibitors. Pulse-chase experiments with slices of rat liver suggested a slow, post-translational conversion of the Mr = 63,000 polypeptide to the Mr = 48,000 polypeptide. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the possibility that the large subunit form of synthase is essentially inactive under physiologic conditions, and that synthase activity is regulated by limited proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1588895741,"The possibility that apo-B is phosphorylated was examined using cultured rat hepatocytes. Rabbit antiserum prepared against rat apo-B was found to specifically react with both large and small molecular weight apo-B (by electroblotting assay and by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes). Following a 4-h incubation with [35P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, an autoradiographic band corresponding to small molecular weight apo-B was obtained from cells and medium. Compared to the relative abundance of 32P which was associated with secreted small molecular weight apo-B, there was little (if any) detected in large molecular weight apo-B. Addition of excess unlabeled apo-B (obtained from rat serum) totally competed with the specific antiserum for this radioactive protein, indicating it was antigenically related to apo-B. Moreover, isolation of the 32P-labeled apo-B electrophoretic band, followed by acid hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis, showed that at least 20% of the 32P originally associated with small molecular weight apo-B was in the form of phosphoserine. Control experiments ruled out the possible contamination of apo-B with phospholipid as well as the possibility that the phosphoserine produced by acid hydrolysis could have been derived from phosphatidylserine. To examine the relevance of these data to the in vivo state, rats were injected with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation of their livers followed by autoradiographic analysis showed the presence of 32P in small molecular weight apo-B. These data show for the first time that small molecular weight apo-B is synthesized as a phosphoserine containing protein."
https://openalex.org/W1484316354,"The kinetics of exchange of radiolabeled cholesterol and phospholipids between intact Mycoplasma gallisepticum cells and unilamellar lipid vesicles were investigated over a wide range of cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio. The change in cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio was achieved by adapting the sterol-requiring M. gallisepticum to grow in cholesterol-poor media, providing cells with decreased unesterified cholesterol content. At least 90% of the cholesterol molecules in unsealed M. gallisepticum membranes underwent exchange at 37 degrees C as a single kinetic pool in the presence of albumin (2%, w/v). However, we observed biphasic exchange kinetics with intact cells, indicating that cholesterol translocation from the inner to outer monolayers was rate-limiting in the exchange process. Approximately 50% of the cholesterol molecules were localized in each kinetic pool, independent of the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio in the cells and vesicles. A striking change in the kinetic parameters for cholesterol exchange occurred between 20 and 26 mol % cholesterol; for example, when the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio was decreased from 0.36 to 0.25, the half-time for equilibration of the two cholesterol pools at 37 degrees C decreased from 4.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.1 h. Phospholipid exchange rates were also enhanced on decreasing the membrane cholesterol content. The ability of cholesterol to modulate its own exchange rate, as well as that of phospholipids, is suggested to arise from the sterol's ability to regulate membrane lipid order. Extensive chemical modification of the membrane surface by cross-linking of some of the protein constituents with 1,4-phenylenedimaleimide decreased the cholesterol exchange rate. Depletion of membrane proteins by treatment of growing cultures with chloramphenicol increased the cholesterol exchange rate, possibly because of removal of some of the protein mass that may impede lipid translocation. The observations that phospholipid exchange was one order of magnitude slower than cholesterol exchange and that dimethyl sulfoxide, potassium thiocyanate, and potassium salicylate enhanced the cholesterol exchange rate are consistent with a mechanism involving lipid exchange by diffusion through the aqueous phase."
https://openalex.org/W1563276555,"The dependence on pH and membrane potential of the ability of colicin E1 and a COOH-terminal tryptic fragment of the colicin to form membrane channels has been measured using a chloride-sensitive electrode to measure colicin-induced ion efflux from asolectin vesicles of two different size classes. This method allows measurement of ion efflux on a faster time scale, with half-times for efflux less than or equal to 3 s, than previously possible using labeled solutes. Activity measurements were also made through the use of potential-indicating fluorescence probes. The activities of both colicin E1 and the fragment increased with decreasing pH. The activity of the colicin was maximum at pH values near 4.0, with an apparent pK of 4.5-4.6, whereas that of the COOH-terminal fragment continued to increase to the lowest pH value, 3.4, that could be used, showing an apparent pK less than or equal to 3.8. Using relatively small vesicles (average diameter approximately equal to 0.1 micron) made by a freeze-thaw procedure, chloride efflux caused by addition of fragment or colicin was independent of the initial transmembrane K+-diffusion potential imposed upon the system. However, with larger (0.5-micron diameter) vesicles prepared by a fusion method, the chloride efflux showed a dependence upon membrane potential, with the activity decreasing as the membrane potential was made more positive. The average size of the different vesicle populations was determined by electron microscopy. It is proposed that the lack of potential dependence observed in the freeze-thaw vesicles and the small voltage dependence, relative to planar membranes, seen in the larger fused vesicles, results from rapid discharge of the membrane potential and internal ion content of the vesicles."

Biol. 115, 465-483) can be further fractionated by chromatography on hydroxyapatite into two major peaks; one containing profilin in combination with gamma-actin (PA gamma) and the other combined with beta-actin (PA beta). Both complexes were shown to consist of 1 mol each of the two proteins. The two forms of profilin, PI (intact form) and PII (lacking the COOH-terminal glutamine and tyrosine residues) (Malm, B., Larsson, H., and Lindberg, U. (1983) J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 4, 569-588), were found unequally distributed between the two major peaks of PA, such that PA gamma contained mainly PI and PA beta both PI and PII. The significance of this finding remains unclear. Isoelectrofocusing showed that PI from both isoforms of PA had an isoelectric point of 9.08. Profilin II gave rise to two major bands on isoelectrofocusing having isoelectric points of 9.12 and 9.18, respectively. Finally it was shown that the two isoforms of actin can be separated from each other in the absence of profilin also by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. In this case, ATP remains bound to the actins eluted from the chromatographic matrix and both actins were shown to polymerize on addition of salts as judged by viscometry."
https://openalex.org/W1552237957,"The effect of the 5'-dephosphorylated 2',5'-adenylate trimer and its 2',5'-trimer core analogs on the inhibition of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replication was determined in tobacco leaf discs, protoplasts, and whole tobacco plants, using infectivity tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A structure-activity-metabolic stability-toxicity analysis of the 2',5'-adenylate trimer core molecule in TMV-infected Nicotiana glutinosa was determined. Modification at either the 6-amino position of the adenylate residues (i.e. inosinate trimer core) or at the 2' terminus (i.e. A-A-ara-A or A-A-Tu) inhibited replication of TMV. Modification of the 3'-hydroxyl group of the adenylate residues to 3-deoxyribose (i.e. the 2',5'-cordycepin trimer core) inhibited TMV replication better than the 2',5'-adenylate trimer core molecule. With enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, there was complete inhibition of TMV replication by 200 nM 2',5'-adenylate trimer core for 60 h and by 200 nM 2',5'-cordycepin trimer core for 96 h. The amount of 2',5'-oligonucleotides associated with the leaves was determined using 2',5'-[3H]cordycepin trimer core; 1 X 10(-12) mol/cm2 of plant leaves inhibited TMV replication by 99%. No 2',5'-phosphodiesterase activity was detected in TMV-infected and noninfected leaf extracts. Therefore, the 2',5'-trimer cores were potent inhibitors of TMV replication at nanomolar concentrations, i.e. at 1000-fold lower concentration than that required in mammalian systems."

All three analytical procedures give a common result, namely (i) that each enzyme molecule is retained by a single immobilized dye molecule; (ii) that the immobilized dye binds to the protein at an NADH binding site with an affinity identical to that of the free dye; and (iii) that less than 2% of the immobilized dye is accessible to the enzyme. The very small fractional accessibility is not due to steric exclusion but likely is a result of adsorption of the immobilized dye to the matrix surface."
https://openalex.org/W1573216774,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum was adapted to grow with delta 5-sterols modified in the aliphatic side chain, and stopped-flow kinetic measurements of filipin association were made to estimate the sterol distribution between the two leaflets of the membrane. Cholesterol derivatives with unsaturated side chains (desmosterol, cis- and trans-22-dehydrocholesterol, and cholesta-5,22E,24-trien-3 beta-ol) or an alkyl substituent (beta-sitosterol) were predominantly (86-94%) localized in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. However, cholesterol, 20-isocholesterol, and sterols with side chains of varying lengths (in the 20(R)-n-alkylpregn-5-en-3 beta-ol series where the alkyl group ranged from ethyl to undecyl) were distributed nearly symmetrically between the two halves of the bilayer. Kinetic measurements of beta-[14C]sitosterol and [14C]desmosterol exchange between M. gallisepticum cells and an excess of sonicated sterol/phosphatidylcholine vesicles confirmed the filipin-binding studies. More than 90% of these radiolabeled sterols underwent exchange at 37 degrees C with unlabeled sterols in vesicles over a period of 12-14 h in the presence of 2% (w/v) albumin. beta-[14C]Sitosterol exchange was characterized by biphasic exchange kinetics, indicative of two pools of sitosterol molecules in the cell membrane. Only a single kinetic pool was detected for [14C]desmosterol exchange. Stopped flow measurements of filipin binding to beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol also revealed an asymmetrical localization of these sterols in membranes of growing Mycoplasma. capricolum cells. When an early exponential culture of beta-sitosterol- or stigmasterol-adapted M. capricolum was transferred to a sterol-rich medium at 37 degrees C, approximately three-quarters of the beta-sitosterol or stigmasterol was localized in the outer leaflet after growth was continued for 6 h; in contrast, cholesterol was distributed symmetrically after about 1 h. The asymmetric localization of sterols with alkylated or unsaturated side chains suggests that growth-supporting sterols need not be translocated extensively into the inner leaflet of the bilayers of M. gallisepticum and M. capricolum."

Glycyl-tRNA synthetase is a dimer of Mr = 160,000 consisting of similar or identical subunits, whereas alanyl-tRNA synthetase is a monomer of Mr = 110,000 to 115,000. The abundance of these two enzymes in the posterior silk gland is consistent with the observed adaptation of this organ to the production of the silk protein, fibroin. The two enzymes are similar in oligomeric structure to the corresponding enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but dissimilar from their counterparts in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1511783936,"Abstract A lectin, previously designated the Man/GlcNAc-specific lectin or mannan-binding protein, is found in rat liver and plasma. Analysis of the structural requirements for oligosaccharide binding indicated that the specificity of this lectin is directed primarily at the core and peptide region of glycopeptides (Maynard, Y., and Baenziger, J. U. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3788-3794). We have examined synthesis and secretion of the core-specific lectin by primary rat hepatocytes and a rat hepatoma, H-4-II-E, utilizing pulse labeling with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation with a monospecific rabbit antibody raised against the purified lectin, and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. A post-translational modification occurs between 10 and 40 min of chase which results in an increase in the Mr from 24,000 to 26,000. This modification is not due to asparagine-linked glycosylation or oligosaccharide processing. The kinetics of secretion are unusual. Secretion begins at 1 h of chase and proceeds linearly for approximately 8 h until a maximum of 70% of the lectin has been secreted. Secretion, but not the post-translational modification is inhibited by monensin. The pattern of synthesis and secretion in conjunction with the presence of the lectin in plasma indicate that it is a plasma protein of hepatocyte origin. The slow kinetics of secretion compared to other secretory proteins indicate an unusual mechanism for the segregation of the lectin from other secretory proteins and/or a different intracellular pathway for secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2150846952,"The covalent structure of the rat liver 60 S ribosomal subunit protein L39 was determined. Fourteen tryptic peptides were purified, and the sequence of each was established by a micromanual procedure; they accounted for all 50 residues of L39. The sequence of the NH2-terminal 32 residues of L39, obtained by automated Edman degradation of the intact protein, provided the alignment of the first seven tryptic peptides. Two peptides, CNI (28 residues) and CNII (22 residues), were produced by cleavage of protein L39 with cyanogen bromide and the sequence of CNII was determined by automated Edman degradation. This sequence established the order of tryptic peptides T8 through T14. The carboxyl-terminal amino acids were identified after carboxypeptidase A treatment. Protein L39 contains 50 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 7308. There are indications that a portion of rat L39 is related to a fragment of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1."
https://openalex.org/W1507241500,"Oxidations of hemoglobin in oxygen-saturated and deoxygenated media by 10 structurally variant alkyl nitrites have been examined in kinetic detail. Pronounced structural influences on rate constants, whose values span a range of 80 in oxidations of both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, have been observed. tert-Butyl nitrite provides the slowest oxidation rate that for deoxyhemoglobin terminates after only half of the available iron(II) heme units have been oxidized. Activation parameters have been determined for oxidations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin by ethyl, isopropyl, and neopentyl nitrites from kinetic evaluation of these reactions as a function of temperature. The differences in free energies of activation (delta G) between hemoglobin R and T states range from 1.8 to 2.9 kcal/mol for the three alkyl nitrites examined. The composite data portray alkyl nitrite oxidations as inner sphere electron transfer processes whose kinetic characteristics reflect the ligand binding properties of hemoglobin. A sulfhydryl-induced alkyl nitrite oxidation of oxyhemoglobin that is most pronounced in oxygen-saturated media has been observed, and its cause has been traced to nitrosyl exchange of alkyl nitrites with the beta-93 cysteine sulfhydryl group of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1631313613,"The major histone acetyltransferase activity from porcine liver nuclei has been isolated and partially purified by a simple, rapid, and reproducible method. Extraction of nuclei in buffered 30% saturated ammonium sulfate and subsequent ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxylapatite, and ultracentrifugation on linear 15-30% glycerol gradients provides an 8650-fold purification (over nuclei) in 42% yield. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 94,000 as determined by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The optimum pH for the reaction is 7.5 and the activity is inhibited by monovalent and divalent salts and by sulfhydryl blocking reagents. The enzyme activity is substantially protected from thermal denaturation at 37 degrees C by the addition of glycerol to the incubation medium. In the presence of the core histones, the enzyme catalyzes the acetylation reaction in the order H3 greater than H4 greater than H2B greater than H2A; the order for histones bound in nucleosome core particles is H4 greater than H2B greater than H3 greater than H2A. The high mobility group proteins 14 and 17 serve as substrates for the enzyme in vitro, suggesting a possible role for enzymatic high mobility group acetylation in chromatin function."
https://openalex.org/W1598869099,"The methylmannose polysaccharide (MMP), found in the cytoplasm of Mycobacterium smegmatis, is composed of 10 to 13 3-O-methylmannoses joined by alpha 1----4 linkages. Each molecule is terminated by an unmethylated mannose and the reducing end is blocked by an alpha-linked methyl aglycon. Two enzymes involved in MMP biosynthesis have been identified in cell extracts, an alpha 1----4 mannosyltransferase (described in the previous paper) and a 3-O-methyltransferase reported here. Studies of substrate specificity and characterization of the products formed demonstrate that MMP elongation occurs via sequential mannosylation and methylation. The 3-O-methyltransferase, unlike the mannosyltransferase, is readily solubilized. It catalyzes transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to position 3 of a terminal alpha 1----4-linked mannose. The labeled product formed from S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine and Man-MeMan5-OCH3 was characterized both by its resistance to periodate oxidation and by the release of labeled 3-O-methylmannose upon acid hydrolysis. Like the mannosyltransferase, the 3-O-methyltransferase utilizes shorter oligomeric acceptors preferentially. The Km values of the methyltransferase for Man-MeMan4-OCH3 and S-adenosylmethionine are 0.7 and 0.4 mM, respectively. Because MMP homologs isolated from the cell are terminated by an unmethylated mannose, the methyl-transferase appears to be responsible for MMP chain termination. Moreover, palmitoyl-CoA selectively inhibits methylation of Man-MeMan12-OCH3 when Man-MeMan4-OCH3 and Man-MeMan12-OCH3 are incubated together with the methyltransferase, which suggests that complex formation between the longer homologs and lipids may play a role in the termination process."
https://openalex.org/W204443584,"The C1H3 monoclonal antibody recognizes two distinct developmentally regulated cell surface antigens, with molecular masses of 170,000 and 140,000 daltons, in embryonic chick neural retina (Cole, G. J., and Glaser, L. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press). In vitro, the 170,000-dalton polypeptide is released by retinal cells into the surrounding culture medium and is present in material sedimentable at 100,000 X g. This pelletable material contains particles designated as adherons (Schubert, D., LaCorbiere, M., Klier, F. G., and Birdwell, G. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 990-998) which promote cell-substratum adhesion of chick neural retina cells. In the present study, evidence is provided that the C1H3 monoclonal antibody inhibits cell adhesion to adheron-coated dishes when bound either to cells or to the adherons. The failure of other monoclonal antibodies, that bind to retinal cells with equal abundance, to disrupt adhesion demonstrates that the effect is specific. These data suggest that the neural-specific 170,000-dalton C1H3 polypeptide is the neural cell-adhesion molecule which is responsible for the ability of adherons to bind to cells."
https://openalex.org/W1646397714,"A single specific radiolabeled polypeptide with an apparent Mr = 63,000 was recovered when cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) was precipitated from extracts of radiolabeled cultured human fibroblasts with an antiserum raised against pure human liver synthase, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Partial proteolysis of this fibroblast subunit and of the subunit of pure human liver synthase (Mr = 48,000) produced similar peptide patterns. Pulse-chase experiments, however, did not provide any evidence for post-translational modification of the fibroblast synthase subunit into a smaller hepatic form. Immunoprecipitation of polypeptides synthesized in vitro from human fibroblast mRNA revealed a polypeptide with the same mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the synthase subunit found in whole cell extracts. We conclude that the Mr = 63,000 subunit is the primary translational product of the gene for cystathionine beta-synthase in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W169781986,"Modeccin is a toxic lectin that arrests protein synthesis in mammalian cells by catalytically inactivating 60 S ribosomes. To interact with 60 S ribosomes, the catalytic subunit of modeccin must pass through a membrane and enter the cytosol. Two known steps in the mechanism of modeccin action are the receptor-mediated internalization of the toxin into vesicles and a second step that requires a low pH within the vesicles. We report here another step required for modeccin to arrest protein synthesis, identified because this step was blocked at 15 degrees C. Modeccin traveling from cell surface receptors to the cytosol at 37 degrees C passed the low pH step within vesicles in a minimum time of 15 min after endocytosis and reached the cold-sensitive step 15 min later. There was no effect on protein synthesis until about 45 min after modeccin had passed the cold-sensitive step, suggesting that the toxin was still within vesicles at the time of the cold-sensitive event. The low temperature at which modeccin failed to reach the cytosol correlated with an apparent low temperature block in the transfer of endocytosed modeccin to lysosomes. The possibility is discussed that modeccin does not penetrate to the cytosol directly from endocytic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1548860899,"The mechanism of Ca2+ inhibition of carbamylphosphate synthetase I has been investigated using purified enzyme obtained from livers of rats fed a high protein diet. Binding of Mn2+ to the enzyme was measured by EPR techniques at pH 7.8, and Scatchard plots of the data indicated one Mn2+-binding site with a K'd of 13 microM. From competition studies between Mn2+ and Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding, values of 180 microM were obtained for K'd (Mg) and 193 microM for K'd (Ca). A nonlinear least squares curve fitting program was used to calculate the K'm for MgATP2- at the metal-nucleotide binding sites using a simplified rate equation of the enzyme reaction mechanism. Values of 140 and 2420 microM were obtained for K'm (MgATP) at the first and second sites, respectively, at pH 7.8, with a free Mg2+ of 1 mM and other substrates and activators present at saturating concentrations. Variations of the bicarbonate, N-acetylglutamate, and ammonia concentrations in the absence and presence of different amounts of total calcium, from which free Ca2+, free Mg2+, MgATP2-, and CaATP2- concentrations were calculated, permitted values for K'i (CaATP) to be obtained by graphic procedures. Mean values of 375 and 120 microM were obtained for K'i (CaATP) at the first and second sites, respectively. Using the above kinetic constants, a computer model of the enzyme reaction was constructed and tested using two further sets of kinetic data obtained by varying the concentrations of Mg2+, Ca2+, MgATP2-, and CaATP2-. Poor fits were obtained unless the formation of a mixed complex involving CaATP2- competition with MgATP2- at the second metal-nucleotide-binding site was incorporated into the rate equation. Nonlinear least squares curve fitting of both sets of experimental data gave a well determined value of 124 microM for this final CaATP2- inhibitory constant. Sensitivity tests for variation of the primary kinetic constants with the computer model showed that the inhibitory effect of free Ca2+ was weak and that the observed calcium inhibition of carbamylphosphate synthetase can be accounted for primarily by competitive interaction of CaATP2- at the second MgATP2- binding site. With 1 mM free Mg2+ and 5 mM MgATP2-, half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity was obtained with 0.2 mM CaATP2-."

These antibodies were used to study the immunological relationships of plant RNA polymerases I, II, and III at the subunit level. RNA polymerases I and II from soybean, I, II, and III from cauliflower and wheat, and II from turnip were purified to homogeneity, and enzyme subunits were separated on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. Separated RNA polymerase subunits were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, reacted with antibodies, and the immunoglobulin complexes were revealed by reaction with 125I-labeled Protein A. Antibodies directed against native soybean RNA polymerase II bind to all or most of the subunits of soybean and wheat RNA polymerase II and to the putative common subunits in RNA polymerases I and III. Antibodies directed against individual subunits of RNA polymerase II enzymes react specifically with the subunit to which the antibody was raised and to related or identical subunits in RNA polymerases I and III. These studies confirm the presence of common subunits in the three classes of nuclear RNA polymerase and provide information on analogous or related subunits within each class of enzyme purified from different plant species."
https://openalex.org/W1546230138,"The apparent quantum yield for dissociation of oxygen from T-state human hemoglobin has been determined using pulses of light 350 ns long at 540 nm. Two quantum yields were found. One was the same as for the R-state, and, like it, strongly temperature- and viscosity-dependent. The other, only slightly influenced by temperature and viscosity, was 10 times larger at 20 degrees C. Previous work (Sawicki, C. A., and Gibson, Q. H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7538-7547) has shown two distinct phases in binding of oxygen by T-state human hemoglobin at pH 7, 20 degrees C. When the apparent quantum yield was followed with time, the species with high quantum yield correlated with the rapidly reacting T-state species. The hemoglobin chains have different quantum yields in the T-state. Quantum yield data may serve as a measure of population of the liganded T-state in human hemoglobin, supplementing absorbance and circular dichroism data, and permit calculation of the rates of reaction at the heme in both R- and T-states."
https://openalex.org/W1586784323,"The proton NMR spectra and role in peptide binding of carboxyl-terminal and NH2-terminal neurophysin residues were studied by preparation of bovine neurophysin-I derivatives from which residues 90-92 had been cleaved by carboxypeptidase or residues 1-8 excised by trypsin. The carboxypeptidase-treated protein showed normal peptide-binding behavior. NMR comparisons of this derivative and the native protein allowed identification of proton resonances associated with residues 89-92, confirmed a lack of functional role for this region of the protein, and permitted new observations on the behavior of neurophysin's aromatic residues. The trypsin-treated protein bound peptide with an affinity only 1/50 that of the native protein at pH 6 but evinced the same binding specificity and pH dependence of binding as the native protein. These results argued against direct interaction of residues in the 1-8 sequence with bound peptide and for a role for these residues, particularly Arg-8, in conformational stabilization of the active site; this role is held to be additional to the reported influence of 1-8 on dimerization. NMR comparisons of the trypsin product and native protein allowed preliminary assignment of a set of alkyl proton resonances to residues within the 1-8 sequence and were compatible with a restricted environment for Arg-8. Conformational differences between native and trypsin-treated proteins were manifest particularly by differences in the NMR spectra of Phe and Tyr-49 ring protons. The behavior of Phe ring protons was consistent with the reported decreased dimerization constant of the trypsin product and suggested participation of Phe-22 or -35 in dimerization. The behavior of Tyr-49 provided the first direct evidence of a change in secondary or tertiary structure associated with excision of residues 1-8. Suggested mechanisms by which this conformational change reduces binding include a direct effect on Tyr-49 and/or a conformational rearrangement of active site residues near Tyr-49."
https://openalex.org/W1589497558,"The kinetics of iodination and oxidation of hog thyroglobulin were studied with purified hog thyroid peroxidase and the results were compared with the reactions of free tyrosine. From Lineweaver-Burk plots and on the basis of a value of 0.83 for delta epsilon mM at 289 nm/iodine atom incorporated, the rate constant for transfer of an assumed enzyme-bound iodinium cation to thyroglobulin was estimated to be 6.7 X 10(7) and 2.3 X 10(7) M-1 s-1 in native (iodine content = 1.0%) and more iodinated (iodine content = 1.2%) thyroglobulins, respectively. This iodine-transferring reaction was stimulated by iodothyronines, similarly as observed in the reaction with free tyrosine. The iodination of thyroglobulin was inhibited by GSH, the inhibition being competitive with thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin was oxidized in the presence of a thyroid peroxidase system without giving any appreciable change in absorbance around 300 nm. From stopped flow data, the oxidation was concluded to occur by way of two-electron transfer and the rate constant for the reaction of thyroid peroxidase Compound I with thyroglobulin was estimated to be 1.0 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. The stopped flow kinetic pattern was similar to that observed on the reaction with free tyrosine and monoiodotyrosine. About 6 mol of hydrogen peroxide were consumed per mol of thyroglobulin. Thyroid peroxidase catalyzed thyroglobulin-mediated oxidation of GSH, but lactoperoxidase did not."
https://openalex.org/W1486781804,"The shunt pathway of mevalonate metabolism (Edmond, J., and Popjak, G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 66-71) has been studied in isolated kidneys from rats perfused with physiological concentrations of variously labeled [14C]- and [3H]mevalonates. The rate of operation of the shunt pathway was quantified by the production of either 14CO2 or 3H2O from the tracers. The measured rates of 14CO2 production from [14C] mevalonate were converted to rates of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production by methods which take into account underestimations of metabolic rates derived from 14CO2 production. We have shown that the sex difference in renal shunting of mevalonate (Wiley, M. H., Howton, M. M., and Siperstein, M. D. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 837-842) occurs at physiological levels of substrate. The shunt pathway diverts up to 17% of the flux of mevalonate entering the cholesterol synthesis pathway in the kidney. It may, therefore, play a role in the long term regulation of cholesterol synthesis in this organ, as had been hypothesized by Edmond and Popjak."
https://openalex.org/W1870499396,"We have selected and characterized a thymidine-sensitive S49 mutant line, MC-3-3. MC-3-3 cells are 35-fold more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of thymidine and 15-fold more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of 5-bromodeoxyuridine than wild type S49 cells. In contrast, the MC-3-3 mutant line does not exhibit increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine. The MC-3-3 mutant line possesses levels of thymidylate synthetase and thymidine kinase activity which are equivalent to the levels in wild type S49 cells, but the ribonucleotide reductase activity in MC-3-3 cells, using CDP as a substrate, is only 10-30% of that in wild type cells. Using ADP as a substrate, the ribonucleotide reductase activity in permeabilized MC-3-3 cells is slightly higher than that in wild type S49 cells. The deoxyribonucleotide pools in exponentially growing MC-3-3 cells are approximately 40-50% of those in wild type S49 cells. By hybrid analysis, we determined that the thymidine sensitivity of the MC-3-3 cells is recessive. The MC-3-3 mutant line displays a rate of spontaneous mutation which is 15-30-fold higher than that of wild type S49 cells. The MC-3-3 mutant cells are also 5-10-fold more sensitive than wild type cells to the cytotoxic effects of tunicamycin and compactin. These results suggest that the MC-3-3 mutant line possesses a mutation in the dTTP binding site in ribonucleotide reductase; abnormal regulation of this enzyme results in an increase in the rate of spontaneous mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1492164968,"We have studied the functional properties of iodinated histones. Isolated, denatured histones were iodinated at trace levels and then renatured together with carrier histones and high molecular weight DNA to form nucleohistone. Nucleosomes were prepared from the reconstitute using micrococcal nuclease, and the relative representations of the individual iodinated tyrosines of the histones in the reconstituted nucleosomes were determined. Our principal findings are 1) that denatured histones can be iodinated at any tyrosine without interfering in subsequent nucleosome reconstitution and 2) that the resulting reconstituted nucleosomes nevertheless possess histone cores of altered stability, being either more or less stable depending on the particular tyrosine which is iodinated. We show that tyrosines 37, 40, and 42 of H2B are protected from iodination in intact core particles, as expected since these tyrosines lie within the H2B-H2A binding site. Yet iodination of these tyrosines in denatured H2B does not interfere with nucleosome assembly. However, the histone cores isolated from these reconstituted nucleosomes are of diminished stability as assayed by Sephadex column chromatography in 2 M salt. In contrast, iodination of tyrosines 83 and 121 of H2B, as well as iodination of the tyrosines of H2A, increases the stability of the histone octamer core. Iodination of H4 tyrosine 72 is without effect on histone octamer stability. Tyrosine iodination constitutes a profound amino acid alteration in the context of the absolute evolutionary conservation of most histone tyrosines. For example, all H2Bs sequenced to date, from fungi to mammals, possess tyrosines at positions 37, 40, and 42. Our results suggest that the immutability of these tyrosines reflects some sophisticated function of the nucleosome histone core beyond the assembly and mere maintenance of a compact structure."
https://openalex.org/W1586771795,"The gamma-esterase activity of 7 S nerve growth factor (NGF) is depressed relative to free subunit because of constraints within the oligomer. 4 M urea causes a reversible dissociation of 7 S NGF and concomitant increase in esterase activity. The gamma-esterase activity with tosyl-arginyl-methyl-ester increased between 1 and 4 M urea and was inhibited at higher concentrations. Upon dilution of 7 S NGF from 6 M urea, the esterase activity was initially identical with that of the similarly treated gamma-subunit but decayed rapidly (10 min) to approach that of the native 7 S NGF. In the presence of 100 microM EDTA the activity was higher, but still required the same length of time to reach a constant depressed value. Upon dilution of 7 S NGF from 2 M NaCl the rapid decay was not observed and the activity remained constant at about the same level as the equilibrium values for the urea-treated and renatured 7 S NGF. A red shift in the fluorescence maximum and a concomitant increase in quantum yield occurred for the 7 S in 8 M urea. Dilution into buffer resulted in a rapid decay and return to native 7 S fluorescence but not when EDTA was included. Both the decay in esterase activity and in fluorescence intensity upon dilution from urea were first order reactions with a rate constant of about 8 X 10(-3) s-1 suggesting that both methods were measuring a unimolecular renaturation process. Renaturation from NaCl or recombination of isolated subunits was much more rapid, indicating a simple combination of subunits in a native conformation. The circular dichroism spectra of urea and NaCl-treated 7 S NGF were different, and spectra of the renatured species with and without EDTA differed. Reassociation to a conformationally different 7 S NGF probably occurs in the presence of EDTA. The results emphasize the role of zinc in 7 S NGF formation and the influence of conformational changes in the effect of beta-NGF on the activity of the gamma-esterase in 7 S NGF."
https://openalex.org/W1666325662,"Xenopus fibrinogen is distinct from that of mammals in that the B beta subunit of the secreted protein has a higher apparent molecular weight than either the A alpha or the gamma subunit. A precursor polypeptide for each subunit was identified among the products translated in vitro from liver mRNA. Pre-A alpha is larger than pre-B beta and pre-gamma is the smallest of the three. Purified liver parenchymal cells cultured in the presence of tunicamycin secrete fibrinogen polypeptides which lack carbohydrate moieties. Our analysis of these forms of Xenopus fibrinogen demonstrated the presence of a signal peptide on each of the precursor polypeptides, the loss of a COOH-terminal peptide from the pre-A alpha chain, and the presence of one carbohydrate moiety on the mature gamma chain and two carbohydrate moieties on the mature B beta chain. The B fibrinopeptide on the NH2-terminus of the B beta chain is unusually large. The number of amino acids in this peptide is approximately twice that characteristic of mammalian B fibrinopeptides and it is glycosylated. On the basis of these data, together with information in the literature, we propose that when vertebrates first arose the B fibrinopeptide was a large glycosylated peptide. It retained this basic structure during the evolution of all subsequent vertebrates, with the exception of mammals. In contrast, the A fibrinopeptide increased in length early in vertebrate evolution. The alpha portion of the A alpha subunit of fibrinogen appears to have originally been a polypeptide about the same length as the beta chain. Concomitant with the evolution of mammals, the alpha polypeptide significantly increased in length."
https://openalex.org/W2143173174,"Intubation of rats with alpha-mercapto-beta-(2-furyl)-acrylic acid (MFA) for 5 days at 50 mg/kg caused a 7-fold increase in kidney copper concentration, a 2-fold increase in kidney zinc concentration, and a 20% increase in liver zinc concentration. The proteins which bound the increased metals were purified and identified as metallothioneins by their amino acid compositions. Two isoforms were isolated from each organ. Renal thioneins appeared identical to counterpart hepatic apoproteins, but the former bound Cu and Zn in a 2:1 mole ratio and the latter bound only Zn. Kidney contained over 10 times more metallothionein per g of tissue than did liver. In rats previously administered MFA, injection of cadmium sulfate resulted in rapid displacement of liver metallothionein-bound Zn by Cd under conditions where minimal metallothionein was found in Cd-dosed animals not administered MFA. We conclude that MFA induces metallothionein biosynthesis in kidney and liver of normal rats; this is a novel effect for an organic compound."
https://openalex.org/W1534084307,"We studied the uptake of leucine, phenylalanine, and the amino acid analog, 2-aminonorborane-2-carboxylic acid, by rat hepatoma cells in tissue culture. The uptake of these amino acids was partially mediated by a plasma membrane transport system similar to the L agency described in other cell types in that it does not require extracellular sodium and is subject to trans-stimulation. Initial rates of sodium-independent transport of these amino acids were calculated using mathematical transformations of the uptake time course curves. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits the activity of this transport system; the initial rates of sodium-independent uptake of leucine, phenylalanine, and 2-aminonorborane-2-carboxylic acid are decreased by approximately one-third (average = 30%, n = 19) after incubation of HTC cells with 0.1 microM dexamethasone. This inhibition requires at least 15 h, reaching a maximum at 24 h of exposure of the cells to the hormone. Dexamethasone has an asymmetrical effect on sodium-independent amino acid transport in that exposure of the cells to the hormone does not inhibit the rates of outflow of leucine or phenylalanine from preloaded cells into medium without sodium. Inhibition of uptake is blocked by 0.1 mM cycloheximide and 4 microM actinomycin D, indicating the need for continuous protein synthesis for dexamethasone action. Insulin, which is known to partially reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the A amino acid transport system in HTC cells, does not alter the action of dexamethasone on the L system. Previous investigations have demonstrated inhibition by dexamethasone of at least two distinct sodium-dependent amino acid transport activities in HTC cells. The data presented here, showing inhibition by the glucocorticoid of a sodium-independent transport activity, indicate that the effect of the hormone is independent of the energy source of the amino acid transport systems affected."
https://openalex.org/W1572945504,"The incorporation of m6dATP by T4 DNA polymerase has been investigated. Unlike Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Engel, J.D., and von Hippel, P.H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem, 253, 935-939), the T4 enzyme discriminates at the insertion step against the methylated triphosphate as compared to the normal substrate (dATP). The apparent Km values measured in two ways agree with the overall 7-fold discrimination measured in double label experiments. The apparent Vmax values measured for net DNA synthesis are the same, while those measured for nucleotide turnover show that the rate for m6dATP is 2-fold greater than for dATP itself. The T4 enzyme results are consistent with the generally held theory that fidelity at the insertion step of DNA polymerization is determined by the relative free energies of primer-enzyme-triphosphate ternary complexes formed by competing, alternative substrate dNTPs. These results are also consistent with the view that these free energies chiefly depend on formation of satisfactory hydrogen bonds between the bases of the template and triphosphate."
