https://openalex.org/W2170725518,"The ability to express or deplete proteins in living cells is crucial for the study of biological processes. Viral vectors are often useful to deliver DNA constructs to cells that are difficult to transfect by other methods. Lentiviruses have the additional advantage of being able to integrate into the genomes of non-dividing mammalian cells. However, existing viral expression systems generally require different vector backbones for expression of cDNA, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) and provide limited drug selection markers. Furthermore, viral backbones are often recombinogenic in bacteria, complicating the generation and maintenance of desired clones. Here, we describe a collection of 59 vectors that comprise an integrated system for constitutive or inducible expression of cDNAs, shRNAs or miRNAs, and use a wide variety of drug selection markers. These vectors are based on the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) whereby the cDNA, shRNA or miRNA of interest is cloned into an Entry vector and then recombined into a Destination vector that carries the chosen viral backbone and drug selection marker. This recombination reaction generates the desired product with >95% efficiency and greatly reduces the frequency of unwanted recombination in bacteria. We generated Destination vectors for the production of both retroviruses and lentiviruses. Further, we characterized each vector for its viral titer production as well as its efficiency in expressing or depleting proteins of interest. We also generated multiple types of vectors for the production of fusion proteins and confirmed expression of each. We demonstrated the utility of these vectors in a variety of functional studies. First, we show that the FKBP12 Destabilization Domain system can be used to either express or deplete the protein of interest in mitotically-arrested cells. Also, we generate primary fibroblasts that can be induced to senesce in the presence or absence of DNA damage. Finally, we determined that both isoforms of the AT-Rich Interacting Domain 4B (ARID4B) protein could induce G1 arrest when overexpressed. As new technologies emerge, the vectors in this collection can be easily modified and adapted without the need for extensive recloning."

L1s must retrotranspose in the germ line or during early development to ensure their evolutionary success, yet the extent to which this process affects somatic cells is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that engineered human L1s can retrotranspose in adult rat hippocampus progenitor cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. Here we demonstrate that neural progenitor cells isolated from human fetal brain and derived from human embryonic stem cells support the retrotransposition of engineered human L1s in vitro. Furthermore, we developed a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction that detected an increase in the copy number of endogenous L1s in the hippocampus, and in several regions of adult human brains, when compared to the copy number of endogenous L1s in heart or liver genomic DNAs from the same donor. These data suggest that de novo L1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism."
https://openalex.org/W1979216961,"The contribution of changes in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting factors to interspecies differences in gene expression is not well understood. The mammalian β-globin loci have served as a model for gene regulation during development. Transgenic mice containing the human β-globin locus, consisting of the linked embryonic (ε), fetal (γ) and adult (β) genes, have been used as a system to investigate the temporal switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin, as occurs in humans. Here we show that the human γ-globin (HBG) genes in these mice behave as murine embryonic globin genes, revealing a limitation of the model and demonstrating that critical differences in the trans-acting milieu have arisen during mammalian evolution. We show that the expression of BCL11A, a repressor of human γ-globin expression identified by genome-wide association studies, differs between mouse and human. Developmental silencing of the mouse embryonic globin and human γ-globin genes fails to occur in mice in the absence of BCL11A. Thus, BCL11A is a critical mediator of species-divergent globin switching. By comparing the ontogeny of β-globin gene regulation in mice and humans, we have shown that alterations in the expression of a trans-acting factor constitute a critical driver of gene expression changes during evolution. The embryo-to-fetus transition in vertebrates is marked by a developmental switch between genes encoding γ-globin in the blood, and there are differences in how globin gene expression is developmentally regulated in mouse versus humans. An experiment involving the insertion of the human β-globin locus, together with 100 kilobases of the surrounding DNA, into the mouse genome, shows that the BCL11A gene is responsible for this difference in regulation. BCLA11A protein is a repressor of human γ-globin expression previously identified by genome-wide association studies. This example of an alteration in gene expression that has occurred during evolution also provides possible new clues as to the mechanism of the clinically important fetal-to-adult haemoglobin switch in humans. The contribution of changes in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting factors to differences in gene expression between species is not well understood. Here it is found that, in transgenic mice containing the human β-globin locus, the expression of BCL11A differs between mouse and human and is a critical mediator of species-divergent globin switching."
https://openalex.org/W2061016350,"Drug repositioning offers the possibility of faster development times and reduced risks in drug discovery. With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies and ever-increasing accumulation of whole genome-level datasets, an increasing number of diseases and drugs can be comprehensively characterized by the changes they induce in gene expression, protein, metabolites and phenotypes.We performed a systematic, large-scale analysis of genomic expression profiles of human diseases and drugs to create a disease-drug network. A network of 170,027 significant interactions was extracted from the approximately 24.5 million comparisons between approximately 7,000 publicly available transcriptomic profiles. The network includes 645 disease-disease, 5,008 disease-drug, and 164,374 drug-drug relationships. At least 60% of the disease-disease pairs were in the same disease area as determined by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) disease classification tree. The remaining can drive a molecular level nosology by discovering relationships between seemingly unrelated diseases, such as a connection between bipolar disorder and hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a connection between actinic keratosis and cancer. Among the 5,008 disease-drug links, connections with negative scores suggest new indications for existing drugs, such as the use of some antimalaria drugs for Crohn's disease, and a variety of existing drugs for Huntington's disease; while the positive scoring connections can aid in drug side effect identification, such as tamoxifen's undesired carcinogenic property. From the approximately 37K drug-drug relationships, we discover relationships that aid in target and pathway deconvolution, such as 1) KCNMA1 as a potential molecular target of lobeline, and 2) both apoptotic DNA fragmentation and G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation as potential pathway targets of daunorubicin.We have automatically generated thousands of disease and drug expression profiles using GEO datasets, and constructed a large scale disease-drug network for effective and efficient drug repositioning as well as drug target/pathway identification."
https://openalex.org/W2042609223,"Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 can respire using carbon electrodes and metal oxyhydroxides as electron acceptors, requiring mechanisms for transferring electrons from the cell interior to surfaces located beyond the cell. Although purified outer membrane cytochromes will reduce both electrodes and metals, S. oneidensis also secretes flavins, which accelerate electron transfer to metals and electrodes. We developed techniques for detecting direct electron transfer by intact cells, using turnover and single turnover voltammetry. Metabolically active cells attached to graphite electrodes produced thin (submonolayer) films that demonstrated both catalytic and reversible electron transfer in the presence and absence of flavins. In the absence of soluble flavins, electron transfer occurred in a broad potential window centered at ∼0 V (versus standard hydrogen electrode), and was altered in single (ΔomcA, ΔmtrC) and double deletion (ΔomcA/ΔmtrC) mutants of outer membrane cytochromes. The addition of soluble flavins at physiological concentrations significantly accelerated electron transfer and allowed catalytic electron transfer to occur at lower applied potentials (−0.2 V). Scan rate analysis indicated that rate constants for direct electron transfer were slower than those reported for pure cytochromes (∼1 s−1). These observations indicated that anodic current in the higher (>0 V) window is due to activation of a direct transfer mechanism, whereas electron transfer at lower potentials is enabled by flavins. The electrochemical dissection of these activities in living cells into two systems with characteristic midpoint potentials and kinetic behaviors explains prior observations and demonstrates the complementary nature of S. oneidensis electron transfer strategies.

Respiratory electron flow typically occurs at the inner membrane, where oxidation and reduction can be easily linked to intracellular electron carriers and used to generate a membrane potential. However, when the electron acceptor or donor is insoluble, bacteria must possess a mechanism for transferring electrons beyond their inner membrane (1Richardson D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This is especially true for Proteobcteria, which have an outer membrane that further insulates cytoplasmic and inner membrane processes from insoluble substrates. Metal oxides (such as Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxyhydroxides) are well recognized naturally occurring electron acceptors that demand such an electron transfer strategy (2Nealson K.H. Saffarini D. Annu.

There is also evidence that some of these cytochromes decorate the surface of pili-like structures extending from the cell surface (13El-Naggar M.Y. Gorby Y.A. Xia W. Nealson K.H. Biophys.

Regardless of the ultimate location of the cytochromes, in all models of electron transfer, electrons must hop from these proteins to a solid surface or be transferred to a soluble mediator that can diffuse to a final destination (15Newman D.K.

Recent work has shown that Shewanella species secrete soluble flavins (FMN and riboflavin) that facilitate electron transfer to both metals and electrodes (23Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D.

For example, removal of accumulated soluble flavins decreases the rate of electron transfer by Shewanella biofilms to electrodes over 80%. Consistent with this observation, kinetic measurements with pure MtrC and OmcA (25Ross D.E. Brantley S.L. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 5218-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that direct reduction of solid metal oxides by these cytochromes was too slow to explain physiological rates of electron transfer, whereas turnover rates of these enzymes with soluble flavins were orders of magnitude larger. These studies suggest that the kinetics of electron transfer from cytochromes on the outer surface of Shewanella to electrodes will be significantly altered in the absence of diffusible mediators (9Ross D.E.

In slow scan rate cyclic voltammetry, the rate of electron transfer from respiring Shewanella biofilms to electrodes rises sharply at the E°′ of riboflavin and FMN (−0.2 V versus SHE) 2The abbreviation used is: SHEstandard hydrogen electrode. 2The abbreviation used is: SHEstandard hydrogen electrode.

Such measurements relating thermodynamic driving force to turnover kinetics would be difficult with whole cell:Fe(III) oxide incubations, which do not allow fine control over the electron acceptor redox potential or real time recording of electron transfer rates. In addition, voltammetry provides tools to observe electron movement under single-turnover conditions (in the absence of electron donor), allowing reversible oxidation and reduction of proteins accessible to the electrode and study of kinetic behavior (43Dumas C. Basseguy R. Bergel A. Electrochim. Acta. 2008; 53: 5235-5241Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 44Fricke K. Harnisch F. Schröder U. Energy Environ.

In this work, techniques of turnover (sustained electron transfer from cells to electrode in the presence of electron donor) and single turnover (reversible oxidation and reduction in the absence of electron donor) voltammetry were harnessed to investigate the role of outer membrane proteins in electron transfer from Shewanella to electrodes. In all of these studies, intact metabolically active cells were used, along with electrode surfaces known to act as acceptors for Shewanella. The results in the absence of soluble mediators provide evidence that electron transfer between MtrC and OmcA and surfaces requires a higher potential compared with when flavins are present to shuttle electrons to the surface. Mutant analysis also demonstrates that cells possessing different outer membrane cytochromes have differing abilities for direct and mediator-enabled electron transfer. For each trial, S. oneidensis MR-1 (ATCC 70050) or mutant cultures were grown from a frozen stock, first aerobically in Shewanella basal medium (described below) with 30 mm lactate acting as the electron donor. After 12 h, the culture was transferred into 0.4 liters of anaerobic Shewanella basal medium, containing (per liter) 0.46 g of NH4Cl, 0.225 g of K2HPO4, 0.225 g of KH2PO4, 0.117 g of MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.225 g of (NH4)2SO4. Prior to autoclaving, 5 ml of a mineral mix (containing per liter 1.5 g of nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.1 g of MnCl2·4H2O, 0.3 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.17 g of CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g of ZnCl2, 0.04 g of CuSO4·5H2O, 0.005 g of AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.005 g of H3BO3, 0.09 g of Na2MoO4, 0.12 g of NiCl2, 0.02 g of NaWO4·2H2O, and 0.10 g of Na2SeO4) as well as 5 ml of a vitamin mix (containing per liter 0.002 g of biotin, 0.002 g of folic acid, 0.02 g of pyridoxine HCl, 0.005 of thiamine, 0.005 g of nicotinic acid, 0.005 g of pantothenic acid, 0.0001 g of B-12, 0.005 g of p-aminobenzoic acid, and 0.005 g of thioctic acid) were added. To buffer against pH changes, 100 mm HEPES was added, and 15 mm lactate and 40 mm fumarate were provided as the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively. Medium was sparged with N2 gas that had been passed over a heated copper column to remove oxygen, adjusted to pH 7.2, and autoclaved. After autoclaving, 0.05% (w/v) filter sterilized casamino acids were also added. To prepare thin films of attached cells, bacteria were grown to stationary phase (A600 between 0.5 and 0.6), which represented depletion of the electron donor. The anaerobic culture was then transferred to centrifuge tubes in an anaerobic chamber (CO2:N2:H2 20:75:5) and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. In an anaerobic chamber, the pellet was gently resuspended in 20 ml of Shewanella basal medium that did not contain electron donor, electron acceptor, or casamino acids. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended again and used to inoculate sterile, anaerobic electrochemical reactors in an anaerobic glove bag. The electrochemical cells were incubated at 30 °C under a stream of nitrogen gas. Base-line voltammetry experiments were performed, and electrodes were poised at +0.24 V versus SHE for at least 6 h to facilitate attachment to electrodes and further depletion of intracellular donors (see “Electrochemistry of Attached Films” below for details on analysis of films). When cells were allowed to colonize electrodes over the course of several days, similarly grown cultures were directly inoculated into the same electrochemical chambers without any washing steps, and electrodes were poised at +0.24 V versus SHE continuously. S. oneidensis MR-1 mutant strains containing markerless deletion constructs for mtrC and omcA were created as described in Ref. 45Hau H.H. Gilbert A. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 6880-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Briefly, upstream and downstream regions of a targeted gene were ligated in a pSMV-3 plasmid containing counter-selectable markers, which was subsequently transformed into an Escherichia coli WM3064 mating strain. Following conjugation between the mating strain and S. oneidensis MR-1 wild type cells, recombination replaced the targeted gene with the deletion construct. Incubation under conditions favoring loss of the insert produced strains with deletions in the desired region. Mutations were verified using PCR with oligonucleotide primers that spanned the deleted region, and proper expression of nearby genes was verified by quantitative PCR. 5X-AQ carbon (Poco Graphite Company, Decatur, TX) was used as the working electrode. Electrodes machined to 0.5 cm × 2 cm × 1 mm were prepared by polishing with 400 grit paper, rinsed, and sonicated in deionized water. The electrodes were cleaned for 24 h in 1 m HCl and stored in deionized water. 0.22-mm-thick platinum wire was attached to the electrodes via a 3.5-mm-long nylon screw (Small Parts Inc., Miramar, FL) and a nylon nut. The platinum wire was soldered to a length of insulated copper wire within a 3-mm-diameter glass capillary tube to provide a sealed outlet extending from the electrochemical cell. The resistance between the carbon electrode and the copper wire was always less than 0.5 Ω. The electrochemical reactors used in this study were 25-ml glass cones (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). A Teflon top was altered to contain a butyl rubber O-ring (limiting oxygen entry) and a series of holes to allow working, counter, reference electrodes, and gas lines to be introduced. A glass body saturated calomel electrode (Fisher) was used as the reference electrode. A 5-mm-diameter glass capillary tube was capped with a nanoporous vycor frit (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) connected to a larger diameter tube filled with 1% agar in 0.1 m sodium sulfate solution as a salt bridge. After placing Shewanella suspensions in anaerobic reactors with electrodes, the working electrode was poised at +0.24 V versus SHE, using a Bio-Logic VMP® Multichannel Potentiostat. During growth and during catalytic voltammetry, reactors were stirred with a magnetic stir bar (Ax-Man, St. Paul, MN). Chronoamperometry was monitored until current levels fell to near background (<1 μA/cm2) to ensure that cells attached and were depleted of electron donors. At various time points, chronoamperometry was halted, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed, until peaks in CV analysis became consistent. CV sweeps were performed from −0.56 to 0.45 V (versus SHE). The scan direction was then reversed and swept to the original value of −0.56 V. CV was performed at a scan rate of 1.0 mV/s. When peak heights had stabilized (typically within 6 h), working electrodes were washed to remove loosely attached cells by replacing the medium in the reactor. The medium was removed with a sterile nitrogen-flushed syringe and replaced with 5 ml of fresh anaerobic medium without electron donor or acceptor. After a brief period of stirring, the replacement process with fresh medium was performed again. Preliminary CV analysis after each wash showed that no changes in peak heights were observed after a total of five washes, and flavin peaks were also undetectable at this point. Three complete cycles of single turnover slow scan rate CV data were collected at 1 mV/s for each film. Scan rate analysis was then performed on cell films with a Gamry PCI4 Femtostat (Gamry Instruments, Warminster, PA). All of the sweeps were performed from −0.56 to 0.8 V (versus SHE) with a scan rate of 1–1000 mV/s with two sweeps/scan rate. Following scan rate analysis, the electrodes were discarded. The data were analyzed (e.g. base-line removal, derivative analysis) using SOAS software (recently described in Ref. 46Fourmond V. Hoke K. Heering H.A. Baffert C. Leroux F. Bertrand P. Lèger C. Bioelectrochemistry. 2009; 76: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Rate constants were also estimated using the program Jellyfit (courtesy of L. Jeuken). Electrodes at various stages were placed in amber 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of medium with 60 μm propidium iodide and 10 μm Syto 9 from a Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit (Invitrogen). The film was stained for 20 min, rinsed, and placed in the center of a microscope slide surrounded by a gasket slightly thicker than the electrode. The basin was filled with 50 μl of medium, and a large coverslip was sealed in place (ColorStay, Revlon Cosmetics, Los Angeles, CA). The stained film was viewed with a Nikon Eclipse C1 confocal microscope using 488- and 561-nm filters. The morphology and coverage of the biofilm were evaluated at several locations, and representative sites were chosen for the collection of three-dimensional images using 0.5-μm intervals, beginning 20 μm above the top of the film and continuing until 20 μm beyond the electrode/biofilm interface. The resulting slices were rendered using EZ-C1 3.20 FreeViewer software and ImageJ 1.34s. A S3500N scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) was also used to image freshly polished electrodes and electrodes with attached cells. The electrodes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and dehydrated for 5 min in 25, 50, 75, 95, and 100% ethanol. The electrodes then were dried in a Denton DV-502 vacuum evaporator (Moorestown, New Jersey), sputter-coated (Fullam EffaCoater, Clifton Park, New York), and fixed through graphite tape to a sample stage. The samples were placed directly into the scanning electron microscope vacuum compartment and examined at accelerating voltage of 5 kV. It was recently discovered that Shewanella strains secrete redox-active flavins (24von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), which can accelerate the rate that electrons are transferred from cells to metals and electrodes (23Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Bond D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, 24von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, other observations showing interactions between purified cytochromes and solid electron acceptors suggested that a mechanism independent of flavins could also be functional. To characterize electron transfer across a range of applied potentials by S. oneidensis MR-1 under growth conditions, cultures were first grown on 2-cm2 planar electrodes held at oxidizing potentials (+0.2 V versus SHE) and analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1). The concentration of soluble flavins in a S. oneidensis MR-1 culture can vary from 0.2 to 1 μm, because of factors such as cell density and the length of incubation (23Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Bond D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, 24von Canstein H. Ogawa J. Shimizu S. Lloyd J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To initiate growth in the presence of varying flavin concentrations, biofilms were amended with increasing levels of flavins. For example, when late exponential phase cultures of S. oneidensis MR-1 were used, flavin concentrations in the bioreactor were 0.1–0.2 μm (FMN plus riboflavin). Over the next 96 h, anodic current rose (doubling nearly every 24 h), and leveled off at 35.6 μA ± 6.1 (n = 3). When flavins were supplemented at inoculation, the rate of increase was faster (doubling time approaching 12 h for 1 μm added flavins), and current stabilized at levels over 3-fold higher (110 μA ± 5.1, n = 3). Representative cyclic voltammetry data for biofilms grown in the presence of increasing levels of flavins are shown in Fig. 1A, with the derivative of each voltammogram shown in Fig. 1B, to allow visualization of midpoint potentials and wave symmetry in catalytic data. Voltammetry of all biofilms was dominated by a catalytic wave that initiated by −0.25 V and rose steeply at a midpoint potential of −0.2 V. The magnitude of this response increased with flavin level (23Marsili E. Baron D.B. Shikhare I.D. Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Bond D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Interfacial electron transfer increases exponentially with the potential difference between donors and acceptors. Thus, small changes near the midpoint potential have a large effect on electron transfer rate, but as potential rises, reactions responsible for bringing electrons to the interface approach a limit. The sharp rise in the rate of electron transfer, centered at the midpoint potential of flavins, provided an example of such behavior catalyzed by Shewanella. However, voltammograms always demonstrated a secondary response to applied potential, as shown by the slow, nearly linear rise in anodic current at potentials above −0.1 V in all experiments (Fig. 1A). The magnitude of this boost was similar, because current rose 10–15 μA as potential was increased from −0.1 to +0.25 V. Although flavins altered electron transfer at the lower potential window (near −0.2 V), the higher potential increase always remained and was not sensitive to flavin concentrations. This suggested a second mechanism that was active at higher potentials, was not dependent upon flavins, and was broader in its response to potential. To further characterize the effect flavins exerted on reaction rates in whole cells, Fig. 2 shows the relationship between added riboflavin and specific rates of electron transfer per unit of attached biomass (as μA/μg protein, 1 μA = nearly 10 pmol of electrons/s). Soluble mediators increased the amount of cell biomass that was able to colonize electrodes but also increased the specific rate each unit of biomass could transfer electrons to the surface. This further demonstrated that Shewanella possessed an excess of lactate oxidation activity and that higher specific rates of electron transfer per cell were achieved when riboflavin was also present to shuttle electrons to the surface. The remainder of the experiments were aimed at explaining the origin of the higher potential electron transfer behavior, which was not affected by the level of soluble flavins. To more precisely study wild type and mutant strains, a method was developed to obtain repeatable electrodes interfaced with cell films. Identical electrodes were exposed to S. oneidensis that had been grown under anaerobic conditions. When an electrode (poised at +0.24 versus SHE) was immersed in a cell suspension of S. oneidensis MR-1 lacking electron acceptors, cyclic voltammetry detected reversible peaks that stabilized in terms of height and location within 6 h. When similar experiments were performed with chloramphenicol-treated cells, identical peak development over time was observed (data not shown), ruling out synthesis of new proteins as a significant cause of the new voltammetry features. Confocal microscopy of electrodes revealed a dense, 1–3-μm-thick layer of cells initially attached to surfaces (Fig. 3). However, when electrodes were washed five times (via five changes of anaerobic cell-free electrolyte), voltammetry features became lower in magnitude but more defined.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report an age-related increase in the lipid oxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as well as increased expression of lipoxygenase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in the murine skeleton. These changes together with decreased Wnt signaling are reproduced in 4-month-old mice bearing a high expressing allele of the lipoxygenase Alox15. The addition of 4-HNE to cultured osteoblastic cells increases oxidative stress, which in turn diverts beta-catenin from T-cell-specific transcription factors to Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors, thereby attenuating the suppressive effect of beta-catenin on PPARgamma gene expression. Oxidized lipids, acting as ligands of PPARgamma, promote binding of PPARgamma2 to beta-catenin and reduce the levels of the latter, and they attenuate Wnt3a-stimulated proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, oxidized lipids and 4-HNE stimulate apoptosis of osteoblastic cells. In view of the role of oxidized lipids in atherogenesis, the adverse effects of lipoxygenase-mediated lipid oxidation on the differentiation and survival of osteoblasts may provide a mechanistic explanation for the link between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2117403660,"A better understanding of the signaling pathways that control muscle growth is required to identify appropriate countermeasures to prevent or reverse the loss of muscle mass and force induced by aging, disuse, or neuromuscular diseases. However, two major issues in this field have not yet been fully addressed. The first concerns the pathways involved in leading to physiological changes in muscle size. Muscle hypertrophy based on perturbations of specific signaling pathways is either characterized by impaired force generation, e.g., myostatin knockout, or incompletely studied from the physiological point of view, e.g., IGF-1 overexpression. A second issue is whether satellite cell proliferation and incorporation into growing muscle fibers is required for a functional hypertrophy. To address these issues, we used an inducible transgenic model of muscle hypertrophy by short-term Akt activation in adult skeletal muscle. In this model, Akt activation for 3 wk was followed by marked hypertrophy (̃50% of muscle mass) and by increased force generation, as determined in vivo by ankle plantar flexor stimulation, ex vivo in intact isolated diaphragm strips, and in single-skinned muscle fibers. No changes in fiber-type distribution and resistance to fatigue were detectable. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation experiments showed that Akt-dependent muscle hypertrophy was accompanied by proliferation of interstitial cells but not by satellite cell activation and new myonuclei incorporation, pointing to an increase in myonuclear domain size. We can conclude that during a fast hyper-trophic growth myonuclear domain can increase without compromising muscle performance.—Blaauw, B., Canato, M., Agatea, L., Toniolo, L., Mammucari, C., Masiero, E., Abraham, R., Sandri, M., Schiaffino, S., Reggiani, C.

https://openalex.org/W1981590299,"The closely related Sox5 and Sox6 turn out to perform distinct functions during brain development. Maintenance of the ventricular zone neuroepithelium requires Sox6 in the dorsal and Sox5 in the ventral telencephalon. A portion of the interneurons born in ventral telencephalon then express Sox6, which is necessary for their correct migration and phenotypic differentiation. The neuronal diversity of the CNS emerges largely from controlled spatial and temporal segregation of cell type-specific molecular regulators. We found that the transcription factor SOX6 controls the molecular segregation of dorsal (pallial) from ventral (subpallial) telencephalic progenitors and the differentiation of cortical interneurons, regulating forebrain progenitor and interneuron heterogeneity. During corticogenesis in mice, SOX6 and SOX5 were largely mutually exclusively expressed in pallial and subpallial progenitors, respectively, and remained mutually exclusive in a reverse pattern in postmitotic neuronal progeny. Loss of SOX6 from pallial progenitors caused their inappropriate expression of normally subpallium-restricted developmental controls, conferring mixed dorsal-ventral identity. In postmitotic cortical interneurons, loss of SOX6 disrupted the differentiation and diversity of cortical interneuron subtypes, analogous to SOX5 control over cortical projection neuron development. These data indicate that SOX6 is a central regulator of both progenitor and cortical interneuron diversity during neocortical development."

Interestingly, the use of glutamic acid decarboxylase-derived peptide 206–220-specific approaches to treat type 1 diabetes in NOD mice revealed that adjuvant-free antigens induced IFNγ and controlled blood glucose via concomitant suppression of IL-17 secretion (9Jain R.

Of interest, a recent study showed that Th17 cells promote pancreatic inflammation in NOD mice (14Martin-Orozco N. Chung Y. Chang S.H. Wang Y.H. Dong C. Eur. J.

More interestingly, Th17 could be converted to a Th1-like phenotype in vivo and induce diabetes to NOD/SCID recipients (16Bending D. Pena H. Veldhoen M. Phillips J.M. UYttenhove C. Stockinger B.

Accordingly, the suppression of IL-17 production could be beneficial, if not essential, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Therefore, drugs that target Th1 and Th17 differentiation could offer promising candidates for treating autoimmune diabetes.Many studies are currently exploring the intracellular signaling pathways involved in Th17 differentiation. It has been shown that the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt is essential for Th17 differentiation (17Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R.

Because type 1 diabetes is associated with islet inflammation, we hypothesized that berberine could ameliorate type 1 diabetes through its immune regulatory properties, which may explain the beneficial use of berberine in the management of type 1 diabetes. In this study, we found that berberine treatment ameliorated type 1 diabetes and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in NOD mice. Berberine also suppressed Th17 and Th1 differentiation via the activation of ERK1/2 and inactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK, respectively. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by a selective inhibitor or by retroviral expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK1 or ERK2 promoted Th17 differentiation. Berberine regulated Th1 differentiation by decreasing the activity of STAT1 and STAT4 by suppressing p38 MAPK/JNK and degrading STAT4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These findings may help to evaluate the use of natural plant products in drug discovery and to better understand the role of MAPK in T cell differentiation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that berberine differentially regulated MAPK activity to decrease IL-17 and IFNγ production, which was associated with the protection against the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice as illustrated in Fig. 8. This conclusion is supported by the following experimental evidence. (i) The improved outcome of diabetes is correlated with decreased IL-17 and IFNγ production. (ii) Berberine treatment activated ERK1/2 activation and inactivated p38 MAPK/JNK in vitro and in vivo. (iii) Inhibition of ERK1/2 using the selective inhibitor PD98059 or by inducing the expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK promoted Th17 differentiation, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK decreased the expression of IFNγ during Th1 differentiation.The MAPK superfamily, which includes p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK, plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Recent studies have also implicated MAPK in immune responses. p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK are reported to be involved in CD4+ effector T cell differentiation. The expression of the dominant-negative form of p38 MAPK selectively impaired Th1 responses, suggesting a key regulatory role of the p38 MAPK pathway (36Rincón M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M.

Our study has shown that berberine strongly inhibited IL-17 production in vivo and in vitro, which could be beneficial, if not responsible, for its therapeutic effect in protecting against the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.A couple of studies have described the anti-inflammatory properties of alkaloid derivatives from Berberis vulgaris L., including berbamine and berberine.

In our study, berberine inhibited the production of both IFNγ and IL-17 in NOD mice probably as a result of structural differences between berberine and berbamine. Another possible reason why berberine could suppress the development type 1 diabetes is its antimicrobial activity (44Yu H.H. Kim K.J. Cha J.D. Kim H.K. Lee Y.E. Choi N.Y. You Y.O. J. Med.

Therefore, berberine could also suppress the development of type 1 diabetes by influencing microbial flora in the gut.Taken together, our study provides new evidence that berberine differentially regulates MAPK activity to control Th17 and Th1 differentiation. This could be favorable in terms of its therapeutic potential in type 1 diabetes. This study also provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory properties of Chinese herbs. Type 1 diabetes, one of the most common autoimmune diseases, is caused by T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-secreting β cells and accounts for ∼5–10% of diagnosed cases of diabetes (1Tisch R.

Interestingly, the use of glutamic acid decarboxylase-derived peptide 206–220-specific approaches to treat type 1 diabetes in NOD mice revealed that adjuvant-free antigens induced IFNγ and controlled blood glucose via concomitant suppression of IL-17 secretion (9Jain R.

Accordingly, the suppression of IL-17 production could be beneficial, if not essential, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Therefore, drugs that target Th1 and Th17 differentiation could offer promising candidates for treating autoimmune diabetes. interferon-γ interleukin phosphate-buffered saline dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase T cell receptor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wild type bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. interferon-γ interleukin phosphate-buffered saline dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase T cell receptor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wild type bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. Many studies are currently exploring the intracellular signaling pathways involved in Th17 differentiation. It has been shown that the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt is essential for Th17 differentiation (17Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R.

Subsequent work revealed that RORα is another lineage-specific transcription factor involved in Th17 differentiation (18Yang X.O. Pappu B.P. Nurieva R. Akimzhanov A. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Ma L. Shah B.

Interestingly, another nuclear receptor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, was found to modulate Th17 differentiation (20Quintana F.J. Basso A.S. Iglesias A.H. Korn T. Farez M.F. Bettelli E. Caccamo M.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because type 1 diabetes is associated with islet inflammation, we hypothesized that berberine could ameliorate type 1 diabetes through its immune regulatory properties, which may explain the beneficial use of berberine in the management of type 1 diabetes. In this study, we found that berberine treatment ameliorated type 1 diabetes and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in NOD mice. Berberine also suppressed Th17 and Th1 differentiation via the activation of ERK1/2 and inactivation of p38 MAPK and JNK, respectively. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by a selective inhibitor or by retroviral expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK1 or ERK2 promoted Th17 differentiation. Berberine regulated Th1 differentiation by decreasing the activity of STAT1 and STAT4 by suppressing p38 MAPK/JNK and degrading STAT4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These findings may help to evaluate the use of natural plant products in drug discovery and to better understand the role of MAPK in T cell differentiation. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that berberine differentially regulated MAPK activity to decrease IL-17 and IFNγ production, which was associated with the protection against the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice as illustrated in Fig. 8. This conclusion is supported by the following experimental evidence. (i) The improved outcome of diabetes is correlated with decreased IL-17 and IFNγ production. (ii) Berberine treatment activated ERK1/2 activation and inactivated p38 MAPK/JNK in vitro and in vivo. (iii) Inhibition of ERK1/2 using the selective inhibitor PD98059 or by inducing the expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK promoted Th17 differentiation, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK decreased the expression of IFNγ during Th1 differentiation.The MAPK superfamily, which includes p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK, plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Recent studies have also implicated MAPK in immune responses. p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK are reported to be involved in CD4+ effector T cell differentiation. The expression of the dominant-negative form of p38 MAPK selectively impaired Th1 responses, suggesting a key regulatory role of the p38 MAPK pathway (36Rincón M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M.

The Th1 response was attenuated in JNK-deficient mice, which was primarily due to reduced IL-12-stimulated IFNγ production by CD4+ T cells (37Yang D.D. Conze D. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Davis R.J.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found that berbamine targets STAT4 via a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase resulting in decreased production of IFNγ in CD4+ T cells of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice, whereas the secretion of IL-17 was not markedly altered. In our study, berberine inhibited the production of both IFNγ and IL-17 in NOD mice probably as a result of structural differences between berberine and berbamine. Another possible reason why berberine could suppress the development type 1 diabetes is its antimicrobial activity (44Yu H.H. Kim K.J. Cha J.D. Kim H.K. Lee Y.E. Choi N.Y. You Y.O. J. Med. Food. 2005; 8: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 45Higaki S. Hasegawa Y. Morohashi M. Takayoshi Y. J. Dermatol. 1995; 22: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A previous study revealed that intestinal microbes are a critical epigenetic factor that modifies the predisposition toward type 1 diabetes (46Wen L. Ley R.E. Volchkov P.Y. Stranges P.B. Avanesyan L. Stonebraker A.C. Hu C. Wong F.S. Szot G.L. Bluestone J.A. Gordon J.I. Chervonsky A.V. Nature. 2008; 455: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Therefore, berberine could also suppress the development of type 1 diabetes by influencing microbial flora in the gut.Taken together, our study provides new evidence that berberine differentially regulates MAPK activity to control Th17 and Th1 differentiation. This could be favorable in terms of its therapeutic potential in type 1 diabetes. This study also provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory properties of Chinese herbs. In this study, we showed that berberine differentially regulated MAPK activity to decrease IL-17 and IFNγ production, which was associated with the protection against the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice as illustrated in Fig. 8. This conclusion is supported by the following experimental evidence. (i) The improved outcome of diabetes is correlated with decreased IL-17 and IFNγ production. (ii) Berberine treatment activated ERK1/2 activation and inactivated p38 MAPK/JNK in vitro and in vivo. (iii) Inhibition of ERK1/2 using the selective inhibitor PD98059 or by inducing the expression of dominant-negative forms of ERK promoted Th17 differentiation, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK and JNK decreased the expression of IFNγ during Th1 differentiation. The MAPK superfamily, which includes p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK, plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Recent studies have also implicated MAPK in immune responses. p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK are reported to be involved in CD4+ effector T cell differentiation. The expression of the dominant-negative form of p38 MAPK selectively impaired Th1 responses, suggesting a key regulatory role of the p38 MAPK pathway (36Rincón M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M. Zapton T. Su M.S. Penix L.A. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The Th1 response was attenuated in JNK-deficient mice, which was primarily due to reduced IL-12-stimulated IFNγ production by CD4+ T cells (37Yang D.D. Conze D. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Rincón M. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK-deficient CD4+ T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 subset effector T cells (38Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 specifically affect T cell development in the thymus (39Pagès G. Guérin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 40Fischer A.M. Katayama C.D. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2005; 23: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERK activation favored Th2 development through stabilizing GATA3 (41Yamashita M. Shinnakasu R. Asou H. Kimura M. Hasegawa A. Hashimoto K. Hatano N. Ogata M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29409-29419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our study also showed that ERK plays a role in the program of Th17, another subset of CD4+ T cells, which enhanced our understanding of the relationship between MAPK and T cell differentiation (Fig. 8). A previous study showed that PD98059 slightly inhibited IL-17 production by lymph node cells activated by concanavalin A (42Stojanoviæ I. Cvjetiæanin T. Lazaroski S. Stosiæ-Grujiciæ S. Miljkoviæ D. Immunology. 2009; 126: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a difference that can be attributed to the cell culture conditions used. Lymph node cells stimulated with concanavalin A secreted various cytokines other than IL-17, and these cytokines could have various effects on IL-17 production. However, under the Th17 culture condition, the T cells mainly secreted cytokines belonging to the Th17 family, including IL-17, IL-17F, and IL-22 (43Nurieva R.I. Chung Y. Hwang D. Yang X.O. Kang H.S. Ma L. Wang Y.H. Watowich S.S. Jetten A.M. Tian Q. Dong C. Immunity. 2008; 29: 138-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Therefore, T cells cultured with the Th17 mixture were a much more homogenous population compared with those simulated with concanavalin A and may be a better system to study the effect of PD98059 on Th17 differentiation. Th17 is critically involved in the development of many autoimmune diseases in both human and mouse models, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis. However, the role of Th17 in the development of type 1 diabetes remains debatable. A study by Komiyama et al. (8Komiyama Y. Nakae S. Matsuki T. Nambu A. Ishigame H. Kakuta S. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) indicated that IL-17 deficiency did not affect hyperglycemia in NOD mice. On the other hand, other studies have emphasized the role of IL-17 in diabetes development in NOD mice. For example, it was shown that IL-17 transcripts increased during the evolution of diabetes in NOD mice (11Vukkadapu S.S. Belli J.M. Ishii K. Jegga A.G. Hutton J.J. Aronow B.J. Katz J.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that Th17 lymphocytes are activated in type 1 diabetic mice (15Srinivasan S. Bolick D.T. Lukashev D. Lappas C. Sitkovsky M. Lynch K.R. Hedrick C.C. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in multiple low dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, another murine model of type 1 diabetes, streptozotocin-stimulated IL-17 secretion promoted nitric oxide-dependent toxic inflammatory responses toward MIN6, a mouse insulinoma cell line (10Miljkovic D. Cvetkovic I. Momcilovic M. Maksimovic-Ivanic D. Stosic-Grujicic S. Trajkovic V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, another study showed that, in the same model, IL-23 is involved in the development of type 1 diabetes by inducing the production of IL-17 (12Mensah-Brown E.P. Shahin A. Al-Shamisi M. Wei X. Lukic M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Of greater interest, the use of glutamic acid decarboxylase-derived peptide 206–220-specific approaches to treat type 1 diabetes in NOD mice showed that adjuvant-free antigen induced IFNγ and controlled blood glucose via the suppression of IL-17 secretion (9Jain R. Tartar D.M. Gregg R.K. Divekar R.D. Bell J.J. Lee H.H. Yu P. Ellis J.S. Hoeman C.M. Franklin C.L. Zaghouani H. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A recent study using IL-21r knock-out mice suggested that IL-17 may play an important role in the development of type 1 diabetes (13Spolski R. Kashyap M. Robinson C. Yu Z. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14028-14033Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, studies by Dong and co-workers (14Martin-Orozco N. Chung Y. Chang S.H. Wang Y.H. Dong C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) suggested that Th17 promoted pancreatic inflammation.

In the present study we examined the role of phosphorylation in modulating the activation of TRPV4. We expressed TRPV4 in HEK293 cells and activated the channel by cell swelling in a hypotonic solution. TRPV4 channel activation and serine phosphorylation were enhanced by exposure to the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or by application of bradykinin, which activates PKC via a G-protein-coupled mechanism. The enhancement was inhibited by the PKC inhibitors staurosporine, bisindolylmaleimide I, and rottlerin or by mutation of the serine/threonine residues Ser162, Thr175, and Ser189. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin also enhanced activation of TRPV4, and the enhancement was antagonized by the selective cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H89 or by mutation of serine residue Ser824. Sensitization of TRPV4 by both PKC and PKA depended on the scaffolding protein AKAP79, because channel activation and phosphorylation were enhanced by co-transfection of AKAP79 and were antagonized by removal of AKAP79 using small interfering RNA. We conclude that the serine/threonine kinases PKC and PKA enhance activation of the TRPV4 ion channel by phosphorylation at specific sites and that phosphorylation depends on assembly of PKC and PKA by AKAP79 into a signaling complex with TRPV4.

TRPV4 has been proposed to play a role in the mechanical hyperalgesia that is generated by the concerted action of inflammatory mediators present in inflamed tissues (19Alessandri-Haber N. Dina O.A. Joseph E.K. Reichling D. Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After tissue injury, inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, prostaglandin E2, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and histamine directly sensitize primary afferent neurons, resulting in hyperalgesia (reviewed in Ref. 20Huang J. Zhang X. McNaughton P.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Important intracellular signaling molecules contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia include protein kinase C (PKC) (21Cesare P. McNaughton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15435-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 22Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A.

Gereau 4th, R.W. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). For example, the activation of the Gq-coupled B1 and B2 receptors by bradykinin leads to the release of a range of potential intracellular messengers, with a substantial body of evidence favoring the idea that the temperature threshold of TRPV1 is lowered by PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation (21Cesare P. McNaughton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15435-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 22Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A.

Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2181-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sensory neurons prostaglandin E2 activates both the EP1 receptor, which is Gq-coupled and therefore activates PKC, and the EP4 receptor, which is Gs-coupled and therefore activates PKA. Cyclic AMP analogues, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (FSK) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors enhance the mechanical and thermal hyperalgesic effects of prostaglandin E2 (27Cunha F.Q. Teixeira M.M. Ferreira S.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Taiwo Y.O. Bjerknes L.K. Goetzl E.J. Levine J.D.

Thus PKC and PKA have vital roles to play in the process of inflammatory hyperalgesia. The speed and specificity of the action of kinases is in many cases enhanced by binding to scaffolding proteins, which preassemble the kinases into signaling complexes with their target substrates. The AKAP (a kinase-anchoring protein) family of scaffolding proteins was originally named for their ability to target PKA to appropriate substrates but are now known to assemble a wide range of kinases and phosphatases into signaling complexes with appropriate targets (30Smith F.D.

The heat-activated ion channel TRPV1, a member of the same subfamily as TRPV4, has recently been shown to be assembled into a signaling complex with PKA, PKC, and PP2B by AKAP79, and the sensitization of TRPV1 by PKC and PKA is critically reliant on binding to AKAP79 (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The present study shows that PKC and PKA activation can sensitize TRPV4 to mechanical stimuli, identifies the relevant phosphorylation sites, and shows that the scaffolding protein AKAP79 plays a critical role in sensitization of TRPV4. HEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm l-glutamine. The cells were transiently transfected using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions with some modification as follows. Briefly, 2 μg of DNA was diluted in a total volume of 100 μl of serum-free medium and mixed with 10 μl of PolyFect transfection reagent, followed by 10 min of room temperature incubation to allow DNA complex formation; 0.6 ml of growth medium was added to the transfection complexes; and DNA solution was transferred to the cells and was incubated for 24 h. Potential TRPV4 PKC and PKA phosphorylation sites were sought by using GPS (36Zhou F.F. Xue Y. Chen G.L. Yao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Potential phosphorylation sites were targeted when they were identified with high probability by one or more of these packages. The siRNA against AKAP79 was constructed in a plasmid co-expressing green fluorescent protein to facilitate identification of successfully transfected cells, as previously described (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We received the following kind gifts of plasmids: hTRPV4 tagged with V5 from Dr. David Cohen, AKAP79 from Dr. John Scott, and hB2 receptor from Dr. Tanya O'Neill. Point mutations were introduced into TRPV4 by using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The S189A/T175A double mutant was constructed by combination of the S189A site mutant together with the T175A mutant. The S162A/S189A/T175A triple mutant was constructed by combination of the S162A site mutant together with the double mutant S189A/T175A. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). The cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for amplification and transfection. Calcium imaging was performed as described previously (47Bonnington J.K. M. Naughton P.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of TRPV4 cDNA (WT or mutant), or co-transfected with 0.67 μg of WT TRPV4 cDNA + 1.33 μg of AKAP79 or siRNA AKAP79 for 24 h. The cells were plated onto 13-mm polylysine-treated coverslips and grown for 1 day, loaded with 10 μm fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes) for 40 min, and then mounted into a chamber that was continuously perfused with an isotonic solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 100 mm mannitol, pH 7.4, osmolarity 320 ± 5 mosm). [Ca2+]i was monitored with an inverted confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Cell swelling was induced by omitting mannitol from this solution (230 ± 5 mosm). Fluo-4 AM was excited at 488 nm, and images of the fluorescence, F, were captured every 3 s. At the end of the experiment, the maximal fluorescence (Fmax) was obtained by application of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (10 μm). The Ca2+-dependent fluorescence changes were calibrated as described (40Zhang X. Huang J. McNaughton P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4211-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The data are expressed as F/Fmax. The inhibitors were applied for 30 min before treatment with e.g. PMA, FSK, or bradykinin. Significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc test (SPSS for Windows). The significance levels in figures are given as: ns, not significant, >5%; *, <5%; **, <1%; ***, <0.1%. All of the errors shown as bars in the figures or quoted in the text are ± S.E. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). The following antibodies were used: anti-phosphoserine antibody (PSR-45;l Sigma) and anti-V5 (Invitrogen). Following treatment as specified in figure legends, transfected cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 10% protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 1× phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma)), the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and cleared supernatant was mixed with 1 μl mouse anti-V5 to precipitate TRPV4 and 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) and was incubated for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer followed by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Agarose beads were removed by centrifugation prior to loading the samples onto 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred from the resolved SDS-PAGE gels to Hybond-P membrane. The blots were blocked in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1.5% gelatin) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with diluted primary antibody (PSR-45 1:1000, anti-V5: 1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 4 °C for 3 h. The blots were then washed in the washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) prior to the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (for PSR-45 and V5) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed repeatedly and developed using ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to x-ray film. All of the bands were quantified with National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software. Because the expression levels of TRPV4 were somewhat variable (see lower blots in Figs. 2A and 5A), the phosphoserine band densities were expressed relative to the relevant TRPV4 band densities. All of the blots shown in the figures are typical of at least three similar results.FIGURE 5AKAP79 enhances TRPV4 phosphorylation levels following activation of PKA and PKC.

Hypotonic solutions were used to activate TRPV4 (1Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Martí-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The calcium influx through the TRPV4 channel, whether activated by heat or by hypotonic solutions, is sensitized by inflammatory mediators in a similar manner (6Gao X. Wu L. O'Neil R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27129-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Alessandri-Haber N. Dina O.A. Joseph E.K. Reichling D. Levine J.D. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were loaded with the intracellular calcium indicator fluo-4 and imaged in a confocal microscope. The increase in calcium-dependent fluorescence (ΔF) caused by applying a hypotonic solution was used as an index of the activation of TRPV4 (Fig. 1A). There was no increase in calcium-dependent fluorescence either in untransfected cells or in cells transfected with an empty vector. Activation of PKC by application of PMA, a specific PKC activator, increased the ΔF observed in response to application of hypotonic solution (Fig. 1A). TRPV4 has been reported to be directly activated by phorbol esters at high concentrations (12Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G. Benham C.D. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 13Xu F. Satoh E. Iijima T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), so to eliminate this direct effect as a possible explanation for sensitization, we removed PMA before applying the first test pulse of hypotonic solution (Fig. 1A). We calculated the ratio between the values of ΔF when sensitization had reached a peak to that immediately before exposure to PMA (Fig. 1A, arrows). Without PMA, the distribution of these ratios was well fitted by a Gaussian function (Fig. 1B). As an index of the sensitization of TRPV4 following exposure to PMA, we calculated the percentage of cells in which the ratio exceeded the 95% confidence limit of the control distribution (Fig. 1B). Sensitization was markedly inhibited by the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, by the PKC-specific inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, and by the inhibitor rottlerin (Fig. 1C). We note that rottlerin had been proposed to be a specific inhibitor of PKCδ but is now thought to be less specific or even to act by other routes (41Soltoff S.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 453-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In summary, these experiments suggest that phosphorylation by PKC plays an important role in the sensitization of TRPV4. Bradykinin causes sensitization of TRPV1 by activating PKCϵ (22Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), which in turn potentiates activation of TRPV1 by phosphorylating serine residues 502 and 800 (residue numbering for rat TRPV1) (24Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor causes sensitization of TRPV1 by activating the tyrosine kinase Src, which phosphorylates human TRPV1 at tyrosine 200 (40Zhang X. Huang J. McNaughton P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4211-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether bradykinin and nerve growth factor can sensitize TRPV4 by co-transfecting the appropriate receptors with TRPV4 (see “Experimental Procedures”). There was no significant increase in the percentage of sensitized cell following exposure to nerve growth factor. Bradykinin, however, gave a significant enhancement (Fig. 1D), showing that activation of PKC by a physiologically important pro-inflammatory mediator can potentiate gating of TRPV4. No enhancement was observed in the absence of transfected B2 receptors (not shown). Using in silico prediction methods, we identified seven serine or threonine residues in the TRPV4 N-terminal cytoplasmic domain as candidate substrates for PKC-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). Although these residues could potentially be phosphorylated by PKC, not all may in practice be accessible to the kinase; so to identify the functionally important sites, these serine or threonine residues were individually replaced with alanine, and the resulting mutant proteins were investigated for enhancement following PKC activation as above. Sensitization of the majority of the single mutants was not significantly different from that observed for wild type TRPV4, but three of the candidate PKC phosphorylation sites, Ser162, Thr175, and Ser189, showed a significantly lower enhancement when compared with WT TRPV4 (Fig. 1H). The double mutant S189A/T175A (Fig. 1F) did not totally abolish PMA-induced sensitization, but mutating all three sites simultaneously completely abolished functional sensitization following PMA application with no significant effect on the activation of TRPV4 by hypotonic solution (Fig. 1, G and H). We quantified total serine phosphorylation of TRPV4 with an anti-phosphoserine antibody. TRPV4 was observed to be partially phosphorylated in the basal state, and following exposure to PMA the normalized band density increased by ∼2-fold (Fig. 2). Mutating the three phosphorylation sites identified above (S162A/T175A/S189A) inhibited the increased level of phosphorylation following exposure to PMA, as did exposure to the inhibitor rottlerin (Fig. 2). Application of the adenylate cyclase activator FSK increased ΔF in a subpopulation of TRPV4-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and C). The specific PKA inhibitor H89 (5 μm) abolished the sensitization of TRPV4 by FSK (Fig. 3, B and C). Using in silico methods, we identified six serine/threonine residues in the TRPV4 N- and C-terminal domains as candidate substrates for PKA-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). These residues were individually replaced with alanine, and the resulting mutant proteins were subjected to functional analysis as above. Most mutants were found to exhibit sensitization in response to PKA activation similar to WT TRPV4, but mutation of one C-terminal residue, Ser824, largely inhibited the sensitization caused by FSK (Fig. 3, E and F). AKAP79 binds to several members of the thermo-TRP family of ion channels, most strongly to TRPV1 and TRPV4 (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The binding to TRPV4 suggests that AKAP79 may play a role in PKA and PKC-mediated sensitization of TRPV4, as it does in the case of TRPV1 (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether AKAP79 mediates PKA- and PKC-dependent sensitization of TRPV4. Co-expression of TRPV4 and AKAP79 enhances sensitization by FSK (Fig. 4, A and E) and by PMA (Fig. 4, C and F), showing that augmenting the endogenous levels of AKAP79 enhances the sensitization of TRPV4 by both PKA and PKC. We next down-regulated endogenous expression of AKAP79 by the use of siRNA against AKAP79, which was co-expressed with green fluorescent protein in the same vector to allow identification of transfected cells. In HEK293 cells transfected with siRNA against AKAP79, the expression of AKAP79 is reduced to 10% or less (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In calcium imaging experiments the background fluorescence caused by the transfected green fluorescent protein can be seen as an enhanced base line (Fig. 4, B and D). Fig. 4B shows that down-regulation of AKAP79 almost completely inhibits sensitization by FSK (results summarized in Fig. 4E). Fig. 4D shows that a similar abolition of the sensitization caused by PMA is also observed when AKAP79 is down-regulated (results summarized in Fig. 4F). Thus the presence of AKAP79 is essential for the functional sensitization of TRPV4 by both PKA and PKC. Activation of PKA with FSK caused only a marginal enhancement of TRPV4 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), probably because phosphorylation at the single Ser824 site identified above does not have a powerful effect in raising overall phosphorylation above the base-line level caused by background phosphorylation of other sites. Transfection of AKAP79 or down-regulation of AKAP79 using siRNA also had only small effects on TRPV4 phosphorylation levels (Fig. 5, A and C). However, the combined effects of transfection of AKAP79 together with activation of PKA with FSK did cause a significantly enhanced level of serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5, A and C). Activation of PKC with PMA, on the other hand, caused a significant increase in serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B and D), as might be expected in view of the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2, which show that more than one site is phosphorylated by PKC. Co-transfection of AKAP79 had no significant effect on basal levels of serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5D, second bar) but did significantly enhance the increase following PKC activation (Fig. 5, B, final lane, and D, fourth bar). Down-regulation of AKAP79 expression by transfection with siRNA abolished the enhancement caused by PKC activation (Fig. 5, B and D, last bar). These results reinforce the functional studies above in showing that AKAP79 is involved in mediating phosphorylation of TRPV4 by both PKA and PKC. The TRPV4 ion channel shows substantial homology to TRPV1, the first member of the vanilloid subclass of TRP ion channels to be cloned. Like TRPV1, TRPV4 is activated by a wide range of stimuli, which among the possible physiological activators include membrane stretch caused by cell swelling or mechanical stress, warm temperatures above ∼27 °C, low pH, nitric oxide, and a variety of intracellular lipid messengers. The physiological role of TRPV4 and which of these possible activating stimuli is physiologically relevant remain unknown. TRPV4 is highly expressed in renal nephron and in hypothalamus, and through its osmosensory properties may play a role in regulating body fluids (2Liedtke W. Choe Y. Martí-Renom M.A. Bell A.M.

Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed. Tissue damage and inflammation cause the release of a range of pro-inflammatory mediators, with bradykinin and prostaglandins prominent among them. These mediators activate of intracellular signaling pathways and downstream kinases, among which PKA and PKC are known to be physiologically important (20Huang J. Zhang X. McNaughton P.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both PKA and PKC enhance activation of TRPV1 (44Huang J. Zhang X. McNaughton P.A. Curr. Neuropharmacol. 2006; 4: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the present paper we examined whether TRPV4 is modulated in a similar way to TRPV1 by phosphorylation by PKA and PKC. We used membrane stretch as a convenient activator of TRPV4, and we monitored activation of TRPV4 from the calcium influx when the channel opens. We carried out our experiments in a HEK293 cell expression system. We note that in the case of the related TRPV1 ion channel, studies in our lab and elsewhere have found that expression systems provide a highly reliable guide to the behavior of the ion channel in its native environment (35Zhang X. Li L. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 2008; 59: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 40Zhang X. Huang J. McNaughton P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4211-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 45Vellani V. Mapplebeck S. Moriondo A. Davis J.B. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC by PMA, a potent and specific activator, substantially enhanced both the gating and the phosphorylation of TRPV4. The physiological pro-inflammatory mediator bradykinin, which activates Gq and hence PKC, also potentiated activation of TRPV4. The effect of PMA was inhibited by the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, by the specific PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, and by the inhibitor rottlerin, which has been proposed to be a specific inhibitor of PKCδ (but see Ref. 41Soltoff S.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 453-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These results show that PKC sensitizes TRPV4, as it does in the case of TRPV1. We identified three phosphorylation sites close together in the N-terminal domain, Ser162, Thr175, and Ser189, mutation of each of which partially inhibited the enhancement caused by PKC. Mutation of other candidate residues was without effect. Mutation of all three sites together completely abolished the effect of PKC activation without a significant effect on gating of TRPV4. Similar experiments on TRPV1 have also identified candidate PKC phosphorylation sites, but in different parts of the molecule: Ser502 located in the cytoplasmic domain linking putative transmembrane domains S1 and S2, close to the binding site for capsaicin, and Ser801 located in the C-terminal domain (24Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 25Bhave G. Hu H.J. Glauner K.S. Zhu W. Wang H.

Activation of PKA by application of the adenylate cyclase activator FSK also enhanced gating of TRPV4. The specific PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the effect of FSK, confirming that PKA is involved. A number of candidate phosphorylation sites was investigated, and among these sites a substantial inhibition of the enhancement, although not a complete abolition, was observed following mutation of a single site, Ser824, in the C-terminal domain. Finally, by using a combination of co-expression and knockdown approaches, AKAP79 was shown to play a vital role in tethering PKA and PKC to TRPV4 to modulate its gating. Functional studies using calcium imaging showed that AKAP79 overexpression enhanced sensitization of TRPV4 by FSK (Fig. 4, A and E) and PMA (Fig. 4, B and F), whereas down-regulation of AKAP79 using siRNA inhibited sensitization. These functional studies were supported by studies of the effect of AKAP79 overexpression or down-regulation on the phosphorylation of TRPV4, in which it was shown that overexpression of AKAP79 enhanced the phosphorylation induced by PMA (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas knockdown with siRNA against AKAP79 decreased the effect of PKC activation on phosphorylation (Fig. 5, C and D). In summary, the gating of the TRPV4 ion channel by cell swelling is modulated by phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinases PKA and PKC in a manner reminiscent of TRPV1, although at sites located in quite different places on the protein. As is the case with TRPV1, AKAP79 orchestrates the action of PKC and PKA by tethering these kinases to TRPV4 so as to enhance the function and phosphorylation of the targeted ion channel. Manipulating this signaling integrator could be a promising target for the development of novel analgesics."
https://openalex.org/W2093006514,"Background Human adult adipose tissue is an abundant source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Moreover, it is an easily accessible site producing a considerable amount of stem cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have selected and characterized stem cells within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of human adult adipose tissue with the aim of understanding their differentiation capabilities and performance. We have found, within the SVF, different cell populations expressing MSC markers – including CD34, CD90, CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD117 – and endothelial-progenitor-cell markers – including CD34, CD90, CD44, and CD54. Interestingly, CD34+/CD90+ cells formed sphere clusters, when placed in non-adherent growth conditions. Moreover, they showed a high proliferative capability, a telomerase activity that was significantly higher than that found in differentiated cells, and contained a fraction of cells displaying the phenotype of a side population. When cultured in adipogenic medium, CD34+/CD90+ quickly differentiated into adipocytes. In addition, they differentiated into endothelial cells (CD31+/VEGF+/Flk-1+) and, when placed in methylcellulose, were capable of forming capillary-like structures producing a high level of VEGF, as substantiated with ELISA tests. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that CD34+/CD90+ cells of human adipose tissue are capable of forming sphere clusters, when grown in free-floating conditions, and differentiate in endothelial cells that form capillary-like structures in methylcellulose. These cells might be suitable for tissue reconstruction in regenerative medicine, especially when patients need treatments for vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2074689259,"APPL1 is a newly identified adiponectin receptor-binding protein that positively mediates adiponectin signaling in cells. Here we report that APPL2, an isoform of APPL1 that forms a dimer with APPL1, can interacts with both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and acts as a negative regulator of adiponectin signaling in muscle cells. Overexpression of APPL2 inhibits the interaction between APPL1 and AdipoR1, leading to down-regulation of adiponectin signaling in C2C12 myotubes. In contrast, suppressing APPL2 expression by RNAi significantly enhances adiponectin-stimulated glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. In addition to targeting directly to and competing with APPL1 in binding with the adiponectin receptors, APPL2 also suppresses adiponectin and insulin signaling by sequestrating APPL1 from these two pathways. In addition to adiponectin, metformin also induces APPL1-APPL2 dissociation. Taken together, our results reveal that APPL isoforms function as an integrated Yin-Yang regulator of adiponectin signaling and mediate the cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways in muscle cells. APPL1 is a newly identified adiponectin receptor-binding protein that positively mediates adiponectin signaling in cells. Here we report that APPL2, an isoform of APPL1 that forms a dimer with APPL1, can interacts with both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 and acts as a negative regulator of adiponectin signaling in muscle cells. Overexpression of APPL2 inhibits the interaction between APPL1 and AdipoR1, leading to down-regulation of adiponectin signaling in C2C12 myotubes. In contrast, suppressing APPL2 expression by RNAi significantly enhances adiponectin-stimulated glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. In addition to targeting directly to and competing with APPL1 in binding with the adiponectin receptors, APPL2 also suppresses adiponectin and insulin signaling by sequestrating APPL1 from these two pathways. In addition to adiponectin, metformin also induces APPL1-APPL2 dissociation. Taken together, our results reveal that APPL isoforms function as an integrated Yin-Yang regulator of adiponectin signaling and mediate the cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways in muscle cells. IntroductionAdiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone that regulates energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, has been shown to be a promising therapeutic drug target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (1.Kadowaki T.

Activation of AMPK by adiponectin reduces S6 kinase-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and increases IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation thus sensitizes insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes (5.Wang C.

Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This adaptor protein was previously shown to interact with the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (p110) and Akt, which are two key kinases in the PI 3-kinase pathway downstream of the insulin receptor (7.Mitsuuchi Y.

The interaction between APPL1 and Akt is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (8.Saito T. Jones C.C. Huang S. Czech M.P. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

APPL1 has also been suggested to function as an adaptor protein in regulating follicle-stimulated hormone (FSH)-mediated PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (11.Nechamen C.A. Thomas R.M. Dias J.A. Mol.

Our results showed that APPL1 binds directly to the intracellular part of the adiponectin receptors and positively mediates adiponectin signaling to the AMPK and p38 MAPK pathways, leading to increased glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells (6.Mao X.

In addition, we found that APPL1 plays a critical role in regulating the cross-talk between adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways (6.Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J.

APPL1 has since been found to mediate adiponectin signaling in other types of cells such as endothelial cells to regulate nitric oxide production and endothelium-dependent vasodilation (13.Cheng K.K. Lam K.S. Wang Y. Huang Y. Carling D. Wu D. Wong C. Xu A. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and to protect from IL-18-mediated cell death (14.Chandrasekar B.

A recent study also suggested that APPL1 has a potentiating effect on insulin-stimulated suppression of hepatic glucose production in mice (15.Cheng K.K. Iglesia M.A. Lam K.S. Wang Y. Sweeney G.

These evidence suggest that APPL1 is an essential mediator in both adiponectin and insulin signaling, which are the two major pathways regulating energy homeostasis.APPL2 is an isoform of APPL1, and these two proteins display 54% identity in protein sequences (6.Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat.

Similar to APPL1, APPL2 contains an N-terminal BAR domain, a central PH domain, and a C-terminal PTB domain. It has been shown that APPL2 is essential for cell proliferation and embryonic development (9.Schenck A. Goto-Silva L. Collinet C. Rhinn M. Giner A. Habermann B. Brand M. Zerial M.

Recent studies indicated that APPL2 regulates FSH signaling by forming a dimer with APPL1 via the BAR domains of the isoforms, leading to the formation of a complex with the FSH receptor, APPL1 and Akt2. However, unlike APPL1, APPL2 does not directly interact with Akt2 (11.Nechamen C.A. Thomas R.M. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17.Chial H.J. Wu R. Ustach C.V. McPhail L.C. Mobley W.C. Chen Y.Q. Traffic. 2008; 9: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of APPL2 in adiponectin and insulin signaling remains largely unknown.In the present study, we show that APPL2 functions as a negative regulator in adiponectin signaling. APPL2 competes with APPL1 in the binding to AdipoR1 and blocks adiponectin signaling in muscle cells. In addition, APPL2 also sequesters APPL1 from adiponectin signal pathway by forming a heterodimer with APPL1. Adiponectin as well as metformin induces a dissociation of this complex. These results provide a mechanism for negative regulation of adiponectin signaling and adiponectin-regulated glucose and lipid metabolism in muscle cells. Furthermore, APPL2 blocks APPL1-mediated insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin in muscle cells by heterodimerizing with APPL1 to inhibit insulin-stimulated Akt activation. Our data indicate that APPL isoforms function as an integrated Yin-Yang regulator in adiponectin signaling and reveals a novel molecular mechanism for adiponectin and insulin resistance.DISCUSSIONWe have recently identified APPL1 as a critical signaling molecule that positively mediates adiponectin signaling and action (6.Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, the role of APPL2, a protein that shares a 54% identity in amino acid sequence with APPL1 (6.Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 16.Miaczynska M. Christoforidis S. Giner A. Shevchenko A. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Habermann B. Wilm M. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Cell. 2004; 116: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), was unclear. It is interesting to notice that APPL1 but not APPL2 interacts directly with Akt (11.Nechamen C.A. Thomas R.M. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the two APPL isoforms may play distinct roles in adiponectin downstream signaling and action.In the present study, we show that APPL2 negatively regulates adiponectin signaling in muscle cells (Fig. 7A). Under the basal condition, APPL2 interacts with AdipoR1 via its BAR domain (Fig. 1). The binding of APPL2 to AdipoR1 hinders the accessibility of APPL1 to AdipoR1 (Fig. 4, C and D) and thus inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK (Fig. 2). Adiponectin treatment stimulates APPL2 dissociating from AdipoR1 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2), hence facilitates the recruitment of APPL1 to AdipoR1 (Fig. 4C, E, and F and supplemental Fig. S1), which is a critical step for adiponectin signaling transduction (6.Mao X. Kikani C.K. Riojas R.A. Langlais P. Wang L. Ramos F.J. Fang Q. Christ-Roberts C.Y. Hong J.Y. Kim R.Y. Liu F. Dong L.Q. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar).In addition to interacting with AdipoR1, APPL2 also undergoes heterodimerization with APPL1. The interaction between APPL2 and APPL1 could negatively regulate adiponectin signaling by sequestering APPL1 from the adiponectin receptor (Fig. 7A). Treating cells with adiponectin or metformin promoted the dissociation between APPL1 and APPL2 (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the heterodimer could be a central node in the regulation of adiponectin signaling. Taken together with the findings that APPL1 and APPL2 migrated to distinct cellular compartments under the adiponectin/metformin-stimulatory conditions (Fig. 3), it is conceivable that a dynamic balance between association of APPL2 with APPL1 and with other molecules in the adiponectin signaling pathways could be a key mechanism regulating adiponectin signaling in cells. Interestingly, both APPL2 and AdipoR1 were simultaneously co-immunoprecipitated with APPL1 at endogenous level (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that these three molecules could form a complex in cells. Further studies will be needed to elucidate these possibilities.In addition to negatively regulating adiponectin signaling, APPL2 also plays an inhibitory role in mediating the insulin sensitizing effect of adiponectin in muscle cells (Fig. 7B). Overexpression of APPL2 blocks the synergistic effect of adiponectin on insulin-stimulated Akt activation and the effects of insulin itself on this kinase (Fig. 6A). Suppression of APPL2 expression levels, on the other hand, greatly enhanced both the sensitizer effect of adiponectin on insulin signaling and the direct insulin-simulated activation of Akt in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 6B). However, unlike APPL1, APPL2 does not interact with Akt (11.Nechamen C.A. Thomas R.M. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or PI 3-kinase (data not shown), suggesting that APPL2 may negatively regulate insulin signaling through an indirect mechanism, probably via dimerization with APPL1. It is interesting to notice that adiponectin treatment inhibits APPL1/APPL2 dimerization (Fig. 4A) and promotes APPL1 plasma membrane translocation (Fig. 3, A and C), suggesting that the adiponectin-induced dissociation of APPL1-APPL2 heterodimer may facilitate APPL1 translocation to the plasma membrane where APPL1 interacts with PI 3-kinase and Akt and promotes insulin signaling (Fig. 7B). In addition to a direct interaction with signaling molecules in the insulin signaling pathway, membrane association of APPL1 may also sensitize insulin signaling by promoting adiponectin-stimulated AMPK signaling pathway, which has been shown to suppress S6-kinase-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, leading to increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin stimulation (5.Wang C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7991-7996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Adiponectin resistance has been shown to contribute significantly to insulin resistance and its associated metabolic diseases (1.Kadowaki T.

Identification of APPL isoforms as a Yin-Yang regulator of adiponectin signaling and the adiponectin-insulin cross-talk in muscle cells provides insight not only to the molecular mechanism by which adiponectin signaling is regulated in cells but also on the identification of a potential therapeutic drug target for the treatment of insulin resistance and related disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2108733591,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have shown only modest clinical activity when used as single agents to treat cancers. They decrease tumor cell expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Hypothesizing that this might normalize tumor vasculature, we examined the effects of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib on tumor vascular function, tumor microenvironment (TME) and chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitivity.Erlotinib treatment of human tumor cells in vitro and mice bearing xenografts in vivo led to decreased HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression. Treatment altered xenograft vessel morphology assessed by confocal microscopy (following tomato lectin injection) and decreased vessel permeability (measured by Evan's blue extravasation), suggesting vascular normalization. Erlotinib increased tumor blood flow measured by Power Doppler ultrasound and decreased hypoxia measured by EF5 immunohistochemistry and tumor O(2) saturation measured by optical spectroscopy. Predicting that these changes would improve drug delivery and increase response to chemotherapy and radiation, we performed tumor regrowth studies in nude mice with xenografts treated with erlotinib and either radiotherapy or the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Erlotinib therapy followed by cisplatin led to synergistic inhibition of tumor growth compared with either treatment by itself (p<0.001). Treatment with erlotinib before cisplatin led to greater tumor growth inhibition than did treatment with cisplatin before erlotinib (p = 0.006). Erlotinib followed by radiation inhibited tumor regrowth to a greater degree than did radiation alone, although the interaction between erlotinib and radiation was not synergistic.EGFR inhibitors have shown clinical benefit when used in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapy. Our studies show that targeting tumor cells with EGFR inhibitors may modulate the TME via vascular normalization to increase response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These studies suggest ways to assess the response of tumors to EGFR inhibition using non-invasive imaging of the TME."
https://openalex.org/W2160683179,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAO A), encoded by the X chromosome, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, and plays a critically important role in brain development and functions. Abnormal MAO A activity has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which show sexual dimorphism. However, the molecular basis for these disease processes is unclear. Recently, we found that MAO A was a putative target gene directly regulated by a transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene located on the Y chromosome. We demonstrated that SRY activates both MAO A-promoter and catalytic activities in a human male neuroblastoma BE(2)C cell line. A functional SRY-binding site in the MAO A core promoter was identified and validated by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. Coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays showed that SRY and Sp1 form a transcriptional complex and synergistically activate MAO A transcription. This is the first study demonstrating that the Y-encoded transcription factor SRY is capable of regulating an X-located gene, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in neural development, brain functions, and initiation/progression of neural disorders associated with MAO A dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2124310819,"Background Metastasis is the most pivotal cause of mortality in cancer patients. Immune tolerance plays a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis. Methods and Findings In this study, we investigated the potential roles and mechanisms of TLR2 signaling on tumor metastasis in a mouse model of intravenously injected B16 melanoma cells. Multiple subtypes of TLRs were expressed on B16 cells and several human cancer cell lines; TLR2 mediated the invasive activity of these cells. High metastatic B16 cells released more heat shock protein 60 than poor metastatic B16-F1 cells. Importantly, heat shock protein 60 released by tumor cells caused a persistent activation of TLR2 and was critical in the constitutive activation of transcription factor Stat3, leading to the release of immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, targeting TLR2 markedly reduced pulmonary metastases and increased the survival of B16-bearing mice by reversing B16 cells induced immunosuppressive microenvironment and restoring tumor-killing cells such as CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages. Combining an anti-TLR2 antibody and a cytotoxic agent, gemcitabine, provided a further improvement in the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions and Significance Our results demonstrate that TLR2 is an attractive target against metastasis and that targeting immunosuppressive microenvironment using anti-TLR2 antibody is a novel therapeutic strategy for combating a life-threatening metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2066018067,"Cell fusion between circulating bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and non-hematopoietic cells is well documented in various tissues and has recently been suggested to occur in response to injury. Here we illustrate that inflammation within the intestine enhanced the level of BMDC fusion with intestinal progenitors. To identify important microenvironmental factors mediating intestinal epithelial cell fusion, we performed bone marrow transplantation into mouse models of inflammation and stimulated epithelial proliferation. Interestingly, in a non-injury model or in instances where inflammation was suppressed, an appreciable baseline level of fusion persisted. This suggests that additional mediators of cell fusion exist. A rigorous temporal analysis of early post-transplantation cellular dynamics revealed that GFP-expressing donor cells first trafficked to the intestine coincident with a striking increase in epithelial proliferation, advocating for a required fusogenic state of the host partner. Directly supporting this hypothesis, induction of augmented epithelial proliferation resulted in a significant increase in intestinal cell fusion. Here we report that intestinal inflammation and epithelial proliferation act together to promote cell fusion. While the physiologic impact of cell fusion is not yet known, the increased incidence in an inflammatory and proliferative microenvironment suggests a potential role for cell fusion in mediating the progression of intestinal inflammatory diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2157893431,"Studies of natural animal populations reveal widespread evidence for the diffusion of novel behaviour patterns, and for intra- and inter-population variation in behaviour. However, claims that these are manifestations of animal 'culture' remain controversial because alternative explanations to social learning remain difficult to refute. This inability to identify social learning in social settings has also contributed to the failure to test evolutionary hypotheses concerning the social learning strategies that animals deploy.We present a solution to this problem, in the form of a new means of identifying social learning in animal populations. The method is based on the well-established premise of social learning research, that--when ecological and genetic differences are accounted for--social learning will generate greater homogeneity in behaviour between animals than expected in its absence. Our procedure compares the observed level of homogeneity to a sampling distribution generated utilizing randomization and other procedures, allowing claims of social learning to be evaluated according to consensual standards. We illustrate the method on data from groups of monkeys provided with novel two-option extractive foraging tasks, demonstrating that social learning can indeed be distinguished from unlearned processes and a social learning, and revealing that the monkeys only employed social learning for the more difficult tasks. The method is further validated against published datasets and through simulation, and exhibits higher statistical power than conventional inferential statistics.The method is potentially a significant technological development, which could prove of considerable value in assessing the validity of claims for culturally transmitted behaviour in animal groups. It will also be of value in enabling investigation of the social learning strategies deployed in captive and natural animal populations."
https://openalex.org/W2108778778,"Background Highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are the two most important poultry viruses in the world. Natural low-virulence NDV strains have been used as vaccines over the past 70 years with proven track records. We have previously developed a reverse genetics system to produce low-virulent NDV vaccine strain LaSota from cloned cDNA. This system allows us to use NDV as a vaccine vector for other avian pathogens. Methodology/Principal Finding Here, we constructed two recombinant NDVs (rNDVs) each of which expresses the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of HPAIV H5N1strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 from an added gene. In one, rNDV (rNDV-HA), the open reading frame (ORF) of HA gene was expressed without modification. In the second, rNDV (rNDV-HAF), the ORF was modified so that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the encoded HA gene were replaced with those of the NDV F protein. The insertion of either version of the HA ORF did not increase the virulence of the rNDV vector. The HA protein was found to be incorporated into the envelopes of both rNDV-HA and rNDV-HAF. However, there was an enhanced incorporation of the HA protein in rNDV-HAF. Chickens immunized with a single dose of either rNDV-HA or rNDV-HAF induced a high titer of HPAIV H5-specific antibodies and were completely protected against challenge with NDV as well as lethal challenges of both homologous and heterologous HPAIV H5N1. Conclusion and Significance Our results suggest that these chimeric viruses have potential as safe and effective bivalent vaccines against NDV and. HPAIV. These vaccines will be convenient and affordable, which will be highly beneficial to the poultry industry. Furthermore, immunization with these vaccines will permit serological differentiation of vaccinated and avian influenza field virus infected animals."
https://openalex.org/W1970700859,"Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease targeting the insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Naturally occurring FOXP3+CD4+CD25high regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in dominant tolerance, suppressing autoreactive CD4+ effector T cell activity. Previously, in both recent-onset T1D patients and β cell antibody-positive at-risk individuals, we observed increased apoptosis and decreased function of polyclonal Tregs in the periphery. Our objective here was to elucidate the genes and signaling pathways triggering apoptosis in Tregs from T1D subjects. Principal Findings Gene expression profiles of unstimulated Tregs from recent-onset T1D (n = 12) and healthy control subjects (n = 15) were generated. Statistical analysis was performed using a Bayesian approach that is highly efficient in determining differentially expressed genes with low number of replicate samples in each of the two phenotypic groups. Microarray analysis showed that several cytokine/chemokine receptor genes, HLA genes, GIMAP family genes and cell adhesion genes were downregulated in Tregs from T1D subjects, relative to control subjects. Several downstream target genes of the AKT and p53 pathways were also upregulated in T1D subjects, relative to controls. Further, expression signatures and increased apoptosis in Tregs from T1D subjects partially mirrored the response of healthy Tregs under conditions of IL-2 deprivation. CD4+ effector T-cells from T1D subjects showed a marked reduction in IL-2 secretion. This could indicate that prior to and during the onset of disease, Tregs in T1D may be caught up in a relatively deficient cytokine milieu. Conclusions In summary, expression signatures in Tregs from T1D subjects reflect a cellular response that leads to increased sensitivity to apoptosis, partially due to cytokine deprivation. Further characterization of these signaling cascades should enable the detection of genes that can be targeted for restoring Treg function in subjects predisposed to T1D."
https://openalex.org/W2031533713,"In fibrotic conditions increases in TG2 activity has been linked to an increase in the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. Using TG2 transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressing TG2 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated inducible promoter, we demonstrate that induction of TG2 not only stimulates an increase in collagen and fibronectin deposition but also an increase in the expression of these proteins. Increased TG2 expression in these fibroblasts led to NF-kappaB activation, resulting in the increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta(1). In addition, cells overexpressing TG2 demonstrated an increase in biologically active TGFbeta(1) in the extracellular environment. A specific site-directed inhibitor of TG abolished the NF-kappaB and TGFbeta1 activation and the subsequent elevation in the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, confirming that this process depends on the induction of transglutaminase activity. Treatment of TG2-induced fibroblasts with nontoxic doses of nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine resulted in decreased TG2 activity and apprehension of the inactive enzyme on the cell surface. This was paralleled by a reduction in activation of NF-kappaB and TGFbeta(1) production with a subsequent decrease in collagen expression and deposition. These findings support a role for NO in the regulation of TG2 function in the extracellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1964838687,"Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses performed on cartilage tissue extracts identified the serine protease HtrA1/PRSS11 as a major protein component of human articular cartilage, with elevated levels occurring in association with osteoarthritis. Overexpression of a catalytically active form of HtrA1, but not an active site mutant (S328A), caused a marked reduction in proteoglycan content in chondrocyte-seeded alginate cultures. Aggrecan degradation fragments were detected in conditioned media from the alginate cultures overexpressing active HtrA1. Incubation of native or recombinant aggrecan with wild type HtrA1 resulted in distinct cleavage of these substrates. Cleavage of aggrecan by HtrA1 was strongly enhanced by HtrA1 agonists such as CPII, a C-terminal hexapeptide derived from the C-propeptide of procollagen IIalpha1 (i.e. chondrocalcin). A novel HtrA1-susceptible cleavage site within the interglobular domain (IGD) of aggrecan was identified, and an antibody that specifically recognizes the neoepitope sequence (VQTV(356)) generated at the HtrA1 cleavage site was developed. Western blot analysis demonstrated that HtrA1-generated aggrecan fragments containing the VQTV(356) neoepitope were significantly more abundant in osteoarthritic cartilage compared with cartilage from healthy joints, implicating HtrA1 as a critical protease involved in proteoglycan turnover and cartilage degradation during degenerative joint disease."
https://openalex.org/W2016390984,"Lipoproteins of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria carry a thioether-bound diacylglycerol but differ by a fatty acid amide bound to the alpha-amino group of the universally conserved cysteine. In Escherichia coli the N-terminal acylation is catalyzed by the N-acyltransferase Lnt. Using E. coli Lnt as a query in a BLASTp search, we identified putative lnt genes also in Gram-positive mycobacteria. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein LppX, heterologously expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, was N-acylated at the N-terminal cysteine, whereas LppX expressed in a M. smegmatis lnt::aph knock-out mutant was accessible for N-terminal sequencing. Western blot analyses of a truncated and tagged form of LppX indicated a smaller size of about 0.3 kDa in the lnt::aph mutant compared with the parental strain. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyses of a trypsin digest of LppX proved the presence of the diacylglycerol modification in both strains, the parental strain and lnt::aph mutant. N-Acylation was found exclusively in the M. smegmatis parental strain. Complementation of the lnt::aph mutant with M. tuberculosis ppm1 restored N-acylation. The substrate for N-acylation is a C16 fatty acid, whereas the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol residue were identified as C16 and C19:0 fatty acid, the latter most likely tuberculostearic acid. We demonstrate that mycobacterial lipoproteins are triacylated. For the first time to our knowledge, we identify Lnt activity in Gram-positive bacteria and assigned the responsible genes. In M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis the open reading frames are annotated as MSMEG_3860 and M. tuberculosis ppm1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2050000588,"A major mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, etc.) is the production of beta-lactamases. A handful of class A beta-lactamases have been discovered that have acquired the ability to turn over carbapenem antibiotics. This is a disconcerting development, as carbapenems are often considered last resort antibiotics in the treatment of difficult infections. The GES family of beta-lactamases constitutes a group of extended spectrum resistance enzymes that hydrolyze penicillins and cephalosporins avidly. A single amino acid substitution at position 170 has expanded the breadth of activity to include carbapenems. The basis for this expansion of activity is investigated in this first report of detailed steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of carbapenem hydrolysis, performed with a class A carbapenemase. Monitoring the turnover of imipenem (a carbapenem) by GES-1 (Gly-170) revealed the acylation step as rate-limiting. GES-2 (Asn-170) has an enhanced rate of acylation, compared with GES-1, and no longer has a single rate-determining step. Both the acylation and deacylation steps are of equal magnitude. GES-5 (Ser-170) exhibits an enhancement of the rate constant for acylation by a remarkable 5000-fold, whereby the enzyme acylation event is no longer rate-limiting. This carbapenemase exhibits k(cat)/K(m) of 3 x 10(5) m(-1)s(-1), which is sufficient for manifestation of resistance against imipenem."

The study also identifies a new class of K-Ras nanocluster regulator that operates independently of the structural scaffold galectin-3. Ras proteins are small GTPases that function as molecular switches on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, conveying extracellular signals to the cell interior. Ras proteins are critical regulators of signal transduction pathways controlling key cell fates such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deregulation of these pathways results in aberrant cell growth and tumor formation. Mutations that render Ras constitutively active are found in ∼15% of human cancers, making Ras one of the most clinically significant proteins in human carcinogenesis. Oncogenic mutations are most prevalent in the K-Ras gene, accounting for a large proportion of solid tumors including 90% of pancreatic cancer, 50% of colon cancer, and 30% of non-small cell lung cancer (1Bos J.L.

These minimal anchors, together with flanking protein sequences and the G-domain, interact with lipids and proteins of the plasma membrane, driving the Ras isoforms into spatially and structurally distinct nanodomains on the plasma membrane (5Abankwa D.

For example, NPM exhibits ribonuclease activity and preferentially cleaves pre-rRNA. NPM and nucleolin also have functions outside of the nucleolus. Both proteins shuttle between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm (20Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition cytosolic NPM is involved in centrosome duplication (22Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G.

Like Ras proteins, NPM and nucleolin regulate cell proliferation and transformation and are overexpressed in multiple cancers (23Lim M.J. Wang X.W. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2006; 30: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of NPM in carcinogenesis remains controversial because it has been described as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor (23Lim M.J. Wang X.W. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2006; 30: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study we identify NPM and nucleolin as proteins that interact specifically with K-Ras but not H-Ras. Furthermore we definitively identify a subset of NPM and nucleolin on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where both proteins interact with K-Ras. Importantly, NPM and nucleolin stabilize K-Ras levels on the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in the K-Ras clustered fraction, which amplifies signal output from the MAPK pathway. Combined, our data indicate that NPM and nucleolin play a critical role in signal transduction via the MAPK pathway.

RFP-NPM and RFP-nucleolin was subcloned using cDNA (obtained from the Microarray Facility, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland) into an mRFP vector. NPM deletion mutants, the N-terminal region of NPM (Nt-NPM) (1–119), acidic domain of NPM (120–188), and the C-terminal region of NPM (189–294), were generated by PCR using full-length NPM as a template. PCR fragments were subcloned into pEGFP. All of the point mutations were introduced by PCR mutagenesis. Antibodies against NPM were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc., nucleolin was from Sigma, Raf-1 and Ras were from BD transduction Laboratories, ERKpp was from Cell Signaling Technology, and K-Ras and upstream binding factor (UBF) were from Santa Cruz. GFP and RFP antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant proteins and affinity-purified from serum. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) and 293T cells were grown and maintained in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested after 24 h. Where necessary, the cells were serum-starved for 3 h prior to harvest. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. GST fusion proteins were purified from Sf9 cell lysates by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma); washed extensively in 1 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol; and then equilibrated three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. Mouse brain cytosol was prepared by incubating minced tissue (14 mouse brains) in 5 volumes of a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 30 min on ice. The minced brain was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica) at 15,000 rpm for four 10-s bursts. The lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Clarified cytosol was incubated with the prepared GST beads for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed ten times for 5 min with buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were transferred to a new tube, eluted in 30 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue-stained gel bands were excised and digested with trypsin as described in Ref. 25Hill M.M. Adrain C. Duriez P.J. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar. The peptides were spotted onto MALDI target using 5 mg/ml α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 5 mm ammonium phosphate, and 0.1% formic acid as matrix. A calibration mixture containing 1 pmol of des-Arg-bradykinin, 2 pmol of angiotensin I, 1.3 pmol of Glu-Fibrino-peptide B, 2 pmol of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (1–17 clip), 1.5 pmol of ACTH (18–39 clip), and 3 pmol of ACTH (7–38 clip) was diluted 10-fold in the matrix and spotted on the same MALDI plate. The samples were analyzed using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF-TOF (Applied Biosystems). After plate calibration for MS and MS/MS, 1000 MS spectra were accumulated for all spots using a MS positive ion reflectron mode acquisition method at a laser energy of 3400. The TOF-MS spectra were analyzed using the Peak Picker software supplied with the instrument. The 10 most abundant spectral peaks that met the threshold (>20:1 signal:noise) criteria were included in the acquisition list for the TOF-TOF. MS/MS data from the TOF-TOF was acquired using the default positive ion, 1-kV collision energy, reflectron mode, at a laser energy of 4200. The threshold criteria were set as follows: mass range, 850–4000 Da; minimum cluster area, 500; minimum signal-to-noise, 20; maximum number of ms/ms spectra per spot, 10. A mass filter excluding matrix cluster ions and trypsin autolysis peaks was applied. Data base searching of noninterpreted TOF-MS and TOF-TOF MS/MS data were carried out using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) and the MSDB data base. The following parameters were used: peptide mass tolerance, 0.4 Da; fragment mass tolerance, 0.2 Da; fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation, variable methionine oxidation, maximum one missed cleavage. The cells were subjected to hypotonic lysis, and the post-nuclear supernatant was isolated as previously described (3Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Where required cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions were further fractionated from the post-nuclear supernatant by a 30 min, 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation at 4 °C. The lysates were solubilized with Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then nonsoluble proteins were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The appropriate antibody was coupled to protein G-conjugated magnetic D (Dynal) and then incubated with the lysate diluted in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.33 ng/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 3.3 ng/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 90 min rotating at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 60 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The beads were resuspended into sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using semi-dry transfer. The membranes were probed with primary and secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Isolated membrane (P100) and cytosolic (S100) fractions from transfected cells were resolved on precast 4–15% gels (Bio-Rad) under native conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using wet transfer. The membranes were probed with primary and secondary horseradish peroxidase antibodies and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride and then permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton, 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h each, and then coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Fluorescent microscopy of plasma membrane sheets was performed based on Ref. 26Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar. Briefly, the cells grown on coverslips were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in poly-l-lysine for 1 min. The coverslips were washed three times for 5 s in 1/3 Buffer A and then briefly in buffer A. The cells were blasted once or twice with 1 ml of buffer A, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, mounted in Mowiol, and imaged on a fluorescent microscope. Apical plasma membrane sheets were prepared from BHK cells, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and labeled with anti-GFP or anti-RFP antibodies conjugated directly to 5-nm gold as described previously (7Plowman S.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Digital images of the immunogold labeled plasma membrane sheets were taken at 100,000× magnification (Jeol 1011). Intact 1-μm2 areas of the sheet were identified using Image J, and the (x,y) coordinates of the gold particles were determined as described (7Plowman S.J. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Proc.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Bootstrap tests to examine the differences between replicated point patterns were constructed exactly as described previously (27Besag J. Diggle P.J. Appl. Stat. 1977; 26: 329-333Crossref Google Scholar, 28Diggle P.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1986; 18: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Diggle P.J. Mateu J. Clough H.E. Adv. Appl. Prob. 2000; 32: 331-343Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the statistical significance was evaluated against 1000 bootstrap samples. To identify proteins that specifically interact with K-Ras, we used affinity chromatography with the farnesylated hypervariable domain of K-Ras (Fig. 1A). The HVR of K-Ras (CTK) was expressed as a C-terminal GST fusion protein in Sf9 cells. GST-CTH, constructed from the HVR of H-Ras, was similarly produced and used as a control to allow the identification of K-Ras-specific interacting proteins. GST-CTK and GST-CTH were separately purified onto glutathione-agarose beads and used as bait with clarified mouse brain cytosol. After extensive washing of the beads, bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie-stained (Fig. 1B). Selected bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Two proteins that bound specifically to CTK but not CTH were NPM and nucleolin (Table 1). To further explore these observations, we used GFP fusions of the HVR of K-Ras and H-Ras (GFP-CTK and GFP-CTH), and GFP fusions of the minimal membrane anchors of K-Ras and H-Ras (GFP-tK and GFP-tH) (Fig. 1A). To confirm the identity of the CTK-binding proteins and the specificity of the interactions, we ectopically expressed GFP-CTK, GFP-tK, GFP-CTH, and GFP-tH with RFP-NPM or RFP-nucleolin in BHK cells. We performed immunoprecipitations from post-nuclear supernatants using an anti-GFP antibody and immunoblotted using an anti-RFP antibody (Fig. 1C). These experiments demonstrated that RFP-NPM and RFP-nucleolin selectively bind to GFP-CTK but not GFP-CTH. RFP-NPM, but not RFP-nucleolin, also bound to the minimal membrane anchor of K-Ras (GFP-tK). Neither RFP-NPM nor RFP-nucleolin bound to the minimal membrane anchor of H-Ras (GFP-tH). We next ectopically expressed full-length GFP-K-Ras and GFP-H-Ras in BHK cells and found that endogenous NPM and endogenous nucleolin both selectively bound to GFP-K-Ras but not GFP-H-Ras (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that although NPM and nucleolin are predominately nucleolar proteins, both have a non-nuclear fraction that selectively interacts with the C-terminal HVR of K-Ras. We chose to further explore the functional significance of the K-Ras-NPM interaction.TABLE 1Identification of K-Ras-interacting proteins by MALDI-TOF-TOFProtein identification (accession number)Peptides matchedSequence coverageMOWSE score (MS and MS/MS)aThe threshold score for p < 0.05 is 59.%Nucleophosmin/NPM (I52858) #1931211Nucleophosmin/NPM (I52858) #282961Nucleolin/C23 (P09405) #11833304Nucleolin/C23 (P09405) #2101796a The threshold score for p < 0.05 is 59. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1C shows that the hypervariable region (CTK) and the minimal membrane anchor (tK) of K-Ras both interact with NPM. To investigate whether the linker region of Ras (amino acids 166–172) contributes in any way to NPM binding, we replaced the linker region of full-length GFP-H-Ras (residues 166–172) with the corresponding linker residues of K-Ras (=GFP-H-Ras+KL). The complementary protein GFP-K-Ras+HL was engineered to comprise full-length K-Ras but with residues 166–172 replaced with the corresponding H-Ras linker residues. The results in Fig. 2A show that full-length K-Ras and K-Ras-HL both bound NPM, whereas H-Ras-KL did not. We conclude that the linker region of K-Ras does not contribute to the interaction with NPM and that the minimal membrane region is solely responsible for the specific interaction between K-Ras and NPM. Two key motifs of the minimal membrane anchor of K-Ras are the polybasic domain and the prenylated cysteine at residue 185. To test whether these motifs are both necessary for the interaction with NPM, we replaced six consecutive lysines of the polybasic domain in constitutively active GFP-K-RasG12V with glutamines (GFP-K-RasG12V,6Q). We also replaced Cys185 with serine (GFP-K-RasG12V,C185S) to abolish farnesylation. When co-expressed with mRFP-NPM in HEK293T cells, GFP-K-RasG12V, but not GFP-H-RasG12V bound to NPM (Fig. 2B). GFP-K-RasG12V,6Q, however, did not co-immunoprecipitate mRFP-NPM, showing that the polybasic domain is essential for binding to NPM. Interestingly, blocking K-Ras farnesylation (GFP K-RasG12V,C185S) actually increased the affinity of K-Ras for NPM, suggesting that prenylation negatively regulates the interaction. These experiments, in conjunction with those in Figs. 2A and 1D also show that the nucleotide, GTP or GDP, bound to K-Ras does not regulate NPM binding. Throughout the rest of this study the mutational analysis is confined to K-RasG12V, because this allows a functional output to be measured. Phosphorylation of Ser181 modulates the electrostatic interactions of K-Ras with the plasma membrane nanoclusters (10Plowman S.J. Ariotti N. Goodall A. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell.

Pérez de Castro I. Li C. Thompson C.B. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Mol Cell. 2006; 21: 481-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the NPM-K-Ras interaction is also sensitive to Ser181 phosphorylation. Fig. 2B clearly shows that the phospho-mimetic mutation S181D reduced the affinity of GFP-K-RasG12V S181D for NPM. In contrast the phospho-mimetic mutation T183E had no significant effect on the affinity of GFP-K-RasG12V,T183E for NPM (Fig. 2B). To map the NPM binding site for K-Ras, we analyzed a set of GFP-tagged NPM deletion mutants (Fig. 3A) using co-immunoprecipitation assays and post-nuclear supernatants prepared from BHK cells. The results clearly show that Nt-NPM is responsible for the interaction with K-Ras (Fig. 3A). Of note, this N-terminal region of NPM has been shown previously to be important for NPM pentamer formation and chaperone activity (21Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The isolated acidic domain or C-terminal region of NPM showed no interaction with K-Ras. By fluorescent microscopy, mRFP-NPM appears to be exclusively nucleolar, and we observed no convincing co-localization with GFP-K-RasG12V (Fig. 3B). However, because the extranuclear pool of NPM is of considerably lower abundance than the nucleolar fraction, it is difficult to detect by fluorescent microscopy. In contrast, the Nt-NPM fragment of NPM displays a much greater cytosolic fraction, and when co-expressed with K-RasG12V, it clearly co-localizes at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Our results so far indicate that the interaction between K-Ras and NPM is extranuclear. To further pinpoint the location of this interaction, we fractionated the post-nuclear supernatant of BHK cells into cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions and assessed the localization of GFP-K-RasG12V and endogenous NPM (Fig. 4A). We observed NPM in both fractions, but it was more abundant in the membrane fraction. As expected, GFP-K-RasG12V was more abundant in the membrane fraction but also displayed a cytosolic pool. To exclude the possibility of contamination by nuclear material, we probed for histone H3 in the subcellular fractions. Histone H3 was detected exclusively in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that the NPM detected in the P100 and S100 fractions was not due to nuclear contamination. Next we immunoprecipitated GFP-K-RasG12V from S100 and P100 fractions and probed for NPM. Interestingly, we observed that NPM interacts with K-Ras exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4A). However, it is important to note that because the abundance of NPM and K-Ras G12V is considerably lower in the S100 fraction, we cannot exclude the possibility that an interaction in the cytosol is not detected because it is below the sensitivity of the Western blot. As a positive control, Raf-1, which also interacts with K-Ras only at the plasma membrane, was co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras exclusively from the membrane fraction. We performed reciprocal immunoprecipitations with anti-NPM antibody on the P100 fraction but this time probed for endogenous Ras. Fig. 4B shows that endogenous Ras binds to endogenous NPM in the membrane fraction. To extend this demonstration of endogenous interactions, we immunoprecipitated NPM and the irrelevant nucleolar protein, UBF, from BHK cell post-nuclear supernatant and blotted for endogenous K-Ras. We could also specifically detect endogenous K-Ras interacting with endogenous NPM but not with UBF (Fig. 4C). Note that only a small amount of UBF was present in the post-nuclear supernatant, which was enriched by immunoprecipitation. However, the UBF antibody detected a band of the same expected size in combined crude nuclear and membrane extract (Fig. 4C, right lane). We further tested Ras binding specificity with a second nucleolar protein, fibrillarin, and again found no evidence of endogenous Ras in fibrillarin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C). The reverse experiment of identifying endogenous NPM in endogenous K-Ras immunoprecipitates is not technically possible because the isoform-specific K-Ras antibody recognizes and blocks the polybasic domain that binds NPM. Interestingly, the immunoprecipitates in Fig. 4A show that endogenous nucleolin is also present in membrane imm"
https://openalex.org/W2067729192,"The metabolic pathway of folate is thought to influence DNA stability either by inducing single/double stranded breaks or by producing low levels of S-adenosyl-methionine leading to abnormal gene expression and chromosome segregation. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding enzymes in the folate metabolism pathway show distinct geographic and/or ethnic variations and in some cases have been linked to disease. Notably, the gene Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) in which the homozygous (TT) state of the polymorphism c.665C>T (p.A222V) is associated with reduced specific activity and increased thermolability of the enzyme causing mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Recently several studies have suggested that men carrying this polymorphism may be at increased risk to develop infertility.We have tested this hypothesis in a case/control study of ethnic French individuals. We examined the incidence of polymorphisms in the genes MTHFR (R68Q, A222V and E429A), Methionine synthase reductase MTRR; (I22M and S175L) and Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS; G307S). The case population consisted of DNA samples from men with unexplained azoospermia (n = 70) or oligozoospermia (n = 182) and the control population consisted of normospermic and fertile men (n = 114). We found no evidence of an association between the incidence of any of these variants and reduced sperm counts. In addition haplotype analysis did not reveal differences between the case and control populations.We could find no evidence for an association between reduced sperm counts and polymorphisms in enzymes involved in folate metabolism in the French population."
https://openalex.org/W2153830788,"Background The bronchial asthma, a clinical complication of persistent inflammation of the airway and subsequent airway hyper-responsiveness, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Several studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in initiation as well as amplification of inflammation in airways. However, still there are no good anti-oxidant strategies available for therapeutic intervention in asthma pathogenesis. Most recent studies suggest that polyol pathway enzyme, aldose reductase (AR), contributes to the pathogenesis of oxidative stress–induced inflammation by affecting the NF-κB-dependent expression of cytokines and chemokines and therefore inhibitors of AR could be anti-inflammatory. Since inhibitors of AR have already gone through phase-III clinical studies for diabetic complications and found to be safe, our hypothesis is that AR inhibitors could be novel therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of asthma. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of AR inhibition in the prevention of allergic responses to a common natural airborne allergen, ragweed pollen that leads to airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness in a murine model of asthma. Methods and Findings Primary Human Small Airway Epithelial Cells (SAEC) were used to investigate the in vitro effects of AR inhibition on ragweed pollen extract (RWE)-induced cytotoxic and inflammatory signals. Our results indicate that inhibition of AR prevents RWE -induced apoptotic cell death as measured by annexin-v staining, increase in the activation of NF-κB and expression of inflammatory markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cycloxygenase (COX)-2, Prostaglandin (PG) E2, IL-6 and IL-8. Further, BALB/c mice were sensitized with endotoxin-free RWE in the absence and presence of AR inhibitor and followed by evaluation of perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, mucin production, eosinophils infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness. Our results indicate that inhibition of AR prevents airway inflammation and production of inflammatory cytokines, accumulation of eosinophils in airways and sub-epithelial regions, mucin production in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and airway hyperresponsiveness in mice. Conclusions These results suggest that airway inflammation due to allergic response to RWE, which subsequently activates oxidative stress-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB-dependent mechanism, could be prevented by AR inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of AR could have clinical implications, especially for the treatment of airway inflammation, a major cause of asthma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1985830678,"Mutations in the TNF family ligand EDA1 cause X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED), a condition characterized by defective development of skin appendages. The EDA1 protein displays a proteolytic processing site responsible for its conversion to a soluble form, a collagen domain, and a trimeric TNF homology domain (THD) that binds the receptor EDAR. In-frame deletions in the collagen domain reduced the thermal stability of EDA1. Removal of the collagen domain decreased its activity about 100-fold, as measured with natural and engineered EDA1-responsive cell lines. The collagen domain could be functionally replaced by multimerization domains or by cross-linking antibodies, suggesting that it functions as an oligomerization unit. Surprisingly, mature soluble EDA1 containing the collagen domain was poorly active when administered in newborn, EDA-deficient (Tabby) mice. This was due to a short stretch of basic amino acids located at the N terminus of the collagen domain that confers EDA1 with proteoglycan binding ability. In contrast to wild-type EDA1, EDA1 with mutations in this basic sequence was a potent inducer of tail hair development in vivo. Thus, the collagen domain activates EDA1 by multimerization, whereas the proteoglycan-binding domain may restrict the distribution of endogeneous EDA1 in vivo.

Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). For some family members, these trimeric complexes are biologically active. For example, trimers of TNF and TWEAK (TNF homologue with weak apoptosis-inducing activity) signal cell death in their respective target cells, and cross-linking of several trimers, via the action of an anti-Flag antibody, does not result in increased activity (2Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). For other ligands, the trimeric, soluble complexes are not or only poorly biologically active, but their membrane-bound forms are. This is the case, among others, for FasL and CD40L. These ligands can however become active in a soluble form if trimers are cross-linked, either with antibodies, or by fusion with oligomerizing proteins, such as the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, or the collagen domain of ACRP/adiponectin (2Schneider P.

Ectodysplasin A (EDA) is a TNF family ligand involved in the development of various structures derived from the ectoderm, such as hair, teeth, and sweat glands, and EDA loss of function in mouse and human is associated with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (OMIM 305100). Of the several EDA isoforms that have been described, two of which comprise the TNF homology domain, only EDA1 has been implicated in the development of ectodermal appendages (4Cui C.Y. Schlessinger D. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2477-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Mikkola M.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2008; 19: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor through the EDA1 receptor (EDAR) is a central signaling event as suggested by the ectodermal dysplasia phenotype of NF-κB-compromised mice (6Schmidt-Ullrich R. Aebischer T. Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Klemm U. Scheidereit C. Development. 2001; 128: 3843-3853PubMed Google Scholar), and by the fact that early events of placode formation can be initiated by EDAR-independent NF-κB signals (7Schmidt-Ullrich R. Tobin D.J. Lenhard D. Schneider P. Paus R. Scheidereit C. Development. 2006; 133: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One relevant NF-κB target downstream of EDAR is CTGF/CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor/CCN family protein2) that locally counteracts inhibitors of placode fate, thus allowing placode formation at the site of EDAR signaling in embryonic skin (8Mou C.

Laurikkala J. Schneider P. Thesleff I. Mikkola M.L. Development. 2007; 134: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that EDA1 trimers must probably be aggregated in order to signal. First, EDA1 possesses a collagen domain that may potentially aggregate the TNF homology domain (10Monreal A.W. Zonana J. Ferguson B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 380-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Second, inactive trimeric FasL is partially activated by fusion with the collagen domain of EDA1 (11Schneider P. Street S.L. Gaide O. Hertig S. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Runkel L. Alevizopoulos K. Ferguson B.M. Zonana J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18819-18827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Third, a number of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XL-HED) patients have point mutations or in-frame deletions in the collagen domain that suggest this domain fulfills a functional role (11Schneider P. Street S.L. Gaide O. Hertig S. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Runkel L. Alevizopoulos K. Ferguson B.M. Zonana J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18819-18827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Fourth, fusion of the EDA1 receptor-binding domain to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin yields a biologically active ligand (12Gaide O. Schneider P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, it has never been formally demonstrated that EDA1 needs to be cross-linked to be active, and that the collagen domain of EDA1 fulfills this cross-linking function. Using an EDA1-dependent NF-κB activation assay in HaCat keratinocytes and a specific biological assay to measure oligomerization of EDA1 trimers, we demonstrate here that the collagen domain is required for EDA1 to signal efficiently through EDAR. This function of the collagen domain can be mimicked by antibody-mediated cross-linking, or by fusion of the TNF homology domain of EDA1 to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. In vivo, the biological activity of exogenously administered EDA1 is also dependent on multimerization, but to a lesser extent than predicted by in vitro results, and is additionally negatively regulated by a newly identified, evolutionarily conserved heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-binding region that may restrict biodistribution of the protein. 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). HaCat cells were grown in DMEM:NutMix-F12 (1:1, v/v), 5% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 9 ng/ml of cholera toxin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml of insulin (Sigma), 24.3 μg/ml of adenosine (Sigma), 10 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (Sigma), and 0.5 μg/ml of hydroxycortisone (Sigma). Jurkat and Jurkat-EDAR:Fas cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were passaged twice weekly. HaCat cells were trypsinized. When cells were analyzed by FACS, however, they were detached with PBS, 1 mm EDTA. Retroviruses were produced essentially as described previously (13Soneoka Y. Cannon P.M. Ramsdale E.E. Griffiths J.C. Romano G. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with pMSCVpuro-EDAR:Fas and co-transfected with the pHIT60 and VSV-G plasmids, containing the sequences for gag-pol and VSV-G, respectively. pMSCVpuro-EDAR:Fas encodes the extracellular domain of human EDAR (amino acids 1–183), amino acids VD and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of human Fas (amino acids 169–335). After transfection, 293T cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. Fas-deficient Jurkat-JOM2 cells were a kind gift of Olivier Micheau (University of Dijon, France). Jurkat-JOM2 cells (106 cells in 1 ml) were mixed with virus-containing supernatants (3 ml) supplemented with 8 μg/ml of polybrene, left for 15 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged for 1 h at 37 °C and at 450 × g (1500 rpm). Cells were selected with 5 μg/ml of puromycin and cloned. About 40 clones were tested for their sensitivity to Fc-EDA1 (12Gaide O. Schneider P. Nat.

HaCat IκBα-DN cells were generated in a similar way using pMSCVpuro-IκBα-S32G vector, except that cells were not cloned but used as a population. Expression constructs were cloned into the PCR3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) according to standard molecular biology techniques. Vector for expression of Flag-tagged ligands, ACRP-ligands, Fc-ligands, receptors-Fc, receptors-GPI, and receptors-COMP-Flag have been described previously (3Holler N. Tardivel A.

Fc-ligands with a PreScission protease cleavage site were constructed by insertion of the Prescission site in the Fc-ligand vector. Details regarding plasmids used in this study and the proteins they encode are provided in supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1, respectively. 106 293T cells were seeded in 8 ml of medium in a 10-cm diameter dish and transfected ∼8 h later. The transfection was performed by mixing 7 μg of plasmid of interest and 1 μg of EGFP tracer plasmid with 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2. Sterile water was then added to 500 μl. While vortexing the DNA mix, 500 μl of 2× HeBS buffer was added dropwise (16.4 g of NaCl, 11.9 g of Hepes, acid form, 0.21 g of Na2HPO4, 800 ml of H2O, adjusted to pH 7.05 with NaOH, and finally brought to 1 liter and filtrated). The transfection mix was added to cells within 1 min after mixing. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and 8 ml of fresh medium was added (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum or serum-free Opti-MEM1 medium). Two days before stimulation, cells were seeded in 24-well plates (105 cells/well). The day before stimulation, cells were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM medium, 50 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin. On the day of stimulation, medium was removed, and 0.5–1 ml of fresh DMEM (no serum) was added that contained the ligand of interest either in a purified form (between 0.05 and 1 μg/ml) or as Opti-MEM supernatants. Conditioned Opti-MEM supernatant was concentrated 20 times in Amicon Ultra filter devices (molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da). Immunoprecipitations were performed on 200–400 μl of Opti-MEM supernatant (or 10–20 μl of concentrated Opti-MEM) with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. 1 μg of hEDAR-Fc was added if the target EDA1 protein did not contain an Fc moiety. PBS was added to a final volume of 400 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and transferred into a mini column made of a 200-μl tip plugged with a 1-mm diameter “stopper,” eluted with 15–20 μl of 100 mm sodium citrate pH 4, and neutralized with the appropriate volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9. For heparin-Sepharose pull-downs (GE Healthcare), 10 μl of beads freshly rehydrated in PBS were mixed with 750 μl of Opti-MEM supernatant in PBS (1:1 v/v), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, transferred into a mini column, washed with PBS, and eluted with 15 μl of PBS supplemented with 0.8 m NaCl. HaCat cells were harvested at defined time points. Plates were put on ice, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and one tablet/50 ml of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)). Plates were briefly vortexed, cells were scraped from the plate, and the lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm (16,000 × g) in a tabletop centrifuge. Protein concentration in cell lysate supernatants was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EDA1 serum AL166 (11Schneider P. Street S.L. Gaide O. Hertig S. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Runkel L. Alevizopoulos K. Ferguson B.M. Zonana J. J. Biol.

Blots were revealed with ECL (GE Healthcare). Various Flag-tagged EDA1 constructs were purified from supernatants of transiently transfected 293T cells using anti-Flag M2-agarose (Sigma). Flag-EDA1 were eluted with citrate-NaOH, pH 3 and neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 9. Buffer was exchanged for PBS, and the protein was stored at −70 °C until use. Fc-PreScission-EDA1-E245, Fc-EDA-A238, and hEDAR-PreScission-Fc proteins were purified from culture supernatants of stably transfected CHO cell clones by protein A affinity chromatography (15Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 322-345Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity assay using EDAR:Fas Jurkat cells was performed as described for FasL on Jurkat cells (2Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Proteins were digested in PBS, 1 mm EDTA with 40 units/ml of GST-Prescission protease (GE Healthcare). Digestions were performed either in solution or on protein A-Sepharose beads for 24 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Digestion efficiency was checked by Western blotting with anti-EDA1 antibodies. 100 μg of Fc-PreScission-EDA1-E245 (cleaved or not with PreScission protease), were applied onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in PBS at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 250 μl were collected, of which 10 μl were analyzed by Western blotting. Various Flag-EDA and Flag-FasL constructs in Opti-MEM supernatants were analyzed similarly. In this case, 2, 5, 10, or 50 μl of the 500 μl fractions were used to detect the ligands by ELISA, essentially as described previously (3Holler N. Tardivel A. Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Hertig S.

Briefly, EDAR-Fc or Fas-Fc (Alexis, Lausen, Switzerland) were coated at 1 μg/ml to capture the ligands, and biotinylated anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma) followed by horse radish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin were used for revelation. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the following standard proteins: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). HaCat cells were detached with PBS, 1 mm EDTA, and washed once with FACS buffer (PBS, 1% FCS). Staining was performed in 96-well plates with 0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106 cells/well, using 10 μl of Fc-PS-EDA1-E245 Opti-MEM supernatant and 40 μl of FACS buffer, for 20 min at 4 °C. In some instances, FACS buffer was replaced by 20-fold concentrated Opti-MEM supernatant containing the soluble receptors EDAR-COMP-Flag or BCMA-COMP-Flag. After washing with FACS buffer, Fc-EDA1 was revealed with phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled anti-human Fc antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). 293T cells co-transfected with EDAR-GPI (or XEDAR-GPI control) and EGFP, and Jurkat cells transfected with syndecan-1, syndecan-2, or glypican-1 expression constructs, were stained with various Fc-ligands or Flag-ligands as described previously (14Bossen C.

Tabby mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were handled according to institutional and Swiss Federal Veterinary Office guidelines, with the authorization of the Office vétérinaire cantonal du canton de Vaud. Pups were labeled by puncture of a footpad with a 30-gauge needle dipped in Aramis tattoo ink (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). Intraperitoneal injections of EDA1 proteins were performed within 24 h after birth with a maximal volume of 15 μl using 0.5 ml of U-100 insulin syringe (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). When two injections were required, Fc-EDA1 and EDAR-Fc were each administered in 7.5 μl. Examination and photography of tail hairs were performed 3–4 weeks postinjection. TNF−/− mice (17Marino M.W. Dunn A. Grail D. Inglese M. Noguchi Y. Richards E. Jungbluth A. Wada H. Moore M. Williamson B. Basu S. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8093-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Fabienne Tacchini-Cottier. The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used for genotyping: TNF−/−: 5′-AGGGCTGTGGGACCTAAATGTC-3′ and 5′-TTTGAAGCGTGCGAGAATGC-3′. TNF+/+: 5′-AGGGCTGTGGGACCTAAATGTC-3′ and 5′-TTTGAGTTCTTGGAGGAAGTGGC-3′. HaCat cells have been shown previously to express messenger RNA for EDAR (18Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We have used a fusion protein, in which the receptor-binding portion of EDA1 was fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (Fc-EDA1) (12Gaide O. Schneider P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), as a probe to detect surface expression of EDAR in HaCat cells (Fig. 2A). As expected for a specific interaction, this staining was dose-dependent (supplemental Fig. S1) and could be competed by preincubation of Fc-EDA1 with a soluble form of recombinant EDAR, but not by preincubation with an irrelevant receptor (Fig. 2A). We conclude that HaCat cells express endogenous EDAR at the cell surface. To determine whether EDA1 or TNF could activate NF-κB signaling in HaCat cells, the phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα (19Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar) was assessed following EDAR or TNF receptor engagement. HaCat cells were starved in serum-free medium to down-regulate spontaneous NF-κB activation, and subsequently stimulated with TNF as a positive control for NF-κB activation. TNF induced robust phosphorylation of IκBα within 5 min. This event was followed by the degradation of IκBα, as observed after 15 and 30 min, and its resynthesis after 1 and 4 h (Fig. 2B). Discrete upper bands of phospho-IκBα detected at 5 min most probably represent ubiquitin derivatives of IκBα that are targeted to degradation (19Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Compared with untreated control cells, biologically active Fc-EDA1 (12Gaide O. Schneider P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) also induced some IκBα phosphorylation, although the response was weaker and slower than with TNF, and the disappearance of IκBα was at best partial at later time points (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that HaCat cell can respond to biologically active EDA1. Mouse embryos with impaired NF-κB signaling suffer from massive liver damage and die at around gestational day 15, but can be rescued by TNF or TNF-R1 inactivation, indicating that TNF is the cause of liver damage (20Alcamo E. Mizgerd J.P. Horwitz B.H. Bronson R. Beg A.A. Scott M. Doerschuk C.M. Hynes R.O. Baltimore D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). When NF-κB is compromised, TNF-R1 signals apoptosis through a death domain-dependent secondary signaling complex (22Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). As EDAR resembles TNF-R1 not only by its ability to activate NF-κB, but also by the presence of an intracellular death domain, we wondered whether EDA1 could negatively affect viability of HaCat cells with compromised NF-κB signaling. HaCat cells expressing a super-repressor of NF-κB (non-degradable IκBα) died as expected in response to TNF, but remained completely resistant to EDA1, suggesting that EDAR does not transmit death signals similar to TNF-R1 (supplemental Fig. S2A). Nevertheless, cells involved in early placode development could be killed in a TNF-dependent manner in the absence of protective, EDAR-mediated NF-κB signals, as observed for fetal liver cells in response to TNF (20Alcamo E. Mizgerd J.P. Horwitz B.H. Bronson R. Beg A.A. Scott M. Doerschuk C.M. Hynes R.O. Baltimore D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). In this scenario, EDA deficiency should be rescued by concomitant inactivation of TNF. This was however experimentally not the case, as EDA-deficient mice expressing TNF or not both displayed identical phenotype of ectodermal dysplasia (supplemental Fig. S2B). Although the THD of EDA1 (EDA-E245) is both required and sufficient to bind EDAR (11Schneider P. Street S.L. Gaide O. Hertig S. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Runkel L. Alevizopoulos K. Ferguson B.M. Zonana J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18819-18827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3B), high concentration of this ligand was required to induce only a weak NF-κB signal in HaCat cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a longer form of EDA1 starting at the furin cleavage site (EDA1-S160) and comprising the collagen domain in addition to the THD was estimated to be at least 100-fold more potent than EDA1-E245 in this NF-κB assay (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3A). The same was true for naturally processed EDA1 (Fig. 3B). Of note, EDA1-S160 constructs with in-frame deletions in the collagen domain (Δ185–196 and Δ218–223) were as efficient as the wild-type protein in this assay (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the presence of the collagen domain increases the biological activity of EDA1 about 100-fold, regardless of whether or not it contains short in-frame deletions. Results presented above indicate that the collagen domain of EDA1 is important for the activation of NF-κB in HaCat cells, despite the fact that it is not required for receptor binding. This suggests that the collagen domain may activate EDA1 by oligomerization of THD trimers, but alternative, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses such as recruitment of interaction partners or engagement of co-receptors via the collagen domain could also account for these observations. Like EDA1-E245, Flag-EDA1-E245 failed to activate NF-κB in HaCat cells. However, Flag-EDA1-E245 could activate NF-κB when cross-linked with anti-Flag antibodies (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3B). Flag-tagged forms of EDA1-S160, with or without in-frame deletions in the collagen domain, were constitutively active and, as expected, remained active in the presence of cross-linking antibodies (Fig. 3B). EDA1 constructs were generated in which the collagen domain was replaced with the Fc portion of human IgG1, with or without insertion of a PreScission viral protease site between the Fc and THD domains. Fusion of the dimeric Fc fragment to trimeric EDA1 is predicted to yield a hexameric protein containing 3 Fc moieties and 2 EDA1 trimers moieties, or even higher oligomers (supplemental Fig. S3A, scheme). Fc-EDA1-E245 indeed eluted with high apparent molecular weight by size exclusion chromatography, consistent with an oligomeric form of the protein (supplemental Fig. S4B), whereas treatment of the protease-sensitive protein with PreScission protease resulted in a quantitative release of EDA1-E245 that eluted at the position expected for a trimer (supplemental Fig. S4, A and C). Uncleaved Fc-EDA1 activated NF-κB in HaCat cells regardless of the presence or absence of the protease site (Fig. 3C). This biological effect was lost by physical separation of the Fc domain from the EDA1 domain by cleavage with PreScission protease, but, as expected, the same treatment did not affect the protease-resistant Fc-EDA1 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that the collagen domain renders EDA1 active by oligomerization. This function can be mimicked by other oligomerization means, such as Flag plus anti-Flag or fusion to the Fc portion of IgG1. The HaCat assay provided qualitative rather than quantitative information on EDA1 activity and unfortunately lacked robustness due to the relatively weak NF-κB activation. We therefore thought to adapt a well-characterized FasL-dependent cell death assay to the purpose of measuring the functional effect of EDA1 oligomerization. Thus, Fas-deficient Jurkat T cells were transfected with a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of EDAR fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Fas, and clones undergoing apoptosis in an EDA1-sensitive manner were selected. Purified Flag-EDA1-S160, with or without in-frame deletions in the collagen domain, killed Jurkat EDAR:Fas cells with an IC50 of about 1 ng/ml, and was further activated only about 2-fold in the presence of anti-Flag antibodies (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S5). Flag-EDA1-E245 displayed no activity by itself in this assay, but this latency was overcome in the presence of a cross-linking anti-Flag antibody that increased the activity about 1000-fold (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a 3-day preincubation at 50 °C did not affect the activity of Flag-EDA1-S160 but decreased the activity of mutants with in-frame deletions in the collagen domain roughly 10-fold. Inline with the results obtained for NF-κB activation in HaCat cells, we conclude that the collagen domain of EDA1 fulfills a prominent role to stimulate the signaling ability of EDA1 trimers by oligomerization. Although deletions in the collagen domain have no or little impact on the activity of the protein, they decreased heat stability of the protein. T"
https://openalex.org/W2115941978,"The orexin neuropeptides promote robust apoptosis in cancer cells. We have recently shown that the 7-transmembrane-spanning orexin receptor OX1R mediates apoptosis through an original mechanism. OX1R is equipped with a tyrosine-based inhibitory motif ITIM, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated on receptor activation, allowing the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, leading to apoptosis. We show here that another motif, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM), is present in OX1R and is mandatory for OX1R-mediated apoptosis. This conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) a canonical ITSM sequence is present in the first intracellular loop of OX1R; 2) mutation of Y(83) to F within ITSM abolished OX1R-mediated apoptosis but did not alter orexin-induced inositol phosphate formation or calcium transient via coupling of OX1R to G(q) protein; 3) mutation of Y(83) to F further abolished orexin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in ITSM and subsequent recruitment of SHP-2 by the receptor. Finally, we developed a structural model of OX1R showing that the spatial localization of phosphotyrosines in ITSM and ITIM in OX1R is compatible with their interaction with the two SH2 domains of SHP-2. These data represent the first evidence for a functional role of an ITSM in a 7-transmembrane-spanning receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1988587478,"A key question in developmental biology is how growth factor signals are integrated to generate pattern. In this study we investigated the integration of the Drosophila BMP and Wingless/GSK3 signaling pathways via phosphorylations of the transcription factor Mad. Wingless was found to regulate the phosphorylation of Mad by GSK3 in vivo. In epistatic experiments, the effects of Wingless on wing disc molecular markers (senseless, distalless and vestigial) were suppressed by depletion of Mad with RNAi. Wingless overexpression phenotypes, such as formation of ectopic wing margins, were induced by Mad GSK3 phosphorylation-resistant mutant protein. Unexpectedly, we found that Mad phosphorylation by GSK3 and MAPK occurred in segmental patterns. Mad depletion or overexpression produced Wingless-like embryonic segmentation phenotypes. In Xenopus embryos, segmental border formation was disrupted by Smad8 depletion. The results show that Mad is required for Wingless signaling and for the integration of gradients of positional information."
https://openalex.org/W1982585426,"Background Kinase-inducible domain (KID) as transcriptional activator can stimulate target gene expression in signal transduction by associating with KID interacting domain (KIX). NMR spectra suggest that apo-KID is an unstructured protein. After post-translational modification by phosphorylation, KID undergoes a transition from disordered to well folded protein upon binding to KIX. However, the mechanism of folding coupled to binding is poorly understood. Methodology To get an insight into the mechanism, we have performed ten trajectories of explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) for both bound and apo phosphorylated KID (pKID). Ten MD simulations are sufficient to capture the average properties in the protein folding and unfolding. Conclusions Room-temperature MD simulations suggest that pKID becomes more rigid and stable upon the KIX-binding. Kinetic analysis of high-temperature MD simulations shows that bound pKID and apo-pKID unfold via a three-state and a two-state process, respectively. Both kinetics and free energy landscape analyses indicate that bound pKID folds in the order of KIX access, initiation of pKID tertiary folding, folding of helix αB, folding of helix αA, completion of pKID tertiary folding, and finalization of pKID-KIX binding. Our data show that the folding pathways of apo-pKID are different from the bound state: the foldings of helices αA and αB are swapped. Here we also show that Asn139, Asp140 and Leu141 with large Φ-values are key residues in the folding of bound pKID. Our results are in good agreement with NMR experimental observations and provide significant insight into the general mechanisms of binding induced protein folding and other conformational adjustment in post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W2039330325,"The Zap1 transcription factor is a central player in the response of yeast to changes in zinc status. Previous studies identified over 80 genes activated by Zap1 in zinc-limited cells. In this report, we identified 36 genes repressed in a zinc- and Zap1-responsive manner. As a result, we have identified a new mechanism of Zap1-mediated gene repression whereby transcription of the MET3, MET14, and MET16 genes is repressed in zinc-limited cells. These genes encode the first three enzymes of the sulfate assimilation pathway. We found that MET30, encoding a component of the SCF(Met30) ubiquitin ligase, is a direct Zap1 target gene. MET30 expression is increased in zinc-limited cells, and this leads to degradation of Met4, a transcription factor responsible for MET3, MET14, and MET16 expression. Thus, Zap1 is responsible for a decrease in sulfate assimilation in zinc-limited cells. We further show that cells that are unable to down-regulate sulfate assimilation under zinc deficiency experience increased oxidative stress. This increased oxidative stress is associated with an increase in the NADP(+)/NADPH ratio and may result from a decrease in NADPH-dependent antioxidant activities. These studies have led to new insights into how cells adapt to nutrient-limiting growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2075533337,"During cell division, the mechanisms by which myosin II is recruited to the contractile ring are not fully understood. Much recent work has focused on a model in which spatially restricted de novo filament assembly occurs at the cell equator via localized myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation, stimulated by the RhoA-activating centralspindlin complex. Here, we show that a recombinant myosin IIA protein that assembles constitutively and is incapable of binding RLC still displays strong localization to the furrow in mammalian cells. Furthermore, this RLC-deficient myosin II efficiently drives cytokinesis, demonstrating that centralspindlin-based RLC phosphorylation is not necessary for myosin II localization during furrowing. Myosin II truncation analysis further reveals two distinct myosin II tail properties that contribute to furrow localization: a central tail domain mediating cortical furrow binding to heterologous binding partners and a carboxyl-terminal region mediating co-assembly with existing furrow myosin IIA or IIB filaments.

Myosin II truncation analysis further reveals two distinct myosin II tail properties that contribute to furrow localization: a central tail domain mediating cortical furrow binding to heterologous binding partners and a carboxyl-terminal region mediating co-assembly with existing furrow myosin IIA or IIB filaments. Non-muscle myosin II, through its interaction with F-actin, is believed to be the dominant force-producing machinery utilized to separate daughter cells during cell division. Following anaphase onset, myosin II is recruited to the equatorial cortex where it assembles into the contractile ring. Despite much recent progress, the exact mechanism by which myosin II is recruited to and retained in the contractile ring in the proper spatio-temporal manner remains unclear. Myosin II is a member of the myosin superfamily that binds F-actin and hydrolyzes ATP to produce force. A monomer consists of two myosin heavy chains (“MHCs”), 3The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin heavy chainNMHCnonmuscle MHCELCessential light chainRLCregulatory light chainGAPGTPase-activating proteinGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorACDassembly-competent domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNA. 3The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin heavy chainNMHCnonmuscle MHCELCessential light chainRLCregulatory light chainGAPGTPase-activating proteinGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorACDassembly-competent domainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePBSphosphate-buffered salinesiRNAsmall interfering RNA. two essential light chains (“ELCs”), and two regulatory light chains (“RLCs”) (see Fig. 1A). The MHC consists of an amino-terminal globular head domain often referred to as the “motor” domain. It is responsible for F-actin binding and ATP binding and hydrolysis. One RLC and one ELC associate with each MHC via two IQ motifs on a neck region linking the head and tail domain. The remainder of the MHC forms a continuous α-helix that interacts with another MHC rod to create a coiled-coil-mediated dimer. At the extreme C terminus, mammalian non-muscle myosin II molecules contain an ∼30 residue “non-helical tailpiece.” Many phosphorylation sites have been identified on both the RLC and the MHC (1Totsukawa G.

The best characterized of these sites is Thr-18/Ser-19 on the RLC, which, when phosphorylated, has been shown to activate myosin II by increasing the affinity of MHC for F-actin, consequently increasing the ATPase activity (5Sellers J.R. Spudich J.A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites is also able to convert myosin II from a folded 10 S “inactive” monomer into the extended 6 S monomer that readily forms filaments (7Craig R. Smith R. Kendrick-Jones J.

Mammalian genomes contain three genes encoding non-muscle myosin II heavy chain isoforms, mhc IIA, IIB, and IIC. MHC IIA and IIB are widely expressed in many tissues and cell lines, whereas IIC is expressed with a more limited distribution (8Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In mice, gene knockouts of mhc IIA and IIB result in differing phenotypes that are only partially rescued by the other isoform, suggesting that both isoform-specific and overlapping roles exist (9Bao J. Ma X. Liu C. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22102-22111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that myosin IIA and IIB isoforms are capable of co-assembling into mixed or heterotypic filaments (10Murakami N. Kotula L. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11441-11451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Marini M. Bruschi M. Pecci A. Romagnoli R. Musante L. Candiano G. Ghiggeri G.M. Balduini C. Seri M. Ravazzolo R. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 17: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence showing that myosin II isoforms have different subcellular localization in non-mitotic cells, supportinga model in which homotypic filaments are the dominant filamentous structure in live cells (12Kolega J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2085-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Gard D.L. Bui D. Adelstein R.S. Baines I.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whether myosin IIA and IIB can co-assemble in the contractile ring of dividing cells is not known. The dominant model for furrow localization of myosin II during cell division hypothesizes spatially restricted equatorial activation and filament assembly via phosphorylation of the RLC on Thr-18/Ser-19. The most prominent upstream signaling pathway implicated in this furrow recruitment model is the centralspindlin pathway. In this pathway, the kinesin-6 protein MKLP1 anchors MgcRacGAP and a RhoGEF (ECT2) to the spindle midzone (14Kamijo K. Ohara N. Abe M. Uchimura T. Hosoya H. Lee J.S. Miki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This in turn locally activates RhoA, leading to activation of Rho kinase and/or citron kinase, both of which have been shown capable of phosphorylating RLC (15Eda M. Yonemura S. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3273-3284PubMed Google Scholar, 16Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Eda M. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Microsc. Res.

Centralspindlin-based signals clearly contribute to myosin II-cytokinesis functions. However, whether these signals contribute to initial myosin II binding/recruitment, to myosin II contractile activation, or to both, is unresolved. Another recent study reported that GFP-tagged RLC constructs with alanine substitutions at the activating Thr-18/Ser-19 sites were still able to localize to the furrow of dividing HeLa cells, suggesting that RLC phosphorylation is not required for myosin equatorial localization (19Miyauchi K. Yamamoto Y. Kosaka T. Hosoya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, in that study, it was not clear how much endogenous wild type RLC was present; thus this result may represent a tracer amount of the T18A/S19A mutant RLC passively co-assembling with a larger pool of endogenous RLC-phosphorylated myosin II. Another proposed model for myosin recruitment to the equatorial region of a dividing cell is cortical flow. In this model, supported by observations in both Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, myosin filaments move along the cortex and into the furrow in a motor-dependent manner (20Mandato C.A. Benink H.A. Bement W.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Yumura S. Ueda M. Sako Y. Kitanishi-Yumura T. Yanagida T.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1259-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, recent studies using total internal reflection fluorescence imaging in normal rat kidney cells revealed no detectable myosin II cortical flow (23Zhou M. Wang Y.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), raising uncertainty as to whether cortical flow is an important mechanism for myosin recruitment in mammalian cells. In this study, we provide the first evidence that mammalian myosin II can localize to the furrow of dividing cells independent of the regulatory light chain. These studies demonstrate that both robust myosin II recruitment to the furrow and efficient cell division can be achieved without spatially localized centralspindlin-mediated RLC phosphorylation. We conclude that other mechanisms such as cortical flow (22DeBiasio R.L. LaRocca G.M. Post P.L. Taylor D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1259-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Yumura S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and/or equatorial myosin II binding partners (25Piekny A.J. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Joo E. Surka M.C. Trimble W.S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) must be sufficient for myosin II recruitment and cell furrowing in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that a headless myosin construct can localize to the contractile ring, supporting a model in which actin binding and ATPase activity are not required for myosin II recruitment. We also provide novel evidence that MHC isoforms are capable of co-assembling in the contractile ring. Amino acid numbering is based on GenBankTM accession number NM_002473. The plasmids pEGFP-C3-NMHC-IIA, pCMV-EGFP-NMHC-IIAΔIQ2, and pCMV-EGFP-NMHC-IIAΔACD were described previously (27Breckenridge M.T. Dulyaninova N.G. Egelhoff T.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All remaining MHC truncations were constructed using PCR methods, and all DNA segments subjected to PCR were sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR-generated errors. The plasmid pEGFP-C3-NMHC-IIA-ΔHead was constructed using a PCR product consisting of residue 775 through the EcoRI site at residue 1339, with an engineered 5′-HindIII site. This product was then ligated into pEGFP-C3-NMHC-IIA following removal of the HindIII-EcoRI segment. The plasmid p-EGFP-C3-NMHC-IIA-Rod was constructed in the same manner but begins with residue 1251. The remaining MHC truncations (GFP-IIA-T1, T-2, and T-3) were engineered with 5′-HindIII and 3′-KpnI restriction sites. These were ligated into pEGFP-C3-NMHC-IIA following digestion with HindIII and KpnI to remove the full-length MHC IIA. HeLa (human cervical cancer) cells were purchased from Clontech and maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented to 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented to 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All transfections were carried out using the Lonza Group Amaxa Nucleofector system with the following conditions (solution, program): HeLa cells (R, I-13), COS-7 cells (R, W-01), and COS-7 cells during siRNA (V, A24). Cells were fixed in 1× PBS supplemented to 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 4% formaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized in 1× PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked in 1× PBS with 3% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Tween for 20 min. Primary and secondary antibody, phalloidin, and DAPI incubations were performed in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The following antibody/stain concentrations were used: NMHC-IIA 1:500 (Sigma, M8064), NMHC-IIB 1:500 (Sigma, M7939), Alexa Fluor-568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for staining of actin and 1 μg/ml DAPI for staining of DNA (Invitrogen). All images are single confocal sections taken on confocal microscopes with Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA oil objectives. Some images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510, and some were acquired on a Leica TCS-SP2. For immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, siRNA was performed as follows. COS-7 cells were transfected with 200 pmol of MHC IIA or MHC IIB siRNA oligonucleotide (Dharmacon Smart Pool) and 5 μg of the indicated plasmid using the Lonza Group Amaxa Nucleofector system (solution V, program A24). These cells were plated and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Cells were collected using trypsin, and an equal number of cells for each transfection were successively pelleted and resuspended in medium containing 0.25% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, cold 90% methanol in 1× PBS for 20 min at −20 °C, 1× PBS for 1 min at 4 °C (2×), and 1× PBS containing 40 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 20 min and then 4 °C for 10 min. An equal volume of 1× PBS with propidium iodide was then added for a final propidium iodide concentration of 50 μg/ml, which was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h prior to analysis. Data were analyzed using ModFit. Z-series of early anaphase HeLa cells were acquired using a Leica TCS-SP2 with a Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA oil objective. Images were collected with identical, subsaturating settings. Step size was set to 0.5 μm. The middle of the cell was defined as the slice with the largest pole to pole distance, and this slice was used for analysis. Line scans through the equatorial region were collected using the NIH ImageJ software. Line width was set to 15 pixels. Line “plot profiles” were exported from ImageJ. Data were analyzed and graphed as box plots using SigmaPlot. To determine whether RLC-phosphorylation-based de novo filament assembly in the furrow zone is the dominant mechanism of myosin localization to the equatorial region of dividing cells, we have used a GFP-tagged MHC IIA construct with a deleted RLC binding site (GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2; Fig. 1, A and B). This construct, previously shown to be incapable of binding RLC when expressed in HeLa cells, displays severe overassembly in live cells (27Breckenridge M.T. Dulyaninova N.G. Egelhoff T.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and based on previous studies, is predicted to have constitutive motor activity (28Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, given that this myosin II construct has no associated RLC, the centralspindlin model that furrow-specific localized RLC phosphorylation drives contractile ring assembly would predict that this construct should not localize to the cytokinetic furrow. Surprisingly, GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 was able to localize to the furrow of dividing HeLa cells with similar robustness as GFP-tagged wild-type MHC IIA (GFP-IIA; Fig. 1C). Quantitative line scan analysis confirmed that GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 is recruited to the furrow to a similar level as wild-type GFP-IIA (Fig. 2). This result suggests that in mammalian cells, myosin II furrow recruitment can occur independently of centralspindlin-based myosin II phosphorylation. However, the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 construct is likely capable of co-assembling into filaments with the endogenous MHC IIA that is present in HeLa cells, allowing the possibility that the endogenous MHC IIA is recruiting the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 into the furrow. To eliminate this possibility, we used COS-7 cells, which predominantly express MHC IIB with no detectable MHC IIA (supplemental Fig. S1) and only trace levels of MHC IIC expression (29Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar to the results in HeLa cells, both wild-type GFP-IIA and GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 were capable of localizing to the furrow in COS-7 (Fig. 1D). This is not an isoform-specific property as GFP-IIB-ΔIQ2 was able to localize to the furrow of dividing HeLa cells that express no endogenous MHC IIB (data not shown). This result demonstrates that localized activation of filament assembly, via furrow-restricted centralspindlin-driven RLC phosphorylation, is unnecessary for myosin II recruitment to the furrow. Because it is unclear whether or not myosin II isoforms can co-assemble into heterotypic filaments (i.e. mixed filaments containing myosin IIA and myosin IIB), it remained a possibility that the myosin IIB present in COS-7 cells was responsible for the furrow localization of the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2. To determine whether the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 was being recruited to the equatorial region via co-assembly with endogenous myosin IIB, we used siRNA to suppress MHC IIB expression in COS-7 cells, in conjunction with transfection of GFP-MHC-IIA-ΔIQ2. Upon depletion of MHC IIB (∼87% knockdown; supplemental Fig. S2), GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 is still able to localize to the equatorial region of dividing cells (Fig. 3A). These data argue that GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 can be recruited to the furrow independently of any association with the endogenous MHC IIB. In agreement with previous reports (29Bao J. Jana S.S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19594-19599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we found that knockdown of MHC IIB in COS-7 cells causes a multinucleation phenotype and that expression of GFP-IIA is able to rescue that phenotype (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine whether a myosin II lacking RLC could also rescue this multinucleation phenotype, we transfected MHC IIB siRNA together with the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 construct. GFP-positive cells were then analyzed for nucleation state using flow cytometry. Interestingly, GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 was able to rescue the multinucleation phenotype nearly as well as wild-type GFP-IIA (Fig. 3C), indicating that this construct is not only recruited to the furrow but is also capable of driving efficient cell division. One possibility for the localization of GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 in the absence of endogenous myosin is through an association with actin via its actin binding site, located in the amino-terminal globular motor or head domain. Recent studies in HeLa cells examined localization behavior of a truncated mammalian MHC IIA construct that lacked approximately one-half of the head domain (30Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although that construct clearly co-assembled with and disrupted stress fibers during interphase, during cell division, it formed dramatic punctate aggregates that did not localize to the furrow. To avoid possible aggregation effects and to assess whether the head is needed for furrow localization, we constructed GFP-MHC truncations that removed the entire head domain (GFP-IIA-ΔHead; this construct retains the ELC and RLC binding sites of the neck) or that removed both the entire head and the entire neck domains (GFP-IIA-Rod; Fig. 4A). Both of these constructs were capable of furrow localization in dividing COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the GFP-IIA-Rod could localize to the furrow independent of endogenous myosin, COS-7 cells were transfected with the GFP-IIA-Rod together with MHC IIB siRNA. These cells became noticeably multinucleate (Fig. 4C, lower panels). However, in these samples, GFP-IIA-Rod still localized reproducibly with actin in cortical regions between separated chromosomes of anaphase cells, where one would predict spindle-based contractile ring assembly signals to operate (Fig. 4C, arrows). However, this localization was not as dramatic or uniform as when endogenous myosin II is present (compare Fig. 4B and 4C), suggesting the possibility that some of the GFP-IIA-Rod recruitment in normal COS-7 furrows was mediated through heterotypic filament assembly with MHC IIB. These results demonstrate that the full-length myosin IIA tail binds to the cleavage furrow cortex even when endogenous myosin II is depleted. To determine whether the multinucleation level induced upon expression of GFP-IIA-Rod with MHC IIB siRNA was similar to the multinucleation seen upon expression of GFP with MHC IIB siRNA or whether the GFP-IIA-Rod is capable of any rescue, we again used flow cytometry to analyze nucleation state. Expression of GFP-IIA-Rod did not rescue the multinucleation phenotype, and in fact, appeared to augment it (Fig. 3C). This supports previous reports using blebbistatin, a specific inhibitor of myosin II ATPase, showing that myosin II ATPase activity is necessary for cleavage furrow ingression and cytokinesis in HeLa cells (31Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). To further map the tail domain(s) that mediate cortical furrow binding, we expressed a truncated tail fragment that extends from a region just upstream of the previously mapped in vitro assembly-competent domain (ACD) (32Sato M.K. Takahashi M. Yazawa M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Nakasawa T. Takahashi M. Matsuzawa F. Aikawa S. Togashi Y. Saitoh T. Yamagishi A. Yazawa M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) through the non-helical tailpiece (termed GFP-IIA-T1; Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, GFP-IIA-T1 shows enrichment at the furrow, although its recruitment appears to be reduced when compared with the full-length rod. Further truncation of this region of the tail, from either the carboxyl-terminal or the amino-terminal ends (GFP-IIA-T2 and GFP-IIA-T3, respectively), completely abrogated enrichment at the equatorial region (Figs. 2 and 5, A and B). This behavior suggested that GFP-IIA-T1 might be localizing to the furrow via a co-assembly-based mechanism. To determine whether GFP-IIA-T1 localization at the furrow was through co-assembly with the endogenous MHC IIB, we again used siRNA to deplete MHC IIB while simultaneously expressing GFP-IIA-T1. Upon siRNA of MHC IIB, we were unable to find any cells in anaphase with GFP-IIA-T1 localization or enrichment in the equatorial region (Fig. 5C, lower panels), supporting the model that GFP-IIA-T1 recruitment is mediated through a co-assembly with the endogenous MHC IIB. Thus sequences in and adjacent to the ACD of myosin IIA can drive co-assembly with endogenous myosin IIB in the furrow (Fig. 5), but additional sequences in the central domain of myosin IIA can drive localization to the furrow cortex even in the absence of endogenous myosin IIA or IIB (Fig. 4). Multiple recent studies have revealed a conserved signaling pathway involving the centralspindlin complex (MKLP1, MgcRacGAP, ECT2) that activates effectors involved in contractile ring assembly (34Barr F.A. Gruneberg U. Cell. 2007; 131: 847-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 35Werner M. Glotzer M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent work from Oegema and colleagues (36Canman J.C. Lewellyn L. Laband K. Smerdon S.J. Desai A. Bowerman B. Oegema K. Science. 2008; 322: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) has shown the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of MgcRacGAP, CYK-4, to have additional roles besides the previously known function of anchoring ECT2 to MKLP1. CYK-4 was shown to be critical for the inactivation of Rac in the central spindle to prevent activation of the Arp2/3 complex, which could theoretically lead to disarrayed actin cytoskeleton in the contractile ring (36Canman J.C. Lewellyn L. Laband K. Smerdon S.J. Desai A. Bowerman B. Oegema K. Science. 2008; 322: 1543-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Another downstream effector of the centralspindlin complex is RhoA, which is activated through the GEF activity of ECT2 (37Yüce O. Piekny A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). RhoA is known to activate the formin mDia2, leading to nucleation of parallel actin filaments at the furrow (34Barr F.A. Gruneberg U. Cell. 2007; 131: 847-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 38Watanabe S. Ando Y. Yasuda S. Hosoya H. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2328-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the centralspindlin complex acts synergistically with anillin to stabilize RhoA at the cleavage furrow (25Piekny A.J. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this model, both RhoA-containing complexes then facilitate localized activation of Rho kinase and citron kinase, leading to localized phosphorylation of the RLC to promote myosin II activation and assembly (14Kamijo K. Ohara N. Abe M. Uchimura T. Hosoya H. Lee J.S. Miki T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Eda M. Yonemura S. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Madaule P.

The studies presented here demonstrate that robust myosin II recruitment to the furrow can be achieved without spatially localized centralspindlin-mediated RLC phosphorylation. Clearly other recruitment pathways such as cortical flow (22DeBiasio R.L. LaRocca G.M. Post P.L. Taylor D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1259-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Yumura S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and/or equatorial myosin II binding partners (25Piekny A.J. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Joo E. Surka M.C. Trimble W.S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) are sufficient for myosin II recruitment and cell furrowing in mammalian cells. Our data argue that in mammalian cells, the centralspindlin complex may be critical for activating these other recruitment pathways and that, in fact, this alternative role for centralspindlin may be more important than any possible role in driving localized RLC phosphorylation. It is important to note that many of these conclusions are derived from work with a constitutively active myosin II (GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2). Without direct disruption of the centralspindlin complex, we cannot rule out its involvement in furrow recruitment of normal myosin II, whether it is through RLC-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Based on previous work in Dictyostelium (28Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 construct would be constitutively active. Our rescue data support this hypothesis (Fig. 3C), although the rescue does not appear to be complete. This difference in rescue between full-length GFP-IIA and GFP-IIA-ΔIQ2 does not appear to be due to a difference in expression as both express at similar levels (data not shown). One possibility is that removal of the IQ2 region from mammalian myosin II does not result in the same level of constitutive activity as was previously shown in Dictyostelium. Another possibility is that IQ2 removal eliminates RLC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, thereby drastically decreasing myosin assembly turnover in the contractile ring. Previous studies in Dictyostelium have shown that constitutive myosin II overassembly can lead to an elevated failure rate in completion of cytokinesis (39Yumura S. Yoshida M. Betapudi V. Licate L.S. Iwadate Y. Nagasaki A. Uyeda T.Q. Egelhoff T.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4256-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to elucidate these possibilities. This is the first report in mammalian cells of headless myosin localizing to the furrow independent of endogenous myosin II. This observation is intriguing and consistent with previous reports demonstrating rod localization to the furrow in lower eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium and fission yeast (40Wong K.C. D'souza V.M. Naqvi N.I. Motegi F. Mabuchi I. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 724-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41Zang J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13652-13657Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that actin is required for myosin II association with the cortex (21Yumura S. Ueda M. Sako Y. Kitanishi-Yumura T. Yanagida T. Traffic. 2008; 9: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and that myosin II is required for the cortical flow of actin (23Zhou M. Wang Y.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, because these rod constructs are presumed not to bind actin, it is unlikely that they are localizing via cortical flow. Myosin IIA rod recruitment requires the presence of the amino-terminal region of the rod (compare GFP-IIA-Rod (Fig. 4C) with GFP-IIA-T1 (Fig. 5C)), suggesting that cortical furrow proteins bind this central domain of MHC IIA to facilitate recruitment to the furrow. Two interesting candidates that may mediate this binding are septins (26Joo E. Surka M.C. Trimble W.S. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and anillin, which is known to stabilize myosin in the contractile ring (25Piekny A.J. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Finally, we show that the carboxyl-terminal region of MHC IIA that contains the ACD is able to localize to the furrow in the presence of MHC IIB but not when MHC IIB expression is suppressed using siRNA. This result promotes two interesting observations. The first is the possibility of a positive feedback mechanism for myosin localization to the furrow in which equatorial myosin II filaments can further recruit myosin molecules in an ACD-dependent manner. The second is that myosin IIA and IIB are capable of co-assembling into heterotypic filaments during cell division. In summary, the behavior of our myosin IIA truncations reveals two distinct modes by which the myosin IIA tail can bind to the furrow cortex. Constructs containing the central domain bind the furrow cortex independent of endogenous myosin IIA or IIB, and the myosin IIA ACD can bind through a mechanism requiring the presence of the IIB isoform, indicating heterotypic filament assembly. We suggest that these independent anchoring mechanisms operate synergistically to facilitate myosin II filament accumulation in the furrow.

https://openalex.org/W1983093886,"Presenilin 1, a protein involved in the development of familial Alzheimer disease, is an important functional component of the gamma-secretase complex that processes many cell surface receptors including the EphB2 tyrosine kinase receptors (Litterst, C., Georgakopoulos, A., Shioi, J., Ghersi, E., Wisniewski, T., Wang, R., Ludwig, A., and Robakis, N. K. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 16155-16163). Recent evidence reveals that cytosolic peptides produced by the combined metalloproteinase/gamma-secretase processing of cell surface proteins function in signal transduction and protein phosphorylation. Here we show that peptide EphB2/CTF2 released to the cytosol by the gamma-secretase processing of EphB2 receptor, has tyrosine kinase activity, and directly phosphorylates the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits in both cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. This phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Src kinases and is resistant to Src inhibitors revealing a novel pathway of NMDAR tyrosine phosphorylation independent of Src activity. EphB2/CTF2, but not a kinase-deficient mutant of EphB2/CTF2, promotes the cell surface expression of NMDAR. Because NMDAR plays central roles in synaptic plasticity and function, our results provide a potential link between the gamma-secretase function of presenilin 1 and learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W1971857963,"The present study tests the hypothesis that the structure of extracellular domain Loop 2 can markedly affect ethanol sensitivity in glycine receptors (GlyRs) and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs). To test this, we mutated Loop 2 in the α1 subunit of GlyRs and in the γ subunit of α1β2γ2GABAARs and measured the sensitivity of wild type and mutant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes to agonist, ethanol, and other agents using two-electrode voltage clamp. Replacing Loop 2 of α1GlyR subunits with Loop 2 from the δGABAAR (δL2), but not the γGABAAR subunit, reduced ethanol threshold and increased the degree of ethanol potentiation without altering general receptor function. Similarly, replacing Loop 2 of the γ subunit of GABAARs with δL2 shifted the ethanol threshold from 50 mm in WT to 1 mm in the GABAA γ-δL2 mutant. These findings indicate that the structure of Loop 2 can profoundly affect ethanol sensitivity in GlyRs and GABAARs. The δL2 mutations did not affect GlyR or GABAAR sensitivity, respectively, to Zn2+ or diazepam, which suggests that these δL2-induced changes in ethanol sensitivity do not extend to all allosteric modulators and may be specific for ethanol or ethanol-like agents. To explore molecular mechanisms underlying these results, we threaded the WT and δL2 GlyR sequences onto the x-ray structure of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC). In addition to being the first GlyR model threaded on GLIC, the juxtaposition of the two structures led to a possible mechanistic explanation for the effects of ethanol on GlyR-based on changes in Loop 2 structure.

This work provides several lines of evidence that position 267 and possibly other sites in the transmembrane (TM) domain of GlyRs and homologous sites in GABAARs are targets for ethanol action and that mutations at these sites can influence ethanol sensitivity (8Mihic S.J.

The initial findings came from studies demonstrating that α1GlyRs are more sensitive to ethanol than are α2GlyRs despite the high (∼78%) sequence homology between α1GlyRs and α2GlyRs (32Mascia M.P. Mihic S.J. Valenzuela C.F. Schofield P.R. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 402-406PubMed Google Scholar). Further work found that an alanine to serine exchange at position 52 (A52S) in Loop 2 can eliminate the difference in ethanol sensitivity between α1GlyRs and α2GlyRs (18Davies D.L. Crawford D.K. Trudell J.R. Mihic S.J. Alkana R.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Perkins D.I. Trudell J.R. Crawford D.K. Alkana R.L. Davies D.L. J.

Res. 2003; 27: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated that mutations at position 52 in α1GlyRS and the homologous position 59 in α2GlyRs controlled the sensitivity of these receptors to a novel mechanistic ethanol antagonist (20Perkins D.I. Trudell J.R. Crawford D.K. Alkana R.L. Davies D.L. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that there are multiple sites of ethanol action in α1GlyRs, with one site located in the TM domain (e.g. position 267) and another in the extracellular domain (e.g. position 52). Subsequent studies revealed that the polarity of the residue at position 52 plays a key role in determining the sensitivity of GlyRs to ethanol (20Perkins D.I. Trudell J.R. Crawford D.K. Alkana R.L. Davies D.L. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The findings with polarity in the extracellular domain contrast with the findings at position 267 in the TM domain, where molecular volume, but not polarity, significantly affected ethanol sensitivity (9Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the physical-chemical parameters of residues at positions in the extracellular and TM domains that modulate ethanol effects and/or initiate ethanol action in GlyRs are not uniform.

GlyRs and GABAARs, which differ significantly in their sensitivities to ethanol, offer a potential method for identifying the structures that control ethanol sensitivity. For example, α1GlyRs do not reliably respond to ethanol concentrations less than 10 mm (32Mascia M.P. Mihic S.J. Valenzuela C.F. Schofield P.R. Harris R.A. Mol.

Since prior studies found that mutations of Loop 2 residues can affect ethanol sensitivity (19Crawford D.K. Trudell J.R. Bertaccini E.J. Li K. Davies D.L. Alkana R.L. J.

The present study tested the hypothesis that the structure of Loop 2 can markedly affect the ethanol sensitivity of GlyRs and GABAARs. To accomplish this, we performed multiple mutations that replaced the Loop 2 region of the α1 subunit in α1GlyRs and the Loop 2 region of the γ subunit of α1β2γ2 GABAARs with corresponding non-conserved residues from the δ subunit of GABAAR and tested the sensitivity of these receptors to ethanol. As predicted, replacing Loop 2 of WT α1GlyRs with the homologous residues from the δGABAAR subunit (δL2), but not the γGABAAR subunit (γL2), markedly increased the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol. Similarly, replacing the non-conserved residues of the γ subunit of α1β2γ2 GABAARs with δL2 also markedly increased ethanol sensitivity of GABAARs. These findings support the hypothesis and suggest that Loop 2 may play a role in controlling ethanol sensitivity across the Cys-loop superfamily of receptors. The findings also provide the basis for suggesting structure-function relationships in a new molecular model of the GlyR based on the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric LGIC homologue (GLIC). Adult female Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). Gentamicin, 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, glycine, GABA, ethanol, zinc chloride, strychnine, picrotoxin, diazepam, and collagenase were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade. Glycine, GABA, and strychnine stock solutions were prepared from powder. Stock solutions of picrotoxin and diazepam were prepared in DMSO and then diluted to an appropriate concentration with the extracellular solution just before use. To avoid adverse effects from DMSO exposure, the final concentration (v/v) of DMSO was not higher than 0.5%. Picrotoxin stocks and solutions were wrapped in foil to avoid UV exposure. The amino acid sequences for α1GlyR and δ- and γGABAAR subunits were aligned, and the Loop 2 regions were compared (Table 1). Individual point mutations in the α1GlyR or γGABAAR subunit cDNA were created so that the resulting Loop 2 region matched that of the δGABAAR or the γGABAAR subunits. Xenopus oocytes were isolated and injected with human GlyR cDNAs (1 ng/32 nl) or GABAAR cDNAs (1:1:10 ratio for a total volume of 1 ng of α1β2γ2) cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIS2 or pBKCMV, as described previously (33Davies D.L.

Res. 2003; 27: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and verified by partial sequencing (DNA Core Facility, University of Southern California). After injection, oocytes were stored in incubation medium (modified Barth's saline supplemented with 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, and 50 mg/liter gentamycin) in Petri dishes (VWR, San Dimas, CA). All solutions were sterilized by passage through 0.22-μm filters. Oocytes, stored at 18 °C, usually expressed GlyRs the day after injection and GABAARs 3–4 days after injection. Oocytes were used in experiments for up to 7 days after injection.TABLE 1Loop 2 sequence alignment for the α1GlyR subunit, δ− and γGABAAR subunits, α1nAChR subunit, and GLICSubunitPositionSequenceHuman GlyR α150SIAETTMDYRHuman GABAAR δ43HISEANMEYTHuman GABAAR γ264PVNAINMEYTHuman nAChR α142NVDEVNQIVEGLIC29SLDDKAETFK Open table in a new tab Native δ-containing GABAARs (α4β2/3δ and α6β2/3δ) have been shown to be sensitive to low ethanol concentrations (1–3 mm) in a variety of preparations (44Wei W.

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the structure of Loop 2 can markedly affect the ethanol sensitivity of GlyRs and GABAARs. We used the δ Loop 2 as a vehicle for testing this hypothesis. In this context, and given the difficulties described above, we did not include WT δ-containing GABAARs in the current paper. Two-electrode voltage clamp recording was performed using techniques similar to those previously reported (33Davies D.L. Trudell J.R. Mihic S.J. Crawford D.K. Alkana R.L. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, electrodes pulled (P-30; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from borosilicate glass (1.2-mm thick walled filamented glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL)) were back-filled with 3 m KCl to yield resistances of 0.5–3 megaohms. All electrophysiological recordings were conducted within a chamber that contains a vibration-resistant platform that supports an oocyte bath, two micro positioners (WPI (Sarasota, FL) or Narishige International USA, Inc. (East Meadow, NY)), and bath clamp (33Davies D.L. Trudell J.R. Mihic S.J. Crawford D.K. Alkana R.L. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Oocytes were perfused in a 100-μl oocyte bath with modified Barth's saline with or without drugs via a custom high pressure drug delivery system (Alcott Chromatography, Norcross, GA) at 2 ml/min using 116 OD high pressure PEEK tubing (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). Oocytes were voltage-clamped at a membrane potential of −70 mV using a Warner Instruments model OC-725C (Hamden, CT) oocyte clamp. A chart recorder (Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA) continuously plotted the clamped currents. The peak currents were measured and used in data analysis. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). For agonist concentration response experiments, WT or mutant GlyRs or GABAARs were exposed to 1 μm to 3 mm glycine or 1 μm to 10 mm GABA for 60 s, using 5–15-min washouts between applications to ensure complete receptor resensitization. We used a concentration of glycine or GABA producing 10 ± 2% of the maximal effect (EC10). Agonist EC10 was applied as a control pre- and post-ethanol treatment. When testing ethanol potentiation, the oocytes were preincubated with ethanol for 60 s prior to co-application of ethanol and agonist for 60 s (18Davies D.L. Crawford D.K. Trudell J.R. Mihic S.J. Alkana R.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Washout periods (5–15 min) were allowed between agonist and drug applications to ensure complete resensitization of receptors. WT and mutant α1GlyR responses were measured across an ethanol concentration range of 1–30 mm. GABAAR responses were measured across an ethanol concentration range of 1–50 mm. Ethanol, in the absence of glycine or GABA, did not significantly affect the holding currents of the GlyRs and GABAARs tested. Oocytes expressing WT, δL2, and γL2 GlyRs were tested for response to low (10 μm) and high (100 μm) concentrations of zinc chloride (ZnCl2), a bimodal allosteric modulator of the GlyR. Glycine EC10 was applied for 60 s. Oocytes were preincubated with ZnCl2 for 60 s, followed by co-application with glycine EC10 for 60 s. Wash-out periods (5–15 min) were allowed between drug applications to ensure complete resensitization of receptors. Oocytes expressing WT, δL2, and γL2 GlyRs were tested for response to the competitive GlyR antagonist strychnine or the noncompetitive GlyR antagonist picrotoxin. Glycine EC10 was applied for 60 s. Oocytes were preincubated with strychnine (50 nm) or picrotoxin (100 μm) for 60 s, followed by co-application with glycine EC10 for 60 s. Washout periods (5–15 min) were allowed between drug applications to ensure complete resensitization of receptors. Oocytes expressing WT and δL2 GABAARs were tested for response to the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam. GABA EC10 was applied for 60 s. Oocytes were preincubated with diazepam (1 μm) for 60 s, followed by co-application with GABA EC10 for 60 s. Washout periods (5–15 min) were allowed between drug applications to ensure complete resensitization of receptors. Biotinylation of surface-expressed proteins was modified from a previous protocol published by Chen et al. (55Chen Z.W. Chang C.S. Leil T.A. Olcese R. Olsen R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Four days after cDNA injections, oocytes (15 oocytes/group) were incubated with 1.5 mg/ml membrane-impermeable sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing once with 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, oocytes were homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 110 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 0.08% Triton X-100, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA)). The yolk and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 3600 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer and stored at −20 °C to assess total receptor fraction. The remaining supernatant was incubated with streptavidin beads (Pierce"

The small heat shock protein HSP27 (or HSPB1) has multiple cytoplasmic roles. HSP27 also can translocate to the nucleus in response to stress, but the functional significance of this nuclear distribution has not been elucidated. We have previously implicated HSP27 as a genetic modifier of spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17), a neurological disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Altered expression of HSP27 is also found in cell models of other polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington disease as well as SCA3 and SCA7. Here, we show that Hsp27, unlike Hsp70, is not detected in mutant TBP aggregates in primary cerebellar granule neurons from transgenic SCA17 mice. Although HSP27 overexpression does not reduce the aggregation of cotransfected mutant TBP containing 105 glutamines, it potentiates activated transcription from both TATA-containing and TATA-lacking promoters. Neither HSP40 nor HSP70 elicits the same transcriptional effect. Moreover, HSP27 interacts with the transcription factor SP1, and coexpression of SP1 and nuclear localization signal-tagged HSP27 synergistically activates reporter constructs for the SP1-responsive neurotrophic receptor genes Ngfrp75 and TRKA.

Various heat shock proteins (HSPs), as well as ubiquitin, proteasomal subunits, and autophagic markers, have been detected in intracellular aggregates formed by mutant polyQ proteins expressed in cultured cells, transgenic mice, and patient brains, indicating that these structures engage the cellular response to misfolded protein (1Sakahira H.

Intriguingly, the time-dependent increase in polyQ aggregate load negatively correlates with the neuronal expression of certain HSPs in multiple mouse models (2Helmlinger D. Yvert G. Picaud S.

Although the pathological role of polyQ aggregates remains controversial and could be disease-specific, the therapeutic potential of manipulating HSP expression has been staked largely on the possibility of reducing toxicity by limiting the misfolding and/or promoting the clearance of polyQ-expanded proteins.HSPs contribute to normal cell physiology and are crucial components of the cellular stress response. Many HSPs serve as molecular chaperones to facilitate folding or refolding of protein substrates that otherwise would be targeted for degradation. The HSP70 family, comprising constitutive and inducible members, is prominently involved in the proper folding of both nascent and mature proteins. Co-chaperones, such as HSP40 proteins and BAG1, directly stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP70 that is required for these processes (7Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). As part of its collaboration, HSP40 mediates the initial recognition of conformationally immature (8Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or misfolded (1Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Some stress-induced proteins, including HSP27, which is alternatively referred to as Hsp25 in mice or HSPB1 in general, can also modulate cell death by antagonizing various steps in apoptotic pathways (9Dierick I. Irobi J. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that polyQ-expanded TBP causes down-regulation of Hsp27, resulting in diminished neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and neuritic defects in primary neurons cultured from SCA17 transgenic mice (6Friedman M.J. Shah A.G. Fang Z.H. Ward E.G. Warren S.T. Li S. Li X.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although HSP27 performs critical functions in the cytoplasm that promote neuronal viability and neuritic integrity (11Williams K.L. Rahimtula M. Mearow K.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Stetler R.A. Cao G. Gao Y. Zhang F. Wang S. Weng Z. Vosler P. Zhang L. Signore A. Graham S.H. Chen J. J.

Dermatol. 1994; 102: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Adhikari A.S. Sridhar Rao K. Rangaraj N. Parnaik V.K. Mohan Rao C. Exp.

Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the role of nuclear HSP27 in neuronal protection remains unclear.Here, we provide evidence that nuclear HSP27 interacts with the transcription factor SP1 and stimulates SP1-dependent gene expression. Moreover, in a PC12 cell model of SCA17, overexpression of HSP27 rescues decreased expression of the neurotrophic receptor TrkA (tyrosine kinase receptor A), which is transcriptionally regulated by SP1. These results support a novel role for nuclear HSP27 in transcriptional activation and suggest that down-regulation of HSPs in the polyQ diseases, as has been widely observed, could directly impact gene expression.DISCUSSIONThese findings indicate that HSP27, unlike molecular chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP40, is not necessarily involved in the cellular response to aggregation by polyQ-expanded TBP. However, nuclear HSP27 can potentiate SP1-dependent gene transcription, suggesting a novel mechanism for neuronal protection by a small HSP. This nuclear effect is seemingly distinct from cytoprotective roles that HSP27 fulfills in the cytoplasm.Like half of the 10-member mammalian small HSP family, HSP27 is constitutively expressed in the brain (29Quraishe S. Asuni A. Boelens W.C. O'Connor V. Wyttenbach A. Neuroscience. 2008; 153: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) albeit in a cell-specific manner (30Armstrong C.L. Krueger-Naug A.M. Currie R.W. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 434: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Hsp27 by small interfering RNA inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured primary neurons, which is the opposite effect elicited by its overexpression in the same system (11Williams K.L. Rahimtula M. Mearow K.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutation of HSP27 is causative in two related peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B, which are characterized by axonal degeneration. Moreover, HSP27 has been implicated in the neuronal response to acute and chronic stress. Among the various tissues in which the small HSP is expressed, the brain is one of maybe only a few that show clear up-regulation of Hsp27 in response to whole body hyperthermic challenge (31Huang L. Min J.N. Masters S. Mivechi N.F. Moskophidis D. Genesis. 2007; 45: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously implicated HSP27 as a genetic modifier of the polyQ disease SCA17 (6Friedman M.J. Shah A.G. Fang Z.H. Ward E.G. Warren S.T. Li S. Li X.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and other studies have suggested that polyQ-dependent toxicity is correlated with a failure to up-regulate (32Evert B.O. Vogt I.R. Vieira-Saecker A.M. Ozimek L. de Vos R.A. Brunt E.R. Klockgether T. Wüllner U. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Tsai H.F.

Thus, altered HSP27 expression or function may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases.Several cellular functions have been attributed to HSP27, which is predominantly cytoplasmic in many cell types under steady-state conditions but translocates to the nucleus in response to stressful stimuli. In the cytoplasm, HSP27 binds actin and tubulin to influence the dynamics and structure of the cytoskeleton (9Dierick I. Irobi J. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, unengaged HSP27 forms tetramers with itself or potentially another small HSP, such as HSPB8 (9Dierick I. Irobi J. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Fontaine J.M. Sun X. Hoppe A.D. Simon S. Vicart P. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2168-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), that readily assemble into large oligomers. These high molecular weight complexes, which are capable of binding multiple molecules of a misfolded substrate, have been shown to confer chaperone activity in vitro (36Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Given that phosphorylation of HSP27 is necessary for oligomer disassembly and is correlated with its entry into the nucleus (28Geum D. Son G.H. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19913-19921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), nuclear HSP27 might be limited to a non-oligomeric quaternary structure that would preclude a chaperone function.Although some small HSPs possess molecular chaperone activity in vivo, a capacity for HSP27 to refold a denatured natural substrate has not been demonstrated in cultured cells or mammalian tissues. Coexpression of HSP27 and huntingtin exon 1 with 43Q or of the androgen receptor with 65Q in CCL39 lung fibroblasts results in a noticeable increase in both the SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble content of the mutant polyQ proteins. Meanwhile, exogenous HSPB8 elicits the opposite effect (23Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chávez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HSP27 also increases the aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 in a Huntington disease neuronal cell model (37Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We observed a similar phenomenon following cotransfection of HEK 293T cells with HSP27 and TBP-105Q. Moreover, we detected recruitment of Hsp70 but not Hsp27 in nuclear inclusions formed by mutant TBP in primary neurons cultured from SCA17 transgenic mice. This finding is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that, unlike HSP70 family members, HSP27 does not colocalize with intranuclear aggregates formed by the mutant version of the polyQ disease protein ataxin-3 in cultured cells or patient brains (38Chai Y. Koppenhafer S.L. Bonini N.M. Paulson H.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10338-10347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to molecular chaperones such as HSP40 and HSP70, it is unlikely that the neuronal protection conferred by HSP27 is due to a direct effect on the accumulation of misfolded polyQ proteins.Transcriptional roles for certain HSPs, including HSP27, have been proposed previously. HSPs have been implicated in both the assembly (26Zoubeidi A. Zardan A. Beraldi E. Fazli L. Sowery R. Rennie P. Nelson C. Gleave M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10455-10465Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and disassembly (39Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 2002; 296: 2232-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) of transcriptional complexes. HSPs can promote transcriptional activation by regulating transcription factor conformation (40Hainaut P. Milner J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 41Georget V. Térouanne B. Nicolas J.C. Sultan C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11824-11831Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and stability (26Zoubeidi A. Zardan A. Beraldi E. Fazli L. Sowery R. Rennie P. Nelson C. Gleave M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10455-10465Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), but genomic mechanisms involving changes in the recruitment of transcription factors to promoter DNA are also plausible.We found that HSP27 interacts with and potentiates the transcriptional activity of SP1. The interplay between nuclear HSP27 and SP1 could influence the expression of many genes, including the gene that encodes HSP27. To analyze the effect of exogenous HSP27 on its own endogenous expression, we utilized a proximal HSP27 promoter fragment that contained two TATA boxes, two estrogen receptor half-elements, two SP1 sites, and a single AP2 site (16Oesterreich S. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Fuqua S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Exclusion of the upstream heat shock element, which normally recruits members of the heat shock factor family of transcriptional activators, indicates that the effect of HSP27 overexpression was probably independent of a previously described HSF1-mediated mechanism of HSP27 autoregulation (42Seo H.R. Chung D.Y. Lee Y.J. Lee D.H. Kim J.I. Bae S. Chung H.Y. Lee S.J. Jeoung D. Lee Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17220-17227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).We have also provided evidence for a broader role of HSP27 in SP1-mediated gene expression. We found that, in addition to inducing its own TATA-containing promoter, HSP27, particularly when targeted to the nucleus, stimulated SP1-dependent transcriptional activity from the TATA-less promoters of the neurotrophic receptor genes TRKA and Ngfrp75. Overexpression of either HSP40 or HSP70 failed to activate any of the gene promoters tested, indicating a specific role for HSP27 in transcriptional activation. Our data are consistent with the possibility that nuclear HSP27 functions as a transcriptional cofactor for SP1, but additional experiments will be needed to determine whether the interaction between the two proteins is direct. Also, it remains to be demonstrated that the small HSP is present at the promoters of certain SP1-regulated genes. Whether nuclear HSP27 modulates promoter occupancy by SP1, potentially via a cooperative interaction, should be evaluated.There is already considerable evidence that HSP27 overexpression is protective against different types of neuronal insult or injury (12Stetler R.A. Cao G. Gao Y. Zhang F. Wang S. Weng Z. Vosler P. Zhang L. Signore A. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13038-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Latchman D.S. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2005; 21: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). With regard to polyQ-mediated pathology, elevated expression of HSP27 attenuates mutant huntingtin toxicity in cultured mammalian cells (37Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), primary neurons (44Perrin V. Régulier E. Abbas-Terki T. Hassig R. Brouillet E.

Given that SCA17 can phenocopy Huntington disease and accordingly is classified as a Huntington disease-like disease (HDL-4), these findings are probably also applicable to the toxic impact of polyQ-expanded TBP. Indeed, we have shown previously that overexpression of HSP27 is protective against neuritic defects induced by TBP-105Q in primary neurons from SCA17 transgenic mice (6Friedman M.J. Shah A.G. Fang Z.H. Ward E.G. Warren S.T. Li S. Li X.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Earlier data and those presented herein indicate that neuroprotection may be conferred by both cytoplasmic and nuclear HSP27. Whereas cytoplasmic HSP27 could provide structural integrity to both the cell body and neuronal processes via interaction with cytoskeletal elements, as has been documented previously (9Dierick I. Irobi J. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Williams K.L. Rahimtula M. Mearow K.M. BMC Neurosci. 2005; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), nuclear HSP27 may modulate the expression of certain disease-associated genes that are important for neuronal function. In SCA17 and likely other polyQ diseases, reduced availability of HSP27 in neuronal nuclei could exacerbate pathological changes in gene expression mediated by a mutant polyQ protein or fragment (46Li S. Li X.J. Mol. Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Benn C.L. Fox H. Bates G.P. Mol. Neurodegener. 2008; 3: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Accordingly, augmenting the function or level of nuclear HSP27 may prove beneficial in alleviating polyQ-dependent neuropathology. Protein misfolding is a characteristic feature of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including the polyglutamine (polyQ) 3The abbreviations used are: polyQpolyglutamineHSPheat shock proteinTBPTATA-binding proteinSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaNLSnuclear localization signalEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: polyQpolyglutamineHSPheat shock proteinTBPTATA-binding proteinSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaNLSnuclear localization signalEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. diseases, which are caused by expansion of a CAG or mixed CAA/CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region of at least nine unrelated genes. Various heat shock proteins (HSPs), as well as ubiquitin, proteasomal subunits, and autophagic markers, have been detected in intracellular aggregates formed by mutant polyQ proteins expressed in cultured cells, transgenic mice, and patient brains, indicating that these structures engage the cellular response to misfolded protein (1Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the time-dependent increase in polyQ aggregate load negatively correlates with the neuronal expression of certain HSPs in multiple mouse models (2Helmlinger D. Yvert G. Picaud S.

Although the pathological role of polyQ aggregates remains controversial and could be disease-specific, the therapeutic potential of manipulating HSP expression has been staked largely on the possibility of reducing toxicity by limiting the misfolding and/or promoting the clearance of polyQ-expanded proteins. polyglutamine heat shock protein TATA-binding protein spinocerebellar ataxia nuclear localization signal enhanced green fluorescent protein. polyglutamine heat shock protein TATA-binding protein spinocerebellar ataxia nuclear localization signal enhanced green fluorescent protein. HSPs contribute to normal cell physiology and are crucial components of the cellular stress response. Many HSPs serve as molecular chaperones to facilitate folding or refolding of protein substrates that otherwise would be targeted for degradation. The HSP70 family, comprising constitutive and inducible members, is prominently involved in the proper folding of both nascent and mature proteins. Co-chaperones, such as HSP40 proteins and BAG1, directly stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP70 that is required for these processes (7Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). As part of its collaboration, HSP40 mediates the initial recognition of conformationally immature (8Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or misfolded (1Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) substrates and delivers these client proteins to HSP70 (8Fan C.Y. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Some stress-induced proteins, including HSP27, which is alternatively referred to as Hsp25 in mice or HSPB1 in general, can also modulate cell death by antagonizing various steps in apoptotic pathways (9Dierick I. Irobi J. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that polyQ-expanded TBP causes down-regulation of Hsp27, resulting in diminished neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and neuritic defects in primary neurons cultured from SCA17 transgenic mice (6Friedman M.J. Shah A.G. Fang Z.H. Ward E.G. Warren S.T. Li S. Li X.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although HSP27 performs critical functions in the cytoplasm that promote neuronal viability and neuritic integrity (11Williams K.L. Rahimtula M. Mearow K.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Stetler R.A. Cao G. Gao Y. Zhang F. Wang S. Weng Z. Vosler P. Zhang L. Signore A. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13038-13055Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it also accumulates in neuronal nuclei in response to stress (13McClaren M. Isseroff R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Adhikari A.S. Sridhar Rao K. Rangaraj N. Parnaik V.K. Mohan Rao C. Exp.

Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the role of nuclear HSP27 in neuronal protection remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that nuclear HSP27 interacts with the transcription factor SP1 and stimulates SP1-dependent gene expression. Moreover, in a PC12 cell model of SCA17, overexpression of HSP27 rescues decreased expression of the neurotrophic receptor TrkA (tyrosine kinase receptor A), which is transcriptionally regulated by SP1. These results support a novel role for nuclear HSP27 in transcriptional activation and suggest that down-regulation of HSPs in the polyQ diseases, as has been widely observed, could directly impact gene expression. DISCUSSIONThese findings indicate that HSP27, unlike molecular chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP40, is not necessarily involved in the cellular response to aggregation by polyQ-expanded TBP. However, nuclear HSP27 can potentiate SP1-dependent gene transcription, suggesting a novel mechanism for neuronal protection by a small HSP. This nuclear effect is seemingly distinct from cytoprotective roles that HSP27 fulfills in the cytoplasm.Like half of the 10-member mammalian small HSP family, HSP27 is constitutively expressed in the brain (29Quraishe S. Asuni A. Boelens W.C. O'Connor V. Wyttenbach A. Neuroscience. 2008; 153: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) albeit in a cell-specific manner (30Armstrong C.L. Krueger-Naug A.M. Currie R.W. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 434: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Hsp27 by small interfering RNA inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured primary neurons, which is the opposite effect elicited by its overexpression in the same system (11Williams K.L. Rahimtula M. Mearow K.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutation of HSP27 is causative in two related peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F and distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 2B, which are characterized by axonal degeneration. Moreover, HSP27 has been implicated in the neuronal response to acute and chronic stress. Among the various tissues in which the small HSP is expressed, the brain is one of maybe only a few that show clear up-regulation of Hsp27 in response to whole body hyperthermic challenge (31Huang L. Min J.N. Masters S. Mivechi N.F. Moskophidis D. Genesis. 2007; 45: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously implicated HSP27 as a genetic modifier of the polyQ disease SCA17 (6Friedman M.J. Shah A.G. Fang Z.H. Ward E.G. Warren S.T. Li S. Li X.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2"
https://openalex.org/W2066808385,"Heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans allosterically activate the serpin, antithrombin, by binding through a specific pentasaccharide sequence containing a critical 3-O-sulfo group. To elucidate the role of the 3-O-sulfo group in the activation mechanism, we compared the effects of deleting the 3-O-sulfo group or mutating the Lys114 binding partner of this group on antithrombin-pentasaccharide interactions by equilibrium binding and rapid kinetic analyses. Binding studies over a wide range of ionic strength and pH showed that loss of the 3-O-sulfo group caused a massive ∼60% loss in binding energy for the antithrombin-pentasaccharide interaction due to the disruption of a cooperative network of ionic and nonionic interactions. Despite this affinity loss, the 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide retained the ability to induce tryptophan fluorescence changes and to enhance factor Xa reactivity in antithrombin, indicative of normal conformational activation. Rapid kinetic studies showed that loss of the 3-O-sulfo group affected both the ability of the pentasaccharide to recognize native antithrombin and its ability to preferentially bind and stabilize activated antithrombin. By contrast, mutation of Lys114 solely affected the preferential interaction of the pentasaccharide with activated antithrombin. These findings demonstrate that the 3-O-sulfo group functions as a key determinant of heparin pentasaccharide activation of antithrombin both by contributing to the Lys114-independent recognition of native antithrombin and by triggering a Lys114-dependent induced fit interaction with activated antithrombin that locks the serpin in the activated state.

Antithrombin, a member of the serpin superfamily of protein protease inhibitors, is the principal physiologic regulator of blood coagulation proteases in vertebrates (1Björk I. Olson S.T.

World Scientific Publishing, Singapore2007: 509-554Google Scholar). Deficiencies of this blood plasma protein thus increase the risk of thrombotic disease (3Van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar), and complete deficiency appears to be incompatible with life (4Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Kadomatsu K. Nakayama Y. Takagi A. Suzuki M. Takeda N. Ito M. Yamamoto K. Matsushita T. Kusugami K. Muramatsu T. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Antithrombin regulates the activity of its major target proteases, thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa, by inactivation of the enzymes through a branched pathway suicide substrate mechanism of inhibition that is characteristic of serpin-protease reactions (5Gettins P. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the protease initially recognizes an exposed reactive loop of the serpin as a normal substrate and proceeds to cleave the loop and form the usual acyl-intermediate. However, once this cleavage has occurred, the serpin is induced to undergo a massive conformational change in which the N-terminal part of the reactive loop inserts into the major β-sheet of the serpin, causing the acyl-linked protease to be dragged to the opposite end of the protein inhibitor and inactivated through conformational distortion (6Dementiev A. Dobó J. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3452-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast to the rapid rates at which many serpins inactivate their target proteases, antithrombin inhibits coagulation proteases at slow nonphysiologic rates. However, these inhibition rates increase up to several thousand-fold in the presence of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans, heparin and heparan sulfate, which thereby act as efficient anticoagulants (9Olson S.T. Björk I. Bock S.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The accelerating effects of heparin and heparan sulfate on antithrombin-protease reactions are dependent on the binding of a sequence-specific pentasaccharide to the serpin (10Petitou M. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), present in about one-third of naturally occurring heparin chains and in a much smaller fraction of heparan sulfate chains (12Marcum J.A.

A characteristic structural marker of the specific antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide region is the 3-O-sulfonated central glucosamine residue (Fig. 1), which is absent or rare in other parts of the heparin molecule (10Petitou M. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochimie. 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex and mutagenesis studies have shown that antithrombin basic residues in the N-terminal region, helix A, helix D, and the loop preceding helix D form a positively charged site to which the negatively charged pentasaccharide binds (13Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Lys114, Lys125, and Arg129 are the most important of these residues, with Lys114, the binding partner of the 3-O-sulfo group, contributing the greatest binding energy (9Olson S.T. Björk I. Bock S.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the interaction of a variant pentasaccharide lacking the 3-O-sulfo group with antithrombin. This variant has been previously reported to poorly bind antithrombin and to have greatly reduced anticoagulant activity, suggesting an essential role of the 3-O-sulfo group in binding and activating antithrombin (15Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Peitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J.

Res. 1988; 52: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, quantitative studies were done at physiologic ionic strength and pH, where binding to antithrombin was extremely weak, and the extent of inhibitor activation was difficult to quantify. We show, by analyzing pentasaccharide binding to and activation of α- and β-glycoforms of antithrombin over a wide range of ionic strength and pH, that deletion of the 3-O-sulfo group results in tremendous ∼104 to 105-fold losses in affinity for antithrombin under physiologic conditions due to the disruption of a cooperative network of ionic and nonionic interactions that stabilize the complex. Despite these large losses in affinity and in contrast to past reports (16Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Peitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6454-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), loss of the 3-O-sulfo group does not affect the ability of the pentasaccharide to induce conformational activation of antithrombin. Rapid kinetic studies of the variant pentasaccharide interaction with antithrombin reveal marked effects of 3-O-desulfonation on both initial binding and subsequent conformational activation steps. These effects contrast with the effects of mutating the Lys114 binding partner of the 3-O-sulfo group, which exclusively involve the second conformational activation step (14Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Together, our findings show that the 3-O-sulfo group is of greater quantitative importance for the antithrombin-pentasaccharide interaction than any other pentasaccharide sulfo group or mutated antithrombin investigated so far due to its dual role in recognizing the native antithrombin conformation as well as in preferentially binding and stabilizing the activated antithrombin conformation. In the latter role, our results suggest that the 3-O-sulfo group must engage Lys114 to position pentasaccharide and antithrombin residues for an induced fit interaction that enhances affinity and locks antithrombin in the activated state. N135Q and K114M/N135Q recombinant antithrombin variants that lacked glycosylation at Asn135, and thereby mimicked the natural β-form of plasma antithrombin, were expressed in BHK cells and purified as previously reported (14Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fully glycosylated α-antithrombin was isolated from human plasma as described (19Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the 280-nm absorbance using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700 m−1 cm−1 (20Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The synthetic pentasaccharide, DEFGH, corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in high affinity heparin chains, and a variant pentasaccharide lacking the 3-O-sulfo group of the central saccharide F were generously provided by Sanofi-Aventis (Toulouse, France) (Fig. 1). The concentration of the natural pentasaccharide was based on stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the saccharide at inhibitor concentrations exceeding KD, as described previously (11Olson S.T.

The concentration of the 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide was determined based on the weight and molecular mass of the saccharide. Human α-thrombin was a gift from Dr. John Fenton (formerly of the New York State Department of Health). Human factor Xa (mostly α form) was purchased from Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). Concentrations of proteases were assessed from their activities in standard assays with peptidyl-p-nitroanilide chromogenic substrates and were based on calibration of these assays with active site-titrated enzymes (21Olson S.T.

All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Studies of the 3-O-desulfonated and natural pentasaccharide interactions with N135Q antithrombin and plasma antithrombin or of the natural pentasaccharide interaction with K114M/N135Q antithrombin were done in buffers of 10–20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, adjusted to pH 6.0 or pH 7.4. The ionic strength of the 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer is 0.025 at pH 6, whereas 10–20 mm sodium phosphate buffers at pH 7.4 correspond to ionic strengths of 0.025–0.05. NaCl was added to achieve higher ionic strengths. For experiments in pH 6 buffer, antithrombin was extensively diluted from a pH 7.4 buffer just prior to the experiment to minimize losses in activity due to reduced stability at the lower pH. Dissociation equilibrium constants for the binding of the different pentasaccharides to N135Q, K114M/N135Q, and plasma antithrombins were measured by titrations monitored by the enhancement of the intrinsic protein fluorescence accompanying the binding, as in past studies (11Olson S.T.

Affinities of the natural and variant pentasaccharides for recombinant and plasma antithrombins were determined at pH 6.0 or pH 7.4 with antithrombin concentrations ranging from 50 to 2000 nm. Titrations were computer-fit by nonlinear least-squares analysis to the quadratic binding equation, ΔFobs/Fo=ΔFmax/Fo×(n[AT]o+[H]o+KD,obs-((n[AT]o+[H]o+KD,obs)2-4n[AT]o[H]o)/2)/(2n[AT]o)(Eq. 1) where ΔFobs/Fo and ΔFmax/Fo are the observed and maximal changes in fluorescence relative to the initial fluorescence, respectively, [AT]o and [H]o are the total antithrombin and heparin concentrations, respectively, KD,obs is the observed dissociation constant, and n is the binding stoichiometry. The binding stoichiometry was assumed to be 1, and KD,obs and ΔFmax/Fo were fitted as parameters. Corrections were made for nonbinding protein in the recombinant antithrombin preparations based on measured stoichiometries of thrombin inhibition as in past studies (14Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M.

The kinetics of pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin were analyzed under pseudo-first order conditions as in past studies (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

Experiments analyzing the binding of the natural and desulfonated pentasaccharides to N135Q antithrombin or of the natural pentasaccharide to K114M/N135Q antithrombin were done at I 0.04, pH 6.0. Pentasaccharide concentrations were at least 5-fold higher than antithrombin concentrations. Progress curves were fit by a single exponential function to give the observed pseudo-first order rate constant, kobs. Multiple curves were averaged to improve signal/noise at subsaturating saccharide concentrations, and reported kobs values reflect global average values from at least 20 reaction traces. For binding of the desulfonated pentasaccharide to antithrombin, fluorescence amplitudes were confirmed to increase nearly proportionally with saccharide concentration over the range examined, in accordance with the measured KD for the interaction. Simulations of the kinetics of heparin binding to antithrombin based on kinetic parameters derived from fitting progress curve data to the general two-step binding mechanism were done using Global Kinetic Explorer software (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) (22Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries of uncatalyzed and pentasaccharide-catalyzed reactions of N135Q, K114M/N135Q, and plasma antithrombins with thrombin or factor Xa were determined as described previously (19Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A fixed concentration of protease (100–1000 nm) was incubated with increasing molar ratios of inhibitor to enzyme of 1–2 in 50–100 μl of I 0.025, pH 6 or I 0.15, pH 7.4 sodium phosphate buffers for times sufficient to achieve complete reaction based on measured reaction rate constants. When present, normal or variant pentasaccharides were added at a fixed level to yield comparable extents of saturation of antithrombin based on measured KD values, such that the pentasaccharide-accelerated reaction was dominant. Residual enzyme activity was determined by adding 900–950 μl of 100 μm S-2238 for thrombin reactions or 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) for factor Xa reactions and monitoring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis from the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm. Plots of residual enzyme activity versus molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme were fit by linear regression and the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) 2The abbreviations used are: SIstoichiometry of inhibitionATantithrombinH5pentasaccharide. obtained from the abscissa intercept. stoichiometry of inhibition antithrombin pentasaccharide. Second order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin or factor Xa by N135Q, K114M/N135Q, and plasma antithrombins in the absence and presence of natural or 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharides were measured under pseudo-first order conditions at I 0.025, pH 6.0 or I 0.15, pH 7.4 as in past studies (11Olson S.T.

Reaction mixtures of 100 μl contained 100–1000 nm antithrombin and 5–50 nm protease and different concentrations of pentasaccharide. Reaction mixtures were incubated for increasing times at fixed pentasaccharide concentrations or for fixed times at increasing pentasaccharide concentrations at 25 °C in polyethylene glycol-coated polystyrene cuvettes and then quenched with 900 μl of 100 μm S-2238 for thrombin or of 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa in I 0.15 sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50–100 μg/ml Polybrene. The residual protease activity was determined from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis, as indicated above. Observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) were obtained from computer fits of the time-dependent or pentasaccharide concentration-dependent decrease in enzymatic activity by an exponential function with a zero activity end point (23Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Uncatalyzed reactions of protease with antithrombin were shown to be free of traces of heparin by analyses in the absence or presence of 0.1 mg/ml Polybrene. Second order rate constants for uncatalyzed reactions were calculated by dividing kobs by the antithrombin concentration. Pentasaccharide-catalyzed reactions of N135Q and plasma antithrombins with thrombin were determined at saturating pentasaccharide concentrations for the natural pentasaccharide and at subsaturating concentrations for the 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide reactions. For the latter, the fitted kobs was corrected for the free antithrombin reaction and then divided by the concentration of antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex, as calculated from the quadratic binding equation using the measured KD for the interaction (19Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Second order rate constants for pentasaccharide-catalyzed reactions of antithrombin with factor Xa were determined using two methods. For reactions at I 0.15, pH 7.4, the decrease in protease activity with increasing subsaturating saccharide concentration at a fixed reaction time was fit by an exponential decay function, and the second order rate constant was obtained from the equation, kH=Kobs/(t×[AT]o/([AT]o+KD))(Eq. 2) where t represents the fixed reaction time, [AT]o is the antithrombin concentration, and KD is the measured dissociation constant for the antithrombin-pentasaccharide interaction (23Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the second method used for reactions at I 0.025, pH 6, apparent second order rate constants were measured as a function of increasing saccharide concentrations over a range that approached saturation of antithrombin and were then fit by the quadratic binding equation (24Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Apparent association rate constants were determined in this case for fixed reaction times from the equation, Ka=-ln(V/Vo)/(t×[AT]o)(Eq. 3) where v and vo represent the initial rates of substrate hydrolysis of enzyme after reaction for the fixed time, t, or for an unreacted enzyme control, respectively. To assess the effect of 3-O-desulfonation on the ability of the sequence-specific heparin pentasaccharide, DEFGH (Fig. 1), to allosterically activate antithrombin, we initially compared the binding of natural and 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharides to antithrombin. Binding was measured by titrating antithrombin tryptophan fluorescence changes that report binding as in past studies. Binding was examined with a β-type N135Q variant of antithrombin missing the N-linked carbohydrate chain at Asn135 that interferes with heparin binding (25Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V.

Chem. 1985; 260: 610-615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and under conditions of low ionic strength (I 0.025), pH 6.0, and 25 °C. These conditions were chosen to strengthen heparin binding affinity and thereby allow accurate measurement of the anticipated weak affinity of the 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide for antithrombin (15Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Desai U.R. Petitou M. Björk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7478-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide produced a saturable increase in antithrombin tryptophan fluorescence like the natural pentasaccharide under these low ionic strength and pH conditions (Fig. 2). Nonlinear least squares fitting of variant pentasaccharide binding curves by the equilibrium binding equation yielded an average KD of 2.8 ± 0.2 μm. Binding of the natural pentasaccharide under the same conditions was stoichiometric and too tight to measure accurately. An estimated KD of 40 fm could be obtained by extrapolation of values measured at higher ionic strengths at the same pH (Fig. 3) (see below), a value that agrees with the one estimated in previous studies for the N135Q antithrombin-pentasaccharide interaction at I 0.025, pH 6, 25 °C (14Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results indicate a dramatic loss in affinity of the pentasaccharide for antithrombin of ∼108-fold at I 0.025, pH 6, when the 3-O-sulfo group is deleted (Table 1). Maximal fluorescence changes induced in antithrombin by the binding of natural and variant pentasaccharides in these experiments were similar (36–37%), indicating that loss of the 3-O-sulfo group did not affect the ability of the bound saccharide to conformationally activate antithrombin (Table 1).FIGURE 3Sodium ion concentration dependence of observed dissociation equilibrium constants (KD,obs) for the binding of natural and 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharides (H5) to N135Q and K114M/N135Q antithrombins at pH 6 and pH 7.4, 25 °C. ●, natural H5, N135Q AT, pH 6.0; ○, natural H5, N135Q AT, pH 7.4; ▴, 3-O-desulfonated H5, N135Q AT, pH 6.0; ▵, 3-O-desulfonated H5, N135Q AT, pH 7.4; □, natural H5, K114M/N135Q AT, pH 7.4.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the large loss in pentasaccharide affinity for antithrombin caused by deletion of the 3-O-sulfo group was due to changes in the ionic or nonionic components of the binding interaction, we evaluated the dependence of the observed dissociation constant, KD,obs, for the interaction on ionic strength. Fluorescence titrations of the binding of the 3-O-desulfonated pentasaccharide to N135Q antithrombin at pH 6.0 and ionic strengths ranging from 0.025 to ∼0.09 or the binding of the natural pentasaccharide at pH 6.0 and higher ionic strengths of 0.3–0.6 showed saturable binding curves with indistinguishable maximal fluorescence enhancements but with progressive decreases in saccharide affinity for antithrombin with increasing ionic strength. The ionic and nonionic components of the binding were resolved from the linear dependence of log KD,obs on log [Na+] for the two saccharide interactions (Fig. 2), in accordance with the equation (11Olson S.T.

The slopes and intercepts of these plots showed that about six (5.8 ± 0.6) ionic interactions contributed to the binding of the natural pentasaccharide to N135Q antithrombin at pH 6.0 and that nonionic interactions contributed significantly to the binding (log K′D = −5.8 ± 0.2) (Fig. 3 and Table 2).

In addition, we examined the pattern of mtDNA mutation in corresponding tumors and normal lymph nodes obtained from eight other patients with primary lung cancers. The entire 16.5 kb mitochondrial genome was sequenced on Affymetrix Mitochip v2.0 sequencing platform in every sample. To examine mtDNA content index, we performed real-time PCR analysis.The airway mucosal biopsies obtained from three lung cancer patients were histopathologically negative but exhibited multiple clonal mtDNA mutations detectable in the corresponding tumors. One of the patients was operated twice for the removal of tumor from the right upper and left lower lobe respectively within a span of two years. Both of these tumors exhibited twenty identical mtDNA mutations. MtDNA content increased significantly (P<0.001) in the lung cancer and all the histologically negative mucosal biopsies except one compared to the control lymph node.Our results document the extent of massive clonal patches that develop in lifetime smokers and ultimately give rise to clinically significant cancers. These observations shed light on the extent of disease in the airway of smokers traceable through mtDNA mutation. MtDNA mutation could be a reliable tool for molecular assessment of respiratory epithelium exposed to continuous smoke as well as disease detection and monitoring. Functional analysis of the pathogenic mtDNA mutations may be useful to understand their role in lung tumorigenesis."

We reported recently that NUCB1 is a negative regulator of the unfolded protein response that activates various endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-originating signaling pathways. In that report, we also showed that Golgi localization of NUCB1 was essential to regulate the unfolded protein response. However, the localization mechanism of NUCB1 is still unknown. Here, we report that the proline residue at the +2-position (Pro+2) from the signal peptide cleavage site is the determinant of NUCB1 protein export from the ER and subsequent transport to the Golgi. Fusion of the N-terminal amino acids 1–35 peptide region, including both signal peptide (amino acids 1–26) and Pro+2, was sufficient for enhanced green fluorescent protein to localize in the Golgi, whereas single amino acid mutation of Pro+2 resulted in defective export from the ER without affecting the protein maturation process. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Pro+2 was important for the enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein to concentrate at a transport vesicle formation site within the ER, often termed the ER exit site. Interestingly, such a Pro+2 has also been functionally conserved in other Golgi-localized soluble proteins, Cab45 (Ca2+-binding protein of 45 kDa), reticulocalbin 1, and calumenin.

Newly synthesized, premature NUCB1 protein is first targeted into the ER via its N-terminal ER signal peptide. After removal of the signal peptide in the ER, a mature NUCB1 protein is transported to the Golgi apparatus and then secreted to the extracellular matrix (11Lavoie C. Meerloo T. Lin P. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2462-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NUCB1 in the Golgi pool is probably involved in establishing the agonist-mobilizable Golgi Ca2+ store (3Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H. McQuistan T. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Golgi-localized NUCB1 regulates the unfolded protein response, which is a cellular stress response that triggers various events, such as ER-resident molecular chaperone induction, translational repression, and apoptosis under ER stress conditions (12Tsukumo Y. Tomida A. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Asada S. Mori K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29264-29272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, extracellular NUCB1 has been suggested to serve as a modulator of matrix maturation in bone, based on the observations that NUCB1 is secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes and can, indeed, be detected in the osteoid extracellular matrix (7Wendel M.

Thus, Golgi transport and subsequent secretion of NUCB1 seem to be important to exert the protein's activity, but little is known about its transport regulation mechanism. In eukaryotic cells, a tremendous variety of soluble and membrane cargo proteins are packaged into transport vesicles at the ER. Vesicle formation on the ER membrane begins with the assembly of a coat protein complex II (COPII) (14Barlowe C. Trends. Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This COPII coat consists of Sar1, Sec23-Sec24, and Sec13-Sec31 complexes that are sequentially recruited to the ER membrane. Sar1 is a small GTPase that regulates coat assembly and disassembly. To assemble the COPII coat, Sar1-GTP transiently associates with an export cargo protein and then binds to Sec23-Sec24, which in turn attracts Sec13-Sec31 (14Barlowe C. Trends. Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Polymerization of the formed COPII coat, which occurs at the so-called ER exit site (ERES), triggers transport vesicle budding on the ER membrane (14Barlowe C. Trends. Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Then the vesicles fuse with the VTC compartment (vesiculo-tubular clusters, also called ERGIC) that mediates further protein transport to the Golgi apparatus. Cargo proteins are then carried to their final destinations, such as organelle, cell surface membrane, and extracellular matrix (14Barlowe C. Trends. Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that some transmembrane cargoes contain specific motifs to be selectively concentrated in the transport vesicle within the ER. This sorting motif is called the ER export signal. Representative ER export signals are the diacidic motif (DXE), dihydrophobic (LL) motif, and diaromatic motif (FF, YY) that have been found in vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, ERGIC-53, and Emp46p, respectively (16Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol.

These export signals are present in the cytoplasmic region of the cargo proteins and mediate their interaction with the COPII complex at the outer side of the ER membrane, resulting in concentration in the newly formed budding vesicle. On the other hand, the soluble type of cargo proteins require their cargo receptor to be sorted into the COPII vesicle, because they cannot interact directly with COPII complex, since these proteins have no cytoplasmic region. Although recent studies have reported the existence of the cargo receptor and functional ER export signals found in some soluble cargo proteins, little is known about many other cargo receptors and the export signals of soluble cargo proteins (19Otte S. Barlowe C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Pro28, which is located at the +2-position (Pro+2) from the signal peptide cleavage site of the NUCB1 protein, is a determinant of its export from the ER. In fact, single amino acid substitution (P28A) led to predominant ER distribution and reduced the secretion of NUCB1 without affecting its maturation process in the ER. We also demonstrated that Pro+2 is required for concentration at the ERES. It is important to note that Pro+2 was also conserved functionally in other proteins. Our results indicate that Pro+2 can function as a new ER export signal. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NUCB1 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to C-terminal CEKKLLERLPEVEVPQHL of the human NUCB1 protein (12Tsukumo Y. Tomida A. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Asada S. Mori K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29264-29272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following commercially available antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL (StressGen; Victoria, Canada), anti-Golgin-97 (Invitrogen), anti-ATF6 (activation transcription factor 6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG M2, anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-V5 (Sigma), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (GE Healthcare). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (for HT1080) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293T) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml of kanamycin and were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were lysed in a 1× SDS sample buffer, and protein concentrations of the lysates were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. To analyze secreted proteins, culture medium (serum-free) was concentrated with Microcon YM-30 (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and then boiled in a 1× SDS buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred by electroblotting to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies, and the specific signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in an SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Cells on a polylysine-coated coverslip were fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocking for 1 h in PBS with 10% bovine serum albumin, we incubated the cells with primary (mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000), rabbit anti-V5 (1:1000), mouse anti-Golgin-97 (1:1000); or mouse anti-KDEL (1:1000)) and subsequent secondary antibodies (Alexa-fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000) or Alexa-fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (1:1000); Invitrogen)) in PBS with 1.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and observed under Olympus IX71 microscope at ×400 magnification with appropriate filters to detect fluorescence. Expression vectors for V5-tagged NUCB1, RCN1, Calumenin, Cab45, and Sar1 (pcDNA3.1 TOPO V5/His; Invitrogen) were constructed by TA-cloning each cDNA amplified by reverse transcription-PCR into pcDNA3.1 TOPO V5/His (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged NUCB1 was constructed by subcloning into the HindIII/NotI site of pFLAG-CMV-5c (Sigma) from pNUCB1(pcDNA3.1). Non-tagged NUCB1 was constructed by ligating PCR-amplified NUCB1 into the HindIII/NotI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Each of the NUCB1 deletion mutants (Mut1, Mut2, Mut3, Mut4, and Mut5) was produced by TA cloning of each segment of NUCB1 amplified by PCR and using the pNUCB1-V5 plasmid (pcDNA3.1) as the template. p1–35aa-EGFP was produced by ligating a PCR-amplified EGFP gene immediately downstream of the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal 35 amino acids in pcDNA3. pSec13-DsRed was produced by ligating a PCR-amplified DsRed gene immediately downstream of the human sec13 DNA sequence subcloned in pcDNA3.1. GalT-YFP was purchased from TAKARA Bio, Japan (pEYFP Golgi vector). For point mutation, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The proper construction of plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were performed using either FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) for HT1080 cells or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 293T, according to each manufacturer's protocol. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were used for each assay. In vitro translation was done using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Reaction mixtures containing 1 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membrane fractions at 30 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by adding a 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. 293T cells transfected transiently with a vector that encodes FLAG-tagged NUCB1-WT or -P28A (4 × 105/well in a 6-well plate) were incubated for 10 min in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 10 min, using the 300 μCi/ml easy tag EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) dissolved in 400 μl of the above mentioned medium. To chase 35S-labeled proteins, cells were washed with fresh medium and incubated in fresh, complete medium for various time periods. After medium was removed, cells were lysed (Tris buffer with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads. Then each sample was boiled for 5 min in SDS buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After gel drying, the incorporated [35S]Met/Cys was visualized with Typhoon9410 image analyzer (GE Healthcare). The lysate prepared from HT1080 cells using Triton X-100 were boiled in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min before digestion by endoglycosidase H or peptide N-glycosidase F (Glyko, San Leandro, CA). After the addition of 5× reaction buffer (Glyko), we incubated the samples for 20 h at 37 °C in the presence of 20 milliunits of sialidase C (Glyko), 0.5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H, or 2 milliunits of peptide N-glycosidase F. Fluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal microscope using 488-nm laser excitation for EGFP or 543 nm for DsRed. 293T cells were transiently transfected with RCN1, Cab45, or calumenin plasmids (FLAG tag). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were immunopurified with anti-FLAG beads. Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining the membrane with Ponceau S (0.1% (w/v) Ponceau, 1% acetic acid (v/v) in distilled water), the sample bands were cut out for peptide sequence. N-terminal amino acids up to the fifth were determined by standard Edman degradation using a Procise 494 HT (Applied Biosystems). To determine the region necessary for the Golgi localization, we constructed five deletion mutants of NUCB1 (Fig. 1A). As we reported previously, when NUCB1-WT was expressed in HT1080 cells, Golgi localization was confirmed by colocalization of NUCB1 with the Golgi marker Golgin-97 (Fig. 1B, top) (12Tsukumo Y. Tomida A. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Asada S. Mori K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29264-29272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mutants that deleted a large part of the C terminus (Mut1 to -3) also exhibited Golgi localization (Fig. 1B, Mut1 to -3). To examine whether the remaining N-terminal region was important for Golgi localization, we constructed Mut-4 and -5, which lacked aa 35–218 or 27–218 (Fig. 1A). Mut4 (del 35–218) still had the ability to localize in the Golgi, but Mut5 (del 27–218) was largely localized at the ER, as shown by co-localization with the ER marker GRP78 (Fig. 1B, bottom). These results indicate that N-terminal residues 27–35 of NUCB1 are involved in the Golgi localization. To determine whether the N-terminal aa 27–35 region of NUCB1 was sufficient for Golgi localization of the protein, we constructed 1–35EGFP, which fused the aa 1–35 region of NUCB1 to the N terminus of EGFP (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal aa 1–26 region of the NUCB1 protein is known to function as an ER signal peptide, which is critical for ER targeting of newly synthesized polypeptides. Therefore, we fused EGFP with the aa 1–35 region but not the aa 27–35 alone. As we had expected, 1–35EGFP was localized in the Golgi as the NUCB1 protein was (Fig. 2B, top). Using alanine exchange mutants of the aa 27–35 region, we determined the amino acid motifs that were important for Golgi localization. Surprisingly, an alanine exchange of Pro28 or Leu29 weakened the Golgi staining pattern. Instead, they exhibited an ER staining pattern. The P28A mutant, especially, showed a striking ER distribution (Fig. 2B). A similar staining pattern was observed in the NUCB1-P28A mutant (Fig. 2C). These observations indicated that Pro28 of NUCB1 is important for the Golgi localization. Pro28 is located at the +2 position from the N-terminal signal peptide of NUCB1. Interestingly, we found that other ER/Golgi-localized proteins, RCN1 (reticulocalbin 1), calumenin, and Cab45, possess proline at the +2-position from their putative signal peptide cleavage site, using a commonly used signal peptide prediction system, SignalP 3.0 (available on the World Wide Web) (Fig. 3A). These are called CREC (Cab45, reticulocalbin, ERC-45, calumenin) family genes. Although these proteins contain multiple EF-hand motifs, like NUCB1, their functions are largely unknown (21Honoré B. Vorum H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To confirm actual signal peptide cleavage sites of these proteins, we analyzed the N-terminal sequences of FLAG-tagged proteins expressed in 293T cells. The expression of each protein was confirmed by both immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody and Ponceau S staining (Fig. 3, B and C). The sample bands (Fig. 3C) were processed for N-terminal sequencing. We detected amino acid sequences that were completely identical to the sequence beginning from the +1-position from each putative signal peptide cleavage site without overlapping at any other positions (Fig. 3D). Although both Cab45 and calumenin proteins were consistently detected as a doublet band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C), the detected amino acids showed the single peptide sequence. Therefore, the doublet bands may result from posttranslational modifications of these proteins, like NUCB1 (see Fig. 4A). These results demonstrated that RCN1, calumenin, and Cab45 have proline at the +2-position (Pro+2) from the signal peptide cleavage site. As to intercellular localization, both RCN1 and calumenin have been reported to localize in the ER (22Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 699-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yabe D. Nakamura T. Kanazawa N. Tashiro K. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18232-18239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but we observed Golgi localization of these proteins at steady state (Fig. 3E). Cab45 was localized in the Golgi, as reported previously (24Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An alanine substitution of Pro+2 in these proteins led to a striking ER distribution, as observed with NUCB1-P28A (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that Pro+2 determines the Golgi localization of several proteins. To elucidate whether ER distribution of the NUCB1-P28A mutant was due to inefficient transport from the ER to the Golgi, we monitored the oligosaccharide modification state of the NUCB1 protein as a transportation indicator. The NUCB1 protein is known to specifically undergo sialylation at the Golgi, which can be monitored by a slight shift in molecular weight in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) (11Lavoie C. Meerloo T. Lin P. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2462-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Tsukumo Y. Tomida A. Kitahara O. Nakamura Y. Asada S. Mori K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29264-29272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, NUCB1 was selectively deglycosylated by sialidase C treatment but not endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F, whereas ATF6 and GRP94, which are ER proteins that contain N-glycosylation sites, were deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F treatments, as shown by mobility shifts to lower molecular weight (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, NUCB1-P28A was detected as only a single band and was resistant to sialidase C treatment (Fig. 4B). Thus, NUCB1-P28A seemed not to reach the Golgi. To examine turnover kinetics after synthesis of NUCB1-WT or NUCB1-P28A protein, we performed a pulse-chase assay with [35S]Met/Cys labeling (Fig. 4C). After 20–60 min, sialylation of NUCB1-WT was indicated by a shift in molecular weight, suggesting that it was normally transported to the Golgi (Fig. 4C, asterisk). In addition, at 60 min of chase, signal intensity of the intracellular WT protein was reduced by less than 40%. By contrast, NUCB1-P28A exhibited no band shift, and the signal intensity remained more than 70% at that time point. Furthermore, we compared time-dependent secretion into the culture medium of NUCB1-WT with that of NUCB1-P28A by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4D). After changing to fresh medium, the WT protein was detected at 1 h and correlated with the reduction of intracellular [35S]Met signal intensity. On the other hand, the P28A mutant was only marginally detected even after 2 h. Thus, the P28A mutant remained in the ER for a prolonged period. These results suggested that P28A had an abnormality in its ER export step and a defect in subsequent events, such as Golgi transport and secretion. In general, misfolded proteins remain in the ER because of its quality control system. A single amino acid mutation or deletion can potentially affect protein folding within the ER, resulting in a defective export from the ER (25Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Cheung J.C. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, 1–35EGFP(P28A) emitted strong luminescence, as observed with the wild type. Additionally, in a trypsin digestion assay, we saw no apparent difference in the fragment patterns between NUCB1-WT and -P28A (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the Pro28 mutation probably had little effect on the overall protein conformation. Next, we examined whether the mutation of Pro28 affected processing of the N-terminal ER signal peptide, which is an initial step for protein maturation at the ER (27Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The signal peptide targets the newly synthesized polypeptide to the ER, and it is cleaved rapidly after entering the ER. In fact, the N-terminal peptide sequencing of the human NUCB1 protein purified from cell or culture medium detected only the sequence corresponding to amino acids beginning at position 27 (data not shown), indicating that cleavage of the signal peptide indeed occurs between 26 and 27. Pro28 is located at the +2-position from the cleavage site, and such an amino acid residue can affect cleavage efficiency (28Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 29Shen L.M. Lee J.I. Cheng S.Y. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed in vitro a signal peptide cleavage assay using the constructs shown in Fig. 5B. In vitro translation of NUCB1-WT in the presence of the dog microsome fraction, which contains signal peptidase, produced a new lower band corresponding to the Del 1–26aa mutant, which lacks a signal peptide. NUCB1-P28A also produced the lower band at the same level as the wild-type (Fig. 5C). In contrast, in vitro translated V24F/A26F, which was a mutant resistant to signal peptide cleavage due to phenylalanine substitution at −1 and −3-positions, known as sites having a strong effect on signal peptide cleavage (28Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 29Shen L.M. Lee J.I. Cheng S.Y. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), showed no production of the lower band despite the presence of microsome fraction (Fig. 5C). Thus, it is unlikely that the Pro28 mutation affected the signal peptide cleavage process in vitro. Next, we performed a phase separation assay using Triton X-114 to confirm that the Pro28 mutation also had little effect on signal peptide cleavage within the cell. In this assay, hydrophilic proteins are found exclusively in the aqueous phase, and membrane proteins with an amphiphilic nature are recovered in the detergent phase (30Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5D (left), in vitro translated NUCB1 protein, which is a proNUCB1 protein containing a hydrophobic signal peptide, was found in both the detergent and aqueous phases, whereas in vitro translated Del 1–26aa was detected only in the aqueous phase (Fig. 5D, left). To examine in vivo signal peptide processing, we used NUCB1-WT or -P28A protein immunopurified from transiently transfected cells. Neither was detected in the detergent phase (Fig. 5D, right), strongly suggesting that the signal peptide of P28A was processed successfully within the cell. Thus"
https://openalex.org/W1982148294,"The role of pleiotrophin in fetal lung development was investigated. We found that pleiotrophin and its receptor, protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor beta/zeta, were highly expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the fetal lungs, respectively. Using isolated fetal alveolar epithelial type II cells, we demonstrated that pleiotrophin promoted fetal type II cell proliferation and arrested type II cell trans-differentiation into alveolar epithelial type I cells. Pleiotrophin also increased wound healing of injured type II cell monolayer. Knockdown of pleiotrophin influenced lung branching morphogenesis in a fetal lung organ culture model. Pleiotrophin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, promoted beta-catenin translocation into the nucleus, and activated T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors. Dlk1, a membrane ligand that initiates the Notch signaling pathway, was identified as a downstream target of the pleiotrophin/beta-catenin pathway by endogenous dlk1 expression, promoter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. These results provide evidence that pleiotrophin regulates fetal type II cell proliferation and differentiation via integration of multiple signaling pathways including pleiotrophin, beta-catenin, and Notch pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2017637139,"Bloom syndrome caused by inactivation of the Bloom DNA helicase (Blm) is characterized by increases in the level of sister chromatid exchange, homologous recombination (HR) associated with cross-over. It is therefore believed that Blm works as an anti-recombinase. Meanwhile, in Drosophila, DmBlm is required specifically to promote the synthesis-dependent strand anneal (SDSA), a type of HR not associating with cross-over. However, conservation of Blm function in SDSA through higher eukaryotes has been a matter of debate. Here, we demonstrate the function of Blm in SDSA type HR in chicken DT40 B lymphocyte line, where Ig gene conversion diversifies the immunoglobulin V gene through intragenic HR between diverged homologous segments. This reaction is initiated by the activation-induced cytidine deaminase enzyme-mediated uracil formation at the V gene, which in turn converts into abasic site, presumably leading to a single strand gap. Ig gene conversion frequency was drastically reduced in BLM−/− cells. In addition, BLM−/− cells used limited donor segments harboring higher identity compared with other segments in Ig gene conversion event, suggesting that Blm can promote HR between diverged sequences. To further understand the role of Blm in HR between diverged homologous sequences, we measured the frequency of gene targeting induced by an I-SceI-endonuclease-mediated double-strand break. BLM−/− cells showed a severer defect in the gene targeting frequency as the number of heterologous sequences increased at the double-strand break site. Conversely, the overexpression of Blm, even an ATPase-defective mutant, strongly stimulated gene targeting. In summary, Blm promotes HR between diverged sequences through a novel ATPase-independent mechanism.

Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 10Branzei D. Vanoli F. Foiani M. Nature. 2008; 456: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The current model for HR-mediated DSB repair is that DSBs are processed to produce a 3′ single-stranded overhang, along which Rad51 is polymerized (11Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The resulting Rad51-DNA filament undergoes homology search and strand invasion into intact homologous duplex DNA, leading to the formation of the D-loop structure. DNA synthesis from the invading strand followed by dissociation from the homologous duplex DNA and subsequent re-annealing of the newly synthesized strand with the other end of the DSB completes the repair. This type of HR, referred to as synthesis-dependent strand anneal (SDSA), results in sequence transfer from the intact template sequence (donor) to the damaged DNA (recipient), and accounts for the majority of mitotic HR (11Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson R.D. Jasin M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Extensive strand exchange of the D-loop, on the other hand, leads to the generation of Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates. SDSA does not cause cross-overs, whereas HR involving the Holliday junction often causes cross-overs, such as SCE and meiotic HR. An increase in the level of SCE in Bloom syndrome cells therefore supports the idea that Blm suppresses the formation of HJ as well as recombinogenic DNA lesions. This idea is supported by the biochemical evidence of the Blm-dependent resolution of Holliday junctions (14Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in Drosophila, DmBlm is known to facilitate the repair of DSB by promoting SDSA (15Adams M.D. McVey M. Sekelsky J.J. Science. 2003; 299: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 16McVey M. Larocque J.R. Adams M.D. Sekelsky J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15694-15699Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the role of Blm in SDSA in the other higher eukaryotic cells has not been defined. BLM−/− cells established from the chicken DT40 B lymphocyte line exhibit a marked increase in the frequency of both SCE and targeted integration (17Kohzaki M. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Yamazoe M.

In this study, using the chicken DT40 cells, we investigated the role of Blm in SDSA induced by defined DNA damage. To this end, we evaluated this type of SDSA using two phenotypic assays designed to analyze Ig gene conversion and DSB-induced gene targeting. Ig gene conversion diversifies the Ig variable (V) gene through HR during in vitro passage. This reaction is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase-mediated uracil formation at the functional rearranged V-region (22Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 23Harris R.S. Sale J.E. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Curr.

Science. 2002; 295: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Uracil is converted to an abasic site, probably leading to a single-strand gap (25Nakahara M. Sonoda E. Nojima K. Sale J.E. Takenaka K. Kikuchi K. Taniguchi Y. Nakamura K. Sumitomo Y. Bree R.T. Lowndes N.F. Takeda S. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000356Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This lesion in the functional rearranged VJλ stimulates the nonreciprocal sequence transfer of a single nucleotide to several hundred nucleotides, from an array of “pseudo-Vλ” regions (donor), located upstream from the functional rearranged VJλ, to the rearranged V region (recipient) (26Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Kawamoto T. Araki K. Sonoda E. Yamashita Y.M. Harada K. Kikuchi K.

Arakawa H. Buerstedde J.M. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. Sonoda E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6113-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Because donor and recipient segments have an ∼10% sequence divergence, sequential Ig gene conversion events are able to substantially diversify Ig V segments. Ig gene conversion is raised only by SDSA without the formation of a Holliday junction. Hence, phenotypic analysis of Ig gene conversion provides a unique opportunity to selectively examine the role of Blm in activation-induced cytidine deaminase-induced SDSA. Moreover, nucleotide sequence analysis of Ig gene conversion products can evaluate the accuracy of HR. Like Ig gene conversion, DSB-induced gene targeting is mediated only by SDSA. The induction of DSBs by a rare-cutting endonuclease, I-SceI, at the endogenous locus, increases the frequency of gene targeting by 3 orders of magnitudes, and the frequency of gene targeting can be evaluated by measuring the reconstitution of a marker gene (29Rouet P. Smih F. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8096-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). We here show that the loss of Blm drastically reduces the rate of Ig gene conversion without compromising its accuracy or affecting the length of the gene conversion tracts, indicating that Blm plays a role in the promotion of SDSA. This is an unexpected result, because Blm is in fact believed to suppress general HR reactions, particularly recombination between diverged homologous sequences. To understand the function of Blm in SDSA, we analyzed the effect of heterologous sequences near a DSB site on HR-dependent DSB repair. The data demonstrate that Blm can promote SDSA when there is sequence divergence between the damaged recipient DNA and the homologous donor sequence. Thus, Blm has both positive and negative effects on HR, depending upon the type of DNA damage and the step of the HR reaction. Gene targeting substrates were amplified with primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10−5 m β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% chicken serum (Sigma) at 39.5 °C. Methods of DNA transfection for producing stable transfectants and genotoxic treatments were as described previously (30Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). 137Cs (0.02 gray/s; Gammacell 40, Nordion, Kanata, Canada) was used for γ-irradiation. BLM−/− cells were established from CL18, a subclone of DT40 cells that is negative for sIgM (26Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We confirmed that BLM−/− cells retained the same frameshift mutation as wild type CL18 cells by sequencing the Ig Vλ region. The rate of Ig gene conversion was assessed by measuring the gain of sIgM expression as described previously (27Kawamoto T. Araki K. Sonoda E. Yamashita Y.M. Harada K. Kikuchi K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Nozaki K. Hashimoto N. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, sIgM gain revertants were monitored by flow cytometric analysis of cells that had been expanded for 3 weeks after subcloning and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgM (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX). To enhance Ig gene conversion, tricostatin A (TSA) (Wako Osaka; concentration, 1.25 ng/ml) was added to a mixture of sIgM-negative subclones (see Fig. 2). In each analysis, the abundance of sIgM-positive cells was determined as the percentage of live cells whose fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated fluorescence intensity is at least eight times higher than the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated fluorescence peak of sIgM-negative cells. DNA was extracted from expanded subclones at 4 weeks after TSA treatment. PCR-amplified fragments of Vλ segments were cloned into a plasmid and subjected to base sequence analysis. Rearranged Vλ was amplified by PCR with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) (30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) with 5′-CAGGAGCTCGCGGGGCCGTCACTGATTGCCG-3′ and 5′-GCGCAAGCTTCCCCAGCCTGCCGCCAAGTCCAAG-3′ primers, as described previously (31Sale J.E. Calandrini D.M. Takata M. Takeda S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into the TOPO pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced with the M13 forward (−20) or reverse primer using an ABI PRISM 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence alignment, using GENETYX-MAC (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan), allowed the identification of changes from the parental sequences in each clone. Differentiating between nontemplated nucleotide substitutions and gene conversion was carried out as described previously (31Sale J.E. Calandrini D.M. Takata M. Takeda S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). 107 cells were suspended in 0.1 ml of Nucleofector Solution T (Amaxa Biosystems) and electroporated using Amaxa program B-23 (Amaxa Biosystems). 2 μg of targeting DNA fragment with expression vectors (Gd-BLM-GFP, EXO1, and human BLM) and nuclease expression vector were transfected. pBluescript II KS+ was used as a negative control. The targeting DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the Mneo-1 to Mneo-4 substrate plasmid using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) (30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), with the 5′-GGATCGGCCATTGAACAAGATGGATTGCAC-3′ and 5′-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAG-3′ primers. Twenty-four hours after electroporation, the number of live cells was counted using fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and the cells were transferred to 96-well cluster trays with or without 2.0 mg of G418 per ml. The cells were grown for 7–10 days, and the HR frequencies were calculated by the following equation: HR frequency (colonies/cells) = number of G418-resistant colonies/(plating efficiency of transfected cells in the absence of G418 × number of live cells determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter 24 h after electroporation). Chromosome aberrations were measured as described previously (32Fujimori A. Tachiiri S. Sonoda E. Thompson L.H. Dhar P.K. Hiraoka M. Takeda S. Zhang Y. Reth M. Takata M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5513-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Blm in SDSA, we examined the rate of Ig gene conversion. To this end, we measured the gain of surface IgM (sIgM) expression in subclones derived from wild type and BLM−/− cells that have a frameshift mutation in the IgVλ segment, as documented previously (25Nakahara M. Sonoda E. Nojima K. Sale J.E. Takenaka K. Kikuchi K. Taniguchi Y. Nakamura K. Sumitomo Y. Bree R.T. Lowndes N.F. Takeda S. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000356Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C.

Cell. 2005; 20: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because the frameshift mutation is removed by gene conversion from pseudo-V segments to Ig Vλ, the level of sIgM gain may reflect the frequency of gene conversion (Fig. 1A). We cultured multiple subclones derived from limiting dilution culture of wild type and BLM−/− strains. During 3 weeks of clonal expansion, only ∼0.6% of BLM−/− cells showed a gain in sIgM, whereas ∼4% of wild type cells showed a gain in sIgM+ (Fig. 2A). Because the sIgM staining in the BLM−/− cells was close to the background signal of flow cytometric analysis, we cultured the wild type and BLM−/− cell in the presence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, which increases the frequency of Ig gene conversion in DT40 cells 50–100-fold (33Seo H. Masuoka M. Murofushi H. Takeda S. Shibata T. Ohta K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), to detect possible rare gene conversion events. Over the course of 2 weeks of expansion in the presence of TSA, 10% of the wild type cells acquired sIgM expression, whereas only 0.92% of BLM−/− cells were converted to sIgM-positive (Fig. 2B). Similarly, fluctuation analysis of sIgM gain in subclones indicated that the median of sIgM gain was 8.6% for wild type cells and only 0.47% for BLM−/− cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that Blm might augment the rate of Ig gene conversion. Alternatively, Blm might increase the accuracy of gene conversion and thereby contribute to the restoration of functional Ig V genes. To evaluate the accuracy of Ig gene conversion, we determined the nucleotide sequences of Ig Vλ segments. We incubated cells for 4 weeks in the presence of TSA, amplified the Ig Vλ segments from the expanded cells by PCR, and then determined the nucleotide sequences of the amplified fragments. For the wild type cells, gene conversion tracts were detected in 37 of 44 Ig Vλ sequences (84%). By contrast, gene conversion events were detectable in only 7 of 47 Ig Vλ sequences in the BLM−/− cells (15%) (Fig. 2D). Aberrant gene conversion events were not observed in the BLM−/− cells, indicating that the accuracy of HR is not compromised by the loss of Blm. These results indicate that Blm may increase the rate of Ig gene conversion in DT40 cells. To explore the role of Blm in Ig gene conversion, we analyzed the length of the gene conversion tracts and the usage of pseudo-Vλ donors, focusing on the gene conversion events that caused the sIgM gain. We sorted sIgM-positive cells from 23 independent BLM−/− subclones that had been independently exposed to TSA for 4 weeks and determined the nucleotide sequences of 46 segments from each genotype. Wild type cells used a variety of pseudo-Vλ segments as a donor (Fig. 2D). However, BLM−/− cells used only limited species of the pseudo-V segments; of the 92 gene conversion events, 46 used the pseudo-V8 segment and 45 used the pseudo-V12 segment (Fig. 2D). The nucleotide sequences of pseudo-V8 and pseudo-V12 segments have a higher identity with the rearranged Vλ segment, compared with segments that were used only in wild type cells. Thus, Blm may promote gene conversion with diverged donor segments, thereby contributing to the extensive diversification of Ig V genes. To determine whether the marked reduction in the frequency of Ig gene conversion in BLM−/− cells is simply caused by general defects in HR, we tested whether Blm is required for efficient HR between identical sequences. For this purpose, we measured sister-mediated HR repair by counting the number of chromosomal breaks in cells following ionizing radiation (IR) in the G2 phase, when DSBs are preferentially repaired by HR using the intact sister chromatid rather than by nonhomologous end joining in DT40 cells (30Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Because after IR, cells in the G2 phase, but not in the S phase, can enter the M phase within 3 h, we can selectively evaluate HR between sister chromatids (sister HR) by analyzing chromosomal breaks in mitotic cells at 3 h after IR (34Sonoda E. Okada T. Zhao G.Y. Tateishi S. Araki K. Yamaizumi M. Yagi T. Verkaik N.S. van Gent D.C. Takata M. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3188-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). BLM−/− cells showed increased levels of spontaneously arising chromosomal breaks (Fig. 3, left panel), as previously reported (17Kohzaki M. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Yamazoe M. Kikuchi K. Vu Trung N. Szüts D. Sale J.E. Shinagawa H. Watanabe M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Imamura O. Fujita K. Itoh C. Takeda S. Furuichi Y. Matsumoto T.

Ishii Y. Enomoto T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We measured the number of chromosomal breaks at 3 h after 2 grays of γ-ray irradiation. We subtracted the number of spontaneous chromosomal breaks from this number to obtain the number of IR-induced breaks (Fig. 3, right panel). The number of IR-induced breaks increased only slightly (1.5-fold) in BLM−/− cells, compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3, right panel). This observation is in marked contrast with the dramatic increase (11-fold) in the number of IR-induced breaks in RAD54−/− cells (30Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Thus, Blm plays only a minor role, if any, in HR using the intact sister chromatid. Taking the critical role played by Blm in Ig gene conversion into account, this slight reduction of sister HR-dependent DSB repair in BLM−/− cells suggests that Blm is important for HR between diverged sequences but not for HR between identical sequences. We next tested whether Blm promotes HR between diverged homologous sequences. To address this issue, we employed a DSB-induced gene targeting assay (Fig. 1B). We examined the efficiency of DSB-induced gene targeting using a variety of targeting DNA fragments (donor; Mneo-1 to Mneo-4) (Fig. 4A) (35Kikuchi K. Taniguchi Y. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Adachi N. Matsuzaki Y. Koyama H. van Gent D.C. Jasin M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6948-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We engineered BLM−/− cells carrying the S2neo construct at the Ovalbumin locus. Transient transfection of the I-SceI restriction enzyme cuts a cleavage site at S2neo. This cleavage stimulates the targeted integration of co-transfected donor DNA fragments into S2neo and removes the termination codon present in S2neo (underlined sequence in Fig. 4A), thereby leading to the reconstitution of the functional neomycin resistance gene. Of the series of gene targeting donor fragments, Mneo-1 has the highest homology to the recipient S2neo, whereas Mneo-4 has the largest deletion near the S2neo I-SceI site (Mneo-1 to Mneo-4 in Fig. 4A). Therefore, there are 11, 23, and 56 heterologous sequences near the I-SceI site of S2neo, when it recombines with Mneo-2, Mneo-3, and Mneo-4, respectively. The knock-in of these donor fragments into S2neo results in the deletion of amino acid sequences from the coding sequences of the neomycin resistance gene. We verified that the deletion does not affect the activity of the gene (data not shown), as previously reported (35Kikuchi K. Taniguchi Y. Hatanaka A. Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Adachi N. Matsuzaki Y. Koyama H. van Gent D.C. Jasin M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6948-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We transfected individual targeting donor fragments together with the I-SceI expression vector into the BLM−/− clone carrying S2neo. We then measured the frequency of gene targeting by counting the number of neomycin-resistant colonies. Gene targeting events in the BLM−/− cells for the Mneo-1 fragment were about 10-fold less frequent than the control cells complemented by the transient expression of a BLM transgene (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, gene targeting events in BLM−/− cells for the most divergent donor construct, Mneo-4, were about 100-fold less frequent than the control cells. We calculated the ratio of the gene targeting frequency in BLM−/− cells relative to that in the control cells (Fig. 4C) and found that the BLM−/− cells showed a more pronounced reduction of gene targeting efficiency in the presence of larger numbers of heterologous sequences in the recipient S2neo, when compared with the complemented control cells. These results, together with the data for Ig gene conversion (Fig. 2), strongly suggest that Blm facilitates HR between diverged homologous sequences. To address how Blm facilitates HR between diverged homologous sequences, we examined the role of Blm in homologous pairing step in HR. To this end, we examined the efficiency of DSB-induced gene targeting using a series of wild type neo fragments carrying variable lengths of homologous arm (Fig. 5A, H-1 to H-4). There are 18-bp heterologous sequences near the I-SceI site of S2neo, when it recombines with all of these targeting fragments. As shown in Fig. 5B, in the control cells complemented by BLM transgene, frequency of the gene targeting increased as the length of homologous arm increases (Fig. 5B). However, gene targeting events in BLM−/− cells were not significantly increased even when a longer homologous arm exists, indicating that limited the length of the homologous arm is used in BLM−/− cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that Blm facilitates homologous pairing step in HR, when there are heterologous sequences around the DSB site. Recently, a biochemical study revealed that the processing of DNA lesions is promoted by the cooperative reaction of Blm and Exo1, a 5′ to 3′ double-strand DNA exonuclease (reviewed in Ref. 36Tran P.T. Erdeniz N. Symington L.S. Liskay R.M. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating later HR events (37Nimonkar A.V. Ozsoy A.Z. Genschel J.

In a mutational study, effects of the insert on ion channel function and secondary structure of the TM3–4 loop were investigated. Whole cell current responses and protein surface expression data indicated that the major effect of mutations within the insert was on channel gating.

Secondary structure analysis suggested that the insert stabilized the overall fold of the large cytoplasmic domain of α3L subunits. The absence of the insert resulted in a channel that was still functional, but the TM3–4 cytoplasmic domain appeared not stably folded.

Two human splice variants, α3K and α3L, have been identified, distinguished by an insert of 15 amino acids following a segment of eight positively charged residues within the long cytoplasmic TM3–4 loop of the receptor subunit (8Nikolic Z.

Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Three hydroxyl groups are located within the alternatively spliced insert, each within a minimum phosphorylation consensus sequence (8Nikolic Z. Laube B. Weber R.G. Lichter P. Kioschis P. Poustka A.

Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Replacement of all three hydroxylated residues by their hydrocarbon analogs resulted in modified desensitization kinetics but had no effect on single channel conductances or macroscopic parameters such as EC50 and maximum current amplitude (9Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Rennert J. Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that hydroxyl functions are important, but not exclusive, determinants of receptor desensitization.Here, we studied the contribution of the alternatively spliced region to domain folding and to the individual steps of α3 GlyR function. Replacement of hydroxylated residues and modification of insert length by deletion or duplication of six residues resulted in dramatic changes in current responses that could be accounted for by altered channel gating behavior. Changes in receptor gating correlated with the distribution of charges on the protein surface of this variable loop. Isolated TM3–4 loops of α3L and α3K formed defined oligomers, each of different stoichiometry. CD spectroscopy indicated a well defined secondary structure for the long splice variant α3L only, whereas the fold of α3K was not stable. Thus, the spliced insert was identified as a novel regulatory motif of the inhibitory α3 glycine receptor, carrying a dual function: (i) stabilization of the secondary structure of the large cytoplasmic TM3–4 loop of α3L and (ii) regulation of ion channel gating.DISCUSSIONLigand-gated ion channels of the Cys loop receptor type share both pentameric architecture of the protein complex as well as transmembrane topology of subunits (2Becker K.

Amino acid sequence homology between mammalian GlyR α subunit orthologs ranges from 80 to 98%, whereas intersubunit homology between α and β sequences is on the order of 60% (2Becker K. Becker C.M. Breitinger H.G. Channelopathies.in: Lehmann-Horn F. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 199-224Crossref Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic TM3–4 loop is the region of highest sequence diversity between GlyR α subunits, as well as other members of the Cys loop receptor superfamily (25Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This domain carries motifs for phosphorylation (26Harvey R.J. Depner U.B. Wässle H. Ahmadi S. Heindl C. Reinold H.

Two natural splice variants of the human GlyR α3 subunit differ in desensitization kinetics (8Nikolic Z. Laube B. Weber R.G. Lichter P. Kioschis P. Poustka A. Mülhardt C. Becker C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19708-19714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); hydroxyl functions within this insert are relevant, but not exclusive, determinants of receptor kinetics (9Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Rennert J. Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, the impact of the 15-residue insert on channel function was probed by removal of its hydroxyl groups and varying its length. Comparison of ion channel properties using patch-clamp recording techniques and secondary structure analysis of isolated TM3–4 loops identified a novel regulatory motif within this cytoplasmic domain of GlyR α3 subunits.GlyR α3L Mutations Affect Ion Channel FunctionAlthough cell surface protein expression levels were largely unaffected, whole cell current responses of recombinant α3 GlyRs revealed a striking sensitivity of ion channel function to alterations within the 15-residue insert in α3L. Maximum current amplitudes (Imax) and EC50 were found to differ 11- and 40-fold, respectively, despite almost identical protein expression. Based on current responses, GlyR α3 mutants could be classified into three groups: (i) one high sensitivity mutant (α3LΔ6), characterized by large Imax and small EC50; (ii) constructs of intermediate Imax and EC50 values (α3L, α3K, α3L+Δ6, α3LT358A/Y367F/S370A, α3LY367F,α3LS370A, and α3LY367F/S370A); and (iii) low sensitivity mutants (α3LT358A, α3LT358A/Y367F, and α3LT358A/S370A), displaying low Imax and large EC50 values. Subunit expression was not different between the various α3 constructs, as determined by dot-blot assay as well as surface protein expression by biotinylation. Thus, because receptor density was excluded as a cause for the variations in Imax, differences in whole cell current responses could be attributed to alterations in (i) ligand affinity, (ii) single channel conductance, or (iii) ion channel gating. The value of EC50 is composed of two equilibria, namely ligand binding and gating (13Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas Imax depends on the number of receptors on the cell surface, as well as channel conductance and gating. We tested, therefore, to which extent other steps of channel function were affected by α3L mutations. Radioligand displacement of [3H]strychnine by its cold analog showed no difference in antagonist affinity for the mutants. Because binding domains for strychnine and glycine on the receptor are thought to overlap (3Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), one would have expected at least some effect on strychnine binding, if ligand binding were responsible for the observed 40-fold shift in EC50.The concomitant changes of EC50 and Imax were consistent with modification of ion channel gating (14Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) as the main effect of the mutations. Indeed, when dose-response data were analyzed using a two-ligand model of receptor activation (29del Castillo J. Katz B. Proc. Roy. Soc. B. 1957; 146: 339-356PubMed Google Scholar), the Imax and KD values were found to differ 3.4- and 8-fold, respectively. In contrast, the value for the gating constant Φ varied ∼770-fold (Table 1), consistent with variations channel gating.The hyperekplexia mutants GlyR α1(K276E) (30Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and GlyR α1(Q266H) (31Moorhouse A.J. Jacques P. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), located within the TM2–3 loop and TM2, respectively, impaired channel gating, leading to a reduced duration of channel openings. Alterations in channel gating were also demonstrated for recombinant glycine receptors from zebrafish, where a soluble Ca2+-binding factor was proposed to mediate these effects (28Fucile S. De Saint Jan D. de Carvalho L.P. Bregestovski P. Neuron. 2000; 28: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The marked difference in open channel dwell times between cell-attached and outside-out recordings would be consistent with an intracellular mode of ion channel regulation. In the glycine receptor α1 subunit, mutations within the TM1–2 loop resulted in altered receptor desensitization (9Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Rennert J. Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Becker K. Becker C.M. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ion permeation (33Lee D.J. Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 351: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed with γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor mutants (34Wotring V.E. Miller T.S. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), also belonging to the Cys loop family of amino acid gated anion channels.Ligand binding appeared least sensitive to alterations within the large intracellular loop, yet desensitization and channel gating were both affected by changes within the TM3–4 loop. Removal of all OH groups of the spliced insert resulted in altered receptor desensitization (9Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Rennert J. Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas the results described here identified changes in channel gating caused by structure modifications within the insert.Mutations in the GlyR α3L Splice Insert Affect Protein Surface PolarityHow can the gating differences observed for GlyR α3 mutants be attributed to changes in protein structure? An alignment of the amino acid sequences around the alternatively spliced region allowed a subdivision of this region into four blocks, each five to six residues long. These blocks were characterized by distinct distributions of charged and hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 5). Common to all constructs is an eight-residue block containing six positive charges immediately preceding the splice site, which is also found in the homologous position of the GlyR α1 subunit (21Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is followed by two six-amino acid segments and one stretch of five residues. The distribution of hydrophobic residues over the entire region is similar for all constructs, but the net charge of each segment is different between mutants. The high efficacy mutation, α3LΔ6, is characterized by a (+)-(+)-(−)-(+) sequence of charged blocks, whereas intermediate and low efficacy mutants display the sequence (+)-(−)-(+)-(−). This sequence of net charges is also retained in the short splice variant, α3K (Fig. 5). Furthermore, Thr358 is absent in the low efficacy mutants with the exception of the triple mutant α3LT258A/Y367F/S370A. Taken together, an extended stretch of positive charges after the alternative splice site and the presence of a hydroxyl group were associated with efficient channel gating, whereas insertion of a short segment carrying a net negative charge appeared to dramatically reduce the efficacy of channel opening. The absence of the hydroxyl function at or near position GlyR α3(358) further impaired gating.Spliced Insert Determines Stability of TM 3–4 Loop Structure and Controls Channel FunctionCD spectroscopy of native and synthesized TM3–4 loops of α3L and α3K indicated a defined and stable fold only for α3L, whereas α3K appeared less ordered. A sequence comparison shows that the insert is located in a region of pronounced diversity among glycine receptor subunits (Fig. 1A). However, secondary structure predictions (35Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) using various algorithms suggested only minor differences between the TM 3–4 loops of α3L and α3K. Generally, a lower amount of α-helix was predicted for the latter, in qualitative agreement with CD spectroscopy (Fig. 4D). Also, no major differences in secondary structure were predicted for the TM 3–4 loops of the mutant constructs. Thus, the pronounced changes in ion channel function and the differences in secondary structure analysis from CD spectroscopy exceeded bioinformatic predictions. This suggested that the spliced insert stabilizes secondary structures of the TM 3–4 loop, whereas removal of the insert, as in α3K, renders the domain more flexible. In nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, an unfolded (or unstably folded) structure appears compatible with receptor function (36Kukhtina V. Kottwitz D. Strauss H. Heise B. Chebotareva N. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and has been observed for the cytoplasmic loop of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (37Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sensitivity of channel gating to mutations within the variable insert indicates that this site is an effective regulatory motif for channel function.The relevance of the intracellular TM3–4 loop of Cys loop receptors to ion channel properties has only recently become a topic of recognition. An arginine residue in 5-HT3A serotonin receptors had been shown to affect receptor desensitization (38Hu X.Q. Sun H. Peoples R.W. Hong R. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21781-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and charged residues within the TM3–4 loop have been implicated in modulation of ion channel conductance (39Deeb T.Z.

Physiol. 2008; 131: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and ion selectivity (42Livesey M.R. Cooper M.A. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kozuska J. Hales T.G. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19301-19313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In fact, the previous study of the spliced insert on α3 glycine receptor currents had shown that hydroxyl groups were contributing but not exclusive determinants of receptor desensitization (9Breitinger H.G. Villmann C. Rennert J. Ballhausen D. Becker C.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with observations that charged (glutamate) residues, introduced into the TM3–4 loop of α1 glycine receptors, affected single channel conductances, but the major contribution to conductance still was mediated through the channel-lining TM2 domain (43Carland J.E. Cooper M.A. Sugiharto S. Jeong H.J. Lewis T.M. Barry P.H. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Moorhouse A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2023-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overall, it appears that both charges and structural alterations within the cytoplasmic TM3–4 domain are indeed contributing but not exclusive determinants of ion channel function.Secondary structure analysis and structure prediction using bioinformatics tools consistently indicated that the spliced insert in α3 GlyRs determines the folding of large parts of the intracellular TM3–4 domain. Alterations of critical positions within the insert as well as insert size confirmed a correlation between the structure of the insert and the function of the corresponding ion channel.Thus, the role of the spliced insert in human α3 GlyRs appeared 2-fold: (i) the insert also stabilizes the fold of the TM3–4 domain, and (ii) the insert is a determinant of ion channel desensitization (8Nikolic Z.

Further studies are needed to identify the molecular partners and mechanisms of ion channel regulation. Yet, GlyR function is remote-controlled by intracellular protein domains that, although physically distant from the receptor ion pore, appear to contribute to ion permeation and channel gating.

https://openalex.org/W2140291146,"The function of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is thought to depend on its acyl chain composition. The present study aims at a better understanding of the way the CL species profile is established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using depletion of the acyl-CoA-binding protein Acb1p as a tool to modulate the cellular acyl chain content. Despite the presence of an intact CL remodeling system, acyl chains shorter than 16 carbon atoms (C16) were found to accumulate in CL in cells lacking Acb1p. Further experiments revealed that Taz1p, a key CL remodeling enzyme, was not responsible for the shortening of CL in the absence of Acb1p. This left de novo CL synthesis as the only possible source of acyl chains shorter than C16 in CL. Experiments in which the substrate specificity of the yeast cardiolipin synthase Crd1p and the acyl chain composition of individual short CL species were investigated, indicated that both CL precursors (i.e. phosphatidylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol) contribute to comparable extents to the shorter acyl chains in CL in acb1 mutants. Based on the findings, we conclude that the fatty acid composition of mature CL in yeast is governed by the substrate specificity of the CL-specific lipase Cld1p and the fatty acid composition of the Taz1p substrates. The function of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is thought to depend on its acyl chain composition. The present study aims at a better understanding of the way the CL species profile is established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using depletion of the acyl-CoA-binding protein Acb1p as a tool to modulate the cellular acyl chain content. Despite the presence of an intact CL remodeling system, acyl chains shorter than 16 carbon atoms (C16) were found to accumulate in CL in cells lacking Acb1p. Further experiments revealed that Taz1p, a key CL remodeling enzyme, was not responsible for the shortening of CL in the absence of Acb1p. This left de novo CL synthesis as the only possible source of acyl chains shorter than C16 in CL. Experiments in which the substrate specificity of the yeast cardiolipin synthase Crd1p and the acyl chain composition of individual short CL species were investigated, indicated that both CL precursors (i.e. phosphatidylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol) contribute to comparable extents to the shorter acyl chains in CL in acb1 mutants. Based on the findings, we conclude that the fatty acid composition of mature CL in yeast is governed by the substrate specificity of the CL-specific lipase Cld1p and the fatty acid composition of the Taz1p substrates.

In the presence of divalent cations and dependent on the acyl chain composition, CL has a propensity for membrane negative curvature, a property that may be important in, e.g. membrane fusion and fission (9Vasilenko I.

Dencher N.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In recent years, CL has also been implicated in apoptosis (12Gonzalvez F. Gottlieb E.

CL is synthesized in the inner mitochondrial membrane by condensation of PG and CDP-DAG, catalyzed by the cardiolipin synthase Crd1p (see Fig. 1; reviewed in Ref. 4Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Compared with the other phospholipid classes, CL is enriched in unsaturated acyl chains, and the molecular species of CL possess a high degree of molecular symmetry (14Schlame M. Ren M. Xu Y. Greenberg M.L. Haller I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2005; 138: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The CL-specific acyl chain pattern originates from substrate preferences during biosynthesis and subsequent remodeling by acyl chain exchange (15Houtkooper R.H. Akbari H. van Lenthe H. Kulik W. Wanders R.J. Frentzen M. Vaz F.M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The finding of an aberrant CL species profile in patients suffering from Barth syndrome, which results from mutations in the tafazzin gene (16Vreken P. Valianpour F. Nijtmans L.G. Grivell L.A. Plecko B. Wanders R.J. Barth P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), revealed the importance of CL remodeling, and set the stage for the identification of tafazzin as the acyltransferase involved (17Hauff K.D. Hatch G.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Schlame M. Ren M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5450-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homologue of tafazzin was shown to be a CoA-independent phospholipid transacylase with substrate preference for CL and PC (19Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39217-39224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis and remodeling of CL have been extensively studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After synthesis by Crd1p, CL is subject to deacylation and reacylation, which involves the yeast homologue of tafazzin encoded by the TAZ1 gene. The yeast taz1 mutant has defects similar to those found in Barth syndrome, including reduced CL content, an aberrant CL species profile, and an accumulation of monolyso-CL (20Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The bioenergetic coupling of isolated mitochondria from a taz1 mutant is compromised (21Ma L. Vaz F.M. Gu Z. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44394-44399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which may be accounted for by the impaired assembly of the III2IV2 supercomplex (22Brandner K. Mick D.U. Frazier A.E. Taylor R.D. Meisinger C. Rehling P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5202-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, the CL-specific phospholipase Cld1p was identified, which functions upstream of Taz1p (23Beranek A. Rechberger G. Knauer H. Wolinski H. Kohlwein S.D. Leber R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11572-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the acyl chain composition of CL is important for its function, we investigated how the molecular species profile of CL is attained by using depletion of the 10-kDa cytosolic acyl-CoA-binding protein Acb1p as a tool to modify the cellular acyl chain content. Deletion of the ACB1 gene increases the cellular levels of C14 and C16 fatty acids at the expense of C18, without having adverse effects on cell growth or on the rate of glycerophospholipid synthesis (24Choi J.Y.

The changes in fatty acid composition are reflected to varying extents in the molecular species profile of phospholipids in Acb1p-depleted cells as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (27Faergeman N.J.

Neergaard T.B. Knudsen J. Faergeman N.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We first determined by mass spectrometry that in the absence of Acb1p acyl chains shorter than C16 accumulate in CL as in the other phospholipid classes despite the Cld1p-Taz1p remodeling system. Using appropriate mutants and analysis by mass spectrometry, we investigated two possible origins of the shorter acyl chains in CL: (i) remodeling by Taz1p and (ii) de novo synthesis of CL from PG and CDP-DAG. The yeast strains listed in Table 1 were maintained on YPD agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose). Strains harboring the pYPGK18 or the p416 plasmids (Table 1) were obtained according to the “rapid transformation protocol” (29Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), and maintained on agar plates containing synthetic glucose medium (SD) lacking leucine or uracil, respectively. Synthetic medium contained per liter: 6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 20 mg of adenine, 20 mg of arginine, 20 mg of histidine, 60 mg of leucine, 230 mg of lysine, 20 mg of methionine, 300 mg of threonine, 20 mg of tryptophan, 40 mg of uracil, and either 30 g of glucose (SD) or 22 ml of 90% (v/v) lactic acid and 1 g of glucose (synthetic lactate medium (SL), adjusted to pH 5.5 using KOH). Strains were cultured aerobically in SL medium at 30 °C to ensure optimal mitochondrial development. Growth was monitored by measuring the OD at 600 nm, using a Unicam Helios Epsilon spectrophotometer. Cells were harvested at late-log phase (A600 between 0.8 and 1.0) by centrifugation (3 min, 3000 × g), washed with water, and freeze-dried.TABLE 1Yeast strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain/plasmidGenotype/characteristicsSource/Ref.BY4742 (wild type)MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0EuroscarfBY4741 acb1MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 acb1 ::kanMX4EuroscarfBY4742 crd1MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 crd1 ::kanMX4EuroscarfBY4741 taz1MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 taz1 ::kanMX4EuroscarfBY4742 crd1acb1MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 crd1 ::kanMX4 acb1 ::HIS5 (S. pombe)This studyBY4741 taz1acb1MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 taz1 ::kanMX4 acb1 ::HIS5 (S. pombe)This studyp416CYCLow copy (CEN/ARS) shuttle vector containing the CYC1 promoter and URA3N.

From each dilution, 6 μl was spotted onto agar plates, containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and either 2% (w/v) glucose (YPD) or 3% (v/v) glycerol (YPG). The plates were incubated at 30 or 37 °C for 2–6 days. The ACB1 gene was deleted via homologous recombination with a PCR construct containing the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ open reading frame flanked by coliphage loxP sites (kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Holthuis, Utrecht University) that were created using primers 5′-GACTAAAACTCTAAAATTAGTTAAACTAGTGTTTTCAGCAAAATGAGGAGGGCTTTTGTAGAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGCCAAAACTCCTTACATGGAGCTAGTATACCCCTTTTTTACAACACTCCCTTCGTGCTTG-3′, with the underlined sequences corresponding to nucleotides −42 to −1 upstream and to nucleotides 1 to 41 downstream (reverse complementary) of the ACB1 gene, respectively. Yeast cells were transformed with the PCR product of 734 bp according to the “high efficiency transformation protocol” (29Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on SD plates lacking histidine. Correct integration of the PCR fragment was verified by colony PCR. Total lipid extracts were prepared of freeze-dried cells as described (15Houtkooper R.H. Akbari H. van Lenthe H. Kulik W. Wanders R.J. Frentzen M. Vaz F.M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To 10 mg of cells (dry weight), 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added, and the suspension was sonicated for 20 min in a Branson B1200 bath sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) containing ice water. Subsequently, 1 ml of water was added, and, if appropriate, 0.4 nmol of tetramyristoyl-CL or 0.064 nmol of dimyristoyl-PG (both from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform were added as the internal standard. The mixture was shaken vigorously for 1 min, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The lower organic layer was collected after centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. Residual lipids in the upper layer were extracted with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the combined organic layers were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. This procedure was applied to different amounts of cells, with volumes adjusted proportionally. Total lipid extracts were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described (30Vaden D.L. Gohil V.M. Gu Z. Greenberg M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The phospholipid containing spots identified by running the appropriate standards were scraped off and their quantities determined as described (31Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2853) Google Scholar). Total lipid extracts obtained from 10 mg of cells (dry weight) corresponding to 150 to 200 nmol of phospholipid phosphorous were dissolved in 150 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (50:45:5, v/v/v) containing 0.01% (w/v) NH4OH, and 5 μl of this solution was analyzed by HPLC-MS as described (15Houtkooper R.H. Akbari H. van Lenthe H. Kulik W. Wanders R.J. Frentzen M. Vaz F.M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipids were separated on a silica HPLC column using a linear gradient between chloroform/methanol (97:3, v/v) and methanol/water (85:15, v/v). The HPLC eluent was introduced into a TSQ Quantum AM mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Mass spectra of CL, PI, and PG were recorded in the negative ion mode with the following settings: source collision-induced dissociation, 10 V; spray voltage, 3.0 kV; and capillary temperature, 300 °C. PC, PE, and PS were measured in the positive ion mode, using a parent ion scan for m/z 184.1, and neutral loss scans for m/z 141.1 and 185.1, respectively. Other settings were: source collision-induced dissociation, 10 V; spray voltage, 3.6 kV; pressure of collision gas (argon), 0.5 mTorr; collision energy, 40 V for the parent ion scan and 25 V for the neutral loss scans; and capillary temperature, 300 °C. Mass spectra of each lipid were acquired during the corresponding retention time in the HPLC elution profile. The acyl chain composition of short CL species was determined by daughter scan analysis recorded in the negative ion mode with a collision energy of 50 V, Q1 peak width of 0.3, and Q3 peak width of 0.7 (FWHM). To label newly synthesized PG with deuterium-labeled glycerol (1,1,2,3,3-d5-glycerol; Sigma) the crd1 and crd1acb1 strain were cultured on SL medium. When the A600 of the cultures had reached ∼0.8, d5-glycerol was added to the medium to a concentration of 1.2% (w/v). After 10, 30, 60, and 180 min cells were harvested, washed with water by centrifugation (3 min at 3000 × g), and the cell pellets were freeze-dried. Lipids were extracted from 20 mg of freeze-dried cells as described above. To determine the molecular species composition of d5-labeled PG, precursor scans of m/z 232 were recorded on a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada). Lipids were sprayed from chloroform/methanol/water (5:10:4, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Ionization was performed at 300 °C at an ion spray voltage of −4200 V. The declustering potential was set to −120 V and the collision energy to −55 V. Other parameters were optimized for a maximum signal-to-noise ratio. For analysis of unlabeled PG molecular species, precursor scans of m/z 227 (32Welti R. Wang X. Williams T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were recorded with identical settings as above. The identity of the molecular species was confirmed by recording product spectra, operating the second mass filter in linear ion-trap mode with dynamic fill time. In these experiments, a collision energy of 50 V with a spread of 15 V was used, which enabled the clear identification of the [M − H]− molecular ion, the corresponding lyso-lipid fragment ions, the subsequent loss of the head group from this fragment ion, the fatty acyl-derived carboxylate ions, and the glycerophosphate ion (data not shown). Aliquots of total lipid extracts corresponding to 1 μmol of lipid phosphorous obtained from about 50 mg of freeze-dried cells were each dissolved in 2 ml of CH3OH/H2SO4 (40:1, v/v), and transesterified by heating at 70 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, 2 ml of water was added and the fatty acid methylesters were extracted three times with 2 ml of hexane. The composition of the fatty acid methylester mixture was determined on a Chrompack CP-9001 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column CP-WAX58 CB, in a 20-min run using the following temperature profile. After 2 min at 100 °C, the column was heated to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C per min. Fatty acid methylesters were identified and signal intensities were calibrated using an equimolar mixture of the methylesters of C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C12:1, C14:0, C14:1, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and C18:1 (Nu-ChekPrep, Elysian, MN).

PG substrate specificity of Crd1p was tested in reaction mixtures containing increasing concentrations of the PG species indicated (diC16:0 PG and diC18:1 PG from Sigma; diC12:0 PG, diC14:0 PG, and C14:1/C17:0 PG from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), whereas the CDP-DAG substrate selectivity of the enzyme was determined by the degree of inhibition of the labeling of CL caused by increasing concentrations of different unlabeled CDP-DAG species (Sigma) in the standard reaction mixture. Reactions were stopped after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, and reaction products were extracted and analyzed as described before (15Houtkooper R.H. Akbari H. van Lenthe H. Kulik W. Wanders R.J.

Using mass spectrometry, we investigated how these changes translate to the molecular species compositions of the separate membrane phospholipid classes. The molecular species profiles of PC, PE, PI, and PS in wild type and acb1 mutant cells as determined by ESI-(MS/)MS can be found in supplemental Fig. S1. As yeast cells have a limited repertoire of fatty acids with saturated and monounsaturated C16 and C18 acyl chains as main components (25Schjerling C.K. Hummel R. Hansen J.K. Borsting C. Mikkelsen J.M. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the majority of the PC, PE, PI, and PS species in wild type cells belonged to the C32 and C34 clusters (cf. Ref. 35Schneiter R. Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S. Daum G. Paltauf F. Wieland F.T. Kohlwein S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Comparison of the acb1 strain to the wild type revealed that the relative abundance of the C32 clusters was increased at the expense of the C34 clusters, in agreement with the average length of the acyl chains of all phospholipid classes tested being shorter in the mutant (supplemental Fig. S1), as reported earlier (27Faergeman N.J.

Moreover, the levels of species with 30 or less carbon atoms in their acyl chains increased to extents depending on the phospholipid class, which is consistent with the rise in the abundance of fatty acids shorter than 16 carbon atoms (24Choi J.Y.

For example, in PS an increased content of the C30 cluster was observed compared with wild type, whereas in the species profile of PC significant amounts of C28 and even C26 species were also found in acb1 cells. The deletion of the ACB1 gene did not significantly influence the degree of saturation of PC and PE. In contrast, in acb1 cells PI contained more unsaturated acyl chains, as observed previously (27Faergeman N.J. Feddersen S. Christiansen J.K. Larsen M.K. Schneiter R. Ungermann C. Mutenda K.

J. 2007; 407: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas for PS the content of unsaturated species was decreased. The molecular species profiles of CL in wild type and acb1 cells are shown in Fig. 2. To interpret the mass spectra of CL it should be realized that this phospholipid is measured as a doubly charged anion, implying that the measured m/z values correspond to half the molecular mass. In wild type cells, the CL species profile is dominated by clusters in the range of C64 to C70, as found previously (20Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and consistent with the abundance of C16 and C18 acyl chains in yeast. In wild type cells, the most abundant clusters are dominated by the peak with the lowest m/z value, i.e. the one that corresponds to the tetra-unsaturated species. This peak is followed in decreasing order of intensity by the peaks representing tri- (m/z increased by 1) and diunsaturated species (m/z increased by 2). In the absence of Acb1p, the CL species profile was profoundly changed as illustrated by the increase in the summed relative abundance of the signal intensity of the clusters smaller than C64 from ∼10 to 40% (based on the highest peak in each cluster). The clusters smaller than C64 contain acyl chains shorter than C16, demonstrating a shortening of the acyl chains in CL. The increase in shorter CL species was at the expense of the C18-containing C68–C72 clusters, with the C70 and C72 species being virtually absent in acb1. Examination of the relative peak intensities within clusters indicated that the shorter CLs were on average more saturated than the longer species (Fig. 2, lower panel). Yeast lacking the ACB1 gene has been reported to undergo a so far uncharacterized adaptation (26Gaigg B. Neergaard T.B. Schneiter R. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Jensen N.A. Andersen J.R. Friis J. Sandhoff R. Schrøder H.D. Knudsen J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To check whether the lipid species profiles shown in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 were affected by this adaptation, acb1 and wild type cells were transformed with plasmid p416CYC-ACB1 (Table 1), carrying the wild type ACB1 gene, or with the empty plasmid p416CYC as control. The phospholipid species profiles of the acb1 cells were restored to wild type upon introducing the ACB1 gene, whereas the species profiles of the acb1 cells transformed with the empty vector and the wild type cells were not affected (data not shown). These results render it unlikely that the species profiles were affected by the adaptation, if any, of the acb1 mutant in the BY4742 background. Moreover, the lipid pro"
https://openalex.org/W1969466722,"The resistance of epithelial cells infected with Chlamydophila pneumoniae for apoptosis has been attributed to the induced expression and increased stability of anti-apoptotic proteins called inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). The significance of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in C. pneumoniae pulmonary infection and innate immune response was investigated in cIAP-1 knockout (KO) mice using a novel non-invasive intra-tracheal infection method. In contrast to wildtype, cIAP-1 knockout mice failed to clear the infection from their lungs. Wildtype mice responded to infection with a strong inflammatory response in the lung. In contrast, the recruitment of macrophages was reduced in cIAP-1 KO mice compared to wildtype mice. The concentration of Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was increased whereas that of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha) was reduced in the lungs of infected cIAP-1 KO mice compared to infected wildtype mice. Ex vivo experiments on mouse peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes revealed that cIAP-1 is required for innate immune responses of these cells. Our findings thus suggest a new immunoregulatory role of cIAP-1 in the course of bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2117948343,"Background Altered expression of DNA polymerase β (Pol β) has been documented in a large percentage of human tumors. However, tumor prevalence or predisposition resulting from Pol β over-expression has not yet been evaluated in a mouse model. Methodology/Principal Findings We have recently developed a novel transgenic mouse model that over-expresses Pol β. These mice present with an elevated incidence of spontaneous histologic lesions, including cataracts, hyperplasia of Brunner's gland and mucosal hyperplasia in the duodenum. In addition, osteogenic tumors in mice tails, such as osteoma and osteosarcoma were detected. This is the first report of elevated tumor incidence in a mouse model of Pol β over-expression. These findings prompted an evaluation of human gastrointestinal tumors with regard to Pol β expression. We observed elevated expression of Pol β in stomach adenomas and thyroid follicular carcinomas, but reduced Pol β expression in esophageal adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas. Conclusions/Significance These data support the hypothesis that balanced and proficient base excision repair protein expression and base excision repair capacity is required for genome stability and protection from hyperplasia and tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W1970553650,"DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired by homologous recombination involving the formation and resolution of Holliday junctions. In Escherichia coli, the RuvABC resolvasome and the RecG branch-migration enzyme have been proposed to act in alternative pathways for the resolution of Holliday junctions. Here, we have studied the requirements for RuvABC and RecG in DNA double-strand break repair after cleavage of the E. coli chromosome by the EcoKI restriction enzyme. We show an asymmetry in the ability of RuvABC and RecG to deal with joint molecules in vivo. We detect linear DNA products compatible with the cleavage-ligation of Holliday junctions by the RuvABC pathway but not by the RecG pathway. Nevertheless we show that the XerCD-mediated pathway of chromosome dimer resolution is required for survival regardless of whether the RuvABC or the RecG pathway is active, suggesting that crossing-over is a common outcome irrespective of the pathway utilised. This poses a problem. How can cells resolve joint molecules, such as Holliday junctions, to generate crossover products without cleavage-ligation? We suggest that the mechanism of bacterial DNA replication provides an answer to this question and that RecG can facilitate replication through Holliday junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2047869673,"The cellular prion protein PrP(C) is encoded by the Prnp gene. This protein is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and serves as a precursor to the misfolded PrP(Sc) isoform in prion diseases. The prototype prion disease is scrapie in sheep, and whereas Prnp exhibits common missense polymorphisms for V136A, R154H and Q171R in ovine populations, genetic variation in mouse Prnp is limited. Recently the CNS glycoprotein Shadoo (Sho) has been shown to resemble PrP(C) both in a central hydrophobic domain and in activity in a toxicity assay performed in cerebellar neurons. Sho protein levels are reduced in prion infections in rodents. Prompted by these properties of the Sho protein we investigated the extent of natural variation in SPRN.Paralleling the case for ovine versus human and murine PRNP, we failed to detect significant coding polymorphisms that alter the mature Sho protein in a sample of neurologically normal humans, or in diverse strains of mice. However, ovine SPRN exhibited 4 missense mutations and expansion/contraction in a series of 5 tandem Ala/Gly-containing repeats R1-R5 encoding Sho's hydrophobic domain. A Val71Ala polymorphism and polymorphic expansion of wt 67(Ala)(3)Gly70 to 67(Ala)(5)Gly72 reached frequencies of 20%, with other alleles including Delta67-70 and a 67(Ala)(6)Gly73 expansion. Sheep V71, A71, Delta67-70 and 67(Ala)(6)Gly73 SPRN alleles encoded proteins with similar stability and posttranslational processing in transfected neuroblastoma cells.Frequent coding polymorphisms are a hallmark of the sheep PRNP gene and our data indicate a similar situation applies to ovine SPRN. Whether a common selection pressure balances diversity at both loci remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2067706727,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex on chromosome 6p21 has been unambiguously associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The complex features of the HLA region, especially its high genic content, extreme polymorphism, and extensive linkage disequilibrium, has prevented to resolve the nature of HLA association in MS. We performed a family based association study on the isolated population of the Nuoro province (Sardinia) to clarify the role of HLA genes in MS. The main stage of our study involved an analysis of the ancestral haplotypes A2Cw7B58DR2DQ1 and A30Cw5B18DR3DQ2. On the basis of a multiplicative model, the effect of the first haplotype is protective with an odds ratio (OR) = 0.27 (95% confidence interval CI 0.13-0.57), while that of the second is deleterious, OR 1.78 (95% CI 1.26-2.50). We found both class I (A, Cw, B) and class II (DR, DQ) loci to have an effect on MS susceptibility, but we saw that they act independently from each other. We also performed an exploratory analysis on a set of 796 SNPs in the same HLA region. Our study supports the claim that Class I and Class II loci act independently on MS susceptibility and this has a biological explanation. Also, the analysis of SNPs suggests that there are other HLA genes involved in MS, but replication is needed. This opens up new perspective on the study of MS."

Ventricular tachycardia, a precursor to ventricular fibrillation and a major cause of sudden death in heart failure, has also been linked to up-regulation of NCX1. NCX1 up-regulation results in a greater potential for delayed after depolarizations, which are major initiators of ventricular tachycardia (9Pogwizd S.M. Schlotthauer K. Li L. Yuan W. Bers D.M. Circ.

In addition, Ca2+ loading, which is one of the major causes of myocardial damage following ischemia-reperfusion, is mediated via reverse mode NCX1. All three benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors, KB-R7943, SN-6, and SEA-0400, have been reported to confer some cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart failure.

Although KB-R7943, SN-6, and SEA-0400 have been utilized in a variety of animal and cell models, most studies have focused only on the acute effects on INCX1 and Ca2+ homeostasis. In this study, we focus our attention on what occurs during chronic NCX1 inhibition, both in the heart and in isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Prolonged blockade of L-type calcium channels, β-adrenergic receptors, or the Na+/H+ exchanger results in their up-regulation (27Morgan P.E. Aiello E.A. Chiappe de Cingolani G.E. Mattiazzi A.R.

In light of what occurs with chronic inhibition of several cardiac channels, receptors, and exchangers (29Aarons R.D. Nies A.S. Gal J. Hegstrand L.R. Molinoff P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 949-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether chronic inhibition of NCX1 activity had any effect on the expression of Ncx1 in cardiomyocytes. This is an important consideration given the potential of NCX1 inhibition as part of a future therapeutic approach. The results of our study show that chronic inhibition of NCX1 by KB-R7943 results in Ncx1 gene up-regulation via a p38-activated pathway. We demonstrate that the increase in expression is directly mediated by the interaction of NCX1 with p38. Adult feline cardiomyocytes were isolated via a hanging heart preparation using enzymatic digestion and cultured by the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as described previously (30Kent R.L. Mann D.L. Urabe Y. Hisano R. Hewett K.W. Loughnane M. Cooper 4th, G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1717-H1727PubMed Google Scholar). The cardiomyocytes were plated on culture trays that were coated with laminin at an initial plating density of 7.5 × 104 cells/ml. After overnight incubation, the cardiomyocytes were rinsed and maintained in serum-free media. Cardiomyocytes were infected on day 1 in culture by adding titered adenovirus to the culture medium at different multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). After an infection of 8 h, the media were changed, and a second adenovirus was added if the experiment called for more than one virus. When more than one adenoviral construct was used to infect cells, additional experiments were carried out to ensure there was no competition for infection between the constructs at the m.o.i. used. Adult cardiomyocytes infected with m.o.i. of 1 resulted in infection of and gene transfer to more than 85% of the plated cells as determined by analysis of GFP expression. Cells were treated with NCX1 inhibitors (10 μm KB-R7943 or 10 μm SN-6 from Tocris Bioscience) 24 h after adenovirus infection. For pathway inhibition studies, cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (2.5 μm), the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (10 μm), the PLC inhibitor U73122 (2 μm), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-89 (10 μm). All the above inhibitors are from Calbiochem. 30 min after addition of the inhibitor, cells were treated with either KB-R7943 or SN-6 for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were washed twice in sterile-filtered cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerol, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100) for Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation studies or in Reporter Assay Buffer for luciferase assay (Promega, Madison WI). Phosphatase and protease inhibitors were added to the buffers (1:100 dilutions of phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). The cells were then incubated on ice for 15 min, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Whole E9.5 embryos were harvested; the heart tubes were micro-dissected, and the embryos were genotyped by PCR as described previously (31Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Individual isolated hearts were placed into 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) and washed three times in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBS was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the hearts were equilibrated at 32 °C for 5 min. The hearts were then transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 10 μm KB-R7943 or vehicle (DMSO) alone at 32 °C for 20 min. After treatment, the heart tubes were homogenized in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with the appropriate antibodies. Antibodies to NCX1 were obtained from Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland. Antibodies to CaMKII, P-CaMKII, p38, P-p38, P-JNK, JNK, P-ERK, and ERK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. For immunoprecipitation of p38 or NCX1, 2 μg of antibody was added to 500 μg of precleared lysate, and complex formation was carried out at 4 °C overnight. The protein-antibody complexes were recovered using protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in immune precipitation buffer, eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. To determine luciferase activity in adult cardiomyocytes or heart tissue, 5 μl of cell or tissue lysate was added to 50 μl of luciferin mixture (Promega, Madison, WI). Light emission was measured using an Auto Lumat LB 953 luminometer. To measure GFP fluorescence, 50 μl of crude lysate was added to 100 μl of PBS, and the samples were read in a fluorometer at the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission of 510 nm. Luciferase readings were normalized by GFP expression. Total RNA was isolated from adult cardiomyocytes with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Duralon membrane to which it was then UV-cross-linked. The membrane was blocked and then hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR probes corresponding to a 2257–3185-bp segment of the feline Ncx1 cDNA sequence. Membranes were then washed to a stringency of 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The results were presented as means ± S.E. The data were evaluated for significance by performing ANOVA with p values < 0.05 considered to be significant. Isolated single ventricular cells with clear striations were superfused with HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (35 °C) and whole-cell patch clamped to a holding potential of −40 mV. The extracellular solution was immediately changed to a nominally calcium-free blocker solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm BaCl2, 2 mm CsCl, 0.01 mm verapamil, 0.05 mm ouabain, 4 mm MgCl2, and 5.5 mm dextrose. Patch pipettes contained 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 50 mm EGTA, 21.6 mm Ca2+, 40 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgATP, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Tris2 creatine phosphate, pH 7.4, with CsOH (free [Ca2+]pip = 47 nm (WinMAXC, C. Patton, Stanford University)). Reverse exchanger current was activated (τ ≈2 s) by changing the perfusate from 0 to 4 mm Ca2+ (4 to 0 mm Mg2+). Voltage pulses (175 ms, −80 to 60 mV in 20-mV steps) were applied at 0.5-s intervals to obtain a complete current-voltage relationship, before, during, and after each calcium application. The exchanger current at each potential was taken as the difference between the mean currents during the last 30 ms of the test and control pulses. We first examined whether prolonged KB-R7943 treatment had any effect on the regulation of Ncx1 gene expression in adult cardiomyocytes. We utilized an adenoviral construct of the full-length Ncx1 promoter that contains 1831 bp of the promoter and the entire first exon fused to the luciferase reporter gene. The 1831Ncx1 construct has been previously shown to be sufficient for cardiac restricted expression that is up-regulated in response to α-adrenergic stimulation in both adult and neonatal cardiomyocytes (32Cheng G.

Adult cardiomyocytes infected with the 1831Ncx1 adenovirus were treated with 10 μm KB-R7943 for 48 h. Inhibition of reverse mode NCX1 activity with KB-R7943 treatment resulted in a 3-fold up-regulation of the 1831Ncx1 promoter-driven luciferase expression when compared with control (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Fig. 1B demonstrates that there is also an increase in endogenous Ncx1 message levels after 48 h of KB-R7943 treatment of adult cardiomyocytes. To determine whether the increase in Ncx1 expression was because of the inhibition of NCX1 activity and not the result of a nonspecific or generalized stress response of the cardiomyocyte to KB-R7943, we examined the expression levels of atrial natriuretic factor, a protein that is often up-regulated in response to cardiac stress. Fig. 1C shows that although the atrial natriuretic factor promoter-luciferase reporter construct is highly responsive to stimulation with the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, there is no increase in luciferase expression in response to KB-R7943 treatment. Importantly, KB-R7943 treatment does not adversely affect resting adult cardiomyocytes. There is no discernable difference in cell morphology or other evidence of cell stress or cell death even after 72 h of KB-R7943 treatment (data not shown). To determine whether the KB-R7943 mediated up-regulation of Ncx1 promoter activity occurred in vivo as well as in vitro, we utilized an 1831Ncx1 promoter reporter mouse model. Our previous studies have shown that transgenic expression of the 1831Ncx1 promoter luciferase reporter construct follows the same cardiac restricted pattern of endogenous Ncx1 promoter expression and is up-regulated to the same extent as the endogenous Ncx1 transcript in response to pressure overload (34Xu L. Renaud L. Müller J.G. Baicu C.F. Bonnema D.D. Zhou H. Kappler C.S. Kubalak S.W. Zile M.R. Conway S.J. Menick D.R. J. Biol.

After 2 days, the mice were sacrificed and the hearts extracted for analysis. We observed an ∼2-fold increase in expression of 1831Ncx1 promoter-driven luciferase expression in mice injected with KB-R7943 when compared with mice injected with vehicle only (Fig. 2A). After 24 h of KB-R7943 treatment there is a slight but nonsignificant increase in NCX1 protein (data not shown). Importantly, Western blotting showed that endogenous NCX1 protein levels were significantly increased in mice after 48 h of KB-R7943 treatment when compared with nontreated controls (Fig. 2B). Because earlier studies in our laboratory have demonstrated a role for MAPKs in modulating exchanger expression, we examined whether they were activated by KB-R7943 treatment (36Xu L. Kappler C.S. Menick D.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Adult cardiomyocytes were treated with KB-R7943 at various times and then lysed, and the phosphorylation states of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK were analyzed by Western blot. There is no activation of ERK or JNK detected in response to KB-R7943 at any time point (Fig. 3A). However, p38 is activated as early as 5 min after treatment (Fig. 3B), and this activation persists for up to 72 h (Fig. 3A). Importantly, treatment of adult cardiomyocytes with a second NCX1 inhibitor, SN-6 (37Niu C.F. Watanabe Y. Ono K. Iwamoto T. Yamashita K. Satoh H. Urushida T. Hayashi H. Kimura J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 573: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), also results in activation of p38. The activation of p38 closely follows the kinetics of INCX inhibition by KB-R7943. In patch clamp experiments, 10 μm KB-R7943 rapidly and reversibly blocked over 90% of the calcium-activated exchanger current without altering the shape of the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 3C). In five independent experiments the mean current at 0 mV was 271 ± 20 pA at 1 min before application of KB-R7943, 51 ± 21 pA at 1 min after application, and 24 ± 7 pA at 3 min after application. Recovery after washout was slower and was incomplete because of time-dependent rundown, but the current returned to 247 ± 27 pA within 11 min after removal of KB-R7943. As would be expected, activation of p38 returns to control levels within 60 min after KB-R7943 washout from the cells (Fig. 3D). Importantly, up-regulation of 1831Ncx1 reporter gene expression in response to KB-R7943 is attenuated by co-expression of a dominant-negative p38 construct (Fig. 3E). These data support the conclusion that the up-regulation of Ncx1 by KB-R7943 treatment is mediated by activation of p38. KB-R7943 has been used extensively to investigate the molecular mechanisms of NCX1 activity and its role in heart disease. A potential caveat of these data is the sole reliance on KB-R7943 to implicate a NCX1-dependent mechanism. Unfortunately, KB-R7943 has been shown to partially inhibit L-type ICa, INa, the inward rectifying IK, and delayed rectifier IK at concentrations used for NCX1 inhibition (22Tanaka H. Nishimaru K. Aikawa T. Hirayama W. Tanaka Y. Shigenobu K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, KB-R7943-mediated activation of p38 and up-regulation of Ncx1 could be due to inhibition of any of these currents or by other unknown off-target effects. To determine whether activation of p38 and the resulting Ncx1 up-regulation in response to KB-R7943 treatment was specifically due to inhibition of the exchanger rather than an off-target effect of the drug, we examined the effects of KB-R7943 in Ncx1 knock-out mice. This allowed us to directly compare the activation of p38 in the presence or absence of exchanger expression. Ncx1 null mice have relatively normal heart morphogenesis but lack a heartbeat and only survive to 11.0 days postcoitum (31Koushik S.V. Wang J. Rogers R. Moskophidis D. Lambert N.A. Creazzo T.L. Conway S.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1209-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, in these experiments, heart tubes were isolated from the embryos of Ncx1−/− and wild type Ncx1+/+ littermates at 9.5 days postcoitum, prior to the appearance of any morphological abnormalities. The tubes were treated with either vehicle alone (DMSO) or KB-R7943 for 20 min. The tubes were then homogenized in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blot for p38 activation. As seen in Fig. 4A, heart tubes from wild type mice (Ncx1+/+) shows p38 activation in response to treatment with KB-R7943, whereas total p38 levels remained unchanged, just as was observed in adult cardiomyocytes. Alternatively, heart tubes from Ncx1−/− mice had no p38 activation in response to KB-R7943, even though the amount of total p38 was comparable with that of the Ncx1+/+ mice. This experiment directly demonstrates that KB-R7943 is acting via NCX1 to activate p38. We next began to examine the possible mechanisms behind KB-R7943-mediated p38 activation. Inhibition of reverse-mode exchanger activity could possibly result in the activation of signaling pathways in one of two ways: 1) inhibition of NCX1 could affect cytosolic or localized [Ca2+]i, which activates a signaling cascade; or 2) inhibition of NCX1 activity might induce a change in exchanger conformation that could mediate activation of signaling pathways through direct interaction of the exchanger with an associated cofactor. There are still uncertainties on how blocking NCX1 affects resting [Ca2+]i. One recent work demonstrated that resting [Ca2+]i was unaffected by treatment of adult canine cardiomyocytes with 1 μm SEA-0400 (38Birinyi P. Tóth A. Jóna I. Acsai K. Almássy J. Nagy N. Prorok J. Gherasim I. Papp Z. Hertelendi Z. Szentandrássy N. Bányász T. Fülöp F. Papp J.G. Varró A. Nánási P.P. Magyar J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 78: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, a second work using mouse and pig cardiomyocytes (21Ozdemir S. Bito V. Holemans P. Vinet L. Mercadier J.J. Varro A. Sipido K.R. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that 1 μm SEA-0400 treatment resulted in a slight increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i. In our feline cardiomyocytes, 10 μm KB-R7943 treatment had no apparent affect resting [Ca2+]i (data not shown). This did not eliminate the possibility of localized [Ca2+]i changes that might activate pathways mediating phosphorylation of p38. Therefore, we examined whether any of the well known signaling factors activated by changes in localized [Ca2+]i were activated by KB-R7943 treatment and whether they were required for p38 activation. The calcium-sensing receptor has been shown to be an important downstream target of Ca2+ in the heart (39Smajilovic S. Tfelt-Hansen J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes calcium-sensing receptor activates PLC, which in turn hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. Diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate then mediate the activation of PKC and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, respectively, resulting in increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and activation of ERK1/2, PKC, and CaMKII (40Tfelt-Hansen J. Hansen J.L. Smajilovic S. Terwilliger E.F. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1165-H1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of PKC with bisindolylmaleimide, inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93, inhibition of PLC with U-73122, or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with LY294002 did not prevent activation of p38 with KB-R7943 treatment (Fig. 4B). In addition, calcium-sensing receptor activation results in rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation. ERK1/2 is not activated between 1 and 15 min following KB-R7943 treatment (data not shown), and Fig. 3A reveals no ERK1/2 activation at later time points. Therefore, none of the classic pathways activated by changes in [Ca2+]i play a role in KB-R7943-stimulated p38 activation. All three benzyloxyphenyl NCX1 inhibitors, KB-R7943, SN-6, and SEA-0400, inhibit NCX1 activity in a [Na+]i-dependent manner (21Ozdemir S. Bito V. Holemans P. Vinet L. Mercadier J.J. Varro A. Sipido K.R. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1301-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The potency of each of these drugs is coupled to the rate of [Na+]i-dependent inactivation (I1), and these compounds may stabilize NCX1 molecules in the I1 confirmation or favor the rate of I1 formation (24Lee C. Dhalla N.S. Hryshko L.V. Can. J. Cardiol. 2005; 21: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar, 37Niu C.F. Watanabe Y. Ono K. Iwamoto T. Yamashita K. Satoh H. Urushida T. Hayashi H. Kimura J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 573: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the second possibility that NCX1 in the I1 conformation could initiate signaling through its direct interaction or cross-talk with transmembrane receptors or in association with a scaffold complex containing signaling factors. We began by testing whether p38 directly complexes with NCX1. In these experime"

As a promoter, Geminin stabilizes Cdt1 and facilitates its accumulation leading to the assembly of the pre-replication complex on DNA. As an inhibitor, Geminin prevents Cdt1 from loading the mini-chromosome maintenance complex onto pre-replication complexes in late S, G2, and M phases. Here we show that during meiosis Geminin functions as a stabilizer of Cdt1 promoting its accumulation for the early division cycles of the embryo. Depletion of Geminin in Xenopus immature oocytes leads to a decrease of Cdt1 protein levels during maturation and after activation of these oocytes. Injection of exogenous recombinant Geminin into the depleted oocytes rescues Cdt1 levels demonstrating that Geminin stabilizes Cdt1 during meiosis and after fertilization. Furthermore, Geminin-depleted oocytes did not replicate their DNA after meiosis I indicating that Geminin does not act as an inhibitor of initiation of DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II.

In eukaryotes, initiation of DNA replication involves the formation and activation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) 3The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseCHXcycloheximideAPC/Canaphase promoting complexCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownUTRuntranslated regionMCMmini-chromosome maintenance complexMPFmaturation-promoting factorH1histone 1CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementMImeiosis IMIImeiosis IIoligooligonucleotide. 3The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseCHXcycloheximideAPC/Canaphase promoting complexCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownUTRuntranslated regionMCMmini-chromosome maintenance complexMPFmaturation-promoting factorH1histone 1CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementMImeiosis IMIImeiosis IIoligooligonucleotide. at the origins of replication. Pre-RCs are formed by the sequential binding of the origin recognition complex components, Cdc6, Cdt1, and mini-chromosome maintenance complex (MCM 2–7) proteins, to DNA. After loading the MCM complex, the pre-RCs are activated by S phase kinases (Dbf4-dependent kinase and Cdks) to initiate DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Replication of DNA, limited to only once per cell cycle, is critical to maintain genomic stability. Redundant mechanisms exist to ensure that DNA replication is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

Geminin plays a major role in regulating the function of Cdt1, one of the pre-RC components (8Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H.

Numerous studies suggest that in higher eukaryotes the interaction between Geminin and Cdt1 is pivotal to restrict DNA replication to only once per cell cycle (6Saxena S. Dutta A. Mutat.

Furthermore, in Xenopus egg extracts, the Geminin/Cdt1 ratio seems to control the assembly of pre-RCs at replication origins and to determine whether the origins are licensed or not (23Lutzmann M. Maiorano D. Méchali M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The positive and negative roles of Geminin in origin licensing and DNA replication are made possible by their temporal separation during the cell cycle. Pre-RC formation occurs during late M and early G1 phase, whereas pre-RC inhibition occurs from late S to mid M phase.As a positive regulator of DNA replication, Geminin has been shown to stabilize Cdt1. In human osteosarcoma cells, silencing of GEMININ expression limits CDT1 accumulation during mitosis and therefore the formation of pre-RCs in the subsequent cell cycle. This stabilizing effect is the result of a direct interaction between CDT1 and GEMININ preventing CDT1 ubiquitination and degradation (13Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similar findings were also recently observed in normal human cells and various cancer cells (24Zhu W. Depamphilis M.L. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4870-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, in both human normal and tumor cells, the low level of CDT1, generated by the absence of GEMININ, did not always prevent cellular proliferation or re-replication of the genome (5Melixetian M. Helin K. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Zhu W. Depamphilis M.L. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4870-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, one might question the importance of the role of GEMININ in stabilizing CDT1 in human cells. Beyond its role as a stabilizer of Cdt1 levels, Geminin has also been shown to participate directly in the formation of pre-RCs in Xenopus egg extracts. A complex between Cdt1 and Geminin binds to chromatin and supports pre-RC assembly. However, the recruitment of additional Geminin molecules to this complex on the chromatin blocks further pre-RC formation. These results indicate that the stoichiometry of Cdt1 and Geminin in this complex regulates its activity as a promoter or inhibitor of pre-RC assembly and DNA replication (23Lutzmann M. Maiorano D. Méchali M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Xouri G. Squire A. Dimaki M. Geverts B. Verveer P.J. Taraviras S. Nishitani H. Houtsmuller A.B. Bastiaens P.I. Lygerou Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been shown to modulate the Geminin/Cdt1 balance on the chromatin. In Xenopus the binding of Cdt1 to the MCM9 protein seems to block the recruitment of an excess of Geminin to the chromatin and therefore favors pre-RC assembly (27Lutzmann M. Méchali M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 190-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inactivation of Geminin by either ubiquitination or degradation also has a positive effect on pre-RC assembly (8Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2741-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

On the other hand, the replication-dependent degradation of Cdt1 has the opposite effect and prevents refiring of replication origins during S and G2 phases of the mitotic cell cycle (18Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Maiorano D. Krasinska L. Lutzmann M. Mechali M. Curr.

The expression pattern of Geminin during oocyte maturation is unclear. The presence of Geminin in immature stage VI Xenopus oocytes is controversial, but the protein is fully expressed in mature oocytes arrested in metaphase of meiosis II (7McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 32Lemaître J.M. Bocquet S. Méchali M. Nature. 2002; 419: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To form haploid gametes, DNA replication has to be inhibited between meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII). In Xenopus oocytes, cyclin B-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) also known as maturation-promoting factor (MPF) plays a role in preventing DNA replication between the two meiotic divisions (33Ohsumi K.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Cdk1 activity between MI and MII leads to the formation of interphase nucleus and DNA replication. However, the role of Geminin in preventing DNA replication between meiotic divisions has not been tested so far. Finally, the possibility that Geminin stabilizes Cdt1 during meiosis and ensures its accumulation for the early embryonic divisions has not been formally examined.Here we show that the levels of Geminin and Cdt1 proteins increase significantly during meiosis in Xenopus oocytes and that the primary role of geminin is to promote the accumulation of Cdt1 and not to repress DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II. Depletion of Geminin in Xenopus immature oocytes does not lead to DNA replication after the first meiotic division but to a decrease in Cdt1 stability during the maturation and activation of these oocytes. Rescue of Cdt1 levels in these Geminin-depleted oocytes is achieved by injection of exogenous recombinant Geminin protein confirming the role of Geminin as a stabilizer of Cdt1 during meiosis and the early embryonic division cycles. These results provide further support for the idea that Geminin functions universally in stabilizing Cdt1. Although the stabilizing role of Geminin might not be its most important function in somatic cells, we show here that stabilizing Cdt1 is a dominant function for Geminin in Xenopus oocytes undergoing meiosis. This stabilizing role of Geminin is essential for the stockpiling of Cdt1 before fertilization that is required to sustain the rapid divisions of the early embryo.DISCUSSIONOur data show that the presence of Geminin during meiosis and after fertilization is required for the proper accumulation of the licensing factor Cdt1. It is well established that the rapid embryonic divisions following fertilization require the accumulation of numerous maternal factors during oogenesis. Such factors include proteins like Cdt1 that will support initiation of DNA replication after fertilization. Large amounts of these factors are accumulated in Xenopus oocytes as the first 12 embryonic cell divisions rely almost exclusively on such maternal inheritance. Xenopus oocytes maturing without Geminin accumulate only a small amount of Cdt1 that almost completely disappears after the first embryonic cell cycle. It is unlikely that such Cdt1 levels would be able to support the early development of Xenopus embryos. Indeed a previous study reported the difficulty of obtaining Geminin-deficient Xenopus embryos following the injection of Geminin antisense oligonucleotides before meiosis (38McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Geminin depletion in embryos was obtained by injection of antisense oligonucleotides at the two-cell stage after maternal accumulation of Geminin during meiosis. Under such conditions the levels of Geminin decreased significantly but remained detectable until the seventh division cycle of the embryo before disappearing completely when the embryo arrested after the midblastula transition. This slow disappearance of Geminin might explain why these embryos managed to develop until the midblastula transition.Although Geminin is known to be an inhibitor of Cdt1 function, our data show that Geminin is not involved in the suppression of DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II. Absence of Geminin neither alters the overall meiotic progression nor pushes the oocytes to enter S phase after completion of meiosis I. Therefore, we conclude that the major role of Geminin during meiosis is to stabilize Cdt1 and favor its accumulation for the early embryonic division cycles after fertilization. We believe that this stabilizing role of Geminin remains predominant during the early division cycles following fertilization until zygotic gene transcription occurs and gap phases appear in a more typical somatic cell cycle. Thereafter, the major function of Geminin becomes the prevention of re-replication of the genome during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The idea that the positive role of Geminin is most important during meiosis and the early embryonic divisions but not in somatic cells is supported by previous studies showing the following: 1) no re-replication occurs in Geminin-deficient Xenopus embryos before midblastula transition (38McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); and 2) Geminin depletion in some mammalian cells does not prevent proliferation or re-replication despite a decrease in Cdt1 stability (5Melixetian M. Helin K. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Zhu W. Depamphilis M.L. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4870-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Accumulation of a cellular protein is determined by the balance between its rate of synthesis and degradation. Our data indicate that extremely low levels of Cdt1 are present in stage VI oocytes that are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. These low levels of Cdt1 were not affected by the injection of an excess of exogenous Geminin into stage VI oocytes, indicating that at this stage the level of Cdt1 might not be the result of a lack of stabilization by Geminin but rather be limited by its rate of synthesis. However, as both proteins appear to be localized in different cellular compartments (the nucleus for Cdt1 and cytoplasm for Geminin) the lack of stabilization of Cdt1 by Geminin cannot be completely excluded (32Lemaître J.M. Bocquet S. Méchali M. Nature. 2002; 419: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Numerous mRNAs accumulated in Xenopus oocytes are translationally silent (43Radford H.E. Meijer H.A. de Moor C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We believe this could be the case for Cdt1 mRNA as its 3′UTR contains consensus sequences that are necessary to mediate translational repression. Two cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) and one hexanucleotide (AAUAAA) were identified in the Cdt1 3′UTR sequence as listed in the GenBankTM data base, suggesting that Cdt1 expression is likely translationally regulated during meiosis. Two CPEs and a single hexanucleotide sequence were also found within the 3′UTR of Geminin indicating that the low level of Geminin observed in immature oocytes might also result from a translational repression mechanism. De-repression of the Cdt1 and Geminin mRNAs occurred during maturation, but accumulation of Geminin protein preceded the accumulation of Cdt1 protein. This observation could in part be explained by the fact that the CPE and hexanucleotide sequences are organized differently in the Geminin and Cdt1 3′UTRs. The two CPEs in the Geminin 3′UTR are spaced further apart, but one is found in close proximity of the hexanucleotide sequence. A similar combination has previously been shown to weaken translational repression and facilitate translational activation and therefore could explain why Geminin synthesis precedes the one of Cdt1 during oocyte maturation (44Piqué M. López J.M. Foissac S. Guigó R. Méndez R. Cell. 2008; 132: 434-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).The absence of Geminin had little effect on Cdt1 accumulation during meiosis I but had a strong destabilizing effect during meiosis II. The decrease in Cdt1 observed is specific to the lack of Geminin expression as it can be reversed by the injection of excess recombinant Geminin in the maturing oocytes. Our results indicate that the presence or absence of Geminin is unlikely to affect Cdt1 synthesis rate during meiosis but rather affects Cdt1 degradation rate during meiosis II. No similar stabilization effect of Geminin was observed early during meiosis I. Two reasons could explain why low levels of Cdt1 still accumulated in the absence of Geminin during meiosis I. First, other factors or post-translational modifications could stabilize Cdt1 and prevent its degradation during meiosis I. The Mcm9 protein has been shown to interact with Cdt1 and form a rather stable complex (27Lutzmann M. Méchali M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 190-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the Mcm9 protein is present in mature oocytes, its expression in stage VI oocytes or during the maturation process is currently unknown. Upon examination of the Mcm9 3′UTR, we found no consensus sequence that would suggest that MCM9 expression is translationally regulated during meiosis. Therefore, it would not be surprising to find MCM9, as the other members of the MCM family, already expressed in immature oocytes arrested in prophase of meiosis I (37Whitmire E. Khan B. Coué M. Nature. 2002; 419: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, the low levels of Cdt1 observed during meiosis I might simply be the result of a rate of Cdt1 degradation that is lower than its rate of synthesis.In human cells GEMININ protects CDT1 from proteasome degradation by inhibiting its ubiquitination. It is likely that the same mechanism is involved in the protective effect of Geminin during meiosis. However, at this point we have no evidence that absence of Geminin during meiosis would lead to Cdt1 ubiquitination. In addition, the specific ubiquitin ligase involved in the degradation of Cdt1 in the absence of Geminin either during meiosis or mitosis is currently unknown.Recent studies have shown that several ubiquitin ligases can mediate Cdt1 degradation in Xenopus. Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligase is responsible for the degradation of Cdt1 associated with DNA replication and after DNA damage (22Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 45Hu J. McCall C.M. Ohta T. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 46Higa L.A.

Cell Div. 2007; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdk2 has also been shown to target Cdt1 destruction via the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase (48Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 49Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 50Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). None of these ubiquitin ligases are known to be active and to mediate degradation of specific factors during meiosis. In addition, Cdt1 degradation in oocytes is independent of Cdk activity and therefore unlikely mediated by SCFSkp2. The activity of two other ubiquitin ligases has been reported during the meiotic cell cycle in different species. In Xenopus, the SCFβ-TrCP ligase is active during meiosis and targets the destruction of the CPEB and Ringo proteins (51Gutierrez G.J. Vögtlin A. Castro A. Ferby I. Salvagiotto G. Ronai Z. Lorca T. Nebreda A.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 52Setoyama D. Yamashita M. Sagata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18001-18006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The involvement of SCFβ-TrCP in Cdt1 degradation during meiosis is unlikely as Xenopus Cdt1 does not contain the canonical DSGXXS motif that is present in many substrates of this ubiquitin ligase. The other well established ubiquitin ligase involved in the control of meiosis is the APC/C. The APC/C exists in two forms defined by the positive regulators Cdc20 or Cdh1 that are associated with it. In Xenopus oocytes, the APCCdc20 promotes the complete degradation of cyclin B and the partial Geminin degradation at the time of fertilization (7McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 41Hochegger H. Klotzbücher A. Kirk J. Howell M. le Guellec K. Fletcher K. Duncan T. Sohail M. Hunt T. Development. 2001; 128: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). We observed no degradation of Cdt1 at the time of activation or fertilization, suggesting that Cdt1 is not the target of APCCdc20 during this transition. However, the resilience of the Cdt1 protein and a subset of the Geminin population at the time of activation could indicate that the Cdt1-Geminin complex is not a target of APCCdc20, and only free Geminin and Cdt1 are readily degraded by this pathway. Furthermore, one could imagine that APCCdc20 is responsible for Cdt1 degradation during meiosis II in Geminin-depleted oocytes as its activity is turned on and off during meiosis II arrest (53Yamamoto T.M. Iwabuchi M. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Dev. Biol. 2005; 279: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mouse oocytes and Drosophila eggs have highlighted the role of APCCdh1 in regulating prophase I arrest and progression through meiosis and more generally the idea that both APC complexes are required for the proper execution of meiosis (54Marangos P. Verschuren E.W. Chen R. Jackson P.K. Carroll J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although APCCdh1 is expressed at a relatively low level in Xenopus oocytes, its role in the destruction of specific proteins during meiosis is controversial and largely unknown (55Papin C. Rouget C. Lorca T. Castro A. Mandart E. Dev. Biol. 2004; 272: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 56Zhou Y. Ching Y.P. Ng R.W. Jin D.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggested that the degradation of Cdt1 in the absence of Geminin could be mediated by APCCdh1. First, a recent study demonstrated that Cdt1 is an APCCdh1 substrate (57Sugimoto N. Kitabayashi I. Osano S. Tatsumi Y. Yugawa T. Narisawa-Saito M. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Fujita M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that the Xenopus Cdt1 protein contains not only generic APC destruction boxes (D-box, RXXL) but also a putative Cdh1 recognition motif known as KEN-box. Second, the slow degradation of Cdt1 observed after fertilization in the absence of Geminin occurs at the time when the KEN-box substrates of APCCdh1 are degraded in mouse oocytes exiting meiosis II and after extrusion of the second polar body (58Chang H.Y. Levasseur M. Jones K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6289-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It will therefore be interesting to determine whether APCCdh1 is involved in the degradation of Cdt1 that we observed in Xenopus oocytes undergoing meiosis in the absence of Geminin despite the fact that its activity is inhibited by a high level of MPF activity. In eukaryotes, initiation of DNA replication involves the formation and activation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) 3The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseCHXcycloheximideAPC/Canaphase promoting complexCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownUTRuntranslated regionMCMmini-chromosome maintenance complexMPFmaturation-promoting factorH1histone 1CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementMImeiosis IMIImeiosis IIoligooligonucleotide. 3The abbreviations used are: pre-RCpre-replication complexCdkcyclin-dependent kinaseCHXcycloheximideAPC/Canaphase promoting complexCPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownUTRuntranslated regionMCMmini-chromosome maintenance complexMPFmaturation-promoting factorH1histone 1CPEcytoplasmic polyadenylation elementMImeiosis IMIImeiosis IIoligooligonucleotide. at the origins of replication. Pre-RCs are formed by the sequential binding of the origin recognition complex components, Cdc6, Cdt1, and mini-chromosome maintenance complex (MCM 2–7) proteins, to DNA. After loading the MCM complex, the pre-RCs are activated by S phase kinases (Dbf4-dependent kinase and Cdks) to initiate DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Replication of DNA, limited to only once per cell cycle, is critical to maintain genomic stability. Redundant mechanisms exist to ensure that DNA replication is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus"

We analyzed 187 individual immune cell subsets (percentages) and the density of the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) on 59 individual immune phenotypes using a monoclonal anti-IL-7R antibody (clone R34.34) coupled to a single APC molecule in combination with an APC-bead array. A non-parametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was conducted in order to test for differences among the groups in each of the variables. To correct for the multiplicity problem, the FDR correction was applied on the p-values. We identified 19 variables for immune cell subsets (percentages) which allowed to segregate healthy individuals and individuals with CNS disorders. We did not observe differences in the relative percentage of IL-7R-positive immune cells in PBMCs. In contrast, we identified significant differences in IL-7 density, measured on a single cell level, in 2/59 variables: increased numbers of CD127 molecules on TCRalphabeta+CD4+CD25 (intermed) T-cells and on TCRalphabeta+CD4+CD25-CD107a+ T-cells (mean: 28376 Il-7R binding sites on cells from HD, 48515 in patients with RRMS, 38195 in patients with SPMS and 33692 IL-7 receptor binding sites on cells from patients with OND).These data show that immunophenotyping represents a powerful tool to differentiate healthy individuals from individuals suffering from neurological diseases and that the number of IL-7 receptor molecules on differentiated TCRalphabeta+CD4+CD25-CD107a+ T-cells, but not the percentage of IL-7R-positive cells, segregates healthy individuals from patients with neurological disorders."
