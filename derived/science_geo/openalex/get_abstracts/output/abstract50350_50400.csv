https://openalex.org/W2005374086,"Sustained exposure to glucocorticoids, the adrenocortical stress hormones, is toxic to neurons, and such toxicity appears to play a role in neuron loss during aging. Previous work has shown that glucocorticoids compromise the capacity of neurons to survive a variety of metabolic insults. This report extends those observations by showing that ischemic injury to neurons in rat brain is also potentiated by exposure to high physiological titers of glucocorticoids and is attenuated by adrenalectomy. The synergy between ischemic and glucocorticoid brain injury was seen even when glucocorticoid levels were manipulated after the ischemic insult. Pharmacological interventions that diminish the adrenocortical stress response may improve neurological outcome from stroke or cardiac arrest."

https://openalex.org/W2037312854,"The natural history of estrogen-responsive breast cancers often involves a phenotypic change to an estrogen-unresponsive, more aggressive tumor. The human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, which requires estradiol for tumor formation in vivo and shows growth stimulation in response to estradiol in vitro, is a model for hormone-responsive tumors. The v-rasH onc gene was transfected into MCF-7 cells. The cloned MCF-7ras transfectants, which expressed the v-rasH messenger RNA and v-rasH p21 protein (21,000 daltons), were characterized. In contrast to the parental cell line, MCF-7ras cells no longer responded to exogenous estrogen in culture and their growth was minimally inhibited by exogenous antiestrogens. When tested in the nude mouse, the MCF-7ras cells were fully tumorigenic in the absence of estrogen supplementation. Thus, cells acquiring an activated onc gene can bypass the hormonal regulatory signals that trigger the neoplastic growth of a human breast cancer cell line."

https://openalex.org/W1587951978,"Studies were conducted to explore the effects of differences in retinoid nutritional status and of sex on the tissue distribution and levels of cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) and of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) in the rat. Sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays were developed and employed to measure the levels of both CRBP and CRABP. Four groups of six male rats each were fed experimental diets that differed greatly in the amount and kind of retinoids provided, but were otherwise identical. These groups were comprised of rats that were normal controls, retinoid-deficient, retinoic acid-fed, and excess retinol-fed. A fifth group of six female rats was fed the control diet. Immunogens identical with rat testis CRBP and CRABP, as assessed by radioimmunoassay displacement curves, were found in every rat tissue examined (21 tissues in males, 18 in females). The highest levels of CRBP were found in the proximal portion of the epididymis, the liver, and kidney. The highest levels of CRABP were found in the seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and skin. A significant (p less than 0.01) inverse relationship was found between CRBP and CRABP levels in the different tissues of the male reproductive tract. In both males and females, CRBP levels were highest in the gonads and proximal portion of the reproductive tract and decreased distally, whereas the opposite was true for CRABP. Retinoid-deficient rats showed reduced tissue levels of CRBP; thus, tissue CRBP levels are influenced by diet and retinoid availability. No differences in tissue CRBP levels were found in the rats fed the control, the retinoic acid, or the excess retinol diets. Female control rats had higher CRBP levels than male controls in 4 of 15 tissues compared (liver, lung, thymus, and fat). In contrast, tissue CRABP levels showed no diet- or sex-dependent differences. Only in one tissue, the skin, were differences observed (lower CRABP in retinoid-deficient and in female rats). Thus, CRABP metabolism and levels appear to be minimally influenced by the amount or kind of retinoid ligand available or by sex."
https://openalex.org/W1978445599,"Cells from the cerebral proliferative zones of newborn ferrets were labeled with tritiated thymidine and a fluorescent dye and were transplanted as a single-cell suspension into the occipital region of newborn ferrets. The transplanted cells became thoroughly integrated into the host environment: many cells migrated through the intermediate zone and into the cortical plate, where they developed as pyramidal neurons. Other transplanted cells came to resemble glial cells. After 1 to 2 months most transplanted neurons had taken up residence in layer 2 + 3, the normal destination of neurons generated on postnatal days 1 and 2. Thus the sequence of morphological differentiation and the eventual laminar position of the isochronically transplanted neurons closely paralleled that of their normal host counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1996194207,"There is substantial evidence that human serum contains antibodies to many autoantigens. For example, all healthy people have autoantibodies (immunoglobulin M) to some undefined brain antigens. In this study immunoblots and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect antibodies to neural tissues in serum samples from 200 healthy people and 200 patients with various neurological diseases. Ninety-nine percent of the 400 subjects had serum immunoglobulin M and 95 percent had immunoglobulin G that bound to a 200-kilodalton protein in homogenates of neural tissues. In most cases there were no antibodies to anything else in the homogenates. The 200-kilodalton protein was the heaviest of the neurofilament triplet proteins. These observations do not support a role for antibodies to the 200-kilodalton protein of neurofilaments in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1546961042,"Interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein (IRBP) is a large retinol-carrying glycoprotein, located only in the interphotoreceptor (or subretinal) space of vertebrate eyes. It has recently been purified to apparent homogeneity. The present report presents its sedimentation, spectroscopic, and binding properties. The molecular weight of bovine IRBP, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, is 133,000. The sedimentation coefficient is 5.8S. The Stokes radius, 56 A, obtained from gel-filtration chromatography, is much larger than that expected for a globular protein of the same molecular weight. These results indicate that IRBP is asymmetric (it can modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution with axial ratio of about 8:1) and explain the overestimates of molecular weight obtained in previous studies based on size-exclusion methods. The molar absorption coefficients for IRBP (at 280 nm) and for bound retinol are both unaffected by ligand dissociation. Fluorescence of the holoprotein displays neither fine structure nor energy transfer from tryptophan to bound retinol. Circular dichroism suggests a secondary structure containing approximately 15% alpha-helix and approximately 20% beta-structure, unchanged by the presence of ligand. The binding of retinol creates a positive, extrinsic Cotton effect at 330 nm, proportional to the amount of retinol bound. The apparent dissociation constant for all-trans-retinol is 1.3 X 10(-6) M. This relatively loose binding implies that, if required during the visual cycle, IRBP should be able to transfer its ligand to other binding proteins in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2043339720,"Fibrinogen fragment D, which is heterogeneous, has several important biological functions. Human fibrinogen fragments D94 (molecular weight, 94,000), D78 (78,000), and E (52,000) were purified. Fragments D78 and D94 but not purified fibrinogen or fragment E specifically caused disorganization of bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured as monolayers. Within 2 hours of exposure to pathophysiological concentrations of fragment D, the confluent endothelial cells retracted from each other and projected pseudopodia. These disturbed cells subsequently became rounded and detached from the substrate. The actin present in stress fibers in stationary monolayer cells was diffusely redistributed in cells with fragment D-induced alterations in morphology. This effect was not observed in monolayers of kidney epithelial cells. The results demonstrate a specific effect of fibrinogen fragment D on the disorganization of cultured vascular endothelial cell monolayers and suggest that fragment D plays a role in the pathogenesis of syndromes with vascular endothelial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2010917353,"A strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules that receives growing popularity among organic chemists employs the photochemically mediated [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. These reactions can be performed on a multigram scale and often proceed with high yield and with stereocontrol. These features, in combination with the useful properties of the four-membered ring photoproducts in subsequent chemical transformations, make them attractive options in the early stage of a synthesis design. Various combinations of unsaturated functional groups can participate in this reaction process. Accordingly, these chemical reactions can be economical solutions to problems relating to the synthesis of a variety of target molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2005001863,"A system has been developed in which organelle transport can be studied without the influence of an organized cellular cytoplasm. Binding and continuous unidirectional movement of organelles along isolated cellular transport cables were directly visualized by video light microscopy after the dissociation of the cytoplasm of characean algae cells in a Ca2+-free buffer containing adenosine triphosphate. Individual organelles had more than one attachment site and moved at mean rates of 11.2 or 62.1 micrometers per second along multiple parallel pathways on each cable. Electron microscopy of these cables after direct freezing demonstrated that they consist of compact bundles of actin filaments. Under these conditions, characteristics of organelle movement should reflect directly the underlying molecular processes of binding and force generation."

https://openalex.org/W1573153261,"Total polysomal RNA of rat liver was translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The translation products were mixed with a postnuclear supernatant fraction of rat liver and incubated post-translationally at 26 degrees C for 15-60 min. The import assay mixture was separated into a particulate fraction and supernatant by centrifugation, both of which were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with a goat antibody against rat liver peroxisomal proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography. One peroxisomal translation product (Mr 72,000) appeared in the particulate fraction, was partly proteinase K-resistant, and addition of detergents prior to proteolysis abolished this resistance. In isopycnic centrifugation of the uptake assay mixture, the protease-resistant 35S-polypeptide of Mr 72,000 cosedimented with the peroxisomes. This translation product was identified immunochemically as fatty acyl-CoA oxidase; both before and after import it was indistinguishable in size from subunit A of the purified enzyme by prolonged sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When the cell-free translation products were incubated with highly purified peroxisomes, 35S-catalase entered peroxisomes (by the criterion of protease resistance), and its entry was stimulated by the addition of a high speed supernatant (cytosolic) fraction of rat liver. These results demonstrate the post-translational import into peroxisomes in vitro of at least two cell-free translation products."

https://openalex.org/W1581184339,"Hematin catalyzes the epoxidation of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BP-7,8-diol) by 13-hydroperoxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid and other fatty acid hydroperoxides in the presence of detergent. The major oxidation product is the anti-dihydrodiolepoxide and the minor product is the syn-dihydrodiolepoxide. (+)-BP-7,8-diol is oxidized to (-)-anti-diolepoxide and (+)-syn-diolepoxide whereas (-)-BP-7,8-diol is oxidized to (+)-anti-diolepoxide and (-)-syn-diolepoxide. Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the source of the epoxide oxygen is O2. The phenolic antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene inhibit epoxidation by 100 and 93%, respectively. These observations suggest that hematin-catalyzed epoxidation proceeds by a free radical mechanism. Incubation of hematin, BP-7,8-diol, and a series of fatty acid hydroperoxides containing two, one, or zero double bonds alpha to the carbon bearing the hydroperoxide indicates that at least one double bond is essential for generation of the epoxidizing agent. Taken with results of the study of the metabolism of 13-hydroperoxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid by hematin described in the accompanying paper (Dix, T. A., and Marnett, L. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5351-5357), these results indicate that the epoxidizing agent is a peroxyl radical generated by coupling of O2 to a carbon-centered radical derived from the double bonds adjacent to the hydroperoxide group. The detergents Tween 20, Triton X-100, and Triton X-405 dramatically enhance epoxidation above but not below their critical micellar concentrations. The intensity and lambda max of the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of BP-7,8-diol increase in the presence of detergent, indicating that an important role of detergent is solubilization of the hydrophobic substrate. However, detergent also stimulates the hematin-catalyzed oxidation of a water-soluble polycyclic hydrocarbon, bis-(carboxyethyl)-anthracene, suggesting that detergent has an effect on the peroxidase activity of hematin. A detailed mechanism for epoxidation of BP-7,8-diol by hematin and fatty acid hydroperoxides is presented and its relevance to other hydroperoxide-dependent epoxidizing systems is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1601142015,"Brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was isolated as the major cytoskeletal component of the post-synaptosomal fraction, accounting for about 50% of the total protein. The alpha- and beta-subunits of the enzyme were present in a ratio of about 6:1. The cytoskeletal preparation was also distinguished by the regular presence of tubulin and actin in approximately equimolar amounts to the beta-subunit. Electron microscopic morphology suggested that the enzyme formed a hierarchy of cytoskeletal complexes with an average diameter of 85 nm. These results indicate that cytoskeletal calmodulin-dependent protein kinase may have a structural as well as a catalytic role in neurons. The cytoskeletal enzyme could be solubilized in 8 M urea, displaying similar properties to its cytosolic counterpart. The postsynaptosomal cytoskeleton provides a simplified and well-defined model for the study of the protein-protein interactions involving calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2031704718,"The intracellular pH (pHl) rises 0.3–0.5 units after fertilization of sea urchin eggs, and this and previous work show this pHl change is necessary for initiating the developmental processes leading to cell division. The experiments described here reveal that while the elevated pHi is permanently required for a normal early development, lowering pHl of embryos after fertilization affects different processes to different extents. Protein synthesis gradually becomes less sensitive to pHl. Karyokinesis proceeds to completion under a low pHl, but is retarded, while cytokinesis is always impaired. These results indicate a hierarchy of requirements for high pHi during early development of sea urchin embryos, with protein synthesis, karyokinesis, and cytokinesis showing, respectively, increasing requirements for an elevated pHl."
https://openalex.org/W1536911646,"Abstract NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) was isolated from squash cotyledons (Cucurbita maxima L.) by a combination of Blue Sepharose and zinc-chelate affinity chromatographies followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m. These preparations gave a single protein staining band (Mr = 115,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, indicating that the enzyme is homogeneous. The native Mr of nitrate reductase was found to be 230,000, with a minor form of Mr = 420,000 also occurring. These results indicate that the native nitrate reductase is a homodimer of Mr = 115,000 subunits. Acidic amino acids predominate over basic amino acids, as shown both by the amino acid composition of the enzyme and an isoelectric point for nitrate reductase of 5.7. The homogeneous nitrate reductase had a UV/visible spectrum typical of a b-type cytochrome. The enzyme was found to contain one each of flavin (as FAD), heme iron, molybdenum, and Mo-pterin/Mr = 115,000 subunit. A model is proposed for squash nitrate reductase in which two Mr = 115,000 subunits are joined to made the native enzyme. Each subunit contains 1 eq of FAD, cytochrome b, and molybdenum/Mo-pterin."
https://openalex.org/W2057030887,"The innervation of acini and ducts of eccrine sweat glands by immunoreactive, vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing nerve fibers was sharply reduced in seven patients with cystic fibrosis compared to eight normal subjects. The decrease in innervation by this neuropeptide, which has been shown to promote blood flow and the movement of water and chloride across epithelial surfaces in other systems, may be a basic mechanism for the decreased water content and relative impermeability of the epithelium to chloride and other ions that characterize cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1580099539,"Intracellular Ca2+ rises when neutrophils are stimulated with formyl peptide ligands. There is enough Ca2+ released to complex approximately 200 microM Quin 2, (220 +/- 90 microM, 7 donors). This result is interpreted in terms of a fixed storage pool of Ca2+ of 44 pmol/10(6) cells. When extracellular Ca2+ is removed from the medium with 5 mM EGTA (final pH 7.4) just prior to cell stimulation, neither the magnitude nor the early time course of the Quin 2 response to formyl peptide is dramatically influenced. This result supports the concept that neither Ca2+ influx nor efflux, which are elevated in stimulated cells, contributes in a major way to the free Ca2+ pool which is monitored by Quin 2 during the early activation phase of cell responses. We have used intracellular Quin 2, and extracellular Ca2+ without the use of EGTA or ionophores to manipulate the levels of intracellular Ca2+. This is accomplished by depleting cells of intracellular Ca2+ by loading with Quin 2 in the absence of Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ is modulated by adding back Ca2+ to the medium. Using simultaneous analyses of cell function and Quin 2 fluorescence, we find that at least two aspects of cellular responsiveness (degranulation and O2- production) depend upon the level of available Ca2+. In contrast, the first phase, at least, of a biphasic rapid light scattering response which is related to actin polymerization is independent of Ca2+. We find that the Ca2+- sensitive cell responses can be partially restored in Ca2+-depleted cells if Ca2+ is provided within 30 s, a period which may reflect the putative lifetime of the transiently active ligand-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1974598209,"Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic drug, was tested for its ability to block the behavioral response to amphetamine and to elicit catalepsy in rats treated with saline or ascorbic acid (1000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight). By itself, ascorbic acid failed to exert significant behavioral effects, but it enhanced the antiamphetamine and cataleptogenic effects of haloperidol (0.1 or 0.5 milligrams per kilogram). These results, combined with a growing body of biochemical evidence, suggest that ascorbic acid plays an important role in modulating the behavioral effects of haloperidol and related antipsychotic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2019001170,"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (proton and phosphorus-31) and ultraviolet absorption spectra of the DNA decamer d(br5CGbr5CGATbr5CGbr5CG), in which the central two adenine-thymine base pairs are out of order with the rest of the purine-pyrimidine alternation sequence, indicate that under appropriate solvent conditions (high salt and methanol) the molecule undergoes a structural transition from a right-handed B-DNA conformation to a left-handed Z-DNA conformation. Measurements of the two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect on the decamer indicate that all of the guanines as well as the two equivalent thymines adopt the syn conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1526930384,"Spontaneous fibrinolysis of plasma clots was studied by following the lysis of the clots formed in 125I-fibrinogen-supplemented citrated plasma. Lysis of the clots invariably follows sigmoidal kinetics with S50 (the time required for 50% clot lysis) ranging from 3.5 to 4.7 days in 8 samples of pooled blood bank plasma and in the majority of apparently healthy donor plasmas. The spontaneous lysis of factor XII-deficient and prekallikrein-deficient plasmas was found to be similar to that of normal plasma. Addition of ellagic acid or antibodies against kallikrein or urokinase to normal pooled plasma did not alter significantly its rate of spontaneous lysis. On the other hand the addition of antibody against tissue activator (t-PA) inhibited over 80% of the spontaneous fibrinolysis in a 7-day incubation period at 37 degrees C, and the clot visually persisted for more than a month. Therefore, the factor XII-dependent components and prourokinase/urokinase system do not contribute significantly in whole plasma fibrinolysis in vitro, while the t-PA-related protein appears to be the major plasminogen activator responsible for initiating spontaneous fibrinolysis in whole plasma. Exogenous addition of increasing amounts of purified HeLa cell t-PA to normal pooled plasma in the ng/ml range cause progressively faster clot lysis. By extrapolation, normal pooled plasma is found to contain endogenous tissue activator in an amount functionally equivalent to 2 ng/ml of purified 60-kDa t-PA. The molecular nature of the t-PA-related proteins in plasma was studied by zymographic and immunological methods. The major t-PA-related protein in plasma was found to have a molecular mass of 100 kDa as determined by zymography. By incubating purified HeLa 60-kDa t-PA with a t-PA-depleted plasma, the 100-kDa component can be generated in plasma, suggesting that the latter is formed as a result of the binding of 60-kDa t-PA to a binding protein in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1500396578,"We report further investigations on protein inhibition of pancreatic and microbial lipases carried out with the monolayer technique. When beta-lactoglobulin A, melittin, serum albumin, myoglobin, and a protein inhibiting lipase from soybean were preincubated with a dicaprin film at a surface pressure of 35 dynes/cm, no activity was detected with horse pancreatic or Rhizopus delemar lipases. By contrast, Rhizopus arrhizus and Geotrichum candidum lipase activities were not impaired under the same conditions. Experiments using mixed lipid-protein film transfer clearly show that the inhibition of pancreatic lipase is due to the protein associated with lipid and not caused by direct protein-enzyme interaction in the aqueous phase. Three parameters were used to determine the surface properties of the various proteins at the dicaprin/water interface; namely, the initial rate of surface pressure increase, (delta pi/delta t)t = 0, the maximal surface pressure increase, delta pi max, and the critical surface pressure, pi c. A positive correlation was observed between values of (delta pi/delta t)t = 0 of proteins and their respective capacity to inhibit pancreatic and R. delemar lipases. By contrast, there was no apparent correlation with the two other parameters, delta pi max or pi c."
https://openalex.org/W1512794318,"A factor able to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of multipotential stem cells and progenitor cells of the granulocyte-macrophage, eosinophil, and erythroid lineages as well as being able to maintain factor-dependent cell lines in culture has been purified from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated mouse spleen cell-conditioned medium. The factor was purified over 2 million-fold by sequential fractionation using salting out chromatography, chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a phenyl-silica column, and gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography. All of the biological activities ascribed to the multipotential colony-stimulating factor co-fractionated through all steps, and the other known mouse-active hemopoietic regulator in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated mouse spleen cell-conditioned medium, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, was separated at the ion exchange step. Two protein species having Mr = 24,000 and 19,000 were visualized by silver-staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of the purified factor. Both species migrated coincidently with the biological activities. The factor was active at a half-maximal concentration of 1 X 10(-13) M when assayed on a factor-dependent cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1502119684,"The stopped flow method combined with fluorescence detection has been employed to study the rapid kinetics of the glucose transporter from human erythrocytes. Upon mixing the purified transporter reconstituted into unsealed membranes of erythrocyte lipids with 4,6-ethylidene D-glucose, a derivative that binds preferentially to the substrate site on the outer domain of the transporter, there was a rapid, first-order decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein. Three properties of this transient indicate that it represents a half-turnover of the transporter from a conformation with the substrate site facing inward to one with this site facing outward. The first-order rate constant decreased as the concentration of ethylidene glucose was increased; the value of the rate constant for the process is similar to that expected from steady-state kinetic studies of transport in the erythrocyte; and D-glucose at low concentration increased the rate of reaction. This study is the first determination of the kinetics of a half-turnover for a transport system of the facilitated diffusion type. The identification of this step provides direct evidence for the alternating conformation mechanism of transport."
https://openalex.org/W1548261214,"Glucocorticoids are known to rapidly inhibit glucose transport when added to isolated rat adipocytes. To determine whether this inhibition of transport persists following isolation of the plasma membranes, adipocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of a maximally inhibitory concentration of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, and plasma membrane vesicles were prepared. D-Glucose uptake into vesicles from steroid-treated cells was inhibited by an average of 40%. The ability of dexamethasone to inhibit transport depended upon pretreatment of cells with hormone prior to membrane isolation. Furthermore, the decreased rate of transport was prevented by the simultaneous addition to the cell of actinomycin D or cycloheximide with dexamethasone, indicating a requirement for RNA and protein synthesis. The effect of dexamethasone on glucose transport was further investigated using our recently developed cytochalasin B affinity-labeling protocol to identify the transporter on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. A peak of radioactivity having Mr = 54,000 was identified which exhibited the properties expected for the glucose transporter, in that label incorporation was prevented by D-glucose and unlabeled cytochalasin B, but not by D-sorbitol or unlabeled cytochalasins A, D, or E. Dexamethasone was found to cause a significant (average 33%) decrease in the amount of labeled transporter in the plasma membrane which was prevented by the simultaneous addition of actinomycin D with dexamethasone to the cells. A similar percentage decrease was not found in a microsomal membrane fraction nor in a total cellular membrane fraction. These results suggest that glucocorticoids may decrease glucose transport in rat adipocytes by selectively decreasing the number of transporters in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1582074486,"The activity of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes with elongation factors from a variety of sources including the mitochondria of lower eukaryotes, chloroplasts, Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm has been investigated. Bovine mitochondrial ribosomes are active with homologous mitochondrial elongation factor (EF)-G but display no activity with the mitochondrial or chloroplast translocases from the lower eukaryote Euglena gracilis, with Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis EF-G or with cytoplasmic EF-2. In contrast to the results obtained with the translocases, E. coli EF-Tu, B. subtilis EF-Tu, and Euglena chloroplast EF-Tu all function to a significant extent on the mitochondrial ribosomes. Cytoplasmic EF-1 has barely detectable activity on the animal mitochondrial ribosomes. The polymerization of phenylalanine by these ribosomes is dependent on poly(U), displays a rather broad Mg2+ optimum around 12 mM, and proceeds most rapidly at low monovalent ion concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1497800970,"Rat hepatic fatty acid binding protein (hFABP) may play an important role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. Recent reports have suggested a substantial circadian variation in the amount of hFABP in liver, and a half-life of less than 2 h for this protein has been inferred. In the present study, the kinetics of hFABP turnover were examined directly. hFABP half-life measured after pulse labeling with NaH14CO3 was 3.1 days compared with 2.9 days for total cytosol protein. Following double-isotope labeling, the charge isoforms of hFABP showed similar rates of turnover, all of which were slower relative to whole cytosol protein turnover. Following a 48-h fast, total liver hFABP measured by immunoassay fell 65%, paralleling a 60% fall in total cytosol protein. Refeeding for 24 h did not lead to a significant recovery of either hFABP or total cytosol protein content. No significant change was observed in hFABP abundance between mid-light and mid-dark periods of a 24-h light-dark cycle. These studies showed that hFABP has a relatively slow rate of turnover and that it is not acutely modulated by dietary or diurnal influences."
https://openalex.org/W1526810885,"Phosvitin, a highly phosphorylated glycoprotein, represents the major fraction of hen egg yolk phosphoproteins. Circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic and fluorescence spectroscopic methods were employed to determine the secondary structure of the protein in both the solid and solution phases. This was supplemented by a Chou-Fasman type of predictive algorithm for the first 25 residues at the N terminus of the dephosphorylated protein. A three-compartment model consisting of alpha-helical, beta-sheet, and beta-turn components with beta-turns occurring at the interface between alpha-helical and beta-sheet regions in the proximity of O-phosphoserine residues is suggested from the combined analyses. Beta-sheets appear to be the dominant secondary structural component in phosvitin in the solid and solution phases. The suggested model bears many similarities to other phosphoproteins reported in the literature. The secondary structure of phosvitin is observed to be sensitive to environmental factors as previously reported although the present studies differ in some respects from earlier results. Preliminary results suggest that Ca2+ ions trigger a decrease in beta-sheet structure at pH 2."
https://openalex.org/W1581968603,"Forskolin, a potent activator of cyclic AMP generating systems, has been proposed to act directly on the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase. Nevertheless, some arguments indicate a possible role of the guanosine triphosphate-binding regulatory protein in forskolin action on adenylate cyclase. In this study, we have observed an increase in the apparent sedimentation coefficient of solubilized adenylate cyclase, elicited by forskolin, both in rat liver (from 6.4 +/- 0.1 to 7.2 +/- 0.1 S) and rat striatum (from 6.7 +/- 0.1 to 7.6 +/- 0.1 S). On both systems, a similar increase in the sedimentation coefficient was observed after preactivation of the enzyme with guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). In contrast to the Gpp(NH)p effect, the forskolin action was found to be reversible. Simultaneous pretreatments of adenylate cyclase with forskolin and Gpp(NH)p did not induce additive increases of the apparent sedimentation coefficient of adenylate cyclase. The modification of the size of solubilized adenylate cyclase was corroborated by gel filtration studies. In rat liver membranes, the Stokes radius of the solubilized enzyme increased from 59 +/- 1 A for basal state to 65 +/- 1 A for forskolin preactivated state. A possible explanation of our findings is that forskolin may stabilize the complex between the GTP-binding regulatory protein and the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase in a reversible manner."
https://openalex.org/W1512292724,"The subcellular location and some properties of the rat kidney 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase are described. Enzyme activity can be measured as previously discussed (Tanaka, Y., and DeLuca, H.F. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 196-199) using saturating substrate (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) concentrations. The reaction is linear with time for up to 30 min at a substrate concentration of 80 microM and 9-11 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. The enzyme, located in the mitochondria, requires molecular oxygen and a source of NADPH. Succinate supplies NADPH for 1 alpha-hydroxylation through reversal of electron transport and transhydrogenation as shown by inhibition with antimycin A and dinitrophenol. Malate supplies NADPH for the reaction via the mitochondrial malic enzyme or malate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase as indicated by the lack of inhibition by antimycin A but inhibition with dinitrophenol. Metyrapone and carbon monoxide both inhibit 1 alpha-hydroxylation indicating the involvement of cytochrome P-450. Diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, a lipid peroxidase inhibitor, has no effect on 1 alpha-hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W2102763416,"Rabbit kidney cortical brush-border membrane vesicles were irradiated in the frozen state with increasing doses of high energy electrons from a Van de Graaff generator. Sodium-dependent D-glucose and L-alanine transport showed a simple exponential loss of activity with increasing radiation dosage. Target size calculation based on these data gives estimates of 1.0 X 10(6) daltons for the glucose transporter and 1.2 X 10(6) daltons for the alanine transporter. A highly purified glucose transport protein extracted from rabbit kidney cortex was similarly irradiated both before and after reconstitution into liposomes. The target size of this purified glucose transporter was 343,000 daltons, based on inactivation of transport. The intensity of the major 165,000-dalton sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis band of this preparation was decreased by radiation. The decrease in staining intensity was dose-dependent, yielding a target size of 298,000 daltons, in situ. We propose that the purified glucose transporter reconstituted into liposomes is a tetramer comprised of 85,000-dalton subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1503634029,"Replication of bacteriophage T7 DNA initiates in vivo at an origin located 15% of the distance from the genetic left end of the chromosome. Bidirectional DNA synthesis from this site results in complete replication of the chromosome. The combination of T7 RNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, and T7 gene 4 protein initiates DNA synthesis in vitro within the cloned origin sequence (Fuller, C. W., and Richardson, C. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260: 3185-3196). DNA synthesis is primed by T7 RNA polymerase transcripts, and proceeds in the same direction (rightward) as transcription to yield partially replicated Y-form DNA molecules. The DNA product of in vitro synthesis (Y-form DNA) has been characterized by electron microscopic, sedimentation, and gel electrophoretic analyses. These studies show that Y-form DNA is the product of unidirectional replication of both leading and lagging strands from the origin to the right-hand end of the template. The inclusion of either Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein or the functionally similar T7 gene 2.5 protein results in marked stimulation of bidirectional synthesis. Studies using purified Y-form DNA provide direct evidence that this species is an intermediate in the complete replication of the linear template. Purified Y-form DNA is converted to linear DNA in a reaction catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase, T7 gene 4 protein, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Y-form DNA is a competent, transient intermediate during the bidirectional replication of linear DNA molecules and DNA-binding protein is essential to initiate leftward synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1487480122,"A photoreactive, radioiodinated derivative of glucose, N-(4-iodoazidosalicyl)-6-amido-6-deoxyglucopyranose (IASA-glc), has been synthesized and used as a photoaffinity label for the human erythrocyte monosaccharide transporter. Photoinactivation and photoinsertion are both light-dependent and result in a marked decrease in the absorption spectra of the compound. When [125I]IASA-glc was photolyzed with erythrocyte ghost membranes, photoinsertion of radiolabel was observed in three major regions, spectrin, band 3, and a protein of 58,000 daltons located in the zone 4.5 region. Of the three regions which were photolabeled, only labeling of polypeptides in the zone 4.5 region was partially blocked by D-glucose. In the non-iodinated form, N-(4-azidosalicyl)-6-amido-6-deoxy-glucopyranose inhibited the labeling of the transporter by [125I]IASA-glc more effectively than D-glucose. The ability to synthesize this [125I]containing photoprobe for the monosaccharide transporter at carrier-free levels offers several new advantages for investigating the structure of this transport protein in the erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1519992772,"Abstract The association of dioxygen and carbon monoxide to soybean leghemoglobin (Lb) has been studied by laser flash photolysis at temperatures from 10 to 320 K and times from 50 ns to 100 s. Infrared spectra of the bound and the photodissociated state were investigated between 10 and 20 K. The general features of the binding process in leghemoglobin are similar to the ones found in myoglobin. Below about 200 K, the photodissociated ligands stay in the heme pocket and rebinding is not exponential in time, implying a distributed enthalpy barrier between pocket and heme. At around 300 K, ligands migrate from the solvent through the protein to the heme pocket, and a steady state is set up between the ligands in the solvent and in the heme pocket. The association rate, lambda on, is mainly controlled by the final binding step at the heme, the bond formation with the heme iron. Differences between Lb and other heme proteins show up in the details of the various steps. The faster association rate in Lb compared to sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) is due to a faster bond formation. The migration from the solvent to the heme pocket is much faster in Lb than in Mb. The low-temperature binding (B----A) and the infrared spectra of CO in the bound state A and the photodissociated state B are essentially solvent-independent in Mb, but depend strongly on solvent in Lb. These features can be correlated with the x-ray structure."
https://openalex.org/W1537157238,"The autophosphorylation reaction responsible for conversion of insulin receptor (from human placenta) to an active tyrosyl-protein kinase was shown to be inhibited by Zn2+ and other divalent metal ions. The order of inhibitory potency was found to be Cu2+ greater than Zn2+, Cd2+ greater than Co2+, Ni2+. Autophosphorylation of insulin receptor was almost completely blocked by 10 microM Zn2+. Zn2+, however, did not appear to affect the binding of insulin to its receptor. Histidine, a chelator of Zn2+, protected against the inhibitory effects of Zn2+. The failure of histidine to regenerate the competence of the Zn2+-inhibited receptor to undergo autophosphorylation suggested that the inhibition by Zn2+ was irreversible. In addition to inhibiting autophosphorylation, Zn2+ inhibited the tyrosyl-protein kinase activity of highly purified phosphorylated receptor. Zn2+ was also observed to inhibit phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase activity present in preparations of partially purified insulin receptor. These inhibitory effects of Zn2+ should be considered in the design of protocols for the isolation and handling of insulin receptor and possibly other tyrosine kinases. Additionally, the possible physiological significance of the inhibition of insulin receptor kinase by Zn2+ is discussed in light of the fact that Zn2+ is accumulated in and secreted from pancreatic islet cells together with insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1549512621,"Using a rapid purification scheme, we have isolated from calf thymus cells two single strand-specific DNA-binding proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 48 and 61 kDa. These proteins remained undetected in earlier studies on DNA-binding proteins from calf thymus because they are extremely sensitive to proteolytic breakdown occurring during purification. The proteins are immunologically and biochemically related. They also share a number of functional properties. Both proteins bind noncooperatively to single-stranded DNA and almost totally ignore double-stranded DNA. Both proteins stimulate DNA synthesis catalyzed by mammalian DNA polymerase alpha in the presence of an excess of activated DNA as primer-template. The stimulation factor was between 2 and 100 depending on the protein/DNA ratio. We have analyzed this effect in more detail with specifically primed single-stranded phage fd DNA as template and concluded that the proteins block nonproductive polymerase-binding sites on single-stranded DNA sequences, thereby increasing the probability for an association of polymerase with 3'-OH primer ends."
https://openalex.org/W1573358632,"Abstract The influence of altered bilayer cholesterol content on the catalytic activity of the human red cell hexose transporter was examined by reconstitution of the transport protein (band 4.5) into bilayers of large unilamellar vesicles formed from dipalmitoyl lecithin and varying amounts of cholesterol. The physical state of the bilayers was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. The major findings are as follows: changes in bilayer phase behavior occur at membrane cholesterol levels of 15 to 20 mol % and 30 to 40 mol %; and the catalytic activity of the reconstituted transporter (Vmax/transporter) correlates with bilayer phase behavior. In crystalline bilayers, this is seen as an abrupt, stimulation of activity at 15 mol % cholesterol (which is reversed at 17.5 mol %) and a gradual acceleration of activity between 30 to 40 mol % cholesterol. In fluid bilayers (where activity is high), activity is unaffected by 10, 20, and 30 mol % cholesterol. However, 12.5 and 17.5 mol % cholesterol reduce activity by 100-fold. These studies demonstrate that small changes in bilayer cholesterol content result in drastic alterations in transporter activity. Transporter sensitivity to cholesterol is a complex rather than monotonic function of bilayer cholesterol content and appears to be primarily determined by bilayer composition rather than by bilayer fluidity."
https://openalex.org/W1655608294,"Abstract The conformational responses of aspartate aminotransferase (cytosolic isoenzyme from pig) to the binding of the coenzyme and competitive inhibitors and to the bond rearrangement steps during the transamination reaction were probed by the method of peptide hydrogen deuterium exchange. Binding of the coenzyme to the apoenzyme results in a marked retardation of hydrogen exchange; binding of the competitive inhibitor maleate to the pyridoxal enzyme induces a retardation of exchange somewhat exceeding that observed in the presence of the transaminating substrate pair glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate (Pfister, K., Kagi, J.H.R., and Christen, P. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 145-148). On formation of the complex of apoenzyme with N-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)-L-glutamate or-L-aspartate, analogs of the covalent coenzyme substrate intermediates, a similar exchange retardation occurs. The extent of the exchange retardation in these different functional states of the enzyme correlates with previous results of differential chemical and proteolytic modifications. Apparently, the diverse methods register shifts in one and the same conformational equilibrium. Moreover, the conditions under which peptide hydrogen exchange indicates a pronounced tightening of the protein matrix correspond with those inducing crystallization of the enzyme in the closed form. Thus, the transition between the open and closed form of the enzyme, i.e. the bulk movement of the small domain, as observed and defined by x-ray crystallography (Kirsch, J. F., Eichele, G., Ford, G. C., Vincent, M. G., Jansonius, J. N., Gehring, H., and Christen, P. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 174, 497-525) is the major structural correlate of the conformational changes undergone by the enzyme in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2035050669,"Attempts to isolate deoxyuridine 2'-hydroxylase from Rhodotorula glutinis by the procedure of Warn-Cramer et al. (Warn-Cramer, B. J., Macrander, L. A., and Abbott, M. T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10551-10557) have led to the identification and partial purification of a newly recognized alpha-ketoglutarate-requiring oxygenase. This activity, designated deoxyuridine (uridine) 1'-hydroxylase, in the presence of iron and ascorbate, catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine (uridine), O2, and alpha-ketoglutarate to uracil, deoxyribonolactone (ribonolactone), CO2, and succinate. Incubation of [1'-3H]uridine with this activity results in time-dependent formation of uracil concomitant with production of CO2 and 3H2O. No Vmax/Km isotope effect is observed on this reaction. Uracil production is accompanied by stoichiometric production of ribonolactone identified by NMR spectroscopy. Also reported in this paper is the partial purification and characterization of the alpha-ketoglutarate-requiring enzyme, deoxyuridine 2'-hydroxylase. Incubation of [2'-alpha-3H]deoxyuridine with this activity results in concomitant production of uridine and 3H2O. Incubation with [2'-beta-3H] deoxyuridine results in the production of uridine whose specific activity is identical to that of the starting material. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine to uridine with retention of configuration. No isotope effect is observed on this transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1508205050,"The giant extracellular hemoglobin from the polychaete Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus consists of two types of subunits: a chain (chain I) and a disulfide-bonded trimer of chains IIA, IIB, and IIC. The complete amino acid sequence of chain IIB was determined. This chain has 148 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 17,236 including a heme group. Of the residues in chain IIB, 74 (50%) and 34 (30%) were found to be identical with those in the corresponding positions in Tylorrhynchus chains IIC and I, respectively (Suzuki, T., Furukohri, T., and Gotoh, T.

Significant differences were predicted between the monomeric chain I and the trimeric chains (IIB and IIC) in the hydropathy profiles and alpha-helical contents."
https://openalex.org/W1593043870,"The transfer of [14C]glucose from UDP-[14C]glucose to lipid intermediates and glycoproteins was decreased in regenerating rat liver microsomes 24 h after partial hepatectomy. In regenerating liver microsomes, the concentration of free dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) was significantly decreased. However, it was only about 10% of total Dol-P, which was not significantly changed. On the addition of exogenous Dol-P, the transfer of [14C]glucose to glycoproteins was still decreased, while the decrease of the transfer to lipid intermediates was no longer observed. These results suggest that the glycoprotein synthesis is not regulated by the amount of Dol-P in regenerating liver microsomes. Oligosaccharide obtained from [14C]glucosyl-oligosaccharide-lipid was not distinguishable between regenerating liver and control by paper chromatography. The oligosaccharide transfer to protein in microsomes was compared by using [14C]glucosyl-oligosaccharide-lipid as oligosaccharide donor. The transfer of oligosaccharide to endogenous proteins decreased to 77% of control in regenerating liver and the transfer to exogenously added denatured alpha-lactalbumin decreased to 59% of control. Therefore, it is unlikely that the acceptor capacity of endogenous protein is decreased in regenerating liver. Neither the change in oligosaccharide-lipid under the condition for oligosaccharide transfer assay nor the stability of oligosaccharide transferase was different between regenerating liver and control. These results strongly suggest that the decrease in the activity of the oligosaccharide transferase in microsomes causes the decrease of glycoprotein synthesis in regenerating liver, which was shown in our previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W2071214564,"Mice were fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 9 days. On removal of the diet, exposure to 12 atmospheres absolute of a mixture of helium and oxygen precipitated earlier withdrawal, increased withdrawal scores for the first 6 hours, and increased the peak withdrawal intensity compared to dependent animals exposed to control conditions. The enhanced withdrawal did not appear to reflect alterations in ethanol elimination, oxygen or helium partial pressures, body temperature, or general excitability. These results extend to chronically treated animals the evidence that hyperbaric exposure antagonizes the membrane actions of ethanol."

Several proteins, including tubulin, showed marked differences in their relative rates of synthesis during the cell cycle. A few proteins were found to be synthesized at a specific time during the cycle. In particular, a pair of proteins of approximately 21,000 daltons and isoelectric point of 5.5 were found to be synthesized only in late G2 and mitotic cells. Cells that were labeled during mitosis and then allowed to divide showed no trace of these proteins, indicating that their presence is transient and that they are likely involved in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1567790141,"It is well established that mannosylphosphoryldolichol participates in the synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins by donating mannosyl residues to oligosaccharide-lipid intermediates. It has been suggested that mannosylphosphorylretinol also is involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis. We conclude that one synthase catalyzes the synthesis of both mannosylphosphoryldolichol and mannosylphosphorylretinol in rat liver tissue and Chinese hamster ovary cells, based on the following results. 1) The enzyme in rat liver microsomes that synthesizes mannosylphosphoryldolichol and mannosylphosphorylretinol is inactivated at the same rate at 55 degrees C. 2) In membranes of both rat liver and Chinese hamster ovary cells, exogenous dolichyl phosphate and retinyl phosphate compete with each other for mannosyl-lipid synthesis. However, in both systems adding exogenous retinyl phosphate has no effect on the synthesis of mannosylphosphoryldolichol from endogenous dolichyl phosphate in the membranes. 3) Membranes prepared from a mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells which is devoid of mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthase lack the ability to synthesize mannosylphosphorylretinol."
https://openalex.org/W1534141824,"The heat effect associated with the binding of diazepam to human serum albumin has been measured from pH 5.5 to 9.5 using flow microcalorimetry. The number of protons released upon the binding of one molecule of diazepam to one molecule of albumin was determined from acid-base titration experiments. In addition, the heat associated with the combination of protons with serum albumin was measured calorimetrically. The results of the experiments using these two techniques were used to correct the measured heat of binding and to obtain what will be called here delta H0obs values. These delta H0obs values are strongly pH-dependent: up to pH 7.5 a value of -24.3 (+/- 0.5) kJ X mol-1 is found, whereas at pH 9.5 the value is -44.3 (+/- 1.2). This pH dependence is different from the pH dependence of the induced CD signal of the albumin-diazepam complex. A model is presented in which the pH dependence of delta H0obs is explained. This model takes into account the N-B (neutral to base) conformational change in albumin around neutral pH. Parameters in this model are KN and KB (representing the affinity of diazepam for albumin in the N and B conformation, respectively), delta H0N and delta H0B which are the corresponding standard enthalpy changes, f which represents the fraction of protein in the B conformation, and delta H0(N-B) which represents the heat associated with the N-B transition."
