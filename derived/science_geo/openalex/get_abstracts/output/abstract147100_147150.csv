https://openalex.org/W2047764904,"Proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components during tissue remodeling plays a pivotal role in normal and pathological processes including wound healing, inflammation, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Proteolytic enzymes in tumors may activate or release growth factors from the ECM or act directly on the ECM itself, thereby facilitating angiogenesis or tumor cell migration. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts found in epithelial cancers and in granulation tissue during wound healing. It is absent from most normal adult human tissues. FAP is conserved throughout chordate evolution, with homologues in mouse and Xenopus laevis, whose expression correlates with tissue remodeling events. Using recombinant and purified natural FAP, we show that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase activity and a collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen; by sequence, FAP belongs to the serine protease family rather than the matrix metalloprotease family. Mutation of the putative catalytic serine residue of FAP to alanine abolishes both enzymatic activities. Consistent with its in vivo expression pattern determined by immunohistochemistry, FAP enzyme activity was detected by an immunocapture assay in human cancerous tissues but not in matched normal tissues. This study demonstrates that FAP is present as an active cell surface-bound collagenase in epithelial tumor stroma and opens up investigation into physiological substrates of its novel, tumor-associated dipeptidyl peptidase activity.

Proteolysis of the ECM contributes to the processes of tumor cell invasion and metastasis and to sprouting of tumor capillaries, thus permitting malignant tumors to spread as well as acquire nutrients and discard wastes. The complex interplay between the multiple cell types involved, including the malignant cells themselves, the endothelium, and tumor stromal fibroblasts, remains poorly understood. Identification of uniformly expressed tumor stromal markers and elucidation of their functions in the tumor remain major challenges to better understand the dynamics of tumor tissue organization and remodeling. One recently identified marker of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts, the so-called fibroblast activation protein (FAP), is expressed in over 90% of common human epithelial cancers, and its expression in tumors is restricted to the tumor stromal fibroblast, as detected by immunohistochemistry with the prototype monoclonal antibody (mAb) F19 (3Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7235-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and other FAP-specific antibodies (4Rettig W.J. Su S.L. Fortunato S.R.

FAP is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein whose sequence suggests its kinship to dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV) (5Scanlan M.J. Mohan Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H.

Scanlan M.J. Mohan Raj B.K. Murty V.V.V.S. Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Chaganti R.S.K. Genomics. 1995; 25: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggest a common ancestry through gene duplication. Conservation of the FAP gene has been observed in several species. A mouse FAP homologue (87% identical predicted amino acid sequence) has been identified (7Niedermeyer J. Scanlan M.J. Garin-Chesa P. Daiber C. Fiebig H.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and, like human FAP, it is expressed in tumor stroma. A Xenopus laevis FAP homologue (8Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) has also been described, using differential display, and its expression is up-regulated during hormone-induced tail resorption, indicating a possible role in tissue remodeling. This study was designed to link the known expression pattern of human FAP in tumor stromal fibroblasts with a biochemical function that may help to explain its role in tumorigenesis and other tissue remodeling events.

Rev. 1992; 10: 1-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was used for some experiments. Rat anti-mouse CD8 mAb (clone 53–6.72) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG and avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase were purchased from Vector Labs (Burlingame, CA). 293 cells were maintained in a DMEM/F12 mix 50:50 or DMEM, respectively. Cells were transfected with a FAP expression vector, pFAP.38 (5Scanlan M.J. Mohan Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5657-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) using either calcium phosphate transfection (10Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Lipofectin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected with 200 μg/ml Geneticin; resistant clones were picked and examined for FAP expression by immunofluorescence with mAb F19 (3Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7235-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Clones were expanded and maintained in DMEM plus 200 μg/ml Geneticin. High Five cells were cultured in serum free Insect Express medium (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts, Heidelberg Germany). Cells to be labeled were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 1 h in DMEM medium without methionine and cysteine. Cells were labeled overnight with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine mix (Xpress, NEN Life Science Products) and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2. Extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were cleared using PD-10 size exclusion columns. Immunoprecipitations, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and fluorography were performed essentially as described (11Park J.E. Draper R.K. Brown W.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A CD8α cDNA clone (a kind gift of Dr. Marilyn Kehry, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was used as a template to amplify the cDNA encoding the extracellular domain (ECD) of murine CD8α (GenBankTM accession number M12825), consisting of the N-terminal 189 amino acids of CD8α, using the polymerase chain reaction. A SalI restriction site was included in the primer sequence on the 3′ end for cloning purposes. Similarly, the FAP cDNA (including the first XbaI site) encoding the extracellular domain of FAP (amino acids 27–760) was amplified using PCR and a 5′ SalI site added. The murine CD8α ECD was ligated to the FAP ECD cDNA by overlap extension PCR, generating a fusion protein construct, FAPmCD8, similar in structure to the CD8α-CD40 ligand fusion protein, as described previously (12Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. McConnell F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were inserted into the pVL1393 vector. Control baculovirus containing only the CD8α ECD were also produced. Mutation of FAP cDNA (5Scanlan M.J. Mohan Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5657-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) to create the Ser624 → Ala mutant was performed by overlap extension PCR. The final construct was generated by restriction fragment exchange. All constructs were verified by sequencing both DNA strands. Transfection of Sf9 cells and amplification of the resulting recombinant baculovirus were performed as described (13O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The culture supernatant of High Five cells infected with recombinant FAPmCD8 baculovirus for 4 days was collected and cleared by ultracentrifugation, loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column, and eluted stepwise with 0.6 and 2.0 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Active fractions from the 2.0m eluate were pooled, concentrated using a YM-10 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and further purified on a 26/60 Superdex-200 gel filtration column. The identity of purified FAPmCD8 was confirmed by N-terminal gas phase sequencing, yielding the sequence QAPEL, which corresponds to amino acids 30–34 of murine CD8α. Extracts of FAP-expressing cells or control cells were prepared by solubilizing cells with extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-114). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (4.000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C and phase-partitioned at 37 °C for 10–20 min, followed by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 20 min at room temperature). The detergent phase was diluted with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.75% Empigen BB, and separated on concanavalin A-Sepharose, as described (14Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Ozer H.L. Schwab M. Albino A.P. Old L.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3327-3335PubMed Google Scholar). Concanavalin A-bound fractions were eluted with 1 mglucose (or 0.25 mmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 and 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were either analyzed immediately or stored frozen at −80 °C. Frozen samples of tumor or normal tissues (stored at −80 °C) were thawed on ice, diced with a scalpel, snap frozen in liquid N2, and pulverized with a mortar and pestle. Extraction buffer was added, and the resulting slurry was homogenized with an Ultorax homogenizer for about 1 min. Further processing of the samples was carried out as described above for the cell lines. Two quantitative assays for dipeptidyl peptidase activity were developed using Ala-Pro-AFC as the substrate. In the first assay format, membrane extracts (see above) were mixed with 5–10-fold volumes of reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris, pH 7.8), and added to an equal volume of 0.5 mmAla-Pro-AFC in reaction buffer followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Release of free AFC was measured in a Cytofluor fluorimeter (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) using the 395 nm excitation/530 nm emission filter set. For 4-methoxy-β-napthylamide-coupled substrates, a 355 nm excitation/404 nm emission filter set was used to measure 4-methoxy-β-napthylamide release. Enzyme kinetic parameters (Michaelis-Menten K m values) were calculated (15Yun S.L. Suelter C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 480: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using membrane extracts in this assay. In the second assay, FAP isolated from membrane extracts via an immunocapture step was tested for enzyme activity. Specifically, 96-well ELISA plates (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml F19 antibody or control antibody in PBS. In the case of FAPmCD8 (see below), plates were coated with F19 antibody as above or with 1 μg/ml rat anti-mouse CD8 overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then rinsed with wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), and excess binding sites were blocked with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking buffer was removed; membrane extracts or supernatants were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound material was removed, wells were washed thrice with wash buffer, and dipeptidyl peptidase activity was assayed using 100 μl of Ala-Pro-AFC (0.5 mmAla-Pro-AFC in reaction buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C. Background fluorescence (as measured using control antibody) was subtracted from each value. In control experiments, binding of antibody F19 to FAP did not detectably affect its dipeptidyl peptidase enzymatic activity. Zymography assays were performed essentially as described (16Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). For protease inhibitor analyses, samples were preincubated with the appropriate inhibitor for 15 min prior to addition of sample buffer. Gel incubation times were in the range of 50–60 h at 37 °C. Gelatinase activity was visualized as clear (unstained) areas of digested gelatin against a blue background following Coomassie Blue staining. Molecular mass standards run on the same gels, but under reducing conditions, were used to determine the apparent molecular masses of proteins with collagenase activity. Indirect ELISA assays were performed using 96-well F19-coated plates prepared as described above. IgG-coated plates were used as negative controls. All incubations were performed at room temperature. All wash buffers and antibody dilutions were made in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 plus 0.02% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). FAP isolated from membrane extracts was added in various dilutions, incubated for 1 h, and washed. Anti-FAP mAbs FB52 or F19 (1 μg/ml) were added, incubated for 1 h, and washed. Goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labeled IgG (0.1 μg/ml) was added for 1 h, and then plates were washed. Bound peroxidase-labeled antibody was detected using the substrate 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid according to manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Native human ECM proteins (1 μg of fibronectin, 1 μg of laminin, 1 μg of type IV collagen, or 1 μg of type I collagen) were incubated with cell membrane extracts (5 μg of protein) for 16 h at 37 °C. Trypsin (5 ng/sample) was used as a positive control for ECM protein degradation. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 1 min. Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Degradation of ECM proteins was visualized by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-fibronectin, rabbit anti-laminin, goat anti-type I collagen, or goat anti-type IV collagen antibodies, respectively (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and a color reaction with nitro blue tetrazalium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega, Madison WI). Cellulose diacetate membranes impregnated with Ala-Pro-AFC were obtained from Enzyme Systems (Dublin, CA). Samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, and proteins were allowed to renature in Tris-buffered saline (50 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2) for 15 min. The membrane was then placed in contact with the gel and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Areas of AFC release on the gel were visualized under ultraviolet light and photographed using a yellow filter (Sigma). FAP immunoprecipitates, isolated with mAb F19, were incubated with 0.5 mm14C-DFP or 0.01 mm3H-DFP for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 1 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed, as described (19Manteuffel R. Weber E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1983; 7: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was carried out using mAb F19 or negative control mouse IgG as described previously (3Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7235-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Tissues were taken from the collection of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. Indirect immunofluorescence on cytospin preparations and cytofluorometry of cell suspensions stained with mAb F19 or control IgG was performed on nonpermeabilized cells following published procedures (20Ryan D.H. Fallon M.A. Horan P.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 171: 125-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Beresford H.R. Oettgen H.F. Melamed M.R. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). First, transfection of the FAP-negative 293 cell line with an expression vector encoding full-length human FAP was used to generate stable clones (designated 293FAPwt) expressing cell surface, membrane-bound FAP protein. Cell surface expression was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining of cytospin preparations with the anti-FAP mAb F19 (Fig. 1, A and B), as well as cytofluorometric analysis of mAb F19-labeled, 293FAPwt unfixed cells (data not shown). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled 293FAPwt cell extracts with mAb F19 yielded the expected 93-kDa band upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C). Second, because previous reports indicated that cell surface FAP is expressed as a noncovalently linked, dimeric, type II integral membrane glycoprotein (14Rettig W.J. Garin-Chesa P. Healey J.H. Su S.L. Ozer H.L. Schwab M. Albino A.P. Old L.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3327-3335PubMed Google Scholar), a soluble FAP fusion protein was produced. The FAP fusion protein comprised the C-terminal 734 amino acids that constitute the entire ECD fused to the murine CD8α ECD. The murine CD8α ECD has been used in fusion constructs (12Lane P. Brocker T. Hubele S. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. McConnell F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) with other type II membrane proteins to provide a signal sequence for efficient secretion, to allow dimerization via CD8 interchain disulfide bonds, and to permit detection with commercially available anti-CD8 mAbs. The structure of the resulting FAPmCD8 construct is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 A. The FAPmCD8 fusion protein was expressed in culture supernatants of insect cells infected with FAPmCD8 recombinant baculovirus and purified using heparin Sepharose affinity chromatography, followed by size exclusion chromatography. The purified FAPmCD8 protein was detected on silver-stained SDS gels and revealed a 215-kDa species when analyzed in the absence of reducing agents (Fig. 2 B). Under reducing conditions, the FAPmCD8 protein migrates as a 115-kDa species on SDS gels. These size estimates are in close agreement with the predicted molecular mass of FAPmCD8 monomers (112 kDa) and dimers (224 kDa), following signal sequence cleavage. Moreover, purified FAPmCD8 is recognized in ELISA assays by anti-mCD8α mAbs as well as three different anti-FAP mAbs, directed against distinct FAP epitopes (data not shown). Finally, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of FAPmCD8 yielded the sequence QAPEL, corresponding to amino acids 30–34 of mCD8, confirming its identity.FIG. 2A, predicted structure of the FAPmCD8 fusion protein. B, silver-stained 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified FAPmCD8 fusion protein with and without reducing agents demonstrates its high degree of purity and the existence of the predicted disulfide bridge. Molecular masses are shown in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To define the biochemical function of FAP, the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the protein were first analyzed for dipeptidyl peptidase activity, because sequence similarity suggests that human FAP is most closely related to dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) (5Scanlan M.J. Mohan Raj B.K. Calvo B. Garin-Chesa P. Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Healey J.H. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5657-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka T. Camerini D. Seed B. Torimoto Y. Dang N.H. Kameoka J. Dahlberg H.N. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 481-486PubMed Google Scholar), a serine-type exopeptidase (23Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) specific for N-terminal Xaa-Pro sequences. Using a fluorogenic assay, we found that membrane extracts prepared from 293FAPwt cells specifically cleave a number of typical DPP-IV test substrates, including Ala-Pro-AFC (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, similarly prepared membrane extracts of the parental, FAP nonexpressor cell line 293 lack this dipeptidyl peptidase activity. Among the dipeptidyl peptidase substrates included in this study (Fig. 4), FAP shows a preference (± indicates 95% confidence intervals) for Ala-Pro-AFC (K m = 0.46 ± 0.04 mm) as compared with Lys-Pro-AFC (K m = 0.9 ± 0.24 mm) or Gly-Pro-AFC (K m = 1.15 ± 0.32 mm).FIG. 4Eadie-Hofstee plot comparing FAP dipeptidyl peptidase substrates. AFC-coupled peptides (Gly-Pro-AFC, Ala-Pro-AFC, and Lys-Pro-AFC) were incubated at 37 °C with FAP enzyme (1 ng) derived from membrane extracts of the 293FAPwt transfected cells. Release of free AFC from the peptides was measured in a fluorometer using the 390 nm excitation/538 nm emission filter set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the tests with 293FAPwt membrane extracts did not reveal whether FAP itself is a dipeptidyl peptidase or activates a latent dipeptidyl peptidase in 293 membrane extracts, further testing was carried out with the purified soluble FAPmCD8 fusion protein, which also possesses dipeptidyl peptidase activity (Fig. 3 A). Dipeptidyl peptidase activity is recovered from FAPmCD8-containing culture supernatants following mAb F19 immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE and is detected using gel overlay assays with Ala-Pro-AFC as a dipeptidyl peptidase substrate. The activity can be assigned to a 215-kDa protein species under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3 B). This molecular size is consistent with the predicted size of a FAPmCD8 dimer. The identification of synthetic substrates for the FAP peptidase activity, such as Ala-Pro-AFC, is useful in studying enzyme mechanisms and specificity. They do not, by themselves, lead to the physiological substrates for FAP enzyme activity that may be present in FAP-expressing organs and tissues, either during development or associated with specific disease processes. Thus, in an ongoing broad survey of candidate substrates, we tested FAP for its ability to cleave various ECM proteins. In initial tests with porcine gelatin, we found that the membrane extracts prepared from 293FAPwt cells contain a 170-kDa gelatinolytic activity not found in parental 293 cell extracts (Fig. 5 A, lane 293FAP). This gelatinolytic activity is mediated by FAP itself, rather than a latent gelatinase of 293 cells activated by FAP, because purified FAPmCD8 protein possesses a corresponding gelatinolytic activity. The FAPmCD8 gelatinolytic activity migrates in nonreducing SDS gels with an apparent molecular mass of ∼205 kDa, consistent with the higher molecular mass of the fusion protein (Fig. 5 B). As a specificity control, no FAP- directed cleavage of casein was seen in this assay format (data not shown). To compare dual enzymatic activities of FAP with those of its nearest known structural relative, DPP-IV, we tested purified DPP-IV protein (0.5 ng) for gelatinolytic activity. No DPP-IV gelatinolytic activity could be detected (Fig. 5 A, lane DPP-IV), although the DPP-IV preparation used still retained a powerful dipeptidyl peptidase activity in the overlay assay (Fig. 5 C,lane DPP-IV; 0.5 ng protein). In the same assay format, the dipeptidyl peptidase activity of FAP can be diluted out (Fig. 5 C, lane 293FAP; 7 μl of membrane extract), while still retaining activity in the gelatinolytic assay (Fig. 5 A, lane 293FAP; 7 μl membrane extract). Each enzyme retained either dipeptidyl peptidase activity (DPP-IV) or gelatinolytic activity (FAP) following SDS gel electrophoresis, demonstrating different substrate specificities for the two enzymes and ruling out the possibility that the two enzymes show different stabilities under the experimental conditions. A Western blot-coupled protease assay was used to examine whether FAP cleaves only gelatin (denatured collagen) or also native ECM proteins. Membrane-enriched fractions of 293FAPwt cell extracts and control 293 cell extracts were incubated with human fibronectin, laminin, and native collagens I and IV (Fig. 6). Immunoblotting with the relevant ECM protein-specific antibodies revealed specific degradation of type I collagen by FAP, visualized through disappearance of collagen bands (Fig. 6, top panel, lane 2).

Plant organelles were purified by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In purified intact peroxisomes a Ca2+-dependent NOS activity of 5.61 nmol ofl-[3H]citrulline mg−1 protein min−1 was measured while no activity was detected in mitochondria. The peroxisomal NOS activity was clearly inhibited (60–90%) by different well characterized inhibitors of mammalian NO synthases. The immunoblot analysis of peroxisomes with a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus region of murine iNOS revealed an immunoreactive protein of 130 kDa. Electron microscopy immunogold-labeling confirmed the subcellular localization of NOS in the matrix of peroxisomes as well as in chloroplasts. The presence of NOS in peroxisomes suggests that these oxidative organelles are a cellular source of nitric oxide (NO) and implies new roles for peroxisomes in the cellular signal transduction mechanisms.

Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the physiological importance of the free radical NO, numerous studies have been focused on the enzyme responsible for its endogenous production. Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion ofl-arginine to NO and citrulline in a complex reaction requiring molecular oxygen, calcium, calmodulin, FAD, FMN, and tetrahydrobiopterin (1Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). NOSs have been characterized as functional homodimers with a large subunit (≥130 kDa) that contain iron-protoporphyrin IX, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as prosthetic groups (1Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar, 2Knowles R.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3McMillan K. Salerno J.C. Masters S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 460-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three NOS isoforms have been identified in mammalian tissues: neuronal NOS (nNOS or type I), inducible NOS (iNOS or type II), and endothelial NOS (eNOS or type III). While types I and II are present in the soluble fraction, type III has been shown to be membrane-associated and none of the isoforms has a strict tissue-specific expression pattern (3McMillan K. Salerno J.C. Masters S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 460-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In organelles from animal systems, the presence of NOS activity has only been detected so far in mitochondria of rat liver (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In plants, several recent studies have shown that NO could function as a signal in disease resistance (5Leshem J.E.

Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). However, NOS-like activity has only been detected in plant extracts during the interaction ofRhyzobium-legume (9Cueto M.

Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 74: 393-398Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and in soybean cell suspensions induced with an elicitor from Pseudomonas syringae (8Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Very recently, the presence of NOS in the cytosol and nucleus of maize cells has been reported (11Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). But no information is available concerning the occurrence of NOS in other plant cell organelle. Peroxisomes are single-membrane bound organelles that contain catalase and H2O2-producing flavin oxidases as their basic enzymatic constituents, and are found in virtually all eukaryotic cell types (12Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore Jr., T.S.m. Plant Peroxisomes. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar, 13Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). A characteristic property of these oxidative organelles is their metabolic plasticity since their enzymatic content can vary depending on the organism, cell/tissue-type, and environmental conditions (13Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 14Mullen R.T. Trelease R. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 389-394Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In higher plants, peroxisomes contain a complex battery of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (15Sandalio L.M. Palma J.M. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Sci. 1987; 51: 1-8Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 16Corpas F.J. Sandalio L.M. del Rı́o L.A. Trelease R.N. New Phytol. 1998; 138: 307-314Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the components of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (17Jiménez A. Hernández J.A. del Rı́o L.A. Sevilla F. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and the NADP-dehydrogenases of the pentose-phosphate pathway (18Corpas F.J. Barroso J.B. Sandalio L.M. Distefano S. Palma J.M. Lupiáñez J.A. del Rı́o L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Likewise, the generation of superoxide radicals has also been reported in the matrices and membranes of peroxisomes (19Sandalio L.M. Fernández V.M. Rupérez F.L. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20López-Huertas E. Sandalio L.M. Gómez M. del Rı́o L.A.

J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All these findings evidence a relevant role for peroxisomes in the cellular metabolism of activated oxygen species (22del Rı́o L.A. Sandalio L.M. Corpas F.J. López-Huertas E. Palma J.M. Pastori G.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 673-680Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the presence of NOS in peroxisomes (perNOS) of pea leaves using four complementary approaches: (i) distribution of NOS activity in cell organelle fractions purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, (ii) sensitivity of NOS activity to well characterized NOS inhibitors, (iii) cross-reactivity of peroxisomes on Western blot with antibodies against iNOS, and (iv) electron microscopy immunocytochemical analysis of intact plant tissue. Pea (Pisum sativum L., cv. Lincoln) seeds, obtained from Royal Sluis (Enkhuizen, Holland), were surface-sterilized with 3% (v/v) commercial bleaching solution for 3 min, and then were washed with distilled water, and germinated in vermiculite for 15 days. Healthy and vigorous seedlings were selected and grown in the greenhouse in nutrient solutions under optimum conditions (23del Rı́o L.A. Sandalio L.M. Yáñez J. Gómez M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1985; 24: 25-34Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for 15 days. All operations were performed at 0 to 4 °C. Peroxisomes were purified from pea leaves by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (35–60%, w/w) as described by López-Huertas et al. (24López-Huertas E. Sandalio L.M. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 295-302Google Scholar). Purified peroxisomes were practically free of chloroplasts and mitochondria, as confirmed by measuring the activities of the appropriate marker enzymes (24López-Huertas E. Sandalio L.M. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 295-302Google Scholar, 25Distefano S. Palma J.M. Gómez M. del Rı́o L.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was assayed as described by Aebi (26Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18681) Google Scholar) and fumarase activity was measured by the method of Walk and Hock (27Walk R. Hock B. Planta. 1977; 134: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NO synthase activity was determined by monitoring the conversion ofl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline (28Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The assays for total NOS activity were performed in duplicate for each sample for 20 min at 37 °C in a reaction medium containing 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm CHAPS, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm β-NADPH, 10 μm FAD, 10 μm FMN, 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), variable amounts of protein samples, and a variable concentration of l-arginine supplemented with l-[3H]arginine (1.0 mCi ml−1) in a total volume of 220 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1.5 ml of a cation exchange resin (Dowex 50W, 8% cross-linkage, 200–400 mesh, Na+ form) at 4 °C which stops the reaction by removing the arginine substrate. Then, 5 ml of water was added and the resin was allowed to settle for approximately 10 min before aspirating 3.5 ml of supernatant which was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The level ofl-[3H]citrulline was computed after subtracting the blank value, which represented the nonspecific radioactivity in the absence of enzyme. In addition, the values obtained in the experiments performed in the absence of NADPH, which indicate the amount of l-[3H]citrulline formation independent of a specific NOS activity, were also subtracted from the total level of l-citrulline. The activity was expressed as picomole of l-[3H]citrulline min−1 mg−1 protein. Protein levels were determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The density of the gradient fractions was calculated at room temperature using an Atago refractometer. Two antibodies have been used in this study. A monoclonal antibody against the NADPH-binding region (residues 961 to 1144) of iNOS from mouse macrophage (Transduction Lab, Lexington, KY) and a polyclonal antibody against the peptide PT387 (Ac-Cys-(residues 1131 to 1144)) from the C terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of murine iNOS (30Uttenthal L.O. Alonso D. Fernández A.P. Campbell R.O. Moro M.A. Leza J.C. Lizasoain I. Esteban F.J. Barroso J.B. Valderrama R. Pedrosa J.A. Peinado M.A. Serrano J. Richart A. Bentura M.L. Santacana M. Martı́nez-Murillo R. Rodrigo J. Microsc. Res. Techn. 1998; 43: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 7.5% acrylamide slab gels. Samples were prepared in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, and were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. For immunoblot analyses, polypeptides were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Semi-Dry Transfer System (Bio-Rad) with 10 mm CAPS buffer, 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 11.0, at 1.5 mA cm−2 for 2 h (31Corpas F.J. Bunkelmann J. Trelease R.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 280-290PubMed Google Scholar). For slot blot studies, proteins were also transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Bio-Dot SF Apparatus (Bio-Rad) following the instructions of the manufacturer. For immunodetections, the two antibodies against iNOS were used with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL-PLUS, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were detected with a photographic film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pea leaf segments of approximately 1 mm2 were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin as described by Corpas and co-workers (31Corpas F.J. Bunkelmann J. Trelease R.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 280-290PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were incubated for 3 h with IgG against iNOS (30Uttenthal L.O. Alonso D. Fernández A.P. Campbell R.O. Moro M.A. Leza J.C. Lizasoain I. Esteban F.J. Barroso J.B. Valderrama R. Pedrosa J.A. Peinado M.A. Serrano J. Richart A. Bentura M.L. Santacana M. Martı́nez-Murillo R. Rodrigo J. Microsc. Res.

The sections were then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15-nm gold particles (Bio Cell) diluted 1/50 in TBST plus 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Sections were poststained in 2% (v/v) uranyl acetate for 3 min and examined in a Zeiss EM 10C transmission electron microscope. Preimmune serum, instead of the iNOS antibody, was used as control. A second control was used omitting the primary antibody. The purification of peroxisomes from pea leaves by sucrose density gradient centrifugation is shown in Fig. 1. Peroxisomes (fractions 20–25) were identified by the peak of catalase activity, used as peroxisomal marker enzyme. The peroxisomal fraction banded at an average equilibrium density of 1.24 g cm−3, characteristic for these intact organelles in sucrose solutions (12Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore Jr., T.S.m. Plant Peroxisomes. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar, 24López-Huertas E. Sandalio L.M. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 295-302Google Scholar). The absence of fumarase activity in these fractions indicated that peroxisomes were essentially free of contamination by mitochondria. The assay of NOS activity throughout the gradient fractions showed a peak of activity in the top of the sucrose gradient (fractions 1–3), corresponding to the zone of broken organelles, and another NOS peak in the peroxisomal fractions (fractions 21–25). A maximum NOS activity of 170 pmol ofl-[3H]citrulline min−1mg−1 protein was found in the peroxisomal fraction 23 which coincided with the maximum of catalase activity. The NOS activity of peroxisomes, measured as production ofl-[3H]citrulline, showed a linear increase with the amount of peroxisomal protein (data not shown). The specific activity of the peroxisomal NOS was reduced more than 70% in the absence of calcium (Table I) and was strictly dependent on NADPH.Table IEffect of calcium on the NOS activity of pea leaf peroxisomesSamplesNOS specific activitynmol of l-[3 H]citrulline mg −1 protein min −1Peroxisomes+ Ca2+ + NADPH5.61 ± 0.54− Ca2+ + EGTA1.49 ± 0.12Peroxisomes + Ca2+− NADPH0 Open table in a new tab The effect on the peroxisomal NOS activity of seven well characterized inhibitors of the three known mammalian NO synthases is shown in Table II.

When the NOS assays were performed using a 100 μml-Arg concentration, a reversion of about 30% of the inhibitory effect of 7-nitroindazole, l-NMMA, and l-NAME was observed (results not given). However, the inhibitory effect of aminoguanidine, which is an irreversible iNOS inhibitor, was not affected by 100 μml-Arg. The NOS activity was not sensitive to d-NAME, an enantiomer ofl-NAME, which is used as a negative control.Table IIEffect of different inhibitors on the NOS activity of pea leaf peroxisomesInhibitor (1 mm)Inhibitory actionInhibition%AminoguanidineIrreversible inhibitor of iNOS100l-NMMANon-selective inhibitor88l-NAMENon-selective inhibitor90ThiocitrullineInhibitor of nNOS > iNOS807-NitroindazoleCompetitive inhibitor of nNOS > eNOS59DiphenyliodoniumNon-selective inhibitor60l-N5-(1-Imenoethyl)-ornithineInhibitor of eNOS59d-NAMEEnantiomer ofl-NAME2 Open table in a new tab The analysis by slot blot of both pea leaf crude extracts and pea leaf peroxisomal fractions with a monoclonal antibody against mouse macrophage NOS (iNOS) gave a positive reaction (Fig. 2, panel A). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of the peroxisomal fractions using the polyclonal antibody against the peptide PT387 from the C terminus of the murine iNOS revealed an immunoreactive polypeptide of about 130 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Immunoreactive bands with similar mobility were obtained with the hepatic iNOS from lipopolysaccharide-induced rat and murine macrophage lysates (Transduction Lab, Lexington, KY) used as positive controls (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3). The assay of the NOS activity after incubation of the peroxisomal fractions with the murine iNOS antibody, showed an inhibition of about 90% with a 1/200 dilution of this antibody (Fig. 3), and no inhibition was observed with a dilution of 1/100,000.FIG. 3Effect of an antibody against iNOS on the perNOS activity. Peroxisomal fractions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with different dilutions of the antibody against murine iNOS. Then, the NOS activity of samples was assayed using 1 mm Arg concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ultrastructural immunolocalization of NOS with the antibody against murine iNOS showed that gold particles were localized inside two cell compartments, peroxisomes and chloroplasts, while no labeling was observed inside mitochondria (Fig. 4,panels B and C). No significant labeling was observed in the controls (Fig. 4, panel A). In higher plants, recent data have shown that exogenous nitric oxide has an important role as messenger in resistance against diseases produced by plant pathogens (6Noritake T. Kawakita K. Doke K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 113-116Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 8Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 32Dangl J. Nature. 1998; 394: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and several groups have detected NOS activity in plant extracts (8Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 9Cueto M. Hernández-Perera O. Martin R. Bentura M.L. Rodrigo J. Lamas S. Golvano M.P.

Considering that plant peroxisomes have a role in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (22del Rı́o L.A. Sandalio L.M. Corpas F.J. López-Huertas E. Palma J.M. Pastori G.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 673-680Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and are also a source of H2O2 which may function as a second messenger (33Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixo R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar, 34Shirasu K. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Immunology. 1996; 8: 3-7Google Scholar, 35Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), the potential presence of NOS in peroxisomes was examined. The first approach was to study the distribution of NOS activity throughout the sucrose density gradient fractions. Two peaks ofl-[3H]citrulline production were detected in the gradient fractions. One peak was in the top of the gradient, and corresponded to the broken organelles, and another peak of NOS activity was observed in the peroxisomal fractions. The peroxisomal NOS activity, measured as l-citrulline production, was protein- and calcium-dependent (Table I). As part of the initial characterization of the NOS activity of leaf peroxisomes, the effect of seven archetype NOS inhibitors, including specific and unspecific inhibitors of different types of NOS isoforms was assayed. The results indicated a clear inhibition of the perNOS activity of 59–100%, being the l-aminoguanidine the most effective inhibitor. In extracts of maize seedlings a 31% inhibition of NOS activity by 3 mml-aminoguanidine plus 3 mml-NAME was reported (11Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and in extracts of lupin roots a 50% inhibition of NOS activity by 1 mml-NMMA was described (9Cueto M. Hernández-Perera O. Martin R. Bentura M.L. Rodrigo J. Lamas S. Golvano M.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the specific activity reported by these authors is much lower (0.2 and 0.7 pmol ofl-citrulline mg−1 protein min−1, respectively) than that obtained in pea leaf peroxisomes (5.6 nmol ofl-citrulline mg−1 protein · min−1). Likewise, in this work the production of citrulline was specifically due to a NOS because an specific antibody against iNOS inhibited this reaction by more than 80% (Fig. 3). The NOS activities described in crude extracts of roots ofLupinus albus (9Cueto M. Hernández-Perera O. Martin R. Bentura M.L. Rodrigo J. Lamas S. Golvano M.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), soybean cell suspensions (8Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar), and maize seedlings (11Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were calcium-dependent, moderately sensitive to inhibitors, and were mainly found in the soluble fractions. In pea leaves, the perNOS was also calcium-dependent but was clearly sensitive to inhibitors of iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS. Nevertheless, none of the NOS activities detected so far in plants have been found identical to the NOS isoforms present in mammals, indicating that plant NOSs could be slightly different from the known NOS isoforms of mammals. To get deeper insights into the presence of NOS activity in pea leaf peroxisomes, two immunological approaches were used, with two types of antibodies against NOS being assayed. The commercial monoclonal antibody against the NADPH-binding region of murine iNOS (a highly conserved region among the three known mammalian NOSs) gave an immunoreactive band with the peroxisomal fraction. Similar results have been obtained in extracts from maize tissues using the same antibody (11Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, this region also shares a high degree of identity with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (36Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glat C.E. Lowestein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the cross-reactivity observed is due to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases, a polyclonal antibody against 14 residues from the C terminus of iNOS which are absent in the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases, was used. This type of anti-peptide antibodies provide powerful tools to discriminate among proteins with a high degree of homology but with differences in other regions of the sequence (37Riveros-Moreno V. Beddell C. Moncada S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this way, an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa was detected, which is in the same molecular mass range described for most iNOS (38Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J.

In maize seedlings extracts, an immunoreactive protein band of approximately 166 kDa was detected using a commercial monoclonal antibody against mouse macrophage iNOS (11Ribeiro E.A. Cunha F.Q. Tamashiro W.M.S.C. Martins I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The electron microscopy immunolocalization of NOS demonstrated the presence of the enzyme in the matrix of peroxisomes and also in chloroplasts. However, no immunogold labeling of NOS was detected in mitochondria. This contrasts with results obtained in mammalian tissues where a NOS was found in mitochondria isolated from rat liver (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) which was characterized as a new isoform (mtNOS) (43Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The mtNOS from rat liver is similar to the inducible form (iNOS) but is constitutively expressed and bound to the mitochondrial membrane (4Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The presence of NOS in peroxisomes suggests an interaction of this enzyme with other components of the metabolism of activated oxygen species of leaf peroxisomes. An important point is that the NADP-dehydrogenases, recently found in the peroxisomal matrix (18Corpas F.J. Barroso J.B. Sandalio L.M. Distefano S. Palma J.M. Lupiáñez J.A. del Rı́o L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), could provide the necessary NADPH for the perNOS reaction. But on the basis of the recent results of Sakuma and co-workers (44Sakuma S. Fujimoto Y. Sakamoto Y. Uchiyama T. Yoshioka K. Nishida H. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a potential function of NO inside peroxisomes can be proposed. NO could react with O2 radicals generated in the peroxisomal matrix by xanthine oxidase (19Sandalio L.M. Fernández V.M. Rupérez F.L. del Rı́o L.A. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite which, according to Sakuma et al. (44Sakuma S. Fujimoto Y. Sakamoto Y. Uchiyama T. Yoshioka K. Nishida H. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) could regulate the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase into the superoxide-generating xanthine oxidase. On the other hand, NO could also diffuse through the peroxisomal membrane, reacting with O2 produced in the cytosolic side of the membrane by a small electron transport chain (22del Rı́o L.A. Sandalio L.M. Corpas F.J. López-Huertas E. Palma J.M. Pastori G.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 104: 673-680Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), thus generating the oxidant peroxynitrite in the cytosol. Likewise, the NO diffused into the cytosol could also function as a cellular transduction signal, as it has been described for H2O2 (33Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixo R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar, 34Shirasu K. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Immunology. 1996; 8: 3-7Google Scholar, 35Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In summary, the biochemical, immunological, and immunocytochemical data reported in this work provide evidence that peroxisomes contain nitric-oxide synthase activity (perNOS) which is calcium-dependent, constitutively expressed, and immunorelated with the mammalian iNOS. The occurrence in peroxisomes of a NOS suggests that these organelles are a cellular source of NO and implies new roles for peroxisomes in the cellular signal transduction mechanisms. We are grateful to Prof. José Rodrigo for generous donation of the antibody against iNOS. The Center of Scientific Instrumentation, University of Granada, is also acknowledged for technical assistance in electron microscopic analyses."

Half-maximal stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 was observed at 10–11 nm ExoS(1–234), respectively. We identified arginine 146 of ExoS to be essential for the stimulation of GTPase activity of Rho proteins. These data identify ExoS as a GTPase-activating protein for Rho GTPases.

A massive production of free polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) hydroperoxides dependent on a 9-lipoxygenase (LOX) activity was characterized during the development of leaf necrosis. The process occurred after a lag phase of 12 h, was accompanied by the concomitant increase of 9-LOX activity, and preceded by a transient accumulation of LOX transcripts. Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation represented 10% of the process. Inhibition and activation of the LOX pathway was shown to inhibit or to activate cell death, and evidence was provided that fatty acid hydroperoxides are able to mimic leaf necrotic symptoms. Within 24 h, about 50% of leaf PUFAs were consumed, chloroplast lipids being the major source of PUFAs. The results minimize the direct participation of active oxygen species from the oxidative burst in membrane lipid peroxidation. They suggest, furthermore, the involvement of lipase activity to provide the free PUFA substrates for LOX.

The collapse of challenged cells, occurring during incompatible interactions, was shown in most cases to be dependent on a gene for gene plant pathogen interaction (1Greenberg J.T. Annu. Rev.

HR is accompanied by a battery of defense mechanisms including de novo synthesis of antimicrobial enzymes and metabolites, strengthening of the cell wall, and the onset of systemic acquired resistance dependent on salicylic acid accumulation (3Bowles D.J.

HR often leads to dry lesions that are supposed to limit pathogen growth. Other proposed roles is the release in apoplasm of defense-related proteins and toxic metabolites, as well as of signals that activate the defenses of both neighboring and distant cells. Hypersensitive cell death appears to not be the result of the direct action of released pathogenic factors but is rather under the genetic control of the host. Indeed, several observations underline that HR is an example of PCD in plants (1Greenberg J.T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

(Paris). 1998; 321: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Some differences between HR and mammalian apoptosis were observed, however, such as changes in DNA laddering (5Mittler R. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1951-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Mittler R. Simon L. Lam E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1333-1344PubMed Google Scholar) and the lack in HR of the repressor role of Bcl-x L (12Mittler R. Shulaev V. Seskar M. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1991-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One ultimate characteristic of HR is the loss of membrane integrity, and thus HR is often characterized by an associated electrolyte leakage (5Mittler R. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1951-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Pike S.M. Adam A.L. Pu X.A. Hoyos M.E. Laby R. Beer S.V. Novacky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1998; 53: 39-60Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This feature is not encountered in mammalian apoptosis but is one characteristic of the catastrophic cell death called necrosis, which is not dependent on gene activation (14Malcomson R.D.G. Oram S.H. Harrison D.J. Biologicals. 1996; 24: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this way, the use of the term “necrosis” assumes different meanings when referring to mammalian cell death or to pathogen-associated plant cell death. Membrane damage during HR is in close correlation with lipid peroxide production and with AOS generation (12Mittler R. Shulaev V. Seskar M. Lam E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1991-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Adam A. Farkas T. Somlyai G. Hevesi M. Kiraly Z. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 13-26Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16May M.J. Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D.G. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1996; 110: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Rustérucci C. Blein J.-P. Stallaert V. Ducruet J.-M. Pugin A. Ricci P. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1996; 111: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). AOS can initiate lipid peroxidation in membranes by fatty acid free radical production, and the process can be propagated by autoxidation (18Porter N.A. Caldwell S.A. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The generation of AOS during the oxidative burst is an important early event during the course of plant-pathogen interactions and is well documented (19Doke N. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 785-813Google Scholar, 20Wojtaszek P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In the HR, lipid peroxidation is often a late process occurring at the same time as the appearance of necrosis. Since AOS production preceded lipid peroxidation, it is generally admitted that AOS are implicated in the initiation of membrane damage, and hence hypersensitive cell death. Indeed, inhibition of oxidative burst by exogenous supplied enzymes, scavengers, or inhibitors of AOS generator systems suppresses or delays both lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive cell death (15Adam A. Farkas T. Somlyai G. Hevesi M. Kiraly Z. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 13-26Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Doke N. Ohashi Y. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1988; 32: 163-175Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Tenhaken R. Levine A. Brisson L.F. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 23Jabs T. Dietrich R.A. Dangl J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 1853-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation might also be due to LOX (EC 1.13.11.12) activity (24Hildebrand D.F. Physiol. Plant. (Rockv.). 1989; 76: 249-253Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 25Rosahl S. Z. Naturforsh. 1996; 51: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Initiation of HR membrane damage by LOXs has been suggested as an alternative hypothesis to free radical action, and the process might be propagated by autoxidation (26Croft K.P.C. Voisey C.R. Slusarenko A.J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1990; 36: 49-62Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Kondo Y. Kawai Y. Hayashi T. Ohnishi M. Miyazawa T. Itoh S. Mizutani J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, induction of LOX activity has been observed in several plants during incompatible interaction and occurs after a lag phase of few hours (28Slusarenko A.J. Piazza G. Lipoxygenase and Lipoxygenase Pathway Enzymes. AOCS Press, Champaign, IL1996: 176-197Crossref Google Scholar). The observation that an incompatible interaction can be suppressed in transgenic tobacco plants expressing antisense LOX clearly demonstrates the role of LOX in plant resistance to pathogens (29Rancé I. Fournier J. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6554-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Finally, since (i) the LOX pathway leads to products, such as hydroperoxides, alkenals, and aldehydes, that may kill plant cells and pathogen (30Farmer E.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,31Farmer E.E. Weber H. Vollenweider S. Planta. 1998; 206: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and (ii) HR triggering is an example of PCD, the induction of a LOX pathway could be considered as an active process of membrane degradation leading to plant cell death. Thus, it is not clear at present whether lipid peroxidation during HR is induced by AOS and free radicals or is the result of a LOX action. Both mechanisms could operate in parallel or be exclusive. Furthermore, the question of whether membrane lipid peroxidation induces cell death or is the consequence of cell death is still open. The HR induced in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves by cryptogein, a purified protein from the fungus Phytophthora cryptogea (32Ricci P. Bonnet P. Huet J.-C. Sallantin M. Beauvais-Cante F. Bruneteau M. Billard V. Michel G. Pernollet J.-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), was investigated in this work. Cryptogein leads also to defense gene activation (33Suty L. Petitot A.-S. Lecourieux D. Blein J.-P. Pugin A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 443-451Google Scholar) and systemic acquired resistance (34Bonnet P. Bourdon E. Ponchet M. Blein J.-P. Ricci P. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 1996; 102: 181-192Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Features of PCD were observed, as assessed by plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and cytoplasmic condensation (6Levine A. Pennell R.I. Alvarez M.E. Palmer R. Lamb C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and the expression of hsr 203J, a gene proposed as the hallmark of HR-inducing pathogens or elicitors (35Pontier D. Tronchet M. Rogowsky P. Lam E. Roby D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On tobacco cells cryptogein induces an early oxidative burst (36Simon-Plas F. Rustérucci C. Milat M.-L. Humbert C. Montillet J.-L. Blein J.-P. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 1573-1579Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and late LOX activity (37Bottin A. Véronési C. Pontier D. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Blein J.-P. Rustérucci C. Ricci P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 32: 373-378Google Scholar). An early AOS production was also characterized on leaves (38Allan A.C. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The AOS production and lipid peroxidation induced by cryptogein are in close correlation with the intensity of necrosis (17Rustérucci C. Blein J.-P. Stallaert V. Ducruet J.-M. Pugin A. Ricci P. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1996; 111: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Applied to detached leaves cryptogein causes total leaf necrosis, and this model appears perfectly suited to biochemical analyses of necrotic associated processes. Molecular insights on the peroxidation regiospecificity and enantioselectivity of PUFAs were expected to discriminate between a free radical mediated process, or a LOX pathway, i.e.nonspecific versus specific peroxidation, respectively. Thus, lipid peroxidation was analyzed in the present work using a previously established hydroxy fatty acid HPLC assay (39Degousée N. Triantaphylidès C. Montillet J.-L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1994; 104: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and was further investigated by chiral phase HPLC (40Feussner I. Balkenhohl T.J. Porzel A. Kühn H. Wasternack C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21635-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated the involvement of an induced 9-LOX-dependent lipid peroxidation pathway using free fatty acids as substrates. Evidence was provided that PUFA hydroperoxides are responsible for tissue necrosis. The activation of the LOX pathway, leading to a massive production of fatty acid hydroperoxides from membrane lipids, appears as being an active process in plant-hypersensitive cell death. The involvement of this pathway to pathogen growth limitation is also discussed. Cryptogein, prepared according to Bonnet et al. (34Bonnet P. Bourdon E. Ponchet M. Blein J.-P. Ricci P. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 1996; 102: 181-192Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was provided by M. Ponchet (INRA, Antibes, France). PUFAs and fatty acid standards were purchased from Fluka (Büchs) or Sigma and MeJA from TCI (Interchim, Montluçon, France). The hydroxy fatty acid chromatographic standards have been previously described (41Degousée N. Triantaphylidès C. Starek S. Iacazio G. Martini D. Bladier C. Voisine R. Montillet J.-L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, 15-HEDE, used as an internal standard for HPLC quantification, was prepared from eicosadienoic acid, according to the previously described procedure (42Martini D. Iacazio G. Ferrand D. Buono G. Triantaphylidès C. Biocatalysis. 1994; 11: 47-63Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the chemical structure was assessed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. An enriched fraction containing 16:3 (16:3/18:3/18:2 composition 37/56/7) was prepared from parsley leaf lipid extract, by TLC and galactolipid hydrolysis, as described below. Tobacco plants (N. tabacum var. Petit Havana) were grown for 8 to 9 weeks in a greenhouse, at 100–120 μmol/m2·s light radiance (HQI-BT 400 watts-D OSRAM lamps, München, Germany), with a 14/10 h, 25/20 °C light/dark cycle and 60% relative humidity. Leaves (about 5 g) were selected in the middle of the stem, detached, and treated with 10 μl of an aqueous solution of cryptogein (0.2 μg/μl) or water for control, as described previously (17Rustérucci C. Blein J.-P. Stallaert V. Ducruet J.-M. Pugin A. Ricci P. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1996; 111: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For MeJA treatment, tobacco plants were placed into an airtight 25-liter chamber for 5 days, and MeJA (5 μl) was applied on a piece of filter paper (43Avdiushko S. Croft K.P.C. Brown G.C. Jackson D.M. Hamilton-Kemp T.R. Hildebrand D. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1995; 109: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chemicals, in a 0.5% Tween 80 aqueous solution, were infiltrated between two secondary leaf veins, applying the syringe tip to the epidermis of excised leaves. Leaf petioles were then dipped into water and the leaves kept in the dark at room temperature. Necrosis was assessed from changes with time of leaf water content, and expressed as % of initial FW. Free and bonded hydroxy and hydroperoxy fatty acids were analyzed by HPLC as free hydroxy fatty acids, after NaBH4 reduction and hydrolysis. Tobacco leaves (2.5 g) were homogenized in 0.2n NaOH, 5% (w/v) NaBH4, in the presence of the internal reference 15-HEDE (100 nmol/g FW). The samples were frozen and stored at −20 °C. Extraction was carried out, as described previously (39Degousée N. Triantaphylidès C. Montillet J.-L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1994; 104: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the extract (50 μl) was submitted to straight phase HPLC (Waters, Millipore, St. Quentin-Yvelines, France) using a Zorbax rx-SIL column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size, Hewlett-Packard, Les Ullis, France), isocratic elution with 70/30/0.25 (v/v/v) hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and UV detection at 234 nm. Hydroxy fatty acid isomers were identified using standards (41Degousée N. Triantaphylidès C. Starek S. Iacazio G. Martini D. Bladier C. Voisine R. Montillet J.-L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed with reference to 15-HEDE, assuming that all hydroxy fatty acids have the same extinction coefficient at 234 nm. For the enantiomer composition analysis, chromatographic peaks were collected from straight phase HPLC and submitted to chiral phase HPLC, using a Chiralcel OD column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, Diacel Chemical Industries, Interchim, France), with a mobile phase of 95/5/0.1 (v/v/v) hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and UV detection at 234 nm (40Feussner I. Balkenhohl T.J. Porzel A. Kühn H. Wasternack C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21635-21642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the analysis of free hydroperoxide and hydroxy fatty acids, tobacco leaf tissue (2.5 g) was ground at 4 °C in 6 ml of 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 1 mm both deferoxamine mesylate and ortho-phenanthroline, as transition metal chelators, and 10 ml of 50/50 (v/v) chloroform/methanol with 2 mm triphenyl phosphine, as reducing agent, and in the presence of 15-HEDE (100 nmol/g FW). The organic phase was recovered by centrifugation at 700 ×g for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was further extracted with 5 ml of chloroform. Both organic phases were pooled before vacuum evaporation of the solvent without drying. Then, 2 × 10 ml of 70/30 (v/v) hexane/ethyl ether was added and evaporated again to eliminate chloroform. The residue was applied onto a silica Sep-Pak cartridge column (Millipore, St. Quentin-Yvelines, France), previously equilibrated with 70/30 (v/v) hexane/ethyl ether. Product elution was carried out successively with 1 ml of 70/30/0.1 (v/v/v) hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid and 10 ml of 70/30/1 (v/v/v) hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid. The first 1 ml was discarded and the next volume recovered, evaporated to 800 μl, and analyzed by straight phase HPLC as described above. In order to assess for free fatty acid hydroperoxides, a second extraction of the same sample was carried out in parallel in which triphenyl phosphine was omitted in the extraction buffer. The extraction procedure and HPLC analysis was the same as above and led to the separation of both free hydroperoxide and hydroxy fatty acids. The overall fatty acid composition of tobacco leaf sample (80 mg FW) was determined according to Miquel and Browse (44Miquel M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas phase chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II, Les Ullis, France) on a 15-meter × 0.53-mm Carbowax column (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) with flame ionization detection. The oven temperature was programmed for 1 min at 160 °C, followed by a 20 °C/min ramp to 190 °C and a second ramp of 5 °C/min to 210 °C, and maintained at 210 °C for a further 5 min. The methyl ester fatty acid peaks were quantified and identified by comparison of their retention times with those of standards. Data are expressed in nmol/mg DW. For individual lipid analysis, tobacco leaves (0.5 g) were ground under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. The tissue sample was transferred into a screw-capped centrifuge tube with 6 ml of 10/10/1 (v/v/v) chloroform/methanol/formic acid and stored overnight at −20 °C. After centrifugation (2,000 × g, 5 min), the supernatant was collected and the tissue pellet re-extracted with 2.2 ml of 5/5/1 (v/v/v) chloroform/methanol/water. Both extracts were combined and washed with 3 ml of 0.2 mH3PO4, 1 m KCl. Lipids were recovered in the chloroform phase, dried under N2, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2/1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol. Individual lipids were purified from the extracts by monodimensional TLC using either 25/25/25/10/9 (v/v/v/v/v) chloroform/methyl acetate/n-propyl alcohol/0.25% aqueous KCl (w/v) for polar lipids or 90/15/2 (v/v/v) hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid for neutral lipids. Lipids were then located by spraying the plates with a solution of 0.001% (w/v) primuline in 80% acetone, followed by visualization under UV light. The silica gel zones corresponding to individual lipids were scraped from the plates, and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and analyzed as described above. Frozen leaf tissue (2 g) was ground in ice-cold 100 mm, pH 6, sodium phosphate buffer (4 ml), containing 2% (w/v) of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone, and a protease inhibitor mixture (½-tablet for 4 ml of buffer, Roche Molecular Biochemicals CompleteTM). The mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. This crude extract was used for the LOX assay and protein quantification. The enzyme extract (0.5 ml) was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, with 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at a final volume of 1.5 ml, and 5 μl of 18:2 (0.1 m) in ethanol. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 1n NaOH and 500 μl of 5% (w/v) NaBH4 in 0.2n NaOH. After addition of the internal reference (100 nmol of 15-HEDE), hydroxy fatty acids were extracted in 1.5 ml of 70/30 (v/v) hexane/diethyl ether and analyzed by straight phase HPLC and chiral phase as above. Protein content was determined using Pierce BCA protein assay reagent, following the enhanced protocol of the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Total RNA fraction was extracted from control and treated leaves at various times. RNA extraction was performed using the Plant RNA easy minikit, and poly(A)+ RNA extraction was carried out using an Oligotex mRNA kit (both from Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. The LOX-specific probe was prepared by RACE amplification using the MarathonTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Ozyme, St. Quentin-Yvelines, France) with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from tobacco cells treated with cryptogein for 60 min. The two primers used for the 5′-RACE reactions were a gene-specific primer deduced from the sequence of the LOX1 of N. tabacum (45Véronési C. Fournier J. Rickauer M. Marolda M. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1995; 108: 1342Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number X84040), 5′-GAGGAGTAGCTGTTGAGGACTGGAGCTCCC-3′ (30-mers), and a primer corresponding to the Marathon adapter 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ (27-mers). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA were reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase using (T)30-NN as primer. The second strand performed with a mixture of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli DNA ligase was monitored by addition of [32P]dCTP. Following the creation of blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase, the double strand cDNA was ligated to the Marathon cDNA-Adapter. The 5′-RACE reaction was performed on this cDNA population with the ExpandTM Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 cycles using the following steps: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel in TAE buffer. One unique band of almost 1 kilobase pair was extracted from the gel and cloned in pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France). Fluorescent sequencing was done by Genome Express S.A. (Grenoble, France) using SP6 as the downstream primer and a custom-designed primer as the upstream primer. Sequence analysis were carried out with FASTA, NCBI, and the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, WI). The obtained sequence (998 base pairs) showed 98% identity with the tobacco LOX1. This cDNA was used as specific LOX probe for RNA analysis. Northern blots were carried out according to standard protocols using 15 μg of total RNA per lane. After electrophoresis, RNA samples were transferred and UV cross-linked to Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out with the specific LOX cDNA, 32P-labeled by random priming (rediprime, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 42 °C overnight as described previously (33Suty L. Petitot A.-S. Lecourieux D. Blein J.-P. Pugin A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 443-451Google Scholar). Filters were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 4 × 10 min, then with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C 2 × 10 min, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Les Bordes, France). Lipid peroxidation was investigated in tobacco leaves using straight phase HPLC analysis of hydroxy fatty acids obtained after NaBH4 reductive extraction and NaOH hydrolysis of total lipids (39Degousée N. Triantaphylidès C. Montillet J.-L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1994; 104: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Typical chromatograms of hydroxy fatty acids extracted from control leaves and cryptogein-treated leaves, when necrotic areas appeared, are described in Fig. 1 A. All positional isomers of 18:2 and 18:3 hydroxy fatty acids were separated and the chromatographic peaks attributed. From our experiments, 16:3 represents in tobacco leaves about 15% of total fatty acids (see below), and the occurrence of corresponding hydroxy fatty acids was investigated. Two isomers were enzymatically prepared and identified (see legend of Fig. 1), but they were not detected either in control or elicited leaf extracts. Therefore the 16:3 hydroxy fatty acids were not investigated further. In control leaves, the level of hydroxy fatty acids is low with a preeminence for 13-HODE and 13-HOTE. In cryptogein-treated leaves, lipid peroxidation increased markedly, as observed on all 18:2 and 18:3 positional isomers, the major isomers being 9-HODE and 9-HOTE. Since 9- or 13-LOX were characterized in plants, positional 9 and 13 isomers can arise from either LOX activity or autoxidation, whereas 12-HOTE and 16-HOTE can be considered to be specific of fatty acid autoxidation. In addition, if peroxidation products are chiral, they necessarily arise from LOX activity, whereas racemic products can be obtained either by autoxidation or by a nonspecific LOX. Each chromatographic peak was collected and submitted to chiral phase HPLC, the example of (9R)- and (9S)-HOTE enantiomer separation in control and treated samples being described in Fig. 1,B and C. All the isomers were racemic mixtures in control leaves, with the exception of 13-HODE and 13-HOTE which exhibited an (S)/(R) enantiomeric ratio of 80/20 and 90/10, respectively (Table I). In elicited leaves, as expected, 12- and 16-HOTE remained racemic, 13-HODE and 13-HOTE (S)/(R) enantiomeric ratios were unchanged, whereas 9-HODE and 9-HOTE (S)/(R) enantiomeric ratios reached values around 90/10 (Table I).Table IEnantiomer composition of the hydroxy fatty acids obtained by the NaBH 4 /hydrolysis procedure from control and cry"
https://openalex.org/W2083308326,"Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAA), the major sites of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain, are believed to be composed predominantly of α, β, and γ subunits. Although cell surface expression is essential for GABAA receptor function, little is known regarding its regulation. To address this issue, the membrane stability of recombinant α1β2 or α1β2γ2 receptors was analyzed in human embryonic kidney cells. α1β2γ2 but not α1β2 receptors were found to recycle constitutively between the cell surface and a microtubule-dependent, perinuclear endosomal compartment. Similar GABAA receptor endocytosis was also seen in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons. GABAA receptor surface levels were reduced upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Like basal endocytosis, this response required the γ2subunit but not receptor phosphorylation. Although inhibiting PKC activity did not block α1β2γ2receptor endocytosis, it did prevent receptor down-regulation, suggesting that PKC activity may block α1β2γ2 receptor recycling to the cell surface. In agreement with this observation, blocking recycling from endosomes with wortmannin selectively reduced surface levels of γ2-containing receptors. Together, our results demonstrate that the surface stability of GABAA receptors can be dynamically and specifically regulated, enabling neurons to modulate cell surface receptor number upon the appropriate cues. Type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAA), the major sites of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain, are believed to be composed predominantly of α, β, and γ subunits. Although cell surface expression is essential for GABAA receptor function, little is known regarding its regulation. To address this issue, the membrane stability of recombinant α1β2 or α1β2γ2 receptors was analyzed in human embryonic kidney cells. α1β2γ2 but not α1β2 receptors were found to recycle constitutively between the cell surface and a microtubule-dependent, perinuclear endosomal compartment. Similar GABAA receptor endocytosis was also seen in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons. GABAA receptor surface levels were reduced upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Like basal endocytosis, this response required the γ2subunit but not receptor phosphorylation. Although inhibiting PKC activity did not block α1β2γ2receptor endocytosis, it did prevent receptor down-regulation, suggesting that PKC activity may block α1β2γ2 receptor recycling to the cell surface. In agreement with this observation, blocking recycling from endosomes with wortmannin selectively reduced surface levels of γ2-containing receptors. Together, our results demonstrate that the surface stability of GABAA receptors can be dynamically and specifically regulated, enabling neurons to modulate cell surface receptor number upon the appropriate cues. GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid transferrin receptor(s) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)1receptors are the major sites of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are also important drug targets for a range of therapeutic agents, including both benzodiazepines and barbiturates. These receptors are believed to be pentameric hetero-oligomers that can be constructed from a range of homologous subunit types, α (types 1–6), β (types 1–4), γ (types 1–4), δ and ε (1Macdonald R.L.

Heterologous expression has been used to determine the minimal structural requirements for the production of GABA-gated chloride channels. Expression of receptor α and β subunits produces GABA-gated channels, and their co-expression with the γ2 or γ3 subunit is essential for benzodiazepine sensitivity and relative Zn2+ insensitivity (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). From in situ hybridization and immunochemical analysis, it is apparent that the α1, β2, and γ2 subunits are co-expressed in many adult brain regions (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 4Laurie D.J. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4151-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they are believed to account for up to 30% of all benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors in the adult brain (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The co-existence of receptors composed of αβ subunitsin vivo has been suggested by the high Zn2+sensitivity, coupled with low single channel conductance of native receptors in some populations of neurons (1Macdonald R.L.

Recent studies have determined that the cell surface localization of GABAA receptors may be regulated with an increase in receptor number following treatment with insulin (7Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y.

Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Conversely, GABAA receptors have been associated with clathrin-coated vesicles from brain (9Tehrani M.H. Barnes Jr, E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 384-390PubMed Google Scholar) and down-regulate their function in an agonist-dependent (9Tehrani M.H. Barnes Jr, E.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

To explore these issues further, we have examined the surface stability of α1β2 and α1β2γ2 GABAAreceptors modified with an N-terminal reporter epitope and expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (A293). Such a recombinant approach has several advantages over endogenous receptors in neurons; receptors of known subunit composition may be studied, receptor levels are readily detectable, and molecular biological approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis may be employed. Our results suggest that GABAAreceptors composed of α1β2γ2, but not α1β2, subunits have the capacity to recycle constitutively between the cell surface and intracellular compartments. Interestingly, native GABAA receptors in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons were also seen to constitutively endocytose from the cell soma. Together, these results suggest that the trafficking itinerary of the GABAAreceptors may be modulated by a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism to differentially regulate surface receptor number. A293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies Ltd., UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells, seeded at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish, were transfected by electroporation (400 V, infinity resistance, 125-microfarad Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II) with 10 μg of DNA using equimolar ratios of expression constructs (14Connolly C.N.

Murine α1, β2, γ2S, and γ2L subunit cDNAs were expressed from the mammalian expression vector pGW1 (17Garofalo R.S. Barenton B. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); the γ2L and γ2S subunits differ by the presence of 8 amino acids within the major intracellular domain of this subunit (16Whiting P.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The subunits were tagged with the 9E10 epitope (EQKLISEEDL) between amino acids 4 and 5, as described previously (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The identified PKC phosphorylation sites that have been mutated to alanine residues have been described for β2 (18McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and γ2 (15Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The 9E10 antibody was obtained from 9E10 hybridoma cells and used direct as supernatant (10 μg/ml) or purified on immobilized protein A (50 μg/ml). The monoclonal antibody Bd 17, specific for the GABAA receptor β2 and β3 subunits was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-human transferrin receptor (CD71)-fluorescein isothiocyanate was purchased from Becton Dickinson (UK) and used at (10 μg/ml). The secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse rhodamine and goat anti-mouse fluorescein) were purchased from Pierce (UK) and used at 1 μg/ml. A293 cells on poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) and quenched twice in 50 mmNH4Cl (in phosphate-buffered saline). Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. When appropriate, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min, followed by quenching and blocking as above. 9E10 supernatant was used at 10 μg/ml. Both secondary antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml. When antibody internalization assays were performed, living cells were incubated with 9E10 (50 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Excess antibody was removed, and internalization was performed at 37 °C Coverslips were examined using a confocal microscope (MRC1000, Bio-Rad). Affinity-purified 9E10 antibody was iodinated to a specific activity of 500 Ci/mmol using Bolton and Hunter Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The iodinated antibody was titrated on β39E10-transfected A293 cells and used at saturating concentration (10 nm) for surface binding. The affinity of the iodinated antibody for β39E10subunit was determined to be 0.5 nm by Scatchard analysis. Surface binding was performed by preincubation in binding medium (DMEM without bicarbonate, with 25 mm HEPES and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with iodinated antibody for 1.5 h on ice. Cells were washed five times in binding medium, trypsinized, and quantified by counting γ emissions. Nonspecific binding was determined using mock-transfected cells. Cells werel-methionine-starved for 30 min before being labeled with [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi/10-cm dish; Translabel ICN/Flow) for 4 h. Postlabeling chase was performed after two washes in normal DMEM and in normal DMEM containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate (lysis buffer). Postnuclear supernatants were preabsorbed with protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of 9E10 supernatant in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. Pellets were washed in lysis buffer followed by three further washes in buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and a final wash without NaCl. Pellets were then resuspended in reducing sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.68m Tris, pH 6.8) and analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiograpy. Whole cell recordings from transfected A293 cells were performed as described previously up to 70 h after transfection (19Wooltorton J.A. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 633-640Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Low density cultures of hippocampal neurons were made as previously (20Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-282Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampus was removed from E18 rat embryos, trypsinized, dissociated by trituration, and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (10,000 cells/cm2). The following day, half the medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium containing B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then fed every 3 days. After 14–21 days, coverslips were utilized for immunofluorescence and endocytosis assays using the monoclonal antibody Bd 17 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) specific for the GABAA receptor β2 and β2 subunits. Primary cultures of hippocampal cells were incubated in the presence of 200 μg/ml mouse IgG for 2 h at 37 °C to down-regulate Fc receptors. Endocytosis assays were then performed as above using 50 μg/ml Bd 17 to prelabel the cell surface at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Endocytosis was permitted for 1 h at 37 °C after extensive washing in the presence or absence of phorbol esters. Neurons were then fixed and processed for immunohistochemistry as described above. To assess the surface stability of GABAA receptors, 9E10 epitope-tagged recombinant receptors (α1β29E10 or α1β2γ29E10) were transiently expressed in A293 cells. To identify receptor internalization, surface receptors were labeled with 50 μg/ml 9E10 antibody on ice and washed, and cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the cells were fixed, and the remaining surface receptors were detected using a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then permeabilized, and internalized receptors were detected with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 1). GABAA receptors composed of α1β29E10, exhibited low internalization of prebound 9E10 antibody, as evidenced by low rhodamine (internalized antibody) and high fluorescein labeling (surface antibody) (Fig. 1 A). During the 120-min incubation, surface levels did not appear to be significantly diminished, suggesting that either the rate of antibody internalization was low or that internalized receptor-antibody complexes were efficiently recycled to the plasma membrane. The use of excess (saturating) antibody used here minimizes the possible effects of antibody-induced receptor cross-linking and subsequent endocytosis (21Pelchen-Matthews A. Parsons I.J. Marsh M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1209-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). That surface receptors are not significantly reduced suggests that significant antibody-induced receptor endocytosis is not occurring. To examine receptor internalization for α1β2γ2, we used the γ2 epitope-tagged subunit to distinguish between the α1β2 and α1β2γ2 receptors. Previous studies have shown that γ2L homomers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while γ2S homomers can access the cell surface (22Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, upon their co-expression with either α1 or β2, both γ2splice variants are not expressed on the cell surface but are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, the only receptor combination that can be detected at the cell surface when α1β2γ29E10subunits are co-expressed are those composed of all three subunits. In contrast to the results observed for α1β2, receptors containing the γ2 subunit (α1β2γ2S9E10 or α1β2γ2L9E10) internalized efficiently with significant loss of surface fluorescein labeling (Fig. 1, B and C). Intracellular rhodamine staining was initially high but diminished with time (results not shown) and was present at only low levels after 120 min (Fig. 1,B and C). These results indicate that antibody-bound receptor internalization is dependent on the presence of the γ2 subunit, consistent with previous findings that γ2 homomers also rapidly endocytose from the cell surface (22Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this assay, antibody staining is lost from αβγ9E10-expressing cells. However, this does not necessarily represent receptor fate, since uncoupling of the antibody-receptor complex could occur in the more acidic intracellular area. To identify whether this loss of staining (Fig. 1, Band C) represents antibody uncoupling or receptor intracellular sequestration/degradation, α1β2γ2L9E10-expressing cells were incubated with 9E10 antibody present in the medium throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig. 1 D). Thus, uncoupled receptors recycled to the cell surface will be able to rebind extracellular 9E10 antibody, whereas intracellular or degraded receptors cannot. Under these conditions, surface expression of α1β2γ2L9E10remains stable, suggesting that loss of staining results from receptor-antibody uncoupling, rather than receptor degradation or intracellular sequestration. Furthermore, these results suggest that α1β2γ2 internalization is counterbalanced by receptor recycling or de novo synthesis of new receptors in A293 cells. Similar results were seen on exchanging the γ2S for the γ2L subunit (data not shown). Since previous studies have demonstrated that direct receptor phosphorylation of biochemically defined sites within the β1, β2, and γ2 subunits by PKC can modulate receptor function (17Garofalo R.S. Barenton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11470-11475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18McDonald B.J. Amato A. Connolly C.N. Benke D. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 19Wooltorton J.A. McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 633-640Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that receptor stability on the cell surface might be modulated by kinase activity. To perform these experiments, we iodinated the 9E10 antibody and used it to quantitative the level of 9E10-tagged cell surface receptors. In these experiments, all subunits were 9E10 epitope-tagged to achieve statistically significant results. A293 cells expressing α1β2 (A), α1β2γ2S (B), or α1β2γ2L (C) were incubated in the presence or absence of 30 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of PKC, for up to 2 h (Fig. 2). In addition, the effects of 30 nm 4-α-PMA, which is incapable of activating PKC, on cell surface receptor levels were also analyzed. After the incubation, cell surface receptor levels were quantified by the binding of iodinated 9E10 antibody to the cells on ice. Since antibody is not present during the incubation, receptor cross-linking and subsequent antibody-induced internalization cannot occur. In the absence of PMA, surface receptors composed of α1β2, α1β2γ2S, and α1β2γ2L were stable (Fig. 2,A–C), with no significant increase or decrease in antibody binding observed, suggesting minimal contributions of synthesis and degradation to surface receptor levels during the 1-h test time period. 4-α-PMA was also without effect on surface levels of all receptor constructs tested (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, a consistent reduction in 125I-9E10 binding was observed within 15 min of PMA treatment for receptors containing either γ2splice variant, α1β2γ2L (18.3 ± 4.5%; Fig. 2 B) or α1β2γ2S (16.0 ± 4.1%; Fig. 2 C), compared with nontreated cells. The reduction reached a plateau within 30–45 min, with 75–80% of receptors remaining, as compared with t = 0 (Fig. 2, Band C, open circles). Interestingly, in the presence of PMA, the cell surface level of α1β2 receptors was unaltered (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that there is a selective loss of γ2-containing receptors from the cell surface upon activation of PKC, whereas receptors comprising only α1β2 subunits are unaffected. To confirm our cell biological studies, the effects of PKC activity upon GABAA receptor function, was measured at 30 °C, since performing these experiments at room temperature would limit, if not block temperature-dependent endocytosis. Whole cell currents of A293 cells expressing α1β2 or α1β2γ2 were monitored by patch clamp in the presence or absence of PMA. For cells expressing α1β2, PMA treatment failed to induce any significant rundown in the 10 μm GABA-activated current (I GABA) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3 A, α1β2). In contrast,I GABA recorded from cells expressing receptors composed of α1β2γ2S subunits exhibited a slow rundown in current amplitude relative to untreated cells, taking 15–20 min before a threshold effect and reaching a plateau at approximately 75% of the controlI GABA, 30 min after initial exposure (Fig. 3 B, α1β2γ2S). Similar reductions were seen for α1β2γ2L receptors as for α1β2γ2S; however, the 4-α-PMA was without effect on the function of receptor assembly (data not shown). Thus, α1β2γ2 (but not α1β2) cell surface levels and function were both decreased to similar levels in response to PKC activation using PMA treatment. To investigate whether the observed PMA-induced down-regulation of α1β2γ2 receptors results in receptor degradation, A293 cells expressing α1β29E10, α1β2γ2S9E10, or α1β2γ2L9E10receptors were [35S]methionine-labeled for 4 h and chased in the presence of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to block further protein synthesis, in the absence or presence of PMA for a further 4 h (Fig. 4). To aid subunit identification, individual receptor subunits were precipitated from labeled cells expressing homomeric α19E10, β29E10, and γ2L9E10subunits using 9E10 antibody. The α19E10subunit migrated as three bands of 48, 50, and 52 kDa; β29E10 migrated as 50 and 52 kDa; and the γ2L9E10 subunit migrated as a smear ranging from 42 to 48 kDa (Fig. 4) in agreement with earlier observations (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Migration of the γ2S subunit appeared to be indistiguishable from that of the γ2L (data not shown). None of these bands were evident precipitating from untransfected cells. Heteromeric receptors were then immunoprecipitated using 9E10 antibody from cells expressing receptors composed of α1β29E10, α1β2γ2S9E10, and α1β2γ2L9E10 and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). All three receptor combinations were found to be equally stable in the presence or absence of PMA for at least 4 h, suggesting that down-regulated α1β2γ2 receptors are removed from the cell surface and stored in a nondegradative compartment. To further analyze the role of PKC activity in mediating the cell surface levels of GABAA receptors, kinase inhibitors and blocks of recycling were utilized. Expressing cells were exposed to PMA in the presence of the broad range kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Staurosporine was able to block removal of α1β2γ2S and α1β2γ2L receptors in the presence of PMA without any effect alone on cell surface receptor levels (PMA alone, 69.3 ± 2.7%; PMA and staurosporine, 101.6 ± 1.1% for α1β2γ2S; Fig. 5 A). These results confirm the selective requirement for PKC activity as shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4 in mediating the removal of cell γ2-containing surface receptors. The effect of wortmannin, an inhibitor of the endosomal recycling pathway (24Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), on GABAA receptor cell surface levels was also analyzed. In agreement with the observations of constitutive endocytosis GABAA receptors (Fig. 1), blocking receptor recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface with wortmannin (100 nm, 1.5 h) caused a down-regulation of α1β2γ2S and α1β2γ2L receptors from the cell surface to 77.3 ± 5.1% (Fig. 5 A) and 74.6 ± 5.4% (Fig. 5 B) respectively, compared with untreated cells. These results suggest that in the absence of exogenous PKC stimulation, approximately 25% of α1β2γ2 surface receptors constitutively internalize over 1.5 h, strongly suggesting that PKC activation is not required for receptor internalization. Furthermore, since antibody was not present during the incubation, these results support the case that the constitutive α1β2γ2 receptor endocytosis observed in Fig. 1 is not an artifact of incubation with antibody. Consistent with the hypothesis that both PMA and wortmannin treatment are affecting the same mechanism, their combined addition to α1β2γ2L expressing cells did not result in a synergistic down-regulation, but down-regulation to similar levels (77.5 ± 6.5%; Fig. 5, A andB) observed when these drugs were used individually (PMA; 69.3 ± 2.7% and wortmannin; 74.6 ± 5.4%; Fig. 4,A and B). Interestingly, constitutive endocytosis as measured by wortmannin treatment did not require PKC activation, since the inclusion of staurosporine did not block α1β2γ2S or α1β2γ2L receptor down-regulation by wortmannin (Fig. 5, A and B). This implies that receptor endocytosis is not dependent upon PKC activity and suggests that the target for PKC activity is receptor recycling. In support of the findings that α1β2 receptors do not constitutively internalize (Fig. 1) or down-regulate in response to PKC activation (Figs. 2 and 3 A), surface levels of α1β2 were unaffected by inhibiting receptor recycling using wortmannin treatment or by blocking kinase activity with stuarosporine (Fig. 5 C). To identify the compartment from which α1β2γ2 receptors recycle, GABAA receptors were co-localized with transferrin receptors (TfR), a marker for endocytic compartments (26Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B.

A293 cells expressing α1β29E10 (Fig. 6 A) or α1β2γ2L9E10 (Fig. 6 B) were incubated in the presence of 50 μg/ml 9E10 and 10 μg/ml TfR (fluorescein-conjugated) antibodies for 1 h in the presence of 30 nm PMA. Under these conditions, TfR containing recycling endosomes are predominantly located in the perinuclear region (26Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R.

Although some perinuclear staining is observed for receptors composed of α1β2, peripheral punctate staining is predominant (Fig. 6 A, arrow). In contrast, internalized α1β2γ2L receptors are observed most frequently in the perinuclear late endosomes co-localizing with TfR (Fig. 5 B,arrowhead). Similar results were observed in the absence of PMA (results not shown), suggesting that α1β2γ2 receptors can constitutively access this perinuclear compartment. Together these results suggest that internalized α1β2γ2 and α1β2 rec"

H. pylori grows persistently in the mucus layer of gastric tissue by means of a potent urease which produces ammonia; this product plays a significant role in the neutralization of the acidic environment of the stomach (9Eaton K.A. Brooks C.L. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2470-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allows the bacteria in vivo to adhere to the apical plasma membrane of surface epithelial cells in the pyloric antrum (10Chen X.G.

Ultrastructural analysis of gastric mucosa infected with H. pylori showed that bacteria adhere to gastric epithelial cells on small cellular projections referred to as adherence pedestals (10Chen X.G. Correa P. Offerhaus J. Rodriguez E. Janney F. Hoffmann E. Fox J. Hunter J. Diavolitsis S. Am J. Clin. Pathol. 1983; 86: 575-582Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In vitro, H. pylori adhered to AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells; H. pylori appeared to be partially enclosed by plasma membrane, which was associated with a loosely organized network of actin filaments (13Smoot D.T. Resau J.H. Naab T. Desbordes B.C. Gilliam T. Bull-Henry K. Curry S.B. Nidiry J. Sewchand J. Mills-Robertson K. Frontin K. Abebe E. Dillon M. Chippendale G.R. Phelps P.C. Scott V.F. Mobley H.L.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 350-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that a non-acidic or alkaline environment is created by ammonia produced from urea secreted by gastric epithelial cells by action of H. pylori urease, even though the gastric juxtamucosal pH of patients infected with H. pylori is 5.7 (14Frieri G. de Petris G. Aggio A. Santarelli D. Ligas E. Rosoni R. Caprill R. Digestion. 1995; 56: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined VacA activation in buffers of different pH and found that it was activated not only under acidic, but also alkaline, conditions. Rapid vacuolation of AZ-521 cells incubated with acid- or alkali-treated VacA was associated with its enhanced binding to a 250-kDa surface glycoprotein, termed p250. Amino acid sequence data and immunological analysis showed that p250 is receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ).1 The toxin-producing strainH. pylori ATCC49503 was used as the source of VacA for purification according to our published procedure (15Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Padilla P.I. Wada A. Hirayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, after growth of H. pylori in Brucella broth containing 0.1% β-cyclodextran at 37 °C for 3–4 days with vigorous shaking in a controlled micro-aerophilic atmosphere of 10% O2 and 10% CO2, VacA was precipitated from culture supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and purified by column chromatography on hydroxylapatite, Superose 6HR 10/30, and Resource Q, followed by filtration (0.45-μm filter). Purified VacA (200 μg/ml) was stored in TBS buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 m NaCl). Human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AZ-521 (Culture Collection of Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan Health Sciences Foundation) was seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well culture plates (2 × 104 cells in 80 μl/well) and cultured as monolayers for 24 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Samples (20 μl) of VacA were added to achieve the indicated final concentrations and cells were incubated for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. To quantify vacuolating activity, uptake of neutral red into the vacuoles in VacA-treated cells was determined (16Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 50 μl of freshly prepared 0.05% neutral red in PBS containing 0.3% BSA, and then washed three times with 0.1 ml of PBS containing 0.3% BSA. After addition of 0.1 ml of 70% ethanol in water containing 0.4% HCl, absorbance at 540 nm (A 540) was measured. Vacuolating activity was determined by subtracting the A 540 of cells incubated without VacA from the A 540 of VacA-treated cells. To evaluate the effect of acid or alkali treatment on vacuolating activity, VacA was adjusted to indicated pH by the addition of 1n HCl or 1 n NaOH, incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and then neutralized to pH 7.7 with 1 n NaOH or 1n HCl, respectively. The resulting samples were added to cells (2 × 104/well) followed by incubation for indicated periods. Samples (100 μl) of the untreated VacA (40 μg) or VacA that had been incubated for 10 min at 30 °C at pH 1.5, 3, 10, or 11.5 with or without subsequent neutralization to pH 7.7 were layered on 5-ml 10–35% glycerol gradients prepared in 100 mm NaCl containing either 60 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 100 mm glycine/HCl, pH 3.0, or 100 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 10 and centrifuged at 10 °C for 7 h at 40,000 rpm in an SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions (550 μl) from the tops of the gradients were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-VacA antibody. After aliquots (400 μl) of each fraction were dialyzed against TBS buffer and concentrated to 100 μl using Centriplus concentrator with Amicon Centriplus-100, 10 μl of each sample were assayed for vacuolating activity. Standard marker proteins, i.e. BSA (4.6 S), catalase (11.2 S), and thyroglobulin (19 S), were centrifuged in parallel gradients. AZ521 cells (1 × 107), were harvested in TNE buffer, containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, washed twice in PBS, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% BSA. Samples (90 μl) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μl (0.62–40 μg) of untreated VacA, VacA exposed to pH 1.5 or 11.5 followed by neutralization, or to heat-inactivated VacA (95 °C, 10 min). After two washes with 500 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA, anti-VacA antibody was added, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2% BSA, suspended in 1 ml of the same solution, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 μl (1 mg/ml) of Fluoro LinkTMCyTM2-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After two washes with PBS containing 2% BSA, samples of 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. Cultured cells (5 × 107 cells) were harvested in 1 ml of TNE buffer and washed twice with PBS. Protein on the cell surface was biotinylated at 4 °C for 30 min according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; ECL protein biotinylation module, no. RPN 2202). Biotinylated cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of Sol buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of leupeptin, 10 mm iodoacetate, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation (20 min, 100,000 × g), the supernatant (300 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 3.0 μg of untreated VacA, VacA exposed to pH 1.5 or 11.5 followed by neutralization, or with heat-inactivated VacA. The mixture was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1 μl of an antibody raised against purified VacA. Antibody-bound proteins were collected after addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1 g/ml in Sol buffer, and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. After the matrix was washed four times with Sol buffer, proteins were solubilized by heating in 0.1 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.6% SDS, 8% glycerol, 2% dithiothreitol, and 0.08% bromphenol blue and separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore; Immobilon-P membranes) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C with Western transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.19 m glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20, then washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 without milk. After extensive washing with PBS, the biotinylated proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (15Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Padilla P.I. Wada A. Hirayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of p250 with VacA using anti-RPTPβ antibody, p250 obtained from a Superose 6 gel filtration column was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1.0 μg of untreated or heat-inactivated VacA, followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight with an anti-human RPTPβ mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), which had been prepared by immunization with the 2098–2307 region of human RPTPβ. Following addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubation for 1 h, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to PVDF membranes, and detected with antibodies to VacA and RPTPβ. Specific binding of lectins was used for identification of carbohydrate moieties in p250 from AZ-521 cells, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; DIG glycan differentiation kit). The lectins selectively recognize terminal sugars. Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (18Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol.

PVDF membranes with proteins that had been separated by SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with lectin conjugated to the steroid hapten digoxigenin. After washing the membrane, glycoproteins were detected with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, followed by detection with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. After centrifugation of lysates of biotinylated cells in Sol buffer, 10 μl of each supernatant (2 mg/ml) were added to a mixture of 34.5 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 μl ofN-glycosidase F (0.1 units) or 0.5 μl ofO-glycosidase (0.5 milliunits) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, and immunoprecipitation with anti-VacA antibody after addition of native VacA or a heat-inactivated VacA. To purify p250, AZ521 cells (3 × 108) were harvested with TNE buffer, washed three times with PBS, and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of Sol buffer. After centrifugation (20 min, 100,000 × g), the supernatant was filtered. The filtrate was diluted with an equal volume of distilled water and applied to a column of PNA-agarose (1 ml bed volume), which was washed with PW buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.3m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and leupeptin, 5 μg/ml, pH7.5), and eluted with PW buffer containing 0.3 md-galactose. Fractions, in which p250 was detected by immunoprecipitation using VacA and anti-VacA antibody, were pooled and concentrated by SpeedVac. The concentrated sample was transferred to a column of Superose 6 (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 mNaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After SDS-PAGE in 5% gels, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Problot, Applied Biosystems), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, reduced,S-carboxymethylated (23Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and digested withAchromobacter protease I (Wako Pure Chemical Institutes, Osaka, Japan). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated by narrow-bore liquid chromatography on a Smart system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a mRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequenced (model 477A/120A sequencer; Applied Biosystems Division, Perkin Elmer Corp.). Protein was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE were phosphorylase b(cross-linked trimer, 292 kDa), myosin (220 kDa), rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), hen egg albumin (46 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa). High molecular mass markers for glycerol density gradient centrifugation, BSA (4.6 S), catalase (11.2 S), and thyroglobulin (19 S), were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. N-Glycosidase F andO-glycosidase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. β-Cyclodextran was kindly supplied by Teijin (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents were of analytical grade. Fig. 1 shows the time course of vacuolation of cultured cells with VacA (final concentration, 30 nm (panel A), 60 nm(panel B), 120 nm (panel C), and 240 nm (panel D)) that had been treated at 30 °C for 10 min at pH 1.5 or 11.5 followed by neutralization to pH 7.7. Cells exposed to the treated VacA were vacuolated at similar rates and much more rapidly than cells incubated with untreated VacA. Time-dependent vacuolating activity, as measured by NRU, was increased about 3-fold by incubation for 8 h with 120 nm acid- or alkali-treated VacA. Significant activation was observed at pH values lower than 5.5 and greater than 9.5 (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, VacA (3.75–240 nm) treated at pH 1.5 or 11.5 showed greater vacuolating activity than untreated VacA. Moreover, specific activity of VacA (up to 60 nm) treated at pH 3 or 10 was significantly lower than that of VacA treated at pH 1.5 or 11.5.FIG. 2Effect of pH on vacuolating activity of VacA. Purified VacA (120 nm) in TBS buffer was exposed to the indicated pH for 10 min at 30 °C before neutralization to pH 7.7. AZ-521 cells were incubated with the treated VacA for 8 h.

Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether alkaline treatment of VacA similarly induced disassembly of VacA oligomers, we used velocity sedimentation in glycerol density gradients followed by Western blotting of fraction samples with anti-VacA antibody (Fig. 4 A). After incubation at pH 1.5 or 11.5 for 10 min and centrifugation at the same pH, VacA was essentially entirely found in fractions containing BSA; after incubation and sedimentation at pH 7.7, all VacA was in fractions corresponding to proteins of 19–22S (Fig. 4). VacA incubated and centrifuged at intermediate pH (pH 3 or 10) was divided between the two gradient regions. Regardless of treatment pH, however, after sedimentation at pH 7.7, all VacA was found in fraction 6; this VacA sedimented more rapidly than thyroglobulin (19 S) and corresponded to ∼22 S (25Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, the extreme in alkaline, as well as acidic pH, resulted in disassembly of native VacA oligomers. These results indicate that VacA dissociated by treatment at pH 11.5, like acid-treated VacA, reassociated on neutralization and sedimented at ∼22 S. Vacuolating activity of each fraction was determined after dialysis against TBS buffer. After taking into account the yield of standard marker protein, total recovery of vacuolating activity of all VacA exposed to pH 11.5 or 1.5 was about 226–289% of untreated VacA (Fig. 4 B). The vacuolating activity of fractions 2 and 3 containing VacA treated at pH 11.5, as well as at pH 1.5 (Fig. 4 B, b and c), was remarkably increased. After incubation at pH 1.5 (Fig. 4 B,d) or 11.5 (Fig. 4 B, e) and sedimentation at pH 7.7, VacA in fraction 6 showed higher vacuolating activity than did untreated VacA (Fig. 4 B, a). These results suggest that VacA may be activated by exposure to alkaline conditions and reassociated after neutralization. The findings are similar to those observed with acid-treated VacA. Cells exposed to VacA that had been incubated at alkaline or acidic pH followed by neutralization were much more rapidly vacuolated than those incubated with the untreated VacA. We, therefore, evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the binding to AZ521 cells of VacA after treatment at pH 1.5 or 11.5 (Fig. 5). Mean fluorescence intensity of cells incubated with VacA previously exposed to pH 1.5 or 11.5 was 145 and 83, respectively, versus 40.7 for cells incubated with 120 nm untreated VacA. Thus, fluorescence intensity, which is an indirect measure of VacA bound to AZ-521 cells, was significantly higher (about 1.3–3 fold) with treated than with the untreated VacA at concentrations from 3.75 to 240 nm (Fig. 6). These results suggest that treatment of VacA at pH 1.5 or 11.5 increased its binding to AZ-521 cells. Two proteins of 140 and 250 kDa on the cell surface of AZ-521 were immunoprecipitated with anti-VacA antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B from lysates of cells that had been incubated with active, but not with heat-inactivated, VacA (Fig. 7). The dense bands of p250 observed in lanes 3 and4 of Fig. 7 A show that binding of VacA to p250 was enhanced considerably by treatment at pH 1.5 or 11.5 followed by neutralization to pH 7.7 (Fig. 7 A, lane 2). Densitometric scanning of the bands detected by immunoprecipitation clearly indicates 5.1- or 3.7-fold stimulation of VacA binding to p250 after treatment, respectively, at pH 1.5 or 11.5, followed by neutralization (Fig. 7 B). There were no significant differences, however, among the intensities of the p140 bands observed in three lanes. These results indicate that the treatment of VacA at pH 1.5 or 11.5 followed by neutralization contributed to the increased binding of the treated VacA to p250.FIG. 6Effect of treatment at pH 1.5 or 11.5 on VacA binding to AZ521 cells. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with indicated concentrations of untreated VacA (■) or VacA that had been exposed to pH 1.5 (●) or pH 11.5 (▵) and neutralized, followed by a 30-min incubation with anti-VacA antibody and additional 30 min with Fluoro LinkTMCyTM2-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), followed by flow cytometry, as described in the legend of Fig. 5 and under “Materials and Methods.” The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 7Effect of treatment of VacA at acid or alkaline pH on binding to cell surface proteins. A, electrophoretic patterns of the proteins immunoprecipitated from AZ-521 cells. Membrane proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then lysed with Sol buffer, the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with 3.0 μg of heat-inactivated VacA (lane 1), untreated VacA (lane 2), or VacA neutralized after treatment at pH 1.5 (lane 3) or pH 11.5 (lane 4). After incubation with anti-VacA antibody, antibody-bound proteins were collected by addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Immunoprecipitated proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels, were transferred to PVDF membranes, which were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, followed by ECL detection. Positions of molecular mass standards (kDa) are on theleft and right. Arrows show the locations of p250 and p140. B, densitometric scans of immunoprecipitated proteins visualized by ECL.

PNA and DSA reacted strongly with p250, indicating the presence of galactose-β(1–3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, and galactose-β(1–4)-N-acetylglucosamine, respectively (Fig. 8). After incubation withN-glycosidase F or O-glycosidase, the biotinylated surface proteins of AZ-521 cells were immunoprecipitated using native VacA and heat-inactivated VacA (Fig. 9). The samples immunoprecipitated using native VacA before (lane 2) and after (lane 4) N-glycosidase F treatment contained 250- and 240-kDa proteins, respectively. These results show that p250 has N-linked glycan and that theN-linked glycan of p250 is not required for the binding to VacA. A significant molecular change in p250 was not observed after treatment with O-glycosidase (lane 6).FIG. 9Immunoprecipitation of p250 after treatment with N-glycosidase F andO-glycosidase. Proteins solubilized from biotinylated cells were incubated without (lanes 1 and 2) or with N-glycosidase F (lanes 3 and 4) orO-glycosidase (lanes 5 and6) at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples were then incubated with heat-inactivated VacA (lanes 1,3, and 5) or native VacA (lanes 2, 4, and 6) before immunoprecipitation and separation of precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels followed by transfer to PVDF membranes; p250 was visualized by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin followed by ECL detection.

https://openalex.org/W2058647684,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding to its receptors TrkA and p75NTR enhances the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of neurons. Recent studies have suggested that NGF receptor activation may occur in caveolae or caveolae-like membranes (CLM). This is an intriguing possibility because caveolae have been shown to contain many of the signaling intermediates in the TrkA signaling cascade. To examine the membrane localization of TrkA and p75NTR, we isolated caveolae from 3T3-TrkA-p75 cells and CLM from PC12 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that TrkA and p75NTR were enriched about 13- and 25-fold, respectively, in caveolae and CLM. Binding and cross-linking studies demonstrated that the NGF binding to both TrkA and p75NTRwas considerably enriched in CLM and that about 90% of high affinity binding to TrkA was present in CLM. When PC12 cells were treated with NGF, virtually all activated (i.e. tyrosine phosphorylated) TrkA was found in the CLM. Remarkably, in NGF-treated cells, it was only in CLM that activated TrkA was coimmunoprecipitated with phosphorylated Shc and PLCγ. These results document a signaling role for TrkA in CLM and suggest that both TrkA and p75NTRsignaling are initiated from these membranes.

Two distinct classes of binding sites differ in their affinity for NGF by 2 orders of magnitude (8Sutter A. Riopelle R.J. Harris-Warrick R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol.

Low affinity (10−9m) and high affinity (10−11m) NGF receptors are distinguished kinetically by a much slower rate of dissociation from the high affinity sites (9Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M.

NGF binding induces TrkA dimerization, kinase activation, and receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation (14Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F.

A. 1992; 89: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that TrkA contributes to the formation of high affinity receptors. However, TrkA alone is unlikely to account for high affinity NGF binding because most binding to TrkA in cells expressing only this receptor is of low affinity (20Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p75NTR is a single-transmembrane glycoprotein; it is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily (21Carter B.D. Lewin G.R.

The latter may be due, in part, to direct interaction of p75NTR with TrkA. p75NTR has been shown to increase the rate of association of NGF with TrkA, thereby increasing TrkA activation and the number of high affinity binding sites (20Mahadeo D.

Caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains that in many cells exist as vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane (35Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zang X.L.

Enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and the ganglioside GM1, caveolae contain structural proteins of the caveolin family (36Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev.

Membranes of similar composition and properties have been isolated from cells that do not contain caveolin; in these cells these membranes have been referred to as CLMs (40Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y.-S.

In addition, many of the intermediates in the TrkA signaling cascade are also present in caveolae or CLMs, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C-γ, Shc, Grb2, SOS-1, Ras, Raf-1, and MAPK (ERK2) (36Anderson R.G.W.

The possibility that caveolae or CLMs could serve as an important locus of NGF receptor binding and signaling prompted us to examine the distribution of TrkA and p75NTR in cells expressing these receptors. We show that both TrkA and p75NTR are enriched in caveolae and CLMs, that NGF binds with high affinity to its receptors in CLMs, and that TrkA activation and signaling are initiated in these membranes. RTA antibody, a polyclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of rat TrkA, was a gift of Dr. L. F. Reichardt (University of California, San Francisco) (30Ross A.H. Daou M.C.

Anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phospholipase Cγ-1, anti-EGFR, anti-TrkA ED, and anti-Shc antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-TrkA (C terminus), anti-Ras, and anti-caveolin-1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to caveolin-1 used for ultrastructural studies was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse NGF was prepared by ion-exchange chromotography as indicated (46Zhou J. Holtzman D.M. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME H-21) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. 3T3-TrkA cells were established by transfecting NIH-3T3 cells with a rattrkA expression vector, pDM115 (a gift of Dr. M. V. Chao, New York University Medical Center) (46Zhou J. Holtzman D.M. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To establish 3T3-p75 cells, the plasmid NGFR1 (a gift of Dr. E. M. Shooter, Stanford University) was cut with NcoI, blunt-ended, and digested with BglII. The resulting 1.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment, which contains the full-length open reading frame for p75NTR cDNA, was inserted into pREP4 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This p75NTR expression plasmid (pMHZ100) was used to transfect NIH-3T3 cells. 3T3 cells that co-express TrkA and p75NTR (3T3-TrkA-p75) were established by co-transfecting the cells with both pDM115 and pMHZ100. The parental 3T3 cells and their derivatives were grown in DME H-21 medium containing 10% bovine calf serum and appropriate antibiotics (500 μg/ml G418 or 200 μg/ml hygromycin or both). The cells were treated with NGF, or with vehicle alone, at 37 °C for the time indicated. The treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy by adding to the culture medium an equal volume of freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 30 min at room temperature, the medium plus fixative was replaced by 4% formaldehyde, and cells were post-fixed for at least 24 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed three times with 0.15% glycine in phosphate buffer, and gently scraped from the dish in a small volume of 1% gelatin. Cells were pelleted in 10% gelatin and, after solidification of the gelatin on ice, cut into ∼1-mm3 blocks. Further preparation for ultrathin cryosectioning and immunogold labeling was carried out as described (47Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James J.E. J.

PC12 cells or 3T3 cells and their derivatives were grown to confluence in 15-cm tissue culture dishes; three dishes of cells were used for each preparation. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were scraped into 2 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11.0. The cells were homogenized sequentially using a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a sonicator (3 × 20-s bursts). The homogenate (2 ml) was then adjusted to 45% w/v sucrose by adding 2 ml of 90% w/v sucrose prepared in 2× MBS buffer (MBS is 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl). The final pH of the mixture was 10.2. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying this solution with 4 ml of 35% w/v sucrose and 4 ml of 5% w/v sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate. The samples were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 16–20 h. From the top of the gradient, 0.85-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 14 fractions. In some experiments, the individual gradient fractions were pooled into CLM (fractions 4–7) and NCM (fractions 10–14). The membranes from each pooled gradient fractions were concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in MBS buffer. The resulting membrane fractions were resuspended in lysis buffer and used for immunoprecipitation or Western blotting analysis. The pooled membrane fractions were resuspended in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 60 mm β-octylglucoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). After sonication (3 × 20 s), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C (14,000 × g for 2 min). The lysate was then mixed with antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitate was collected by incubating with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 2 h. The beads were washed with 3 × 1 ml of lysis buffer followed by 1 ml of PBS. The bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed using 4–15% SDS-PAGE (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Blots were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h. The membrane was first probed for 3 h with primary antibodies at the dilution suggested by the suppliers. After washing three times with TBST, the blots were then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgGs, goat anti-mouse IgGs, or protein A (for probing caveolin), each conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). The membranes were then washed three times with TBST. The SuperSignal (Pierce) was used to visualize the reaction. For detecting GM1, the nitrocellulose was probed with cholera toxin B-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2000) and washed three times with TBST, and the bound conjugate was visualized with SuperSignal. NGF binding and cross-linking was carried out essentially as described (46Zhou J. Holtzman D.M. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (107/15-cm dish) were washed with binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mg/ml each of glucose and bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 10 min and then incubated with 2 ml of binding buffer containing 2 nm125I-NGF for 1 h at 4 °C. To measure binding to high affinity (slowly dissociating) receptors, cells were washed with ligand-free binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C before cross-linking. To correct for nonspecific binding and cross-linking, unlabeled NGF (1 μm) was included during binding and cross-linking. To cross-link NGF to TrkA, bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm in binding buffer. For cross-linking NGF to p75NTR, EDAC was used at a final concentration of 20 mm. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by washing cells with binding buffer. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm of glutathione to the samples. The samples were then subjected to membrane fractionation as described above. The resulting fractions were pooled as described, and the proteins were separated using 4–15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film XAR-5 (Eastman Kodak Co.). The film was scanned by a Umax superVista S-12 scanner, and intensity of the each protein band was measured using NIH image software. Biotinylation of surface receptors was carried out as described (50Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnet N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml of NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by washing followed by adding lysine (1 mm) to react with remaining biotin. The CLM and NCM fractions were prepared as described above. To show whether or not p75NTR and TrkA are present in caveolae, we used nondetergent extraction to isolate caveolae from 3T3-TrkA-p75 cells. Fourteen fractions (0.85 ml each) from the discontinuous sucrose gradient were collected and analyzed for distribution of p75NTR, TrkA, and caveolar markers including the proteins caveolin-1, Ras and the ganglioside GM-1. As expected from earlier studies, caveolin-1, Ras, and GM-1 were found almost exclusively in fractions 4–6 (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis showed that about 40% of TrkA and 60% of p75NTRwere also present in fractions 4–6. The ratio of TrkA in caveolar to noncaveolar fractions was 0.6; the caveolar to noncaveolar ratio for p75NTR was 1.5. Because the amount of protein in these fractions accounts for only about 5% of total cellular protein, TrkA was enriched 13-fold in these membranes, whereas p75NTR was enriched 25-fold. The distribution of TrkA was similar in 3T3-TrkA cells (data not shown). Using immunoprecipitation, some receptors and signaling proteins localized to caveolae can be shown to interact with caveolin-1. In agreement with an earlier study (37Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar), p75NTR was found in anti-caveolin-1 immunoprecipitates from 3T3-TrkA-p75 cells (Fig. 2 A). NGF treatment had no effect on the ability to coimmunoprecipitate p75NTR with caveolin, suggesting that NGF binding to p75NTR has no effect on the interaction of p75NTR with caveolin-1. In the same experiments, we found no evidence for immunoprecipitation of TrkA with anti-caveolin-1 antibodies (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that TrkA either fails to interact with caveolin-1 or does so with lesser affinity than p75NTR. Palmitoylation marks many proteins present in caveolae (51Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and for some proteins this modification enhances their targeting to this locus (53Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). p75NTR was shown to be palmitoylated in an earlier study (51Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ask whether TrkA was also palmitoylated, we incubated 3T3-TrkA cells with [3H]palmitic acid, and, after lysis, determined whether the receptor was acylated. SDS-PAGE analysis of TrkA immunoprecipitates showed that TrkA was covalently linked to the fatty acid (Fig. 2 B). This covalent bound was sensitive to 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that like other palmitoylated proteins found in caveolae (51Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), palmitic acid is linked through a thioester bond to a cysteine residue(s) in TrkA. Palmitoylation of TrkA and p75NTR is consistent with their presence in caveolae. Filipin binds cholesterol and disrupts caveolae (54Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Filipin treatment has been shown to decrease PDGF-mediated activation of PDGF receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase localized in caveolae, and to decrease signaling downstream from PDGF receptor (41Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To show whether or not filipin would also reduce TrkA activation, 3T3-TrkA cells were treated with filipin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to adding NGF (5 ng/ml). TrkA phosphorylation was decreased to about 63% (± 6%) of the nonfilipin treated control (n = 5) (Fig. 2 C). To ask whether altered TrkA signaling following filipin treatment was associated with a change in the distribution of the receptor, we examined gradients prepared from 3T3-TrkA cells treated with filipin under conditions identical to those used to examine signaling. Compared with untreated cells, TrkA was more widely distributed in filipin treated cells. There was an increase in TrkA in the heaviest CLM fraction (i.e. fraction number 6) and in fractions 7–11 (Fig. 2 D). These results show that the distribution and signaling of TrkA receptors is influenced by a treatment that disrupts caveolae. They provide further support for the localization of TrkA in caveolae. Both differentiated and undifferentiated PC12 cells have been reported to express caveolin-1 (55Galbiati F. Volonte D. Gil O. Zanazzi G. Salzer J.L. Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Engelman J.A.

Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using a fractionation protocol that enriches for CLM, a small amount of caveolin was present in immunoprecipitates from undifferentiated PC 12 cells (59Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Lisanti M.P. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We found very little evidence for caveolin-1 in the PC12 cells used for our experiments. Whereas by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot we readily detected caveolin-1 in 3T3 cells, we were unable to do so in untreated PC12 cells or in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 4 days (Fig. 3 D). We also carried out immunoelectron microscopy analysis. Membrane invaginations characteristic of caveolae were seen in both 3T3-TrkA and 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In both, we found immunolabeling of caveolin-1 in these structures. However, we could not show that caveolin-1 was present in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 C) using conditions under which the protein was readily seen in 3T3 cells. We conclude that there is little, if any, caveolin-1 in the PC12 cells used in our experiments. To determine whether or not the membrane localization of p75NTR and TrkA in PC12 cells is similar to that in 3T3 cells, PC12 cells were subjected to extraction and fractionation as described above. Aliquots (15 μl) of fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. About 95% of cellular protein was found in fractions 10–14 (Fig. 4 A). Only 5% was present in fractions 4–6. Immunoblot analysis showed that most GM1 was in factions 5 and 6 (Fig. 4 B), the same fractions in which GM1 was found in 3T3 cells. Immunoblots revealed that Ras was also concentrated in fractions 5 and 6. β3-Integrin, a membrane protein that is excluded from caveolae (39Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), was found only in fractions at the bottom of the sucrose gradient (fractions 10–14). These results indicate that PC12 cells contain membrane domains similar to caveolae in buoyant density, ganglioside content, and protein constituents. In accord with others (40Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y.-S. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we refer to them as CLM. We designated fractions 4–6 as CLM and 10–14 as NCM. To show whether or not TrkA and p75NTR were present in CLM, an aliquot of each gradient fraction was analyzed using antibodies to TrkA or p75NTR.

A previous study has demonstrated that paxillin contains two binding sites for FAK. We have further characterized these two binding sites and have demonstrated that the binding affinity of the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK is the same for each of the two binding sites. The presence of both binding sites increases the affinity for FAK by 5–10-fold. A conserved paxillin sequence called the LD motif has been implicated in FAK binding. We show that mutations in the LD motifs in both FAK-binding sites are required to dramatically impair FAK binding in vitro. A paxillin mutant containing point mutations in both FAK-binding sites was characterized. The mutant exhibited reduced levels of phosphotyrosine relative to wild type paxillin in subconfluent cells growing in culture, following cell adhesion to fibronectin and in src-transformed fibroblasts. These results suggest that paxillin must bind FAK for maximal phosphorylation in response to cell adhesion and that FAK may function to direct tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in the process of transformation by the src oncogene.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). FAK and paxillin colocalize with integrins, which are transmembrane receptors that engage extracellular matrix ligands,e.g. fibronectin (3Albelda S.M. Buck C.A.

Upon binding ligand, the integrins trigger cytoplasmic signals that modulate cellular functions (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). One major mechanism of signal transduction utilized by integrins involves tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Upon integrin-dependent cell adhesion, FAK becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and enzymatically activated. Other focal adhesion-associated proteins, including paxillin, also become tyrosine phosphorylated upon cell adhesion. FAK has been implicated in controlling several integrin-regulated biological functions including cell spreading, motility, growth, and survival (7Richardson A. Parsons J.T.

Several features of FAK that are important for its function have been defined and include its focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence and its autophosphorylation site. The carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK contains the FAT sequence and binding sites for the focal adhesion-associated proteins talin and paxillin (13Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol.

Two proteins that regulate the generation of lipid second messengers, phosphatidylinosotide 3′ kinase and phospholipase C-γ1, can also bind to FAK through an SH2-mediated interaction with tyrosine 397 (22Reiske H.R.

The recruitment of Src into complex with FAK may regulate signaling via multiple mechanisms. First, Src can phosphorylate FAK on a number of additional tyrosine residues resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and the formation of docking sites for additional SH2 containing binding partners, e.g. growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (27Calalb M.B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Second, formation of the FAK·Src complex may direct tyrosine phosphorylation of additional focal adhesion-associated substrates, e.g. paxillin and p130 cas . Phosphorylation of these substrates results in the recruitment of additional SH2 domain containing signaling molecules, e.g.Crk (24Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These motifs have been implicated in mediating binding to FAK, vinculin, the human and bovine papillomavirus E6 protein, and a GTPase-activating protein for the ARF GTP-binding protein (37Brown M.C.

The amino-terminal domain of paxillin contains four tyrosine residues that are sites of phosphorylation (24Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

The role of tyrosine phosphorylation and the biological function of paxillin have not been definitively established. Dominant negative mutants of FAK have been used to explore FAK function and have implicated FAK in controlling the rate of cell spreading in CE cells. In this system, reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was correlated with the spreading defect, suggesting that paxillin may play a role in this function (25Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The importance of the physical interaction between FAK and paxillin has not been firmly established. It is clear that this interaction is not required for the correct localization of paxillin to focal adhesions because the FAK-binding site is in the amino terminus of paxillin and the focal adhesion targeting sequence is in its carboxyl terminus (37Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). FAK is proposed to target to focal adhesions via paxillin binding because a number of FAK mutants defective for paxillin binding are also defective for localization to focal adhesions (49Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, there are several FAK mutants that are unable to bind paxillin yet correctly target to focal adhesions (13Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). 4M. Cooley, J. M. Broome, and M. D. Schaller, manuscript in preparation. One other potential role for the FAK-paxillin interaction is to direct tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. In this manuscript, we describe further characterization of the two FAK-binding sites within paxillin (37Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Both binding sites interact with the same affinity with FAK and the FAK-related PTK, CAKβ/Pyk2/CadTK/RAFTK. A paxillin mutant with lesions in each of the FAK-binding sites has been engineered and expressed. Tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type paxillin and this mutant was examined in cells in culture, following adhesion to fibronectin and in src-transformed fibroblasts. The FAK-binding mutant was tyrosine phosphorylated under each of these conditions, although the level of phosphorylation was reduced relative to wild type. These results suggest that FAK binding is not essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin but that association with FAK may enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. CE cells were prepared and maintained as described previously (50Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As described previously, paxillin, FAK, and Src were exogenously expressed using the replication competent, avian retroviral vectors RCAS (24Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 51Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CE cells were transfected or infected with stocks of retrovirus (for coexpression) as described previously (50Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For cell adhesion experiments, cells were trypsinized and the trypsin was neutralized by washing in soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then held in suspension or plated onto 100-mm2 Petri dishes coated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C, the cells were lysed. The avian paxillin cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript for subsequent manipulations. An epitope-tagged derivative of paxillin was engineered using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the paxillin cDNA. One primer (the T7 primer) annealed to the vector, and the second primer altered the termination codon and created a HindIII site at the 3′ end of the coding sequences. The PCR product was inserted between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBSctag in-frame with the sequences encoding the KT3 epitope tag (51Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A PCR-based mutagenesis strategy was utilized to create point mutations. Complementary primers containing the desired point mutation(s) were used for amplification of epitope-tagged paxillin (in pBluescript) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The product was digested with DpnI and introduced intoEscherichia coli DH5. Successfully mutated clones were identified by nucleotide sequencing. The alterations to FAK-binding site 1 (substitution of alanine for aspartic acid 146) and FAK-binding site 2 (substitution of alanine for aspartic acid 268) were made sequentially. The epitope-tagged wild type and mutant paxillin sequences were subcloned into RCAS A. Fragments of paxillin were expressed as GST fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were designed based upon the secondary structure predications of paxillin. The amino terminus of each fragment was chosen to correspond to the beginning of a predicted α-helix, and the carboxyl terminus of each fragment was designed to correspond to the end of a predicted α-helix. Paxillin fragments were amplified by PCR using primers that created a BamHI site at the 5′ end and anEcoRI site at the 3′ end. The fragments were subcloned into pGEX2TK in-frame with the GST coding sequences. Thus three fusion proteins were engineered, GST-PaxN1-C3 (containing codons 113–312), GST-PaxN2-C3 (containing codons 219–312), and GST-PaxN1-C1A (containing codons 113–229). Point mutations were engineered in these constructs using the strategy outlined above. Aspartic acids 146, 268, and 303 were targeted for mutagenesis and were converted to alanine residues. GST constructs harboring these point mutations individually and in combination were created. GST-FAK fusion proteins have been described previously (52Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sequences encoding the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK were mutated using the Altered Sites mutagenesis protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). 4M. Cooley, J. M. Broome, and M. D. Schaller, manuscript in preparation. Mutated DNA sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pBluescript-FRNK plasmid (51Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into RCAS A.4 Two sequencing strategies were utilized. First, clones that were successfully altered by site-directed mutagenesis were identified by nucleotide sequencing using a Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Secondly, all amplified sequences were completely sequenced to verify that no unintended mutations were introduced during the procedure. DNA was sequenced at the UNC-CH Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division) using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1–0.3 mm) and further incubation at 37 °C or room temperature for 4–5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. For extraction and purification of protein, the cell pellets were resuspended in NETN buffer containing protease inhibitors and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (53Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Aliquots were sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatants were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and finally resuspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. For some applications the GST fusion proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm glutathione). The carboxyl-terminal domains of FAK and CAKβ were cleaved from GST and purified as follows. Bacterial lysates were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2). The sample was further dialyzed against this buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Approximately 105 μg of thrombin (Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT) was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mm to stop the reaction. The sample was clarified by centrifugation, and the FAK/CAKβ proteins were purified by chromatography on three columns. The samples were first run on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA). Then the samples were run on a Sephadex G75 column equilibrated with elution buffer and finally on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.4, 0.2m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After each column, fractions containing the FAK/CAKβ proteins were identified by monitoring absorption at A 280 andA 260 and verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The fractions were pooled and concentrated using centricon concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) before loading onto the next column. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IPEGAL (equivalent to Nonidet P-40), 0.5% deoxycholate) or Tx-RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) containing 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm vanadate. The protein concentration of lysates was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 0.5–1 mg of protein and approximately 5 μg of purified antibody or 5 μl of antiserum. After incubation on ice for 1 h, immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) or goat anti-mouse agarose beads (Sigma) by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in Tris-buffered saline and eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by Western blotting. FAK antibodies BC4 (equivalent to BC3) and 2A7 and the KT3 monoclonal antibody recognizing the KT3 epitope tag were gifts of Dr. Tom Parsons. A paxillin monoclonal antibody and the RC20 phosphotyrosine antibody were purchased (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). A paxillin polyclonal antiserum was prepared as described below. GST-PaxN1-C3 (containing amino acids 113–312 of paxillin) was used as antigen to prepare polyvalent rabbit antiserum as described previously (55Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified on glutathione beads, eluted with 1% SDS, and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. For primary immunizations, 1 mg of fusion protein in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into female New Zealand White rabbits. For all boosts, 500 μg of antigen in phosphate-buffered saline was emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. Serum was prepared by centrifugation of cellular and clotted material from whole blood. The antiserum was characterized using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of lysates of CE cells. Specificity of the antiserum was determined by comparison with preimmune serum.3 For in vitro binding assays using GST fusion proteins, cell lysates were precleared with GST immobilized to glutathione beads (10 μg of GST/mg of lysate) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants were dispensed into 200-μg aliquots and incubated with 1, 5, or 10 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in Tris-buffered saline. The samples were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were dialyzed against BIAcore buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA). GST antibody (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) with EDC/NHS cross-linking following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Two different surface densities (500 and 250 response units) of GST, GST-PaxN1-C1A, GST-PaxN2-C3, and GST-PaxN1-C3 were immobilized on the sensor chip by capture with the GST antibody. A flow cell to which GST alone was captured was also used as a control. The purified carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK or CAKβ was injected into the flow cell over a range of concentrations (0.039–10 μm), and BIAcore buffer was used as a blank control. This procedure was then repeated. Sensorgram signals were corrected by subtracting binding to the GST control surface. The data were analyzed using the BIAEvaluation version 3.0 software provided with the instrument. This software performs simultaneous global data fitting of the sensorgrams and provides reliable estimates of kinetic binding constants. Corrected sensorgrams were fit to model equations within the BIAEvaluation program to determine binding affinities. Single site interactions (i.e. between GST-PaxN1-C1A or GST-PaxN2-C3 and FAK or CAKβ) optimally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir (kinetic) model and a steady state affinity (equilibrium) model, which best described the data. Similar results were obtained from both methods of analysis. Data fitting was not improved by the use of more sophisticated binding analysis models. The suitability of the models for the observed data was determined by chi-square analysis and residual plot analysis. Previously published data demonstrate that two nonoverlapping fragments of paxillin contain FAK binding activity (37Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We initially sought to verify this result. Because our early e"

The 4.2-kilobase pair cDNA contains an open reading frame of 762 base pairs encoding a 253-amino acid protein with two putative transmembrane domains. mc3s5/mtCLIC protein shares extensive homology with a family of intracellular organelle chloride channels but is the first shown to be differentially regulated. mc3s5/mtCLIC mRNA is expressed to the greatest extent in vivo in heart, lung, liver, kidney, and skin, with reduced levels in some organs fromp53−/− mice. mc3s5/mtCLIC mRNA and protein are higher in p53+/+ compared withp53−/− basal keratinocytes in culture, and both increase in differentiating keratinocytes independent of genotype. Overexpression of p53 in keratinocytes induces mc3s5/mtCLIC mRNA and protein. Exogenous human recombinant tumor necrosis factor α also up-regulates mc3s5/mtCLIC mRNA and protein in keratinocytes. Subcellular fractionation of keratinocytes indicates that both the green fluorescent protein-mc3s5 fusion protein and the endogenous mc3s5/mtCLIC are localized to the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Similarly, mc3s5/mtCLIC was localized to mitochondria and cytoplasmic fractions of rat liver homogenates. Furthermore, mc3s5/mtCLIC colocalized with cytochrome oxidase in keratinocyte mitochondria by immunofluorescence and was also detected in the cytoplasmic compartment. Sucrose gradient-purified mitochondria from rat liver confirmed this mitochondrial localization. This represents the first report of localization of a CLIC type chloride channel in mitochondria and the first indication that expression of an organellular chloride channel can be regulated by p53 and tumor necrosis factor α."

A number of regulatory mechanisms ensure optimal deoxyribonucleotide pools, which are essential for cell viability. The best studied mechanisms are transcriptional regulation of the RNR genes during the cell cycle and in the response to DNA damage, and the allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reductase by nucleoside triphosphates. Recently, another mode of RNR regulation has been hypothesized in yeast.

Both the yeast and mammalian ribonucleotide reductases belong to the ribonucleotide reductase class Ia; in this class, the active enzymes consist of a large subunit and a small one (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, these two non-identical homodimeric subunits are encoded by the R1 and R2 genes, respectively. The R1 protein contains redox-active dithiols, the active site binding nucleoside diphosphate substrates and binding sites for nucleoside triphosphates that act as allosteric effectors. Substrate specificity is controlled by binding of ATP, dATP, dTTP, or dGTP to a specificity site, whereas overall activity is controlled by binding of ATP (active) or dATP (inactive) to an activity site (2Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions In Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). Failure to control the size of dNTP pools and/or their relative amounts leads to cell death or genetic abnormalities (3Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The R2 protein contributes a tyrosyl-free radical, which is essential for RNR activity; this radical is generated by a binuclear iron center (2Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions In Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). The flexible C-terminal tail of the R2 polypeptide chain is essential for the R1 and R2 interaction, and upon binding to the R1 protein, the flexible R2 protein tail becomes rigid (4Lycksell P.O. Ingemarson R. Davis R. Graslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Peptides and peptidomimetics corresponding to the R2 protein C-terminal inhibit ribonucleotide reductase in a species specific way (5Liuzzi M. Deziel R. Moss N. Beaulieu P. Bonneau A.M. Bousquet C.

Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the yeast RNR genes suppresses the lethality of strains lacking Mec1 or Rad53, supposedly by increasing the dNTP pools (12Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2956-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Unlike the mammalian enzyme, the yeast RNR is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of dATP; this observation explains the positive correlation between enzyme and dNTP levels in yeast. 2A. Chabes and L. Thelander, submitted for publication. Recently, Zhaoet al. (13Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) identified a novel protein that negatively affects dNTP pools in yeast, and they called it Sml1p. Deletion ofSML1 rescued the lethality of a mec1 orrad53 strain. Sml1p was shown to interact with the yeast Rnr1 protein using the two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitations. For this reason, a novel mode of RNR regulation was suggested, where Sml1p binding to the Rnr1 protein would inhibit the enzyme. Using highly purified recombinant proteins, we now directly demonstrate in an in vitro yeast ribonucleotide reductase assay that Sml1p is indeed a very potent inhibitor of yeast RNR. It specifically binds to the yeast Rnr1p as shown by biosensor technique using sensor chips with immobilized Sml1p. Interestingly, the Sml1p also specifically binds to the mouse R1 protein with high affinity. However, the inhibition seen in an in vitro mouse ribonucleotide reductase assay is less pronounced than in the yeast system, which indicates an inhibition mechanism different from the one in yeast. These findings may be used to develop a new generation of antiproliferative drugs targeted to RNR. The recombinant yeast proteins Rnr1, Rnr2, and Rnr4 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) bacteria using the pET3a expression vector; mouse recombinant proteins R1 and R2 were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria using the same vector (14Studier F.W.

Thelander, manuscript in preparation. TheSML1 coding sequence (13Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CAA TAA TTT CCC CAT ATG CAA AAT TCC-3′ and 5′-AAA GGA TCC TTA GAA GTC CAT TTC CTC GAC-3′. After the polymerase chain reaction product was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, it was cloned into the pET3a vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. The SML1 sequence in the resulting plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing. Recombinant yeast Sml1p was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria by growing a culture at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, followed by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 25% saturation at 0 °C (0.136 g/ml). The pellet was dissolved in the same buffer as above; finally, the solution was centrifuged through Ultrafree-MC Millipore 30,000 NMWL filter units with a 30-kDa cut-off value to obtain pure Sml1 protein in the filtrate. N-acetylated peptides corresponding to the last 9 amino acids of either Rnr2p (GAFTFNEDF), Rnr4p (KEINFDDDF), or Sml1p (QGKVEEMDF) were ordered from Genosys. Protein concentrations were determined by reading the absorbance at 280 nm, and using the earlier published E1%1 cm of 12 (mouse R1 and yeast Rnr1 proteins; Ref. 15Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J.

Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The corresponding value for the Rnr2p/Rnr4p heterodimer (12.9) was obtained from quantitative amino acid hydrolysis of aliquots from solutions with known absorbance. The concentration of Sml1p solutions was determined using an E 1%1 cm of 7.1 based on calculations (DNAstar, Inc.) from the amino acid composition. The interaction between Sml1p and either yeast Rnr1p or mouse R1 protein was studied by biosensor analysis using the BIAcore method (Biacore AB). The Sml1 protein was prepared in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at a concentration of 0.44 mg/ml; it was then immobilized on the dextran layer of the sensor chip as described previously for the mouse R2 protein (17Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ligand proteins were equilibrated with running buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.05% Surfactant P20 (BIAcore). The interactions were studied at a constant temperature of 22 °C and a constant flow of 5 μl/min. Kinetics for the interaction of Sml1p with yeast Rnr1p was determined by allowing the immobilized Sml1p to interact with increasing concentrations of Rnr1p (18Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resonance unit (RU) is proportional to the mass, and 1 RU corresponds to a surface concentration of 1 pg of protein/mm2 of the 100-nm thick dextran layer (19Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. et al.BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Rnr1p (500 μg) was incubated in 0.1 ml of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm dTTP if indicated, in the presence or absence of 90 μg of Sml1 protein. After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, the samples were cooled on ice and mixed with 0.75 μg of bovine liver catalase (Sigma); catalase served as a marker for the determination of sedimentation coefficients. The 0.1-ml samples were layered onto 4.0 ml of a 5–20% linear gradient of sucrose in the same buffer as above, and centrifuged for 14 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 60 rotor at 4 °C. The bottom of each tube was punctured, and fractions of approximately 0.1 ml were collected. Aliquots of each fraction were removed for spectrophotometric assay of catalase activity (20Chance B. Herbert D. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 402-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), protein concentration as determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), or SDS-PAGE analysis. As seen in Fig. 1, pure recombinant Sml1 protein was obtained after only three purification steps: ultracentrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and ultrafiltration. The yield was about 1 mg of pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. Recombinant yeast ribonucleotide reductase was assayed for activity using a CDP reduction assay, with ATP as a positive effector in the presence of increasing amounts of Sml1 protein (Fig. 2). A molar ratio of 1:1 between Rnr1p monomer (M r 100,000) and Sml1p (M r 11,800) gave about 50% inhibition. The amounts of Rnr2p/Rnr4p heterodimer were varied (1–32 μg) at one fixed amount of Rnr1p (2 μg) and 0, 0.2, and 2 μg of Sml1p; this experiment did not give any evidence of competition between Sml1p and the Rnr2p/Rnr4p heterodimer for binding to Rnr1p. Instead the data fitted best to a noncompetitive inhibition (data not shown). The C-terminal sequence of the Sml1p shows some homology to the C-terminal peptides of the Rnr2 or Rnr4 proteins. Because such peptides are known to inhibit RNR activity by binding to the R1 protein and preventing R1/R2 interaction, we wanted to study the influence of a C-terminal nonapeptide of Sml1p on yeast RNR activity. As shown in Fig. 3, nonapeptides from the C terminus of Rnr2p or Rnr4p inhibited the in vitro yeast RNR assay to about the same extent with an IC50 of 44 and 30 μm, respectively. In contrast, the nonapeptide corresponding to the C terminus of Sml1p showed an inhibition with an IC50 of only about 300 μm. For enzymatic activity, ribonucleotide reductases of the class Ia-type must form a heterodimeric complex composed of homodimeric R1 and R2 proteins. It was previously demonstrated for the mouse RNR that binding of effectors to the substrate specificity site promotes formation of the R1 dimer, which is believed to be a prerequisite for binding to the R2 dimer (18Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,23Thelander L. Eriksson S. Åkerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if Sml1p binding to the Rnr1p might interfere with Rnr1p dimer formation and thereby inhibit RNR activity, we preincubated Rnr1p and Sml1p in the presence of the allosteric effector dTTP; we then analyzed the mixture on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 4). The addition of dTTP induced formation of dimers and tetramers of the Rnr1p, and no monomer peak could be seen in the gradient. This pattern is quite different from the one shown in the absence of dTTP, where the Rnr1p monomers dominate (Fig. 4). Addition of Sml1p did not influence the distribution of Rnr1p in the gradient, and no shift from dimers to monomers could be observed. At the same time, analysis of the fractions by SDS-PAGE clearly demonstrated two peaks of Sml1p, one minor peak cosedimenting with the dimer peak of Rnr1p, and one major peak representing free Sml1p sedimenting at the top of the gradient. The fact that a portion of Sml1 protein was present in the fractions containing the Rnr1p dimers indicates that the Sml1p can bind to the Rnr1p dimer without dissociating it into monomers. No shift toward Rnr1p monomers was observed under the following conditions: the Rnr1p/Sml1p/dTTP incubation mixture was sedimented through a gradient containing Sml1p at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml throughout to minimize Rnr1p-Sml1p dissociation (data not shown). Therefore, binding of Sml1p did not influence the monomer/dimer equilibrium of the Rnr1p. To obtain a quantitative description of the Rnr1p and Sml1p interaction, we immobilized the Sml1 protein to the dextran layer of a sensor chip and then injected a series of solutions containing increasing concentrations of Rnr1p to the same sensor chip. The immobilization of Sml1p at a concentration of 0.44 mg/ml gave an increase of 91 RU, which correspond to 91 pg/mm2. With a surface of 0.8 mm2, 91 RU corresponds to a total of 72.8 pg of bound Sml1p, which can be compared with the total injected amount of 15.4 μg. This low degree of attachment (only 0.0005%) makes it unlikely that the protein is attached to multiple binding sites. Increasing concentrations of Rnr1p resulted in increasing equilibrium values, which approached a maximal value (Fig. 5 A). In control experiments, where the same series of Rnr1p solutions passed a sensor chip without immobilized Sml1p, a “bulk effect” gave a response of only about 60 RU. The same background value of about 60 RU was observed when bovine serum albumin or Rnr2p/Rnr4p heterodimer was injected at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (data not shown). In Fig. 5 B, the response at equilibrium is plotted against the concentration of injected Rnr1p. Using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, Inc.), an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of 0.41 ± 0.1 μm and a maximal binding of 691 RU were obtained. These values correspond to 691 pg/mm2 or a total of 553 pg or 5.5 fmol of Rnr1p monomer bound to about 6.2 fmol of immobilized Sml1p, i.e. nearly one Rnr1p monomer bound per molecule of immobilized Sml1p. Using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB), an association rate constant of about 153,000m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate constant of 0.04 s−1 were obtained from the lower curves in Fig. 5 A. Calculating the equilibrium dissociation constant from these rate constants gave a K D of about 0.25 μm, which is close to the directly determinedK D . Mixing the Rnr1p with Rnr2p/Rnr4p heterodimer, with or without dTTP before injection, did not affect the curves; the same results were obtained as when Rnr1p was injected alone. The effects of Sml1 protein on pure recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase were tested in a CDP assay in the presence of ATP as a positive effector (Fig. 6). In the figure, RNR activity in the presence of a fixed amount of R1 protein, and in the presence or absence of a 300-fold molar excess of Sml1p, are plotted against increasing concentrations of the R2 protein. In contrast to the situation with the yeast RNR, this inhibition is less pronounced and dependent on the R1 to R2 ratio. In a double reciprocal plot, clear competition is observed between Sml1p and the R2 protein (data not shown). After observing inhibition of the mouse RNR by Sml1p, we wanted to characterize the binding between the mouse R1 protein and Sml1p. As before, the Sml1p was immobilized on a sensor chip, and a solution containing 0.1 mg/ml of mouse R1 protein was injected (Fig. 7). On injection, a very rapid association phase was observed; this phase was immediately followed by a prolonged dissociation phase that never reached an equilibrium plateau. Injecting the R1 solution over an empty sensor chip gave the same low background value as observed earlier. Injection of mouse R2 protein also resulted in only background values (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the unexpected behavior of the mouse R1 protein was due to improperly immobilized Sml1p, we injected 0.1 mg/ml of the yeast Rnr1 protein; we observed the same type of response as in Fig. 5 A, with a clear equilibrium plateau. Knowing that allosteric effectors affect the conformation of R1 proteins, we next mixed the mouse R1 protein with dTTP before injection. This time, a rapid association phase was followed by a clear equilibrium plateau; this sensorgram resembled the sensorgram obtained with the yeast Rnr1p. Finally, we mixed the mouse R1 protein plus dTTP with R2 protein before injection, expecting to see an R1-R2 complex bound to Sml1p. However, the R2 protein addition almost abolished the specific R1 binding, and resulted in almost background values. No attempts were made to quantify the mouse R1 binding data, because the sensorgrams deviated widely from standard curves. Our in vitro data directly prove the hypothesis of Zhaoet al. (13Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) that the yeast Sml1 protein is a physiological inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase; this is a new concept in the RNR field. So far, no mammalian homologue has been identified, and no homologous proteins could be found in available data bases. This situation may reflect different control of ribonucleotide reductase activity in yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, transcriptional activation of the RNR genes and suppression of the Sml1 protein lead to increased RNR activity and deoxyribonucleotide pools after DNA damage (12Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2956-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 13Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In contrast, mammalian cells control RNR activity by an S-phase/DNA-damage specific stabilization of the R2 protein, until cells enter into mitosis, in combination with negative feedback regulation by dATP2. We suggest that the Sml1 protein may substitute for dATP feedback regulation, since yeast RNR is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of dATP. Therefore, unlike in mammalian cells, there is a direct correlation between levels of RNR proteins and deoxyribonucleotide pools in yeast cells. The Sml1 protein specifically binds to the yeast Rnr1 protein with a dissociation constant of 0.4 μm and in a 1:1 ratio at saturation. Binding did not influence the R1 monomer/dimer equilibrium, and no competition with the R2-R4 heterodimer was observed. These observations may indicate separate binding areas on the R1 protein, or that the affinity of the Rnr1p/Sml1p interaction is much higher compared with the Rnr1p interaction with the R2/R4 heterodimer. For mouse and E. coli RNRs, the dissociation constant for the R1-R2 complex was reported to be around 0.1 μm (18Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the subunit interaction in the yeast RNR appears much weaker, however, and we have not yet been able to quantify it. On a molar basis, the Sml1 protein is about 200 times more efficient in inhibiting yeast RNR activity than its C-terminal nonapeptide. Furthermore, unlike Sml1p inhibition, peptide inhibition depends on the concentration of the R2-R4 heterodimer. The yeast Rnr1 protein and the mouse R1 protein show 68% amino acid sequence identity, and the sequence similarities are distributed along the whole polypeptide chain. Still, it was quite unexpected that the Sml1 protein would also specifically bind to the mouse R1 protein. However, as indicated by the sensorgram that shows mouse R1 binding to Sml1p, the initial rapid binding was followed by a prolonged dissociation that is prevented by the addition of dTTP. This finding may indicate conformational changes induced by dTTP that makes the R1 protein a better target, or that binding of the R1 dimer is preferred. Furthermore, both in the mouse RNR assay and in the biosensor experiments, clear competition was observed between Sml1p and the mouse R2 protein for binding to the R1 protein. Therefore, the inhibition mechanism may differ for yeast and mouse RNR enzymes. Although inhibition in the yeast system is very efficient and may involve blocking the entrance to the active site, inhibition in the mouse system is rather inefficient and may reflect blocking R2 protein binding to the R1 protein, perhaps in the same way as R2 protein C-terminal peptides. We hope that structural studies of the Sml1 protein, alone and bound to the R1 protein will reveal the mechanism of inhibition. This finding should be useful in developing specific antiproliferative inhibitors of RNR; such new inhibitors could complement existing ones, which include radical scavengers, iron chelators, and peptidomimetics (2Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions In Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar).

Inoculation of tobacco leaves with incompatible pathogens triggers the biosynthesis of SA which accumulates primarily as the SA 2-O-β-d-glucoside (SAG) and glucosyl salicylate (GS).

In tobacco cultivars containing theN gene for resistance, the hypersensitive response occurs after inoculation with incompatible pathogens including tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or Pseudomonas syringae pv.phaseolicola. The hypersensitive response is characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions which restrict the spread of pathogens and by a dramatic increase in SA levels in the inoculated leaf and, to a lesser extent, throughout the plant. Concomitant with the appearance of SA is an accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and the establishment of systemic acquired resistance throughout the plant. Direct evidence showing the involvement of SA in disease resistance came from a study of transgenic plants that were unable to accumulate SA or to establish systemic acquired resistance (5Gaffney T. Friedrich L. Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Ukness S. Ward E. Kesmann H. Ryals J. Science. 1993; 261: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants showed that mutants with high levels of SA exhibited enhanced disease resistance while plants unable to respond to exogenous SA were impaired in their disease-resistance response (6Durner J. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 266-274Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SA was shown to be involved in production of active oxygen species and cell death (7Draper J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 162-165Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Like other plant hormones, SA is present in plants as both a free acid and as conjugated metabolites generated primarily by methylation, hydroxylation, and glucosylation. Among the SA conjugates, the SA 2-O-β-d-glucoside (SAG) has been identified as a predominant and stable metabolite in many plants, including tobacco. In TMV-inoculated tobacco possessing the N gene, newly synthesized SA is converted primarily to glucosylated and methylated conjugates (8Enyedi A.J. Yapani N. Silverman P. Raskin I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2480-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Shulaev V. Silverman P. Raskin I. Nature. 1997; 385: 718-721Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The glucosylated forms are localized in the vicinity of the necrotic lesions, while methyl salicylate is volatilized. Glucosyl salicylate (GS), an ester form, was also recently identified as a SA metabolite in virus- or bacteria-inoculated tobacco (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In vivo tracer studies with tobacco leaves fed [14C]SA showed that the SAG accumulates over time while GS formation is more transient and occurs rapidly after SA administration. Rapid GS formation may serve as a protective mechanism from the phytotoxic effects of high concentrations of SA, while the more stable SAG may be a slow-release storage form of SA. The precise role of each conjugated form is, however, difficult to document. In tobacco, two SA glucosyltransferase (SA GTase) activities leading to the formation of both SAG and GS were detected (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Edwards R. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 609-614Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Enyedi A.J. Raskin I. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UDP-glucose:SA GTase (SAGT) catalyzed the conversion of SA to SAG, while formation of GS was catalyzed by UDP-glucose:SA carboxyl GTase. Both enzyme activities were enhanced in pathogen-inoculated or SA-treated tobacco plants. However, little is known about how closely these two glucosyltransferases are related to each other and whether they are products of one gene or a gene family. For reasons of simplicity, therefore, we will refer to the SA glucosyltransferase simply as SA GTase, realizing that it results from the combined activities of both SAGT and SA carboxyl GTase. In oat, the glucosyltransferase displaying SAGT activity was partially purified (195-fold) and characterized (13Yalpani N. Schulz M. Davis M.P. Balke N.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here, we purified to near homogeneity, characterized, and partially sequenced the glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the in vitro conversion of SA to GS (an ester form) and to a lesser extent to SAG (a more stable glucoside). Using the peptide sequence information obtained from the purified protein, we were able to isolate and characterize the cDNA clone for the purified SA GTase. We also confirmed that the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli converted SA to both GS and SAG. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi-nc NN genotype) were grown as described previously (14Yalpani N. Silverman P. Wilson T.M.A. Kleier D.A. Raskin I. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). SA infiltration or inoculation of either tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (NPS3121) (15Lindgren P.B. Peet R.C. Panopoulus N.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was described previously (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For SA incubation, leaf disks were floated on a solution containing SA at the indicated concentration. Distilled water was used as a control. For inhibition of protein synthesis, the leaf disks were preincubated in 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) solution for 1 h and then floated in solutions containing either 20 μg/ml CHX alone or 20 μg/ml CHX and 1 mm SA. All of the samples harvested at the indicated time points were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for RNA extraction. Frozen tobacco leaves were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, and resuspended in 20 mm triethanolamine (TEA) buffer (pH 7.3) containing 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, and 2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone. The tissue slurry was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min and supernatant filtered through Miracloth. The filtrate was used for further purification. The protein fractions which precipitated between 40 and 75% of ammonium sulfate saturation were isolated by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm TEA buffer containing 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (TEAM) and desalted in a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was equilibrated with TEAM buffer. After desalting, the protein samples were subject to Mono Q FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was equilibrated with TEAM buffer. The proteins were eluted with a 0–2 m KCl gradient in TEAM buffer (pH 7.3) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions were collected and assayed for enzyme activity and protein concentration. The fractions containing enzyme activity were desalted on a PD-10 column and concentrated using a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). Concentrated active fractions from the Mono Q column were applied to a UDP-glucuronic acid affinity column (Sigma). The eluent and washed fractions that contained the enzyme activity were collected and used for further purification. The glucosyltransferase activity was not detected in the fractions eluted with salts or UDP-glucose. The active fractions were further purified with a Hitrap Blue affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which was linked to the Ranin FPLC/HPLC system. After washing the column with 20 mm TEAM buffer, the active fractions were eluted from the column with 10 mm UDP and concentrated with a Centricon 30. After removal of UDP, the fractions were assayed for the enzyme activity. Active fractions from the dye affinity column were applied to the Superose 12 FPLC column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 20 mm TEAM. Fractions were assayed for enzyme activity and protein concentration. The enzyme extract in 25 mmbis-Tris (pH 6.3) was applied to a Mono P chromatofocusing column. Fractions were eluted with 100 ml of diluted Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a linear pH range of 7.0–4.0. Fractions (1 ml) were collected in tubes containing 1 ml of TEA buffer in order to reduce the inhibitory effect of Polybuffer 74 on the enzyme activity. Polybuffer from each fraction was removed after centrifugation using the Centricon 30. Thereafter, each fraction was assayed for enzyme activity or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples from each step of protein purification were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized with a silver-staining procedure. Protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Blue dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). The purified protein fraction containing SA GTase was separated on SDS gel and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein band was stained with Coomassie Blue and excised after destaining. After elution of the protein from the membrane, the sample was digested with Lys-C endopeptidase. The peptide fragments were then separated by HPLC, followed by peptide sequence analysis. Three of the peptide fragments, SGP1, SGP2, and SGP3, were microsequenced by Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). The enzyme assay for SA GTase activity was described previously (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as formation of 1 μmol of either GS or SAG min−1 from SA. From the two internal peptide sequences (SGP1 and SGP3) of the purified SA GTase, two degenerate oligonucleotides, LP1S and LP3A, were designed and used as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. LP1S is 5′-GARGCNGARCARATGGRAGA-3′ and LP3S is 5′-CCCATYTCCCANACRTCYTC-3′. PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase as suggested by manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and visualized after ethidium bromide staining. The PCR product was recovered from the agarose gel with a gel extraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The purified PCR fragment was then labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primering and used as a probe to screen 100,000 plaque forming units from an SA-induced λ TriplEx cDNA library constructed byCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. Forty positive plaques were selected and evaluated on the basis of their insert sizes by PCR. One positive plaque containing the longest insert in λ TriplEx was further purified and converted to the pTriplEx vector viaCre-lox recombination. The insert was sequenced by an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was prepared using Tri reagents (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA gel blotting, total RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1.3% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gels and blotted on nylon membranes (Zeta probe, Bio-Rad). Cloned DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random priming method (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 137: 266-267Google Scholar). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). The coding region of the SA GTase cDNA was subcloned into the pET30a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The recombinant protein was then expressed in BL-21 (DE3) after isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction according to manufacturer's recommendation. The glucosyltransferase activity leading to the formation of either SAG or GS was detected in tobacco plants treated with SA or inoculated with TMV or P. syringae pv.phaseolicola where induction of both enzyme activities was localized to the infected areas (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Edwards R. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 609-614Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Enyedi A.J. Raskin I. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Tobacco plants inoculated with TMV and incubated at 32 °C for 4 days showed no change in SA content or glucosyltransferase activity. However, a temperature shift to 24 °C resulted in similar induction of both glucosyltransferase activities in the whole infected leaves (data not shown). Since protein purification requires large quantities of plant material, tissue samples were prepared either from tobacco leaves 6 h after SA infiltration (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or from TMV-inoculated tobacco leaves 12 h after temperature shift from 32 to 24 °C, when the SA glucosyltransferase activity was maximum. The enzyme in crude extracts was stable for months when stored at −80 °C. However, the enzyme activity was sensitive to oxidation (data not shown). Therefore, β-mercaptoethanol was always included in the extraction buffer as a reducing reagent. Comparison of relative enzyme activities in different buffer systems showed that the optimum pH for this enzyme is around pH 7.0. SA GTase activity was also relatively high in TEAM buffer at pH 7.3 which is a recommended buffer for Mono Q column. Therefore, TEAM buffer at pH 7.3 was used as the buffer system for the entire purification protocol. Most of the SA GTase activity (>95%) was recovered from the 40–75% fractionation with ammonium sulfate. This step allowed the protein sample to be purified approximately 2-fold and to be concentrated for anion exchange chromatography. The enzyme activity was detected as a single peak after FPLC separation on a Mono Q column. Although the SA GTase had no affinity for UDP-glucuronic acid, some of the UDP-glucuronic acid-binding proteins with molecular masses of 40–50 kDa were eliminated from the extract using a UDP-glucuronic acid affinity column. However, SA GTase was able to bind to a blue dye-ligand affinity column, providing a considerable purification. Glucosyltransferase substrates, SA or UDP-glucose, were unable to elute the glucosyltransferase from the dye affinity column (data not shown). Only UDP, the end product of the reaction, eluted the enzyme with relatively high specificity. Because UDP inhibited the enzyme activity in the eluted fraction, UDP had to be removed from the sample by Centricon filtration. The SA GTase could also be eluted from the blue dye-ligand affinity column with a salt gradient, along with many other proteins (data not shown). Therefore, gel filtration chromatography was used as the final purification step to eliminate proteins with high molecular mass. A summary of the efficiency of the purification process is provided in Table I. The protein patterns at various steps of this purification are shown in Fig. 1. After the final purification step, SA GTase protein appeared as a dominant single peptide on a silver-stained gel.Table IPurification of SA GtasePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activityaOne unit is defined as the formation of 1 μmol · min−1 of GS from SA.Specific activityEnrichmentRecoveryμgunitsunits mg −1-fold%Crude extract50,0001,85031.0100(NH4)2SO440–75%31,1001,775571.595Ion-exchange2102171,03228.011UDPGA affinity2102421,15031.511Dye affinity17.51377,850195.07Gel filtration0.43479,5002,000.02a One unit is defined as the formation of 1 μmol · min−1 of GS from SA. Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the SA GTase is a monomer or a multimer, the molecular masses of denatured and native forms of this protein were estimated by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. The molecular mass of the denatured protein was around 48 kDa in SDS gel when compared with protein standards (data not shown). Similarly, the native form of the enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa estimated by gel filtration on Superose 12, indicating that the glucosyltransferase is a monomeric protein. The SA GTase activity is induced by SA (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it was never determined whether the enhanced glucosyltransferase activity is due to activation of a pre-existing enzyme or due to an increase in the de novo biosynthesis of the enzyme. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, the glucosyltransferase activity was partially purified from the leaves of both the TMV-resistant tobacco cultivar (Xanthi-nc NN genotype) and the TMV susceptible tobacco cultivar (Xanthi-nc nn genotype) after SA treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and4) by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange, and affinity chromatographic steps. SDS gel analysis showed that the 48-kDa protein band attributed to SA GTase was strongly induced in both tobacco plants treated with SA (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4), compared with that in healthy control plants (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3). The staining intensity of the putative SA GTase protein in the gel also correlated with the enzyme activity in respective fractions. The purified enzyme was tested for substrate specificity using various nucleotide sugars as glucose donors and phenolic compounds as glucose acceptors. Only UDP-glucose served as the glucose donor for the SA GTase. None of the other tested nucleotide diphosphate glucose compounds or UDP-glucose analogues functioned as sugar donors for the enzyme (Table II). In contrast, the SA GTase possessed a range of substrate specificities toward phenolic compounds forming glucose esters with the carboxyl groups. All the tested phenolics were glucosylated, while plant hormones such as IAA, GA3, and zeatin were not glucosylated. Interestingly, the enzyme showed the highest activity with benzoic acid, a biosynthetic precursor of SA, among tested phenolics.Table IISpecificity of the purified enzyme for glucose acceptors and donorsSubstrateRelative activityGlucose acceptorsSalicylic acid1.0trans-Cinnamic acid1.1Benzoic acid5.73-Hydroxybenzoic acid1.14-Hydroxybenzoic acid3.5IAA0GA30Zeatin0Glucose donorsUDP-Glc1.0UDP-GA0UDP-Gal0CDP-Glc0GDP-Glc0TDP-Glc0 Open table in a new tab The pI of the SA GTase was determined by Mono P chromatofocusing chromatography. The enzyme activity was detected between pH 4.3 and 4.4. In addition, the glucosyltransferase activity was slightly increased by the addition of divalent cations such as 10 mm Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (data not shown). EDTA (5 mm) appeared to have no effect on either the stability or activity of this enzyme, while Zn2+ (10 mm) had a strong inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity (data not shown). Consistent with UDP-glucose being the sole glucose donor, the SA GTase was inhibited by UDP, an end product of the enzyme reaction (data not shown). The apparent K m for UDP-glucose was 0.27 mm which is similar to the K m values of other known glucosyltransferases. In contrast, the apparentK m for SA was 1–2 mm. The SA GTase was partially purified from tobacco plants treated with 1 mm SA by the combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column, and dye-affinity chromatography (see Table I). After Lys-C endopeptidase digestion and HPLC separation of the purified protein samples prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the amino acid sequences of the three longest peptide fragments were determined by Edman degradation. A 320-base pair PCR fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the degenerate oligonucleotides designed from the amino acid sequences of the two peptide fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The PCR product was then used to screen a SA-induced cDNA library which was constructed in λ TriplEx with mRNA from tobacco leaves induced with SA for 6 h. Among the 40 positive clones, the longest clone was isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length clone is shown in Fig. 3. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 1,377 base pairs that encodes a protein of 459 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass (51.3 kDa) of the cDNA encoded protein is close to the molecular mass (∼48 kDa) of the purified glucosyltransferase determined by gel filtration on Superose 12. The cDNA-encoded protein contained domains that perfectly matched the sequences of all three internal peptide fragments of the purified protein. The locations of amino acid sequences corresponding to all peptide sequences of the purified protein are indicated in Fig. 3. The degree of homology between the cDNA-encoded protein and other glucosyltransferases is shown in Fig. 4. The highly homologous proteins are plant glucosyltransferases such as indole acetic acid (IAA) glucosyltransferase (19Szerszen J.B. Szczyglowski K. Bandurski R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 1699-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and flavonol glucosyltransferase (20Ralston E.J. English J.J. Dooner H.K. Genetics. 1988; 119: 185-197PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine if the isolated putative glucosyltransferase gene encodes an active SA GTase enzyme, the coding region of the corresponding cDNA was introduced into an overexpression vector, pET30a, and the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli. Following the addition of UDP-glucose and [14C]SA, two 14C-glucosylated metabolites of SA were formed only in the reaction mixture containing the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacterial lysates expressing the recombinant protein (Fig. 5). The identity of the labeled products as SAG and GS was confirmed by their R F values and following treatment with β-glucosidase and esterase. Treatment with glucosidase resulted in conversion of both metabolites back to SA, while esterase treatment, as expected, was only able to hydrolyze GS back to SA (data not shown). Furthermore, the recombinant protein converted [14C]UDP-glucose to radioactive-labeled SAG and GS when non-radioactive SA was used as the glucose acceptor (data not shown). The E. coli expression data indicate that the cDNA clone encodes functionally active SA GTase. To further confirm the functional identity of the recombinant enzyme, the substrate specificity of the recombinant SA GTase was tested with various phenolics as glucose acceptors. Similar to the SA GTase purified from tobacco, the recombinant protein from E. colishowed a broad range of glucose acceptor specificity (Table III). Consistent with the benzoic acid being the most favored substrate of the purified enzyme, the recombinant protein showed high substrate specificity toward benzoic acid.Table IIISpecificity of the recombinant SA GTase for glucose acceptorGlucose AcceptorGlucosylation siteRelative Activity-foldSalicylic acid−COOH1.0−OH0.8trans-Cinnamic acid−COOH1.3Benzoic acid−COOH6.03-Hydroxybenzoic acid−COOH7.74-Hydroxybenzoic acid−COOH5.5IAA−COOH0.3GA3−COOH0.0Zeatin−COOH0.0 Open table in a new tab It was shown that the SA GTase activities involved in the formation of SAG and GS were induced during pathogen inoculation (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine if the enhanced enzyme activity was due to transcriptional activation. In tobacco inoculated with TMV and incubated at 32 °C for 4 days, SA GTase mRNA began to accumulate between 6 and 8 h after temperature shift (32 → 24 °C) and was maintained at high levels for at least 4 h (Fig. 6 A). In P. syringaepv. phaseolicola inoculated tobacco, levels of the corresponding mRNA increased 12 h postinoculation and were maintained 24 h postinoculation when the infected tobacco leaves began to collapse (Fig. 6 B). In TMV- or Pseudomonas-inoculated tobacco, the timing of induction of the SA GTase mRNA correlated with the accumulation of SA (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that SA is involved in the transcriptional activation of the SA GTase mRNA. The SA GTase activity was shown earlier to be rapidly induced in response to SA (10Lee H.-I. Raskin I. Phytopathology. 1998; 88: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We wanted to perform a more detailed analysis of induction pattern of the SA GTase mRNA following SA infiltration (Fig. 6 C). The levels of SA GTase mRNA began to increase within 1 h with a maximum reached by 2 h, and then decreased rapidly. SA GTase mRNA returned to background expression levels between 6 and 24 h. The rapid inducibility of SA GTase mRNA by SA suggested that this gene might be classified as an early SA response gene. In order to study the effect of CHX on the SA GTase expression, a time course experiment on the SA-treated leaves was carried out in the presence or absence of CHX (Fig. 7). In control tobacco treated with H2O, there were no significant changes in the mRNA levels during the time course, while SA alone temporarily induced the SA GTase mRNA. However, following treatment with CHX alone or a combination of SA and CHX, the mRNA accumulated steadily and remained high for 24 h. As expected, PR1agene, one of the late SA inducible genes, was induced by SA treatment alone (Fig. 7). After treatment with CHX and SA, however, expression of the PR1a mRNA was dramatically reduced, confirming thatPR1a gene expression is blocked in the presence of CHX (21Horvath D.M. Chua N-H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Salicylic acid glucosyltransferase activity has been observed in many plants including oat and tobacco (11Edwards R. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 143: 609-614Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Enyedi A.J. Raskin I. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have purified a SA GTase which forms primarily GS in vitro. The peptide sequences of the protease-digested fragments of the purified protein were homologous to UDP-glucose-binding domains of other known glucosyltransferases, suggesting that the purified protein is a glucosyltransferase. Also, the molecular mass of the purified enzyme was similar to other known glucosyltransferases that range from 40 to 60 kDa. However, Western blot analysis showed that SA GTase was not recognized by antibodies against flavonol GTase from tobacco (a gift of Dr. C.-H. Nam, Rockefeller University) or IAA GTase from maize (supplied by Dr. Bandurski, Michigan State University) or thiohydroximate GTase fromBrassica (a gift of Dr. D. W. Reed, Plant Biotechnology Institute, Canada). In addition, none of those antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate the SA GTase or to inhibit its activity. This immunological data suggested that the SA GTase was different from other isolated glucosyltransferases. The purified enzyme preparation preferentially glucosylated phenolics with the carboxy group, suggesting that a carboxy group and the structure of the aglycone (benzene ring) are necessary for glucosylation. The broad substrate specificity of the enzyme for SA as well as its precursors, benzoic acid and trans-cinnamic acid, suggests that SA GTase may have an additional role in regulating the metabolism of SA precursors. The identity of the clone was confirmed by the following observations. (i) The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone contained domains that perfectly matched the amino acid sequences of all three peptide fragments from the purified protein. (ii) The sequence of SA GTase gene was homologous to other sequenced glucosyltransferases and contained the characteristic highly conserved regions. (iii) Recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli glucosylated SA and showed a comparable substrate specificity of the purified native protein. The purified enzyme fraction displayed a major GS forming activity and lesser SAG forming activity. However, we could not exclude the possibility that SAG formation was due to another co-purified glucosyltransferase. The isolation of the cDNA clone followed by its overexpression in E. coli clearly confirmed that the enzyme possesses both activities. However, it remains to be determined how the dual enzyme activity is regulated in vivo, since, unlike the purified native enzyme, the recombinant enzyme formed GS and SAG in almost equal proportions. One possibility is that the ratio of both activities is regulated by cellular factor(s) which are present only in tobacco plants. Alternatively, the enzyme activities might be influenced by post-translational modification, which became altered inE. coli. As expected, in tobacco plants carrying the N gene, SA GTase mRNA was induced by bacterial or viral pathogens. The induction of SA GTase mRNA paralleled the increase in endogenous SA in the inoculated tissue. Indeed, SA GTase mRNA was activated by SA treatment, indicating that the SA GTase gene is induced through the SA-mediated signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, the correlation between the increased quantity of the SA GTase mRNA and the enzyme activity suggests that the induction of SA GTase activity is primarily due to the de novo synthesis of this enzyme. The relative lack of CHX effect on SA GTase transcription suggests that the pre-existing transcriptional factors are involved in activation of this gene in vivo. This phenomenon has been found in many other early response genes in plants and animals (23Almendral J.M. Sommer D. MacDonald-Bravo H. Burckhardt J. Perera J. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 24Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently, some of the early SA responsive genes were cloned from tobacco and characterized on the basis of the timing of mRNA induction in the presence of SA and/or CHX (25Horvath D.M. Huang D.J. Chua N.-H. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interactions. 1998; 11: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, their functions were not determined. The role of SA in disease resistance has been the subject of intensive investigation for decades but still requires further elucidation. The successful cloning of the SA GTase gene will provide means to define how the process of glucosylation is involved in the regulation of SA metabolism and in the general pathogen defense responses as well as to give insights into basic mechanisms of disease resistance. Only with a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of plant pathogen interactions together with usage of SA GTase cDNA clone as a tool will it be possible to regulate plant disease resistance in field-grown crops.

https://openalex.org/W2112133946,"The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70-kDa protein, a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-specific protein, has been shown to have multiple roles in nuclear precursor mRNA processing in animals. By using the C-terminal arginine-rich region ofArabidopsis U1-70K protein in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified an SC35-like (SR33) and a novel plant serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein (SR45) that interact with the plant U1-70K. The SR33 and SR45 proteins share several features with SR proteins including modular domains typical of splicing factors in the SR family of proteins. However, both plant SR proteins are rich in proline, and SR45, unlike most animal SR proteins, has two distinct arginine/serine-rich domains separated by an RNA recognition motif. By using coprecipitation assays we confirmed the interaction of plant U1-70K with SR33 and SR45 proteins. Furthermore, in vivoand in vitro protein-protein interaction experiments have shown that SR33 protein interacts with itself and with SR45 protein but not with two other members (SRZ21 and SRZ22) of the SR family that are known to interact with the Arabidopsis full-length U-70K only. A Clk/Sty protein kinase (AFC-2) from Arabidopsisphosphorylated four SR proteins (SR33, SR45, SRZ21, and SRZ22). Coprecipitation studies have confirmed the interaction of SR proteins with AFC2 kinase, and the interaction between AFC2 and SR33 is modulated by the phosphorylation status of these proteins. These and our previous results suggest that the plant U1-70K interacts with at least four distinct members of the SR family including SR45 with its two arginine/serine-rich domains, and the interaction between the SR proteins and AFC2 is modulated by phosphorylation. The interaction of plant U1-70K with a novel set of proteins suggests the early stages of spliceosome assembly, and intron recognition in plants is likely to be different from animals."

The cvHsp gene mapped to 1p36.23–p34.3 between markers D1S434 andD1S507. The expression of cvHsp was analyzed with RNA dot, Northern blots, or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: expression was high in heart, medium in skeletal muscle, and low in aorta or adipose tissues. In the heart of rat models of cardiac pathologies, cvHsp mRNA expression was either unchanged (spontaneous hypertension), up-regulated (right ventricular hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline treatment), or down-regulated (left ventricular hypertrophy following aortic banding). In obese Zucker rats, cvHsp mRNA was increased in skeletal muscle, brown, and white adipose tissues but remained unchanged in the heart. Western blot analysis using antipeptide polyclonal antibodies revealed two specific bands at 23 and 25 kDa for cvHsp in human heart. cvHsp interacted in both yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments with α-filamin or actin-binding protein 280.

McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholarand 2Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Hsps are mostly chaperones that associate with malfolded proteins, prevent their aggregation into large damaging complexes, aid their renaturation, and influence the final intracellular location of mature proteins. The Hsp superfamily comprises several subfamilies, including Hsp70, Hsp90 or Hsp110, the mitochondrial Hsp60/Hsp10 and cytosolic (t-complex polypeptide-1 (TCP-1) ring complex) chaperonin systems, and the low molecular weight heat shock or small stress proteins (smHsps), including αB-crystallin, αA-crystallin, Hsp20 protein, Hsp β-2, Hsp-like 27, and Hsp27 (reviewed in Ref. 1Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The presence of an evolutionarily conserved α-crystallin domain characterizes all smHsps. This domain is preceded by an N-terminal domain, which is variable in size and sequence, and is followed by a short, poorly conserved C-terminal extension, known to undergo numerous modifications including truncations (3Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The smHsp family of proteins have since been shown to play a role in stabilizing protein folding and transport and chiefly through the modulation of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal organization. αB-crystallin interacts with actin, desmin, and vimentin in the heart (4Bennardini F.

Gene discovery using expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases has proved a powerful alternative to experimental cloning techniques (e.g. filter hybridization, PCR using degenerate primers, etc.) and is thought to provide a rapid route to identifying and mapping the great majority of the 65,000–80,000 genes in the human genome (9Sikela J.M. Auffray C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Initial approaches for data base cloning most often rely on sequence homologies searches for paralogs or orthologs with nucleotide or protein queries using the BLAST or FASTA algorithms (10Andrade M.A. Sander C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other strategies are based on the use of keywords queries on sequence annotations, and an example includes a text-based search to find new sequences that shared homology with ion channels (11Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Similarly, a strategy based on the use of the word “prost” (for prostate) as query for EST data bases lead to the finding of three contigs (assembly of overlapping ESTs) selectively expressed in this organ (12Vasmatzis G. Essand M. Brinkmann U. Lee B. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we augmented such strategies by using a novel computational approach aimed at identifying “selectively expressed” genes in chosen cDNA libraries (EST data bases) (13Greller L.D. Tobin F.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 282-296PubMed Google Scholar). This method was applied to heart cDNA libraries and allowed the identification of a novel smHsp, cvHsp, selectively expressed in cardiovascular and insulin-sensitive tissues. We report here initial characterization of cvHsp, including molecular cloning, chromosome localization, mRNA distribution in normal and pathological states, and the interaction of cvHsp with α-filamin, or actin-binding protein 280 (14Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A computational method has been developed to identify gene products selectively expressed in a particular tissue when compared against expression levels in other tissues (13Greller L.D. Tobin F.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 282-296PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the algorithm identifies these exceptional levels of expression by combining a statistical test of discordancy with adjustments for the separation of the largest from the next-to-largest intensity. In addition, the algorithm estimates its own reliability in order to distinguish high confidence calculations from more ambiguous ones. The algorithm has been implemented to routinely analyze large data bases of gene abundances. The method was applied to cardiac libraries and allowed the identification of assembled ESTs highly and selectively expressed in the heart. Several 5′ clones of the assembly corresponding to cvHsp were requested and fully sequenced on both strands using an ABI automatic sequencer. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments were performed using the Marathon Ready human heart cDNA (CLONTECH). The following primers were used: 5′-CCGCTCGGAAGGTGGAAGAGGTTCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGGGCTGGACAGGAGAGGGTGTG-3′ for the ACD transcript (see “Results” and Fig. 2, panel 3), for the initial PCR and the second nested PCR, respectively, using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Similarly, 5′-CCTCCTCATTCCTACAGCCCACCTT-3′ and 5′-CCCCAGGGCCACAACTGTTCCTTAG-3′ were used for the initial PCR and the second nested PCR, respectively, for the alternative ABCD form (see under “Results” and Fig. 2). Double stranded amplification products were then sequenced. The mouse ortholog of human cvHsp was found by homology searches in dbEST, and its sequence was further confirmed after RT-PCR amplification of the mRNA from mouse heart. The rat sequence was amplified using primers defined for the mouse. Sequences of cvHsp from human, mouse, and rat have been deposited in the GenBankTM/EMBL data bases. Total RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) as described previously (16Krief S. Fève B. Baude B. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. Emorine L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6664-6670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a PTC-200 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research). The sequences of the primers were as follows: 5′-CGCCCACACCCTCTCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCTCAGCCCGCACCTC-3′ (antisense) for cvHsp, and 5′-TCGTGTGCACCGTGTGGGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAAACGGCGCTCGCAGCTGTCG-3′ (antisense) for β1-adrenergic receptor. The expected size of the amplicons were 412 bp forcvHsp and 265 bp for β1-adrenergic receptor. Northern blot analysis was done either on 10 μg of total RNA or on 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using standard methods (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A prenormalized 50-tissue poly(A)+ RNA dot blot was used to semiquantitatively assesscvHsp expression (Human RNA Master Blot,CLONTECH). Blots were exposed to x-ray films for 2–12 h. Densitometric analyses were performed for cvHsp and the ubiquitin normalization probe. The plasmids pHybLex/Zeo and pAS2–1 were purchased from Invitrogen and CLONTECH(Matchmaker system 2), respectively. The complete open reading frame ofcvHsp (170 amino acids), and derivatives thereof (amino acids 41–170, 56–170, and 119–170) were fused to the LEXA DNA-binding domain after PCR amplification from human heart cDNA (Invitrogen) and cloning into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pHybLex/Zeo. The 170- and 175-amino acid isoforms were also fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, after cloning of the corresponding cDNAs into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pAS2–1. The resulting fusion proteins were expressed into the yeast reporter strains PJ69–4A (18James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) and Y190 (CLONTECH). Plasmid pASV3, used for construction of the mouse embryo cDNA library (19vom-Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), has already been described (20Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the interaction trap with LEXA-cvHsp, L40 yeast transformants were selected on plates lacking leucine, histidine, and lysine, supplemented with 300 μg of zeocin (Invitrogen) and 30 mm3-aminotriazole (Sigma). The library inserts of clones positive in both the growth and β-galactosidase assays were recovered by PCR amplification from yeast colonies and directly used for sequencing. All nucleotide sequences were verified using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The deduced amino acid sequence ofcvHsp was analyzed for highly antigenic regions using the Jameson-Wolf antigenic index. The following synthetic peptide QLPEDVDPTSVTSALR (amino acids 132–147) was synthesized (peptide synthesizer model 431A, Applied Biosystems), purified and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde as the coupling agent. Fourteen-week-old New Zealand rabbits were injected every 2 weeks with peptide-carrier conjugate (150 μg/injection), and serum titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on unconjugated peptide-coated plates. The immunoglobulins fraction from the cvHsp immune serum, P672, were obtained by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose. For Western blotting, crude homogenates from normal human heart were subjected to a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (2% β-mercaptoethanol) and then transferred to Biotrace polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman, Champs-sur-Marne, France). Proteins were detected using purified P672 polyclonal antibody (500 ng/ml) revealed with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody (NA934, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Other antibodies used were monoclonal mouse anti-human α-filamin (Chemicon International), polyclonal rabbit anti-human alpha-B crystallin (Serotec), and polyclonal goat anti-human Hsp27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins complexes containing filamin were immunoprecipitated from human heart homogenates (200 μg protein) using anti-human α-filamin antibodies and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed by the use of anti-cvHsp or anti-αB-crystallin antibodies. The determination of the expression pattern ofcvHsp was performed in tissues from different experimental models in rodents. All rats were obtained from IFFA Credo (St Germain sur l'Arbresle, France) and were maintained and used according to the National Institutes of Health guideline for the use of laboratory animals. Right ventricular hypertrophy was obtained by a single injection of monocrotaline (MCT) (60 mg/kg, subcutaneously) 3 weeks before analysis. Left ventricular hypertrophy was obtained by chronic pressure overload induced by banding the abdominal aorta (aortic banding) above the renal artery of 5 week-old Wistar male rats. Aortic stenosis was performed under pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) using a silver clip with a clearance of 0.1 mm. Sham-operated animals underwent an identical procedure except that the clip was not tied. The magnitude of the left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed after 5 weeks by comparison of the left ventricular weight to body weight ratio from operated/treated versussham-operated/treated animals. Other experimental models included spontaneously hypertensive rats and their age-matched Wistar-Kyoto controls, as well as Zucker obese and lean rats that were all 12 weeks old. All animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and tissues were withdrawn, rinsed in ice-cold RNase-free phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent processing. Values shown are mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Statistical analysis was made by using analysis of variance, and a p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. cvHsp was first identified using the “selective expression” algorithm recently reported by two of us (13Greller L.D. Tobin F.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 282-296PubMed Google Scholar) as an assembly highly “expressed” in heart libraries. This computational approach was applied to large abundance data bases (or reconstructed abundances from the dbEST and Human Genome Science data bases). In this approach, selective expression refers to a pattern of expression in one or a small number of tissues in which there is markedly high or low expression against the baseline of expression implicitly defined in the other tissues. The assembly abundances were calculated as the number of “random” ESTs that constituted a given assembly divided by the total number of random ESTs generated from that given library. ESTs are counted as random if they were initially selected as random and not as subsequently “directed” sequencing, second walks, resequencings, the second EST of a 3′-5′ pair, etc. Assembly expression was further divided into three levels of qualitative expression (high, medium, and low) such that the total amount of RNA was the same (i.e.one-third) for each expression level. According to these criteria,cvHsp was identified as selectively and highly “expressed” in heart. Indeed, cvHsp assembly represented 0.3% of the total RNA (not considering housekeeping genes; see Table I). However, because of the variability of sampling depth with different EST libraries, there can be a substantial distortion of the reconstituted abundances that has to be taken into account by the selective expression detection algorithm. To correct for this limited sampling effect, we did not use the abundances from Table I but first corrected the bias due to finite sampling (21Good I.J. Biometrica. 1953; 40: 237-264Crossref Google Scholar,22Good I.J. Toulmin G.H. Biometrica. 1956; 43: 45-63Crossref Google Scholar). The markedly elevated abundance in the heart libraries (mainly adult but also fetal heart) of cvHsp assembly became visually apparent (Fig. 1). According to the criteria set for detecting selective expression of genes, significance probability of 5.5 × 10−7 was obtained for the cvHsp abundance pattern as compared with a randomly chosen pattern. Furthermore, the gap between the largest relative abundance and the next-to-largest, which is an estimator of separation of selective expression from baseline behavior and can only vary between 0 and 1, was 0.78. Overall, the algorithm assesses thecvHsp abundance pattern as a modestly strong selective expression pattern (see Ref. 13Greller L.D. Tobin F.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 282-296PubMed Google Scholar for details). In addition to this marked expression level in adult and fetal heart libraries,cvHsp was also found to be expressed in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in breast, bone marrow stroma, and adipose tissue.Table IcvHsp computational abundances in various libraries as reconstituted from ESTsLibraryComputational abundance%Breast0.030Fetal heart0.058Fetal lung0.009Senescent fibroblasts0.017Skeletal muscle0.089Heart0.280Muscle0.024Synovial hypoxia0.095Bone marrow stroma0.037Adipose tissue0.034 Open table in a new tab The initial contig of cvHsp was not assigned to any known protein, and most of the ESTs that composed the initial cvHsp contig were accordingly unknown (i.e. not homologous to known genes), probably because more than 75% of the transcript consisted of the untranslated 5′ and 3′ regions, regions known to have much less homology than the coding block in a given family of genes. However, a few ESTs translated into an open reading frame that shared significant identity with known members of the smHsp family, i.e. Hsp27 and α-crystallin. We gathered 124 ESTs by using BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) homology searches, which resolved into a contiguous sequence of about 2.2 kb. A further analysis of the sequence suggested the presence of three different transcripts generated by alternative splicing (Fig. 2). One or two of the corresponding cDNA clone variants from these three transcripts, obtained mainly from cardiac or adipose tissue libraries, were requested and sequenced to completion. Although the ATG codon in position 75 is in a poor Kozak consensus environment (TGGATGA versusANNATGG) and no stop codon could be found upstream of the start codon, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments confirmed the obtained sequence and rendered unlikely the possibility of the existence of another ATG codon upstream from that in position 75. In the three different types of transcripts, the 5′ sequence was identical in bp 1–273, a region named A, and in a segment of over 1000 bp, named region D. Isoform 1 has an additional sequence of 875 bp, region E, just before the poly(A) tailing consensus signal AATAAA, thus giving a total length of 2.15 kb (in the absence of the poly(A) tail), in good agreement with the size of the major transcript determined by Northern blotting (2.3 kb; see below). The open reading frame of isoform 1, from nucleotide 75 to 584, gave a deduced amino acid sequence of 170 residues. Isoform 2 was represented in a second series of sequenced clones: these have an additional 15-bp sequence in-frame between segment A and D, named region C, which added 5 amino acids to the 170-amino acid sequence. These clones missed the E region, thus giving a transcript size of about 1.3 kb. In isoform 3, a region B of 542 bp was inserted between A and C: the corresponding sequenced clone was of 1.8 kb. Interestingly, this B segment introduced a stop codon, and the resulting deduced open reading frame (75–281) of isoform 3 was of 68 residues (Fig. 2, panel 2). Segments A, B, and C have the intronic (C/A)AG consensus sequence prior to the exon splicing donor at the end of their 3′ sequences in good agreement with the AB, AC, AD, BC, and CD organization of the segments. Because the segments are at least composed of one exon, a minimal organization of the gene into five segments/exons could be envisaged (Fig. 2, panel 3). Full-length mouse and a partial rat cvHsp sequences were identified and found to share 92–95% identity with the human sequence at the amino acid level. The amino acid sequence comparison between human and mouse cvHsp is presented (Fig. 2, panel 4). Finally, seven of the components of cvHsp are NCBI ESTs with known chromosome localization: these included ESTs with GenBankTM accession numbers R49801, H44673, AA397963,T19903, T20269, T20235, and T32631. The mapping location of these NCBI ESTs were found to be deposited in the Unigene data base, and all were in 1p36.23–p34.3 between markers D1S434 andD1S507. According to its “electronic” tissue distribution, cvHsp is expected to be principally expressed in cardiac tissue. We experimentally studied the expression pattern ofcvHsp gene using several approaches summarized in Fig. 3. First, the tissue distribution ofcvHsp was analyzed using a poly(A)+ RNA dot blot of 50 different tissues. The results show a high expression in adult and fetal heart and in skeletal muscle; a fainter expression was evidenced in the aorta. In contrast, cvHsp expression was virtually undetectable in other organs tested, including 15 regions of the brain, digestive tract, liver, lung, adrenal, thyroid, spleen, thymus, gonads, and placenta. Using a Northern blot analysis on 9 different tissues, a main single transcript of 2.3 kb was observed in heart and skeletal muscle only (Fig. 3, left inset). Although cvHspmRNA could be readily detected after a 2-h exposure by Northern blot with 10 μg of total RNA from human heart, which suggested a high expression of the gene in this organ, a longer exposure revealed the presence of ∼1.2- and ∼1.6-kb transcripts (not shown), which are reminiscent of the sizes of transcript 2 and 3 respectively (Fig. 2,panel 3). Although few ESTs were found to derive from adipose tissue libraries, we have performed RT-PCRs on RNA from human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (Fig. 3, right inset). The mRNA levels ofcvHsp were semiquantitatively evaluated with amplifications performed with 10–200 ng of starting total RNA from adipose tissue and heart. cvHsp could be readily amplified with 100 ng of total RNA in adipose tissue, and it appears, by comparison of signals obtained for 50 ng of RNA in heart and adipose tissue, to be expressed at lower levels in adipose tissue than in the heart. cvHsp being mainly expressed in heart, but also in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, we hypothesized that, if regulated,cvHsp levels of expression may be altered in cardiovascular pathologies and in metabolic disorders. Therefore, we determined the expression levels of cvHsp mRNA in right and left ventricles of hearts from rats with right ventricular hypertrophy (treated with MCT) and left ventricular hypertrophy (spontaneously hypertensive rats and aortic banding) and also in different tissues from Zucker fatty rats (Fig. 4). cvHsp mRNA expression level in heart was not changed in 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with age matched Wistar-Kyoto control rats. When using a model of pressure overload with aortic banding, in which the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight increased from 1.97 ± 0.03 in sham-operated rats (n = 8) to 2.59 ± 0.07 in rats subjected to aortic stenosis for 8 weeks (n = 17, p< 0.001), there was a 2-fold decrease in cvHsp mRNA expression in both ventricles. In contrast, in MCT-treated hearts, the expression level of cvHsp was increased. In these rats, MCT induced a pulmonary hypertension, leading to an increase in the right ventricle mass (from 238 ± 17 mg in control rats receiving vehicle (n = 8) to 381 ± 39 mg in rats treated with MCT (n = 10, p < 0.001), whereas left ventricle mass remained unchanged (860 ± 18 and 841 ± 34 mg in control and MCT-treated rats, respectively)). After treatment by MCT, cvHsp mRNA expression level was increased 2.5-fold, in both the right and left ventricles, irrespectively of the site of hypertrophy (Fig. 4). It should be noticed that blots were normalized with ubiquitin, which is considered as a member of the smHsp family (23Mayer R.J. Arnold J. Laszlo L. Landon M. Lowe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin levels could possibly be modulated in the hearts from the different models of cardiac pathologies, thus rendering specious interpretation of the results. However, in MCT rats, a similar increase in cvHsp mRNA levels was obtained following normalization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (not shown), and, in right ventricle from aortic banded rats as compared with sham operated controls, ubiquitin levels are comparable, whereascvHsp is clearly down-regulated (Fig. 4 A). Finally, the expression patterns of cvHsp mRNA were investigated in heart, skeletal muscle, and white and brown adipose tissues in a model of insulin-resistance associated with obesity, the Zucker fatty rat. Although there was no changes in cvHspexpression in hearts from obese rats, there was a 2-fold increase incvHsp mRNA steady state levels in skeletal muscle (hind limb) (Fig. 4). Likewise, cvHsp expression in interscapular brown fat and epididymal white fat was increased 4–5 times in obese rats compared with their lean controls. Similar results were obtained after a 28 S ribosomal RNA normalization (not shown). To determine the apparent molecular weight of cvHsp, we performed Western blot analyses on heart homogenates from normal human heart (Fig. 5). Antibodies raised against human αB-crystallin and Hsp27 were used as controls and allowed the detection of a band at 20 and 27 kDa, respectively, as expected. The anti-cvHsp revealed a major band at 25 kDa and a less abundant band at 23 kDa, which were absent in the control preimmune antiserum. The two cvHsp bands could not be detected when the antibody was immunodepleted with the peptide that served for immunization. Because the identity of the two bands is not fully understood at the present time, and to avoid confusion with the rodent ortholog of human Hsp27, which is often called Hsp25, we suggest that this novel smHsp not be named after its molecular weight, as generally done for smHsps (1Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 24Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar). Rather, we propose that this novel smHsp be named cvHsp after its high expression in cardiovascular and insulin-sensitive tissues. The comparison of cvHsp amino acid sequence with known proteins revealed the highest level of homology with the members of the smHsp family. The alignment of cvHsp amino acid sequence with that of αA-crystallin, αB-crystallin, Hsp20, Hspβ-2 (or MKBP), Hsp-like 27, and Hsp27 is presented in Fig. 5. All seven smHsp shown in Fig. 5are of similar length, between 160 and 241 amino"

In an ongoing effort to elucidate the cellular functions of Gz, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify proteins that specifically interact with a mutationally activated form of Gαz. One of the molecules uncovered in this screen was Rap1GAP, a previously identified protein that specifically stimulates GTP hydrolytic activity of the monomeric G protein Rap1 and thus is believed to function as a down-regulator of Rap1 signaling. Like Gz, the precise role of Rap1 in cell physiology is poorly understood. Biochemical analysis using purified recombinant proteins revealed that the physical interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP blocks the ability of RGSs (regulators of G protein signaling) to stimulate GTP hydrolysis of the α subunit, and also attenuates the ability of activated Gαz to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Structure-function analyses indicate that the first 74 amino-terminal residues of Rap1GAP, a region distinct from the catalytic core domain responsible for the GAP activity toward Rap1, is required for this interaction. Co-precipitation assays revealed that Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1 can form a stable complex. These data suggest that Rap1GAP acts as a signal integrator to somehow coordinate and/or integrate Gz signaling and Rap1 signaling in cells.

These G proteins consist of a GTP-binding α subunit and two additional subunits, termed β and γ, that are tightly associated with each other and function as a single βγ complex (1Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 2Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Based on structural homology between their α subunits, G proteins are divided into four groups, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. During G protein signaling, activation by an appropriately liganded receptor stimulates GTP binding to the α subunit and subsequent dissociation of α-GTP from the βγ complex to produce the active forms of the G proteins that transmit signals to downstream targets, termed effectors (3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In addition to receptors, G proteins, and effectors, a new family of proteins has recently been discovered that is important in signaling through trimeric G proteins. These proteins, termed RGSs (regulators of G protein signaling), act as negative regulators because of their abilities to stimulate GTP hydrolysis of G protein α subunits (2Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar); in addition, some RGS proteins can apparently modulate other aspects of G protein signaling processes (4Dohlman H.G.

Gαz, a member of Gαi family, is a 41-kDa α subunit that has several unique, and presumably important, properties (6Fong H.K.W. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, its tissue distribution is quite restricted, being found primarily in brain, adrenal medulla, and platelets, while expression is virtually undetectable in other tissues (9Hinton D.R.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another property that distinguishes Gαz from other members of Gi family is its inability to serve as a substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (8Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I.

Additionally, the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαzis quite low compared with most other G protein α subunits (8Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that RGS or RGS-like molecules play important roles in regulation of Gz signaling. Finally, Gαz is subjected to phosphorylation by protein kinase C; this phosphorylation occurs both in vitro and in vivo and the modification interferes with the interaction of Gαz with both the βγ complex and a recently identified selective regulator, RGSZ1 (11Lounsbury K.M.

While it is not yet clear which receptors are normally coupled to Gz, many receptors that couple to Gi proteins can also activate Gz signaling pathways if the receptors are overexpressed in cells (15Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Tsu R.C. Lai H.W.L. Allen R.A. Wong Y.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, although the downstream effects of Gz activation are not well understood, activated Gαz does possess an ability to inhibit some subtypes of adenylyl cyclase, a property shared with other members of Gi family (15Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, stable expression of mutationally activated Gαz can transform Swiss 3T3 and NIH3T3 cells by stimulating mitogenic pathways (18Wong Y.H. Chan J.S. Yung L.Y. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this stimulation is apparently unrelated to the ability of Gαz to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that Gz signaling is coupled to additional signaling pathways (18Wong Y.H. Chan J.S. Yung L.Y. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar). As part of an ongoing effort to elucidate the signaling functions of Gz, we recently undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that specifically interact with a mutationally activated form of Gαz (14Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe one of the molecules identified via this approach as Rap1GAP, a protein that had been previously identified as a specific activator of the GTP hydrolytic activity of the monomeric G protein Rap1 (19Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous involvement of members of the Ras superfamily in mitogenic signaling pathways makes regulators of these proteins like Rap1GAP attractive candidates to act as signal integrators and/or coordinators with Gαz. Interestingly, the expression pattern of Rap1GAP is similar to that mentioned above for Gαz, with predominant expression being observed in brain among normal tissues examined (19Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Characterization of the interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP indicates that the active form of Gαz specifically and functionally interacts with Rap1GAP and that the three proteins, i.e. Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1, can form a stable complex. These data point to an unanticipated cellular cross-talk between Gz and Rap1 signaling processes, and provide new insight into potential cellular functions of Gz. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and fall army worm ovarian (Sf9) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The anti-Rap1GAP polyclonal antibody (20Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the anti-Gαz polyclonal antibody (8Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been previously described. Anti-Rap1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Radioactive compounds ([γ-32P]GTP, [γ-35S]GTPγS, and [α-32P]ATP) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Plasmids containing the cDNA of rat Gαz (both wild type and the Q205L mutant), containing the Glu-Glu epitope at residues 3 to 8, were the gift of Henry Bourne (University of California at San Francisco) and have been described (21Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing full-length Rap1GAP (designated pCAN-Rap1GAP) and fragments thereof were previously described (20Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other constructs used in yeast two-hybrid screen have also been described (14Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing full-length Rap1GAP with an appended NH2-terminal His-tag (pRSET-Rap1GAP) was constructed by subcloning a KpnI- and EcoRI-digested fragment from pCAN-Rap1GAP that contained the Rap1GAP coding sequence into the pRSET-C vector (Invitrogen). Rap1GAP was purified as described previously (20Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). His-tagged Rap1GAP was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) carrying pRSET-Rap1GAP. Briefly, cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.6 and protein production was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g and resuspended (10 ml/liter of culture) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was lysed in a French press and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g. The resulting supernatant was diluted 2-fold such that the final buffer composition was 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Lubrol. This extract was applied to a 2-ml column of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient consisting of sequential 6-ml aliquots of the same buffer containing 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mm imidazole; Rap1GAP eluted at 100 mm imidazole. Gαs, Gαz, and myristoylated Gαi2 were purified from E. colias described previously (8Casey P.J. Fong H.K. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in six-well Falcon plates. Standard protocols provided by manufacturer were used. In each transfection, 2.0 μg of plasmid encoding Gαz forms and/or 0.5 μg of the plasmid encoding Rap1GAP were used whenever applicable. Sf9 cells were cultured in SF-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Preparation of membranes from Sf9 cells overexpressing adenylyl cyclase Type V were prepared as described previously (25Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gαz-GDP-(AlF4−) was formed by incubation of Gαz in 50 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Lubrol (Buffer A) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 400 μmAlCl3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 μm GDP at 30 °C for 15 min. Gαz-GTPγS was formed by incubation of Gαz in Buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA and 100 μm GTPγS. Both forms were isolated by gel filtration using 1-ml spin columns of G-50 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been prewashed with Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mmMgCl2. Rap1-GTPγS was formed by incubation of Rap1 with Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 10 min; the complex was isolated by the same technique used for Gαz forms except that the G-25 Sephadex resin used in the spin column. For single turnover GTPase (commonly referred to as GAP) assays, Gαz was first incubated with [γ-32P]GTP at 30 °C for 30 min in Buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA and 2 μm[γ-32P]GTP. The Gαz·GTP complex was then isolated by gel filtration using a 1-ml spin column of G-50 Sephadex that had been prewashed with Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm MgCl2. GTP hydrolysis was carried out in the presence or absence of specified RGS proteins. In experiments assessing the abilities of Rap1GAP and its fragments to block RGS-mediated acceleration of the GTPase reaction, the Rap1GAP proteins were incubated with the Gαz·GTP complex at 0 °C for 5 min before addition of RGS proteins. GTPase activity was measured by phosphate release as described previously (26Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured by using SpinZymeTM Acidic Alumina Devices (Pierce). The standard protocols provided by manufacturer were used. The activated form of Gαs was formed by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h with 4 mm free Mg2+ and 100 μm GTPγS. Activated forms of myristoylated Gαi2 and Sf9-produced Gαz were produced by incubation of the proteins at 30 °C for 2 h with 4 mm (for Gαi2) or 5 nm (for Gαz) free Mg2+ and 100 μmGTPγS (27Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Free nucleotide was removed through use of a 1-ml spin column of G-50 Sephadex that had been prewashed with Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mmMgCl2. Either Gαs-GTPγS or forskolin was used to activate the adenylyl cyclase in the Sf9 membranes as described (17Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Rap1GAP on Gα proteins, Gαi2-GTPγS or Gαz-GTPγS and Rap1GAP were incubated for 5 min at 0 °C in Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm MgCl2 before they were added into the reaction. Two types of co-precipitation assays were performed; the first series being completely in vitro using purified proteins. Purified full-length Rap1GAP containing a NH2-terminal His-tag was incubated with Gαz-GDP-(AlF4−) or Gαz-GTPγS at 4 °C for 1 h together with Ni-NTA resin. To determine whether Rap1GAP and Rap1 can form a stable complex, Rap1GAP and Rap1 were first incubated in Buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, 400 μmAlCl3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 μm GDP or in Buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm GTPγS, respectively, at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were then diluted 5-fold with Buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2 to decrease the nonspecific binding to Ni-NTA resin. Following dilution, the reactions were incubated with the Ni-NTA resin for 1 h at 4 °C. To assess complex formation between Gαz, Rap1GAP, and Rap1, His-tagged Rap1, full-length Rap1GAP, and Gαz-GTPγS were first incubated in Buffer A containing 5 mm MgCl2, 400 μm AlCl3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 μm GDP at 30 °C for 15 min. Reaction mixtures were then diluted 5-fold with Buffer A containing 5 mmMgCl2 to decrease the nonspecific binding to Ni-NTA resin and the diluted reactions incubated with Ni-NTA for 1 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, Ni-NTA resin was extensively washed. Resin then was boiled in SDS loading buffer to recover bound proteins and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels followed by Western blotting. The second series of co-precipitation assays was designed to assess molecular interactions between the relevant proteins in intact cells. HEK293 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cytosolic fractions were prepared by centrifugation of cell extracts at 30,000 × g for 1 h. Immobilized Rap1GAP antibody was prepared by incubation of the affinity purified antiserum with Protein A-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 12 h. Rap1GAP was immunoprecipitated from the prepared cytosolic fractions by addition of the immobilized antiserum followed by incubation at 4 °C for another 2 h. Resin was then collected, washed, and analyzed as described above. To identify proteins involved in Gz signaling pathways, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in which the mutationally activated Q205L variant of Gαz was used as “bait” to screen a human brain cDNA library. Because an active form of Gαz was used in this screen, the expected interactors included regulators of Gαz GTP hydrolysis and/or downstream effectors. This expectation was validated by our previously reported finding that one of the molecules identified in this screen was a novel RGS protein, RGSZ1, a selective regulator of the Gαz GTPase reaction (14Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to RGSZ1, among more than 100 total positive clones identified, 24 sequences encoded a previously identified protein termed Rap1GAP, a GTPase activating protein for the monomeric GTP-binding protein Rap1. The initial examination of the specificity of the interaction between the active form of Gαz and Rap1GAP was performed through the use of a two-hybrid counter-screen. In this counter-screen, the Rap1GAP cDNA was co-transformed in the yeast reporter system together with the mutationally activated forms of several other G protein α subunits, including two other Gi family members (Gαo and Gαi2) and at least one member from each of the remaining three G protein families (Table I). No interaction could be detected in this counter-screen between Rap1GAP and any other G protein α subunit with the exception of Gαi2, for which a very weak interaction was observed. To eliminate the possibility that the inability to detect the interaction between Rap1GAP and the G protein α subunits was due to lack of expression of the α subunits, an additional counter-screen between all the α subunits and the aforementioned RGSZ1 was performed. Interactions between RGSZ1 and Gαo and Gαi2, as well as Gαz, were detected in the system (Table I), indicating that at least Gαo and Gαi2 were expressed in functional forms in yeast cells.Table IResults of the yeast two-hybrid counter-screenG protein α subunitCloneRap1GAPRGSZ1aData from Glick et al.

Open table in a new tab The observed interaction between the active form of Gαzand Rap1GAP, and the accumulating literature indicating that both Gz and Rap1 were involved in signaling pathways influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (18Wong Y.H. Chan J.S. Yung L.Y. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S.

A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), prompted us to initiate an investigation of the biochemical properties and functional significance of their interaction. In the first series of experiments, the interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP was further evaluated both in vitro, using purified recombinant proteins, and in the context of a cell expressing both proteins. In thein vitro experiments, interaction between purified full-length Rap1GAP containing an appended NH2-terminal His-tag and recombinant Gαz, purified from a bacterial expression system, was examined in co-precipitation assays. Interaction of activated forms of Gαz, i.e. the GTPγS-bound form or that activated by aluminum fluoride, with Rap1GAP was readily detected, while interaction with GDP-bound form of Gαz could not be detected (Fig. 1 A). To investigate the interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP in a cellular environment, co-precipitation experiments were performed using extracts from HEK293 cells expressing the proteins. Cells were transfected with Gzα (either the Q205L constitutive-active mutant or the wild-type form) in both the absence and presence of co-transfection with full-length Rap1GAP. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection and cytosolic fractions isolated. A polyclonal antibody against Rap1GAP was then used to immunoprecipitate Rap1GAP along with associated proteins from this cytosolic fraction. The results of this experiment showed that the mutationally activated form of Gαz, but not wild-type Gαz, could be co-immunoprecipitated with Rap1GAP (Fig. 1 B), even thought the wild-type protein was expressed at an equal level in the cells (not shown). These results, together with the in vitro co-precipitation results, confirmed that the activated form of Gαz specifically interacts with Rap1GAP. Having confirmed that activated Gαz and Rap1GAP could indeed form a complex, experiments were designed to determine whether the interaction had functional consequences in terms of measurable activities of Gαz. Rap1GAP binding to Gαzdid not enhance the single turnover GTPase activity of the G protein (Fig. 2 C and results not shown). Because RGS proteins also bind selectively to active forms of a number of G protein α subunits (2Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 5De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), including Gαz, the possibility that the interaction between Gαz and Rap1GAP would interfere with the ability of RGS proteins to act on Gαz was then examined. Two RGS proteins, RGS10 and RGSZ1, were chosen to test this hypothesis; RGS10 acts on Gαz as well as several other members of the Gi family (26Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), while RGSZ1 action is quite selective for Gαz (14Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To assess whether the interactions of Rap1GAP and the RGS proteins with Gαz were mutually exclusive, purified recombinant proteins produced in bacteria were used in single-turnover GTPase assays. Briefly, Gαz was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and the GTP-bound form of Gαzwas isolated by gel filtration. Both basal and RGS-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Gαz was then determined in the presence or absence of Rap1GAP. Stimulation of GTP hydrolysis of Gαzby both RGS10 and RGSZ1 was readily observed in these assays (Fig. 2). Rap1GAP itself did not affect the basal GTP hydrolysis rate of Gαz (data not shown), but the presence of Rap1GAP markedly attenuated the stimulation of Gαz GTPase activity by either RGS protein. The ability of Rap1GAP to attenuate RGS-mediated stimulation of Gαz GTPase was concentration-dependent and nearly complete (Fig. 2). Additionally, the effect was quite specific for Gαz, as Rap1GAP did not affect the ability of RGS10 to stimulate Gαi2 GTPase activity (Fig. 2 C), even though a weak interaction between Rap1GAP and Gαi2 had been detected in the two-hybrid system (Table I). We also sought to determine whether the interaction of Rap1GAP with Gαz could interfere with the G protein's ability to regulate effector molecules. The only characterized activity of Gz in terms of modulation of effector activity is that the active form of Gαz can inhibit some subtypes of adenylyl cyclase (15Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To examine whether Rap1GAP binding to activated Gαz could influence this activity of the G protein, studies were performed with adenylyl cyclase type V (AC-V), which is subject to inhibition by activated Gαz (15Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). AC-V was expressed in Sf9 cells and the membrane fraction containing the protein prepared. This recombinant AC-V preparation was then activated with either the GTPγS-bound form of Gαs or forskolin, and the influence of Gαz in the presence or absence of Rap1GAP was determined. As previously reported (15Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), inhibition of AC-V activity by the GTPγS-activated form of Gαz could be readily observed (Fig. 3 A). Addition of purified recombinant Rap1GAP attenuated the inhibition by activated Gαz, and this attenuation increased with the increasing concentration of Rap1GAP (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained when forskolin-activated AC-V was used (Fig. 3 B). While the effect was somewhat modest, the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by the finding that Rap1GAP had no effect on the ability of the GTPγS-bound form of Gαi2to inhibit adenylyl cyclase under the same conditions (data not shown). Having verified the binding of Rap1GAP to activated Gαzand determined that there were indeed fu"

Phosphorylation of NFκB inhibitory protein (IκB) leading to its degradation and NFκB activation, is regulated by the multimeric IκB kinase complex, including IKKα and IKKβ. We recently reported that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) inhibits TNFα-regulated IκB degradation and NFκB activation. To determine the mechanism of 5-ASA inhibition of IκB degradation, we studied young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells by immunodetection and in vitro kinase assays. We show 5-ASA inhibits TNFα-stimulated phosphorylation of IκBα in intact YAMC cells. Phosphorylation of a glutathioneS-transferase-IκBα fusion protein by cellular extracts or immunoprecipitated IKKα isolated from cells treated with TNFα is inhibited by 5-ASA. Recombinant IKKα and IKKβ autophosphorylation and their phosphorylation of glutathioneS-transferase-IκBα are inhibited by 5-ASA. However, IKKα serine phosphorylation by its upstream kinase in either intact cells or cellular extracts is not blocked by 5-ASA. Surprisingly, immunodepletion of cellular extracts suggests IKKα is predominantly responsible for IκBα phosphorylation in intestinal epithelial cells. In summary, 5-ASA inhibits TNFα-stimulated IKKα kinase activity toward IκBα in intestinal epithelial cells.

These findings suggest a novel role for 5-ASA in the management of IBD by disrupting TNFα activation of NFκB. inflammatory bowel disease 5-aminosalicylic acid 4-aminosalicylic acid young adult mouse colon tumor necrosis factor α glutathione S-transferase epidermal growth factor interferon nuclear factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline with Tween mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase IκB kinase NFκB-inducing kinase Aminosalicylic acid is an important antiinflammatory agent used for management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).1 Sulfasalazine was introduced as an azo bond compound between 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine for use in arthritis (1Pinals R.S. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 17: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was not an effective therapeutic agent for arthritis, however it proved to be useful for IBD. The benefit has been principally attributed to the bacterial azo-cleavage product 5-ASA and not the sulfapyridine moiety (2Khan A.K.A. Piris J. Truelove S.C. Lancet. 1977; 2: 892-898Abstract PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the therapeutic value of 5-ASA and other amino salicylates is due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (3Peskar B.M. Dreyling K.W. May B. Schaarschmidt K. Goebell H. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1987; 32: 51S-56SCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, cumulative evidence suggests additional mechanisms are involved. For example, aspirin, a more effective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase activity, has not been therapeutic for IBD. Intestinal mucosal 5-ASA concentrations in the millimolar range correlate with a therapeutic effect (4Peppercorn M. Goldman P. Gastroenterology. 1973; 64: 240-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We, and others have recently reported that amino salicylates can inhibit signal transduction leading to nuclear factor (NF) κB activation (5Kaiser G.C. Yan F. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 602-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Sodium salicylate and aspirin have also been found to inhibit NFκB activation in murine T and B cells (7Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one group recently reported sulfasalazine to be effective at inhibiting NFκB activation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α (8Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J Clin Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, it is known that sulfasalazine disrupts TNFα from its receptor (9Shanahan F. Niederlehner A. Carramanzana N. Anton P. Immunopharmacology. 1990; 20: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TNFα-regulated transcriptional activation of NFκB plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD (10Sartor R.B. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1995; 24: 475-507PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schreiber S. Nikolaus S. Hampe J. Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 12Neurath M.F. Becker C. Barbulescu K. Gut. 1998; 43: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Increased NFκB activation has been shown in inflamed mucosal epithelial cells, but not in adjacent uninvolved mucosa, in patients with IBD (13Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholmerich J. Gross V. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Treatment with 5-ASA decreases TNFα levels in patients with IBD (14Casellas F. Papo M. Guarner F. Antolin M. Armengol J.R. Malagelada J.-R. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The expression of cytokines, including TNFα and interferon (IFN) γ, is inhibited in colonic lymphocytes by 5-ASA (14Casellas F. Papo M. Guarner F. Antolin M. Armengol J.R. Malagelada J.-R. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, NFκB is held in an inactive state in a cytoplasmic complex with its inhibitory protein (IκB). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, result in phosphorylation of IκBα on serine 32 and 36 (15DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), targeting IκB for ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation. Thus, NFκB is released for nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation (16Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 17Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, NFκB binds to cis elements enhancing transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules (18Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). Recently, additional novel mechanisms of activating NFκB by both IκB-dependent and IκB-independent pathways have been described (19Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TNFα-stimulated IκB phosphorylation is mediated by several intermediate signaling proteins. The multimeric protein kinase complex that directly phosphorylates IκB in response to TNFα signaling contains two catalytic subunits, IκB kinase (IKK) α and β (22Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar,23Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both recombinant and immunoisolated IKKα and IKKβ can stimulate IκB phosphorylation (15DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 23Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ have been found to form both homodimers and heterodimers, and both isoforms can phosphorylate IκB bound to NFκB more efficiently than free IκB (24Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of either IKKα or IKKβ block TNFα-induced NFκB activation (25Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 26Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Thus, both IKKα and IKKβ contribute to the activity of the IKK complex and are able to induce IκB phosphorylation, degradation, and NFκB activation. Interestingly, IKK null mouse studies show specificity in cytokine signal transduction and limb development for IKKβ and IKKα, respectively (27Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 28Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The IKK complex also associates with upstream kinases, NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1). Both NIK and MEKK1 are able to phosphorylate IKKα and IKKβ leading to their activation (29Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8355-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar,30Nemoto S. Didonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, NIK was shown to preferentially activate IKKα by phosphorylation on serine-176 (31Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas MEKK1 appears to regulate IKKβ phosphorylation (32Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared salicylate compounds for their activity against TNFα-stimulated IκB phosphorylation and degradation in intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that 5-ASA inhibits TNFα-stimulated IκB phosphorylation and degradation by directly inhibiting IKKα activity toward IκBα in intact intestinal cells. Young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells (gift of Robert Whitehead, Ludwig Institute, Melbourne, Australia), a conditionally immortalized murine colon cell line isolated from the H-2kb-tsA58 mouse expressing a heat-labile simian virus 40 large T antigen with an IFN-γ-inducible promoter, were grown on culture dishes as previously reported (33Kaiser G.C. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in culture under permissive conditions at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent cell monolayers were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum) and IFN-γ-deprived under nonpermissive conditions at 37 °C for 24 h prior to all experiments. HeLa cells (gift of Jeff Holt, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, as detailed elsewhere (35Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers were serum-starved for 24 h prior to study. Cells were treated with murine TNFα (Pepro Tech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for indicated times, or pretreated with 5-ASA, 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA), aspirin, salicylic acid, or sulfasalazine for 30 min followed by TNFα. All inhibitors were from Sigma. The medium containing inhibitors was adjusted to pH 6.65. Butyric acid and mannitol were used as controls for pH and molarity, respectively. All experiments using 5-ASA were protected from light exposure. Cell monolayers were washed twice on an ice bath with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmorthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, with leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (18 μg/ml), and 1% Triton X-100). The scraped suspensions were centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cellular lysate protein were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-IκBα (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Cells were prepared as above and then treated with murine TNFα in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Cellular lysates were prepared as above with the following modifications. One hundred micrograms of protein supernatant was precleared with 10% (v/v) Staphylococcus aureus cell suspension (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 1 min). The supernatant was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-IKKα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 10% (v/v) S. aureus cell suspension overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was recovered by centrifugation (14,000 ×g, 1 min) and washed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitate was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-IKKα, or anti-IKKβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. The immunoprecipitate and supernatants were also used forin vitro kinase assays as detailed below. After SDS-PAGE, protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was accomplished by semidry technique (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked overnight in a solution of 5% nonfat, dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween (TBS-T). Before immunoblotting, membranes were washed twice in TBS-T. Western blotting was performed using anti-phospho-IκBα antibody (1:3000), anti-IκBα antibody (1:3000), anti-IKKα antibody (1:4000), anti-IKKβ antibody (1:4000), or anti-phosphoserine antibody (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature in TBS-T. Next, membranes were washed three times in TBS-T for 10 min each. For Western blot analysis with anti-Flag, membranes were blocked in TBS-T containing 5% milk at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing three times in TBS-T for 5 min each, blotting was conducted using mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma) at 1:750 dilution in TBS-T for 30 min at 22 °C. Secondary antibody incubations were carried out using anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:10,000), or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000), in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After three 10-min washes with TBS-T, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, comparison between intensity of bands was detected by densitometric analysis using Gel-Pro Analyzer software for Macintosh (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD) and indicated as -fold change. Recombinant Flag-IKKα or Flag-IKKβ (gift of Tularik, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmEDTA, 100 nm ATP with leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (18 μg/ml)) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of various concentrations of inhibitors. The inhibitors were added to the reaction buffer for 30 min at 4 °C before the kinase reactions were initiated by incubation at 37 °C (6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Flag-IKKα or Flag-IKKβ was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE with phosphorylation detected by autoradiography. Western blot analysis with anti-Flag was used to verify equal protein loading. In vitro GST-IκBα phosphorylation assay was performed by incubating cellular lysates or autophosphorylated Flag-IKKα or Flag-IKKβ, as prepared above, in kinase buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were isolated from YAMC cells treated with either murine TNFα or murine EGF (gift of Stanley Cohen, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) for various times. GST-IκBα fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated to Glutathione Sepharose-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the reaction mixture with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of various concentrations of inhibitors. In some experiments, immunoprecipitated IKKα or the supernatant from the immunoprecipitation was used in the in vitro kinase assay with GST-IκBα. Inhibitors were added to the reaction buffer for 30 min at 4 °C before the kinase assays. GST-IκBα conjugated to beads or GST-IκBα was recovered by centrifugation and separated by SDS-PAGE for detection of phosphorylation by autoradiography. Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα or anti-Flag was used to verify equal protein loading. Because we have shown that TNFα-induced NFκB activation and IκB degradation are blocked by 5-ASA, we asked whether IκBα phosphorylation is also inhibited. YAMC cells were incubated with salicylates prior to the addition of TNFα for various times. To control for pH and molarity of the inhibitors, butyric acid (20 mm, pH 6.65) and mannitol (200 mm) were added to cells as indicated. Triton-soluble cellular lysates were studied by Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα and anti-phospho-IκBα antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TNFα treatment of YAMC cells increased IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, which was blocked by 5-ASA (Fig. 1 A). Other salicylates show similar inhibitory effects on TNFα-induced IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). However, the combination of butyric acid and mannitol had no effect on IκBα phosphorylation. These results indicate the effect of 5-ASA is to inhibit NFκB activation upstream of IκB serine phosphorylation. To determine whether the 5-ASA inhibitory effects on TNFα-stimulated IκBα phosphorylation extend to intracellular kinase activity, we established an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IκBα. Cellular lysates were prepared in kinase buffer from untreated, EGF-treated, or TNFα-treated YAMC cells for various times. Equal amounts of cellular lysate were incubated with GST-IκBα and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of salicylates at various concentrations. The GST-IκBα conjugated to beads was precipitated, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE with phosphorylation detected by autoradiography. Equal loading was verified by Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα. Cellular lysates isolated from cells treated with TNFα, but not EGF, enhanced kinase activity toward GST-IκBα detected by [32P]ATP labeling and Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine compared with non-treated cellular lysates (Fig. 2 A). Salicylates added to the cellular lysates show a concentration-dependent inhibition of GST-IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). At equimolar concentrations, 5-ASA, 4-ASA, aspirin, and salicylic acid show similar inhibitory effects on GST-IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C). However, when directly compared with 5-ASA, neither the parent compound sulfasalazine nor the sulfapyridine product showed inhibition of this kinase activity toward GST-IκBα (Fig. 2 D). In fact, sulfasalazine increases the in vitro kinase activity toward IκBα in cellular lysates. Taken together, these findings indicate various salicylates inhibit the kinase activity of TNFα-treated intestinal cell lysates toward IκBα. To determine the role of IKKα in GST-IκBα phosphorylation, we immunoisolated IKKα from lysates of YAMC cells treated with TNFα for in vitro kinase assays. Immunoprecipitated IKKα, GST-IκBα, and [γ-32P]ATP were incubated in kinase buffer, at 37 °C for 30 min, in the presence or absence of 5-ASA or other salicylate compounds. Fig. 3 A shows 5-ASA, 4-ASA, and other salicylates inhibit phosphorylation of GST-IκBα by native IKKα isolated from TNFα-treated YAMC cellular lysates. To further characterize the regulation of kinase activity by 5-ASA, we immunoprecipitated IKKα or prepared cellular lysates for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies against phosphoserine, IKKα, or IKKβ. TNFα treatment increased the phosphoserine content of IKKα in intact YAMC cells (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, IKKβ was not detected in immunoprecipitates of IKKα from either TNFα-treated or untreated cells, even though it was clearly present in the cellular lysates. Because the role of IKK isozymes in regulating TNFα-stimulated IκB phosphorylation remains controversial, we tested the role of IKKα in IκBα phosphorylation using an immunodepletion assay. Supernatants recovered from the immunoprecipitation of IKKα were incubated with GST-IκBα for in vitro kinase assays. Immunodepletion of IKKα decreased by two-thirds the level of GST-IκBα phosphorylation compared with total cellular lysates isolated from TNFα-treated YAMC cells (Fig. 4 A). However, no decrease in kinase activity was detected in supernatants precipitated with pre-immune serum. Surprisingly, the level of IKKβ present in the supernatants from precipitating IKKα were the same as total cellular lysates or preimmune immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B). Because IKKβ has been shown to regulate TNFα-stimulated IκBα phosphorylation in HeLa cells (37Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), we performed an immunodepletion assay using these cells to address this apparent discrepancy and as a positive control for IKKα-IKKβ co-precipitation in our immunodepletion assay. Similar to our findings in YAMC cells, antibody to IKKα depleted IκB kinase activity from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 4 C). By contrast, however, IKKβ was depleted from the HeLa cell lysate by precipitation with anti-IKKα (compare Fig. 4 D with Figs. 4 B and 3 B). These findings suggest IKKα is the predominant IκB kinase activated by TNFα in intestinal cells. To address the inhibitory effects of 5-ASA on IKKα autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of GST-IκBα,in vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant Flag-tagged-IKKα alone or with GST-IκBα in the presence or absence of 5-ASA and other salicylates. All salicylates studied inhibited both IKKα autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 A) and phosphorylation of GST-IκBα by recombinant IKKα (Fig. 5 B). Because it has recently been shown that aspirin and salicylic acid inhibit IKKβ autophosphorylation (6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and since we only recovered IKKα in our intestinal cell immunoprecipitates phosphorylating IκBα, we asked if 5-ASA and the other salicylates studied inhibit IKKβ autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of IκBα. Recombinant Flag-tagged IKKβ was incubated in phosphorylation buffer with [γ-32P]ATP and various salicylates, then separated by SDS-PAGE for detection by autoradiography or Western blot analysis with anti-Flag or anti-IκBα antibodies. Both autophosphorylation of IKKβ and IκBα phosphorylation by IKKβ were inhibited by the salicylates (Fig. 6). To determine whether 5-ASA inhibits generalized kinase activity leading to phosphorylation of IKKα, YAMC cells were treated with TNFα in the presence or absence of 5-ASA. Triton-soluble lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation with anti-IKKα for Western blot analysis with anti-phosphoserine. Treatment of YAMC cells does not inhibit TNFα-stimulated IKKα serine phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A), which indicates that 5-ASA inhibition in the NFκB pathway is downstream of phosphorylation of IKKα. In addition, this shows specificity of kinase inhibition. To verify that this serine-phosphorylated IKKα isolated from YAMC cells had increased kinase activity, immunoprecipitated IKKα was separated for use in a kinase assay. Immunoisolated IKKα from YAMC cells treated with TNFα in the presence of 5-ASA was divided for anin vitro kinase assay with GST-IκBα in the presence or absence of 5-ASA. Serine-phosphorylated IKKα recovered from YAMC cells treated with TNFα in the presence of 5-ASA still phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 7 B). However, this phosphorylation was inhibited by the addition of 5-ASA to the kinase assays. These findings clearly indicate that the specific inhibitory effect of 5-ASA in this TNFα signal transduction pathway is at the level of the IκB kinase. In this report, we demonstrate that 5-ASA and other salicylates specifically inhibit TNFα-induced IκB kinase activity in intact intestinal epithelial cells. Whereas in vitro kinase assays show these compounds block IκBα phosphorylation by either IKKα or IKKβ, immunodepletion of IKKα from lysates of TNFα-treated cells shows a 66% reduction in kinase activity toward IκB. Consistent with these findings, 5-ASA does not inhibit IKKα serine phosphorylation by its upstream kinases in intact cells. Thus, inhibition of IKKα activity toward IκBα may function as an important therapeutic mechanism for 5-ASA in inflammatory bowel disease by blocking TNFα-stimulated IκBα degradation and NFκB activation in intestinal epithelial cells. TNFα has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD in humans, as well as a number of animal models (38James S.P. Targan S.R. Shanahan F. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: From Bench to Bedside. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1994: 65-77Google Scholar, 39Fiocchi C. Podolsky D.K. Kirsner J.B. Shorter R.G. Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1995: 252-280Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the effects of TNFα are mediated via inflammatory cells present in the submucosa of the intestinal epithelial monolayer. However, little attention has been directed toward the effects of TNFα on the intestinal epithelial cells. A recent report showed an increased nuclear localization of NFκB in the epithelial cells at sites of mucosal inflammation (13Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholmerich J. Gross V. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These findings suggest an effect of increased mucosal TNFα levels in IBD may be to stimulate NFκB-induced cytokine production by intestinal epithelial cells. Similar effects have been proposed to support roles for TNFα in the pathogenesis of other chronic inflammatory conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, arthritis, chronic hepatitis, and psoriasis (40Kontoyiannis D.

Aderka D. Camp R.D.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although both IKKα and IKKβ directly phosphorylate IκBα, these display distinct modes of regulation when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Overexpression of IKKβ leads to constitutive phosphorylation of IκB, whereas overexpression of IKKα does not phosphorylate IκB unless cells are stimulated by TNFα (22Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 25Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells IKKβ, not IKKα, is the target of TNFα signal transduction and is essential for IKK activation (37Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). On the basis of our findings combined with those of Gaynor and colleagues on salicylates (6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), we suggest that both IKKα and IKKβ are targets for 5-ASA inhibition of NFκB activation. In the present study, we find that 5-ASA inhibits phosphorylation of IκBα by either IKKα or IKKβ. In agreement with this observation, 5-ASA also inhibited autophosphorylation of either kinase. Interestingly, we observed inhibition of IκB phosphorylation in vitro by 5-ASA at picomolar concentrations compared with the reported micromolar concentrations required for aspirin inhibition of IKKβ (6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Because immunoprecipitating antibodies for mouse IKKβ are not readily available, we used an immunodepletion assay to assess the relative contributions of IKKα and IKKβ in TNFα-stimulated phosphorylation of IκBα. Our findings suggest that the majority of kinase activity is contributed by IKKα since immunodepletion of cellular extracts reduced most of the kinase activity toward IκBα. Even with prolonged exposure, no IKKβ was detected in these immunoprecipitates, despite readily detectable β form in the cellular lysates. Since our immunodepletion assay using HeLa cells showed both IKKα and IKKβ were precipitated by anti-IKKα antibody, it appears likely that the assay is sufficient to detect complex formation, if present, in intestinal cells. Definitive evidence regarding the absolute contribution of IKKα and IKKβ in TNFα signal transduction in intestinal cells requires further study. However, these findings indicate the relative contribution of IκB kinase isozyme activity toward IκB varies between cell types. It is noteworthy that salicylates also deplete intracellular ATP concentrations (44Cronstein B.N. Van de Stouwe M. Druska L. Levin R.I. Weissmann G. Inflammation. 1994; : 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, this seems unlikely to be the mechanism of 5-ASA inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation in intact cells. First, the TNFα-induced serine phosphorylation of IKKα occurs in these experiments despite 5-ASA in the media. Also, we have previously shown that 5-ASA does not inhibit EGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation (5Kaiser G.C. Yan F. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 602-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The findings in that report show 5-ASA also inhibits TNFα-stimulated MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation. Together, these observations suggest either IKK is an upstream regulator of MAP kinase or, more likely, 5-ASA inhibits at least one other kinase such as Raf-1 or MEK-1. Aspirin and salicylic acid were recently reported to inhibit IKKβ activity, but not IKKα activity, toward IκBα in Jurkat cells andin vitro using recombinant proteins (6Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Somewhat at odds with that study, we found 5-ASA and other salicylates inhibit both IKKα and IKKβ autophosphorylation and their phosphorylation of IκBα. Based on our observation that picomolar concentrations of 5-ASA were sufficient to inhibit IκBα phosphorylation by either cellular lysates from TNFα-treated cells or immunoprecipitated IKKα, we propose that 5-ASA inhibits IKKα at clinically relevant concentrations. If NFκB inhibition is an important target for 5-ASA in IBD, it is likely that cellular permeability is the limiting factor requiring millimolar concentrations for therapeutic benefit. As such, the specific interaction of 5-ASA inhibiting IKKα kinase represents an area for further investigation. Potentially, development of more cell-permeable inhibitors of IKKα may prove useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. We have found 5-ASA inhibits TNFα-stimulated IKKα kinase activity toward IκBα consequently inhibiting NFκB activation in intestinal epithelial cells. Such action could disrupt critical signal transduction pathways necessary for production of inflammatory mediators in IBD. Although the clinical relevance of this effect remains to be shown, these findings suggest development of more cell-permeable 5-ASA-like agents may represent an important area for novel therapeutic development in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

https://openalex.org/W2010861085,"Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are well known to accelerate G protein GTPase activity in vitro and to promote G protein desensitization in vivo. Less is known about how RGS proteins are themselves regulated. To address this question we purified the RGS in yeast, Sst2, and used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to identify post-translational modifications. This analysis revealed that Sst2 is phosphorylated at Ser-539 and that phosphorylation occurs in response to pheromone stimulation. Ser-539 lies within a consensus mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation site, Pro-X-Ser-Pro. Phosphorylation is blocked by mutations in the MAP kinase genes (FUS3, KSS1), as well as by mutations in components needed for MAP kinase activation (STE11, STE7, STE4, STE18). Phosphorylation is also blocked by replacing Ser-539 with Ala, Asp, or Glu (but not Thr). These point mutations do not alter pheromone sensitivity, as determined by growth arrest and reporter transcription assays. However, phosphorylation appears to slow the rate of Sst2 degradation. These findings indicate that the G protein-regulated MAP kinase in yeast can act as a feedback regulator of Sst2, itself a regulator of G protein signaling.

G-protein coupled receptor kinase mitogen-activated protein regulator of G protein signaling solid phase extraction nickel nitrilotriacetic acid mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis All eukaryotic cells respond to external signals through cell surface receptors linked to heterotrimeric G proteins. In humans, G protein-linked receptors can detect hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli (odors, taste, light). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein linked pheromone receptors mediate events required for mating and cell fusion. Upon receptor stimulation, the G protein binds GTP and undergoes subunit dissociation. The Gα subunit or the Gβγ subunit dimer can then propagate the signal through a variety of effector enzymes or ion channels. Upon GTP hydrolysis, the G protein subunits reassociate and signaling stops. Additional proteins can modulate this cycle of G protein activation and inactivation. For instance, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)1 and arrestins promote desensitization through phosphorylation, uncoupling, and internalization of the receptor (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It is now evident that G proteins are also subject to desensitization and that this process involves members of the RGS protein family. The contribution of RGS proteins in vivo has been established through genetic analysis in yeast and nematodes. In yeast, disruption of the RGS gene SST2 can increase pheromone sensitivity by 100–300-fold (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanism of RGS action has also been well characterized through detailed biochemical and x-ray crystallographic analysis of purified components (3Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Stop flow fluorescence measurements reveal that RGS proteins can accelerate Gα GTPase activity by up to 1000-fold (5Lan K.L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. Mackenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G.

Some RGS genes, includingSST2, are transcriptionally induced by G protein activation (6Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Virtually nothing is known about how these proteins are regulated post-translationally, however. In particular, it is not known if RGS proteins are phosphorylated or otherwise modified in response to cell stimulation. To address this question, we examined whether Sst2 undergoes any chemical modifications in vivo. Our analysis reveals that Sst2 is stoichiometrically phosphorylated at Ser-539, in response to pheromone stimulation, and in a Fus3-dependent manner. Phosphorylation appears to stabilize the protein, thereby augmenting the transcriptional induction that occurs in response to pheromone stimulation.

SST2 mutants were obtained using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. BJ2168 cells transformed with pAD4M-SST2-his were grown to A600 nm ∼ 0.8 and treated with 2.5 μm α-factor, as indicated. Cells were chilled, harvested by centrifugation, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed in urea buffer (6 m urea, 100 mmNa2H2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole (at 250 ml/6 liter of medium) at room temperature. Cells were further disrupted using a stainless steel beadbeater (Biospec) packed in ice and salt, with 10 × 30-s pulses, once every 90 s. The remaining procedures were carried out at room temperature. The disrupted cells were rocked for 60–90 min, then clarified by centrifugation 3840 × g, 15 min and paper filtration (Whatman No. 1). The soluble material was mixed with 3 ml of equilibrated Superflow Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 60–90 min, then packed into a HR 10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and washed using 10 column volumes (CV) of urea buffer, 250 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole at 1.5 ml/min, followed by 10 CV urea buffer at 1 ml/min. Sst2 was eluted in 10 CV of urea buffer, 75 mm imidazole at 1 ml/min. The eluate was mixed with 2 ml of equilibrated Mono Q resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min, then packed into a HR 10/10 column and washed with 5 CV of urea buffer at 1 ml/min, then 7.5 CV of urea buffer and a linear gradient (0–60 mm) of NaCl at 0.5 ml/min and 7.5 CV 60 mm NaCl urea buffer at 0.5 ml/min. Sst2 was eluted with 15 CV urea buffer, 1 m NaCl at 0.5 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted using an Ultrafree-30 (Millipore) filter. The final purified product (500 μl) was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfide-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining (Silver Stain Plus, Bio-Rad). Except where indicated, 16-cm 8% acrylamide gels were used to resolve the 82- and 84-kDa species of Sst2. Antibodies and conditions for immunoblot detection of Sst2 are described elsewhere (7Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each silver-stained protein band (∼1 μg) was excised (20-cm gel) and transferred to a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and destained with a 1:1 solution of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate for 2 min. The gel was washed four times with Milli-Q water, cut into small pieces, washed three times for 8 min each with 12.5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile and Speedvac-lyophilized. Samples were reconstituted with 40 μl of 12.5 ng/ml endoproteinase Asp-N or pepsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated on ice for 40 min, then at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted three times with 40 μl of 5% acetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. All four supernatants were pooled, and the solution was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 10 μl of capillary electrophoresis buffer (10 mm acetic acid, 10% MeOH). Solid phase extraction (SPE) capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was performed essentially as described (16Figeys D. Ducret A. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The SPE cartridge consisted of Spherisorb C-18 material between two Teflon membranes inside a Teflon tube (17Figeys D. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reconstituted peptide mixture was loaded on the SPE cartridge at 1 μl/min. The concentrated peptides were washed for 10 min and eluted by applying a small plug of 67% acetonitrile, 3 mm acetic acid across the SPE cartridge. Separation was achieved by capillary electrophoresis in a 50 μm inner diameter and 150 μm outer diameter fused silica capillary 40 cm in length. Separated analytes were electrosprayed into a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer and detected in the MS mode. Ion signals above a predetermined threshold automatically triggered the instrument to switch from MS to MS/MS mode for generating collision-induced dissociated spectra (data-dependent MS/MS). The ion trap was run with automatic gain, and the MS scan was performed in three segments from 400–900, 900–1400, and 1400–2000 atomic mass units, respectively. To determine the phosphorylation site in the protein, the generated collision-induced dissociated spectra were searched against a yeast genomic sequence data base using the SEQUEST search program (18Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). To determine whether Sst2 undergoes post-translational modification, we isolated a His-tagged version of the protein from both pheromone-stimulated and -unstimulated cells. Cells were disrupted in a denaturing buffer containing 6 m urea, so as to fully solubilize Sst2 and to preserve any modifications. Sst2 was then purified by sequential Ni2+-NTA affinity and Mono Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography, and resolved by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figs. 1 and2, Sst2 from control (unstimulated) cells migrates at the predicted size of ∼82 kDa, while Sst2 from pheromone-stimulated cells migrates as a doublet of ∼82 and 84 kDa. Both products were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Sst2 antibodies (Fig. 1 A, bottom) and by mass spectrometry sequencing (Fig. 1 B).FIG. 2Phosphorylation requires Fus3 and Ser-539. A, to determine whether Ser-539 is phosphorylated in vivo, this residue was replaced with Ala (A), Glu (E), Asp (D), or Thr (T). BJ2168 cells expressing wild-type or mutant Sst2 (pAD4M-SST2-His) were treated with α-factor for 1 h (“+”). Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the conversion of Sst2 to the phosphorylated species was monitored by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using anti-Sst2 antibodies (7Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).B, to determine the time course of Sst2 phosphorylationin vivo, BJSST2 cells containing pRS316-ADH-SST2 were exposed to 2.5 μm α-factor for the indicated times, lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and monitored by immunoblotting.C, to determine which signaling components are needed for Sst2 phosphorylation, extracts were prepared from YPH499 or YPH499-based mutant strains, containing pRS316-ADH-SST2, and lacking the α-factor receptor (STE2), the G protein β subunit (STE4), the Gγ subunit (STE18), the MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase (STE20), the MAP kinase kinase kinase (STE11), the MAP kinase kinase (STE7), the functionally redundant MAP kinases (FUS3, KSS1), or the downstream transcription factor (STE12). Thegpa1 G302S product cannot bind to Sst2, but is otherwise fully functional (24DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fus3K42R lacks kinase activity (31Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 2.5 μm α-factor for 1 h as indicated (“+”), and subjected to immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The appearance of a new higher molecular weight species suggested that Sst2 undergoes some form of stimulus-dependent post-translational modification. To characterize this further, each band was excised from the gel, subjected to limited proteolysis, and analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. As indicated in Fig. 1 B, a phospho-Ser at position 539 was present in the 84-kDa band. The corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide was obtained from the 82-kDa bands, from either stimulated or unstimulated cells (data not shown). To confirm that phosphorylation occurs on Ser-539, we replaced this amino acid with Ala, Glu, Asp, or Thr. With the exception of Thr, these residues cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinases. The acidic residues Asp and Glu can often substitute for the negatively charged phospho-Ser (19Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). As expected, the Ser-539 → Thr mutation preserved the pheromone-dependent mobility shift, while the Ala, Asp, and Glu mutations blocked the shift completely (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that Sst2 undergoes a stimulus-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-539 and that Ser-539 phosphorylation causes the gel mobility shift. Ser-539 lies within an ideal consensus sequence (Pro-X-Ser-Pro) for phosphorylation by MAP kinases (19Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). Indeed, the pheromone signaling pathway involves at least one MAP kinase family member, Fus3 (20Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2817-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether Sst2 is a substrate for Fus3 in vivo, we examined whether Sst2 phosphorylation requires Fus3 expression or activity. We first established the time course of Sst2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). We then tested whether Sst2 is phosphorylated in cells lacking the FUS3 gene or any of the other known components of the signaling cascade (Fig. 2 C). As predicted, Sst2 failed to undergo phosphorylation in cells lacking FUS3, provided that KSS1 (another MAP kinase that can partially rescue a fus3 mutant) was also deleted (21Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 22Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was not restored by a Fus3 mutant (Lys-42 → Arg) that lacks kinase activity. Phosphorylation was also abolished by mutations that block expression of the upstream MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK, Ste7) or MAPKK kinase (Ste11). This was expected, since both Ste7 and Ste11 are required for Fus3 activity (23Gartner A. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was preserved in a Gpa1Gly-302 → Ser mutant that cannot bind Sst2 (24DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5780-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as well as in mutants lacking the MAPKKK kinase Ste20 or the transcription factor (and Fus3 substrate) Ste12. Deletion of the pheromone receptor Ste2 blocks the pheromone-mediated response, but also leads to elevated basal signaling (9Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sst2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the only components of the pathway necessary for Sst2 phosphorylation are those needed to activate MAP kinase and the MAP kinase itself. Taken together, these findings indicate that Sst2 is phosphorylated in vivo by Fus3. Loss-of-function mutations in Sst2 are well known to increase pheromone sensitivity (25Chan R.K. Otte C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine whether MAP kinase phosphorylation has any effect on pheromone signaling in vivo, we tested the ability of the Ser-539 mutants to regulate the pheromone response pathway, using a reporter transcription assay. As shown in Fig. 3 A, pheromone-induced gene transcription (using the FUS1 promoter linked to the essential HIS3 gene) was unaffected by any of the Ser-539 substitutions. Likewise, no difference was seen using an alternative pheromone bioassay, the growth inhibition plate assay (halo assay, Fig. 3 B) (26Pausch M.H. Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Strnad J. Delacruz F.

Some regulatory factors (e.g. cyclins, cyclin inhibitors) are targeted for destruction by phosphorylation and, in some cases, by ubiquitination (28Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered whether phosphorylation of Ser-539 contributes to Sst2 proteolysis. Cells were transformed with plasmids containing wild-type or the 539 mutant forms of Sst2, under the control of a constitutive promoter (ADH1, to prevent pheromone-mediated changes in SST2transcription). Cells were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and sampled at various times. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the overall levels of Sst2 drop rapidly when translation is blocked, but the decrease is most pronounced for thenonphosphorylated (82-kDa) species. An alternative explanation, that loss of the 82-kDa species is due to increased phosphorylation, is improbable, since there is no concomitant increase in the 84-kDa form of the protein. Surprisingly, all of the 539 mutants degraded at rates comparable with the phosphorylated form of Sst2 (data not shown). These data suggest that Sst2 is rapidly degraded, except when Ser-539 is phosphorylated or replaced with another amino acid. One of the defining characteristics of desensitization is feedback inhibition. One way this is accomplished is through increased expression of factors that can attenuate the signal. Indeed it is well known that increased expression of Sst2 will inhibit the pheromone response (7Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that pheromone stimulation leads to increased transcription of SST2 (6Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that pheromone stimulation promotes increased stabilization of the protein, and this is achieved in part through phosphorylation at Ser-539. The combined effect of transcriptional induction and protein stabilization should allow for sustained expression of Sst2 and at a lower energy expenditure than transcriptional induction alone. Consistent with this interpretation, we have found that expression of endogenous Sst2 is induced by pheromone (7Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the induced protein exists predominantly in the 84-kDa phosphorylated form (data not shown). The Ser-539 mutants do not alter pheromone sensitivity, presumably because they are stabilized even without being phosphorylated. How do these findings fit with our understanding of RGS structure-function relationships? The crystal structure determination of rat Gi1α complexed with RGS4 provides some important insights (3Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The RGS core region contains nine α-helices that form two subdomains. The majority of residues that contact Gα are on the “bottom” of the subdomain comprised of helices 4, 5, 6, and 7. A structurally based alignment of RGS4 and Sst2 reveals that Ser-539 lies between helices 6 and 7, on “top” of this subdomain. Thus it appears that Sst2 is phosphorylated at a site distal from the G protein binding interface and therefore would not be expected to have any direct effect on Sst2-Gpa1 interaction. Correspondingly, Sst2 could undergo phosphorylation even in the Gpa1-bound state. This model is consistent with the lack of any G protein modulatory effects of the Ser-539 mutants. There is also the possibility that phosphorylation modulates some other (G protein-independent) function of Sst2. The adjoining region of Sst2 has a 118-amino acid insert (residues 539–657). The function of this region is unknown, but it is probably dispensable for GTPase accelerating activity, since it is absent in all other RGS proteins. Intriguingly, the same insert contains at least two PEST motifs (544–581 and 606–626) (7Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are often found in proteins that are rapidly degraded (29Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Perhaps this insert serves as a proteolytic signal, but one which is regulated by pheromone-dependent MAP kinase activity. How do these findings fit with our understanding of MAP kinase function? To our knowledge, this work represents the first direct identification of a MAP kinase phosphorylation site in yeast. It is also a rare example of a MAP kinase substrate outside of the nucleus (30Peter M. Gartner A. Horecka J. Ammerer G. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1993; 73: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 31Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol.

In yeast, Fus3 is known to phosphorylate a transcriptional activator (Ste12), transcriptional repressors (Dig1, Dig2), and cyclin inhibitors (30Peter M. Gartner A. Horecka J. Ammerer G. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1993; 73: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Kron S.J. Thorner J.

Even in mammalian cells only a handful of non-nuclear substrates for MAP kinases have been identified. However, this list includes members of the GRK and arrestin families, two proteins that promote desensitization of G protein coupled receptors (35Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15971-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 4Robert J. Lefkowitz, personal communication. Thus the regulation of receptors and G proteins may be coordinated in part by the ability of MAP kinases to phosphorylate a variety of desensitization factors acting throughout the signaling pathway. In summary, RGS proteins are well known to promote G protein GTPase activity and desensitization. Our objective was to determine whether RGS proteins are themselves regulated, through post-translational modification. Our demonstration that Sst2 is phosphorylated in response to pheromone stimulation reveals one way that G protein signaling pathways might undergo feedback regulation in vivo. Given the striking similarities in yeast and human RGS proteins, it is likely that the regulatory mechanisms described here will also be recapitulated in more complex organisms.

Localization analysis using green fluorescent protein fusion protein and immunostaining showed that Npw38 and NpwBP are colocalized in the same subnuclear region. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the association between Npw38 and NpwBP, which were expressed as epitope-tagged forms in COS7 cells.

WW domains have been revealed to be involved in mediating protein-protein interaction that resulted from a binding between the WW domain and a proline-rich motif in a corresponding ligand. Recent reports described various pairs of proteins mediated by WW domains, which have potential involvement in signaling processes that underlie human disease (5Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J.

A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, a different class of motif has been found in phosphoproteins to which WW domains of the Pin1 and the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 bind in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (15Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar).We have previously reported a novel WW domain-containing protein Npw38 (16Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Npw38 is localized in the nucleus and has binding ability for poly(rG). The WW domain of Npw38 possesses eight hydrophobic amino acid residues in a relatively acidic region, while other WW domains have rather hydrophilic and more basic residues. These characteristics may contribute to the ligand binding specificity of Npw38. To characterize a binding motif in a Npw38 ligand, we tried to find a physiological ligand of the WW domain of Npw38 using a yeast two-hybrid screening system. However, we failed to identify the ligand because the WW domain itself caused a basal transcriptional activation (16Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the isolation of a Npw38-binding protein, NpwBP, from HeLa nuclear extracts using affinity purification and the characterization of NpwBP using its cDNA. NpwBP has been shown to have two proline-rich regions that are capable of interacting with the WW domain of Npw38. The precise binding motif was determined by a binding assay using an oligopeptide-immobilized membrane, demonstrating a novel WW domain-binding motif composed of proline, glycine, and arginine. Localization and immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that Npw38 and NpwBP associate with each other in the nucleus. Furthermore, NpwBP was shown to have nucleotide binding ability as does Npw38.DISCUSSIONWe have purified a nuclear protein associating Npw38 from HeLa nuclear extracts and have named it NpwBP. The cloning and characterization of the NpwBP cDNA revealed that NpwBP has two proline-rich regions. Two kinds of binding assays using GST fusion proteins and in vitro translated products and using the yeast two-hybrid system showed that NpwBP associates with Npw38 through interaction between the WW domain of Npw38 and the two proline-rich regions in NpwBP. The conserved two Trp and one Pro residues have been shown to be essential for this interaction by mutation analysis. Localization analysis showed that NpwBP is colocalized with Npw38 in the nucleus. Npw38 and NpwBP expressed in COS7 cells were coimmunoprecipitated. All these results indicate that NpwBP is a physiological ligand of the WW domain of Npw38.The binding assay using an oligopeptide-immobilized membrane demonstrated that the sequence motif interacting with the WW domain of Npw38 is PPGPPP. Npw38 has five sites containing a PPGPPP motif in which two sites (positions 199–204 and 459–464) are the most likely binding sites based on the results of the oligopeptide binding assay. It should be noted that these two PPGPPP sequences are flanked by Arg within three amino acids. The importance of the flanked Arg was confirmed by oligopeptide binding assay and site-directed mutation analysis. Thus we named it a PGR motif. The contribution of Arg to the interaction may be attributed to an acidic environment of the WW domain of Npw38 compared with the basic ones of other WW domains. The structural analysis of the complex between the WW domain of YAP and a peptide containing a PPXY motif revealed that the peptide binds to a hydrophobic surface formed by three amino acids, including the second Trp-39, Tyr-28, and Leu-30 (19Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which correspond to Trp-75, Tyr-64, and Trp-66 in the WW domain of Npw38. This hydrophobic region of Npw38 is surrounded by three acidic amino acids (Asp-58, Asp-69, and Asp-71). These acidic residues may contribute to stabilize the binding of a PGR motif sequence to the hydrophobic pocket through ionic interaction between Arg and Asp.A protein data base search showed 21 sequences containing PPGPPP, in which the following three sequences have a PPGPPP flanked by Arg: (i) human hypothetical protein KIAA0755 (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB018298), TRGMLPPGPPPPGPHQ (53–68); (ii) human atrophin-1 (Swiss-Prot accession number P54259), YKTASPPGPPPYGKRA (623–638);(iii) herpes simplex virus trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP4 (Swiss-Prot accession number P08392), PGRTPPPGPPPLSEAP (232–249). These sequences may not be a physiological ligand of Npw38, because Arg in KIAA0755 or Atrophin-1 is not located within three amino acids flanked by PPGPPP, and the trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP4 is flanked not only by upstream Arg but also by downstream Glu. Experiments are needed to confirm this.Previously, we demonstrated that the WW domain of Npw38 can activate a basal transcription in yeast and mammalian cells, suggesting that the WW domain may interact with transcriptional machinery. The single mutation among conserved two Trps and one Pro did not affect this transcription activation, whereas the same mutation abolished the interaction between Npw38 and NpwBP. These results imply that the transcriptional activation by the WW domain of Npw38 may not result from the interaction via a PGR motif and that the WW domain of Npw38 could have dual binding abilities for different ligands through which Npw38 may play dual roles in nuclear events. At present, it is not clear whether the interaction of the WW domain with transcriptional machinery is physiologically meaningful.NpwBP has been shown to have binding ability for poly(rG) and G-rich ssDNA, whereas Npw38 binds preferentially to poly(rG) but not ssDNA as described in the previous paper (16Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The G-specific binding to AdMLP has been reported on hTAFII68, which is a component of a multiprotein complex composed of the TATA-binding protein and TATA-binding protein-associated factors (20Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Like this complex, the Npw38-NpwBP complex may play a role in mediating a link between DNA and RNA in transcriptional or posttranscriptional events. The identification of other proteins interacting with the Npw38-NpwBP complex will help elucidate the physiological role of this complex in these nuclear events. WW domains are globular modules composed of 35–40 amino acids in which two tryptophans and one proline are conserved (1Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem.

Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Like this complex, the Npw38-NpwBP complex may play a role in mediating a link between DNA and RNA in transcriptional or posttranscriptional events. The identification of other proteins interacting with the Npw38-NpwBP complex will help elucidate the physiological role of this complex in these nuclear events. We have purified a nuclear protein associating Npw38 from HeLa nuclear extracts and have named it NpwBP. The cloning and characterization of the NpwBP cDNA revealed that NpwBP has two proline-rich regions. Two kinds of binding assays using GST fusion proteins and in vitro translated products and using the yeast two-hybrid system showed that NpwBP associates with Npw38 through interaction between the WW domain of Npw38 and the two proline-rich regions in NpwBP. The conserved two Trp and one Pro residues have been shown to be essential for this interaction by mutation analysis. Localization analysis showed that NpwBP is colocalized with Npw38 in the nucleus. Npw38 and NpwBP expressed in COS7 cells were coimmunoprecipitated. All these results indicate that NpwBP is a physiological ligand of the WW domain of Npw38. The binding assay using an oligopeptide-immobilized membrane demonstrated that the sequence motif interacting with the WW domain of Npw38 is PPGPPP. Npw38 has five sites containing a PPGPPP motif in which two sites (positions 199–204 and 459–464) are the most likely binding sites based on the results of the oligopeptide binding assay. It should be noted that these two PPGPPP sequences are flanked by Arg within three amino acids. The importance of the flanked Arg was confirmed by oligopeptide binding assay and site-directed mutation analysis. Thus we named it a PGR motif. The contribution of Arg to the interaction may be attributed to an acidic environment of the WW domain of Npw38 compared with the basic ones of other WW domains. The structural analysis of the complex between the WW domain of YAP and a peptide containing a PPXY motif revealed that the peptide binds to a hydrophobic surface formed by three amino acids, including the second Trp-39, Tyr-28, and Leu-30 (19Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which correspond to Trp-75, Tyr-64, and Trp-66 in the WW domain of Npw38. This hydrophobic region of Npw38 is surrounded by three acidic amino acids (Asp-58, Asp-69, and Asp-71). These acidic residues may contribute to stabilize the binding of a PGR motif sequence to the hydrophobic pocket through ionic interaction between Arg and Asp. A protein data base search showed 21 sequences containing PPGPPP, in which the following three sequences have a PPGPPP flanked by Arg: (i) human hypothetical protein KIAA0755 (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB018298), TRGMLPPGPPPPGPHQ (53–68); (ii) human atrophin-1 (Swiss-Prot accession number P54259), YKTASPPGPPPYGKRA (623–638);(iii) herpes simplex virus trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP4 (Swiss-Prot accession number P08392), PGRTPPPGPPPLSEAP (232–249). These sequences may not be a physiological ligand of Npw38, because Arg in KIAA0755 or Atrophin-1 is not located within three amino acids flanked by PPGPPP, and the trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP4 is flanked not only by upstream Arg but also by downstream Glu. Experiments are needed to confirm this. Previously, we demonstrated that the WW domain of Npw38 can activate a basal transcription in yeast and mammalian cells, suggesting that the WW domain may interact with transcriptional machinery. The single mutation among conserved two Trps and one Pro did not affect this transcription activation, whereas the same mutation abolished the interaction between Npw38 and NpwBP. These results imply that the transcriptional activation by the WW domain of Npw38 may not result from the interaction via a PGR motif and that the WW domain of Npw38 could have dual binding abilities for different ligands through which Npw38 may play dual roles in nuclear events. At present, it is not clear whether the interaction of the WW domain with transcriptional machinery is physiologically meaningful. NpwBP has been shown to have binding ability for poly(rG) and G-rich ssDNA, whereas Npw38 binds preferentially to poly(rG) but not ssDNA as described in the previous paper (16Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

Now, we show that p22 phox , a subunit of the NADPH oxidase component flavocytochrome b 558, also is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation is selectively activated by phosphatidic acid (PA) versus other lipids and occurs on a threonine residue in p22 phox . We identified two protein kinase families capable of phosphorylating p22 phox : 1) a potentially novel, partially purified PA-activated protein kinase(s) known to phosphorylate p47 phox and postulated to mediate the phosphorylation-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase by PA and 2) conventional, but not novel or atypical, isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). In contrast, all classes of PKC isoforms could phosphorylate p47 phox . In a gel retardation assay both the phosphatidic acid-dependent kinase and conventional PKC isoforms phosphorylated all molecules of p22 phox . These findings suggest that phosphorylation of p22 phox by conventional PKC and/or a novel PA-activated protein kinase regulates the activation/assembly of NADPH oxidase.

This defense is achieved, in part, by the respiratory burst, leading to the production of superoxide anion, which along with its metabolic products are toxic to invading microorganisms. The respiratory burst is mediated by the multicomponent enzyme complex, the NADPH oxidase. The two membrane-bound components (p22 phox and gp91 phox) form the heterodimeric flavocytochrome b 558 (2Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin.

Thus, it has been hypothesized that phospholipase D and its product, PA, play important roles in the signal transduction mechanisms leading to superoxide anion production. Recently, our laboratory developed and characterized a cell-free system for NADPH oxidase activation, which was synergistically activated by PA + diacylglycerol (35Qualliotine-Mann D. Agwu D.E.

A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activation was enhanced by ATP and reduced by protein kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, PA induced the phosphorylation of several neutrophil proteins. These data suggest that phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms are involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in this cell-free system. We have reported that p47 phox is phosphorylated in this system by a novel, cytosolic PA-activated protein kinase (36McPhail L.C. Qualliotine-Mann D. Waite K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have now characterized the phosphorylation of p22 phox in vitro and show that a potentially novel, PA-activated protein kinase and conventional but not other protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are able to phosphorylate this protein.

In the first method, CNBr-activated Sepharose beads were conjugated to either mAb 44.1 or the isotype control, according to manufacturer's directions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Solubilized membrane was precleared with isotype control antibodies-conjugated beads and then incubated with the mAb 44.1-conjugated (∼150 μg of solubilized membrane protein/15 μl antibody-conjugated beads) at 4 °C for 16 h. Alternatively, protein A-Sepharose and either the isotype control antibody or mAb 44.1 were incubated with the solubilized membrane (500 μg solubilized membrane/20 μg antibody) at 4 °C for 16 h. The beads were washed, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 14 or 8–15% SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE using Laemmli sample buffer (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and separated on 8–15, 7, or 14% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or GelCode Blue Stain (Pierce), destained, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography and densitometry. In some experiments, proteins were transferred electrophoretically (51Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar) to nitrocellulose for autoradiography and Western blot analysis. Autoradiographs were analyzed by scanning densitometry (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). Western blot analysis for p47 phox was performed as described previously (37Waite K.A. Wallin R. Qualliotine-Mann D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15569-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For p22 phox Western blotting, a transfer buffer optimized for flavocytochrome b 558 (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 20% methanol, 0.1% SDS) was used (51Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl.

Blood. 1989; 73: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20), incubated with mAb 44.1 (1:1000 dilution) for 4 h at room temperature, and washed for 2 h. The blot was incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h followed by six 10-min washes. Proteins were visualized using SuperSignalTM Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Pierce). Lipid phosphorous assays were performed as described previously (53Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), using NaH2PO4 (5–50 nmol) for the standard curve. Phosphorylated p22 phox was excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to hydrolysis with 6 nHCl for 1.5 h at 110 °C (54Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were separated by thin layer electrophoresis at 1100 V for 45 min in water:acetic acid:pyridine (189:10:1, pH 3.5) (11El Benna J. Dang P.M.-C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Morel F. Hakim J.

As shown in Fig. 1 A (left two lanes), when neutrophil membrane and cytosolic fractions were incubated with di10:0PA, a 22-kDa protein was phosphorylated. Because this phosphoprotein was the appropriate size for the light chain of the flavocytochrome, we hypothesized it could be p22 phox . Neutrophil membrane fractions from patients with flavocytochrome b 558-deficient CGD were substituted for normal membrane fractions in the reaction mixture. Membrane fractions from a total of four patients, two with the X-linked form of CGD and two with the autosomal recessive form, were tested. The two patients with X-linked CGD were previously characterized as having ∼10% of the normal levels of flavocytochromeb 558 (46Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Anklesaria P. Erickson R.W. Rae J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.J. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the sibling pair with the autosomal recessive form had no detectable flavocytochromeb 558.2 As shown in Fig. 1 A (right two lanes), the substitution of neutrophil membrane fractions from a patient having ∼10% normal levels of flavocytochrome b 558 resulted in markedly reduced levels of the phosphorylated 22-kDa protein. Similar results were obtained with membrane fractions from the other X-linked patient, and no PA-dependent phosphorylation of a 22-kDa band was observed using membrane fractions from the two patients totally deficient in flavocytochrome b 558 (data not shown). To further confirm that p22 phox was phosphorylated, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using a monoclonal antibody to the protein (41Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation in the presence of cytosol, membrane fractions were reisolated, and solubilized proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the p22 phox -specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B (left two lanes), a phosphorylated 22-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from membrane fractions incubated with neutrophil cytosol in the presence of di10:0PA. Very little phosphorylation was observed in immunoprecipitates from membrane fractions incubated in the presence of neutrophil cytosol without the addition of di10:0PA. In contrast, no phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with the isotype control antibody (Fig. 1 B, right two lanes). We performed two additional experiments to verify that p22 phox is phosphorylated by a PA-dependent protein kinase present in neutrophil cytosol. First, purified, relipidated flavocytochromeb 558 was mixed with neutrophil cytosolic fractions in the absence or presence of di10:0PA. In the presence of purified flavocytochrome b 558, di10:0PA clearly induces the phosphorylation of a protein migrating at 22 kDa (Fig. 1 C, right three lanes). Because only a faint band at 22 kDa is observed in the absence of the purified flavocytochromeb 558 (Fig. 1 C, left two lanes), these results indicate that the 22-kDa band is p22 phox . In the second experiment, we tested whether a recombinant form of p22 phox could undergo PA-dependent phosphorylation. We used a GST-p22 phox fusion protein containing amino acids 127–195 of p22 phox, comprising the putative cytosolic tail of the protein (55Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tokita K. Ochiai H. Nakamura M. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of the protein also contains three protein kinase phosphorylation motifs (Wisconsin Package version 9.0, Genetics Computing Group, Madison, WI). Therefore, it might be expected that this portion of the protein would contain a PA-dependent phosphorylation site(s). As shown in Fig. 1 D, in the presence of di10:0PA and neutrophil cytosolic fractions, the p22 phox peptide was phosphorylated. Thus, the cytosolic portion of p22 phox contains one or more PA-dependent phosphorylation site(s). Therefore, p22 phox can be phosphorylated by a PA-dependent protein kinase, presumably present in neutrophil cytosol. In none of these experiments did we observe evidence of phosphorylation of the flavocytochrome b heavy chain, gp91 phox (data not shown). To characterize the phosphorylation of p22 phox by a PA-activated protein kinase, we varied the concentration of di10:0PA from 0 to 300 μm, and the time of incubation from 0 to 120 min. Optimal phosphorylation of p22 phox was obtained with incubation of neutrophil cytosol and membrane fractions in the presence of 10 μm di10:0PA for 60 min (data not shown). This concentration of PA is within the range of that measured in stimulated neutrophils (56Agwu D.E. McPhail L.C. Wykle R.L. McCall C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), thus indicating that phosphorylation is mediated by a physiological concentration of PA. We next determined the lipid specificity for the induction of p22 phox phosphorylation. At 10 μm, only di10:0 PA (PA) clearly induced p22 phox phosphorylation. However, the addition of 10 μm PS or phosphatidylinositol (PI) caused a faint darkening over background in the 22 kDa range (Fig. 2 A,top panel). A concentration curve with PS (0–300 μm) revealed a low level of p22 phox phosphorylation with a maximum at 100 μm (data not shown). We then screened various lipids at 100 μm for their ability to induce p22 phox phosphorylation. At this concentration, PS, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and 1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (LPA) induced low levels of p22 phox phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). However, di10:0PA clearly induced the highest response. We examined the ability of PA species with different acyl chain compositions to induce p22 phox phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, di10:0PA (10:0), at either 10 or 100 μm, induced the highest level of p22 phox phosphorylation; however, both 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18:1) and the physiological egg lecithin-derived PA (egg) also had activity. In contrast, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18:0) was unable to induce the phosphorylation of p22 phox . Thus, PA-induced phosphorylation of p22 phox shows selectivity for short or unsaturated acyl chains over long, saturated acyl chains. To identify the type of protein kinase that mediates p22 phox phosphorylation, we tested the effect of several protein kinase inhibitors. 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)piperazine, an H-7 analog, selectively blocks protein Ser/Thr kinases (42Gerard C. McPhail L.C. Marfat A. Stimler-Gerard N.P. Bass D.A. McCall C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14368–14373). Here, we report the molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene encoding the ceramidase of this strain. Specific oligonucleotide primers were synthesized using the peptide sequences of the purified ceramidase obtained by digestion with lysylendopeptidase and used for polymerase chain reaction. DNA fragments thus amplified were used as probes to clone the gene encoding the ceramidase from a genomic library of strain AN17. The open reading frame of 2,010 nucleotides encoded a polypeptide of 670 amino acids including a signal sequence of 24 residues, 64 residues of which matched the amino acid sequence determined for the purified enzyme. The molecular weight of the mature enzyme was estimated to be 70,767 from the deduced amino acid sequence. Expression of the ceramidase gene inEscherichia coli, resulted in production of a soluble enzyme with the identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. Recombinant ceramidase was purified to homogeneity from the lysate of E. coli cells and confirmed to be identical to thePseudomonas enzyme in its specificity and other enzymatic properties. No significant sequence similarities were found in other known functional proteins including human acid ceramidase. However, we found a sequence homologous to the ceramidase in hypothetical proteins encoded in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologue of the ceramidase gene was thus cloned from an M. tuberculosis cosmid and expressed in E. coli, and the gene was demonstrated to encode an alkaline ceramidase.

Since the first description of CDase activity in the rat brain by Gatt (1Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CDase has been found ubiquitously in mammalian tissues (3Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). Isoforms of CDase have been reported which mainly differ in their catalytic pH optima. Acid CDase in lysosomes plays a crucial role in the catabolism of ceramide, and an inherited deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of ceramide in lysosomes that is known as Farber disease (4Sugita M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Science. 1972; 178: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Acid CDase was purified from human urine (5Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K.

Sphingosine, a catalytic product of ceramide generated by CDase, has recently emerged as a novel lipid biomodulator. Several lines of evidence indicated that sphingosine could modulate cell activitiesvia inhibition of protein kinase C (11Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12604-12609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modulation of Na+, K+-ATPase (12Oishi K. Zheng B. Kuo J.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15246-152251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, sphingosine-1-phosphate, a phosphorylated derivative of sphingosine generated by the action of sphingosine kinase (14Stoffel W. Bauer E. Stahl J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was found to be involved in diverse biological processes including cell growth, survival, and motility (15Spiegel S.

Recently, a new class of G protein-coupled receptors named the EDG family was cloned, some of which were identified as putative receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate (18Lee M.-J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 19Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). CDase is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in generation of sphingosine and might be that of sphingosine-1-phosphate because sphingosine is only produced from ceramide by the action of ceramidase and not by de novo synthesis (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CDase could therefore have a critical role in signal transduction mediated by sphingosine and might be sphingosine-1-phosphate. It is interesting to note that neutral and alkaline CDases were up-regulated by growth factors (8Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and cytokines (10Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J.

In contrast to those of mammalian origin, there have been few reports on the occurrence of ceramidase in invertebrates. Recently, we purified and characterized a CDase from the Gram-negative bacteriumPseudomonas aeruginosa, strain AN17, isolated from a patient with atopic dermatitis (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This CDase, the first reported from a prokaryote, showed the highest activity around pH 8.5 and required calcium ions for its activity and was therefore identified as a novel type of alkaline CDase (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we report the molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression of the gene encoding the alkaline CDase from P. aeruginosa. We also describe the cloning and expression of a CDase homologue inMycobacterium tuberculosis which is known to cause tuberculosis. pTV118N, pTV119N, and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Japan. Restriction endonucleases and Ligation Pack were purchased from Nippon Gene Co., Japan. [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. d-Sphingosine and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma, and precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were from Merck, Germany.M. tuberculosis cosmid MTCI376 was a kind gift from Dr. S. T. Cole, Institut Pasteur, France. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. CDase from P. aeruginosa strain AN17 was purified as described previously (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The purified CDase was concentrated with a Y-shaped gel (160 × 160 × 2 mm) modified form of a funnel-shaped one (22Dainese H.P. Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 264: 336-343Google Scholar). After the concentration, protein band localized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue was cut out, reduced with dithiothreitol, and loaded again on a well of an usual SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The CDase band (about 2 μg) was cut out and treated in situ with lysylendopeptidase AP-1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated with a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column of C8 (RP-300, 1.0 × 100 mm, Applied Biosystems) and sequenced with a pulse-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise 492 cLc, Applied Biosystems). General cloning techniques were carried out essentially as described by Maniatiset al. (23Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 was isolated by the method of Saito and Miura (24Saito H. Miura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems), and a DNA Sequencer (model 377A, Applied Biosystems). PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides was used to amplify a DNA fragment encoding the CDase. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed using the internal amino acid sequences of C-89 and C-91 (Table I). PCR was performed with the AN17 genomic DNA as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles (each consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 51 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega), and their DNA sequences were determined. One PCR product (C89 s-C91a, named Probe 1) contained the sequence found in the purified CDase.Table IPeptide sequences of alkaline ceramidase from P. aeruginosa AN17N-terminalC-118 DDLPYRFGL(G)KADITGEAAXVGMMLysylendopeptidase digestC-86 VTXAFVTGHPKC-89 SFGDVLQQPRESYRIG(D)KS-90 DDLPYRFGLGKC-91 ISEIGGSTRSFEVLGTC-121 XFLEVVNIGK Open table in a new tab Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with various restriction endonucleases, and the digests were fractionated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis by the standard method (23Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was transferred from agarose gels onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Probe 1 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for hybridization, which was performed in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 7% SDS at 65 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed three times with 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% SDS at 65 °C and was exposed on an imaging plate, which was then examined after several hours using a BAS 1000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). Judging from the Southern blots of the ApaI digest using Probe 1, only the 2.4-kbp fragment was found to contain the CDase gene. For cloning of this gene, a digest with ApaI was prepared using 10 μg of genomic DNA. Restriction fragments of genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 were fractionated by preparative 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, and 2.4-kbp fragments were extracted from the gel. The ApaI fragments were ligated to the ApaI site of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). The recombinant plasmids thus obtained were used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α, which were employed for preparation of a gene library enriched with the CDase gene. Colony hybridization was performed by the standard procedure using Probe 1 (23Sambrook H. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One clone was selected, and the plasmid in the clone was designated pSCA59. Probe 2 was prepared by digestion of pSCA59 with KpnI andSacII. The probe, about 500-bp long, contained the 5′-end of the CDase gene in pSCA59 and was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. BamHI fragments (1.9 kbp) from genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 were ligated to theBamHI site of pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega) and used to transformE. coli DH5α, which were used for preparation of a gene library enriched with the 5′-end of the CDase gene. The library was screened by colony hybridization with Probe 2. The vector pTV119N was treated with HindIII. An insert that included the 5′-end of the CDase gene was prepared by digestion of deletion mutant of clone pGCB38 (pGCB38-D13) with HindIII and BamHI (nucleotide position, 612–1957), and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. An insert that included the 3′-end of the CDase gene was prepared by digestion of clone pSCA59 withHindIII and BamHI, and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two inserts were ligated with vector and used to transform E. coli JM109. The recombinant plasmid was purified and designated pTCD11. E. coli JM109 cells transformed with pTCD11 were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached about 0.5. Then isopropylthio-β-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture at the final concentration of 0.1 mm, and cultivation was continued for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in extraction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzensulfonylfluoride hydrochloride), and sonicated. After sonication, the solution was centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant obtained was used as the crude enzyme solution. The purified recombinant CDase was obtained from the crude extracts by using a combination of chromatographies using DEAE-Sepharose FF, phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF, chelating-Sepharose FF, and TSKgel G3000SW (Tosoh, Japan) as described previously (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The M. tuberculosiscosmid MTCI376 was treated with NotI, and the digest was separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 5-kbp fragment containing putative CDase homologue Rv0669c was cloned intoNotI-digested pBluescript II SK. The recombinant plasmid was purified and designated pSMN5. PCR primers were designed using the start and stop codon regions of the gene, both of which contained aHindIII restriction site; sense oligonucleotide (5′-AGGAAAGCTTAATGCTTAGTGTAGGGCGCGGCAT-3′) and antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGAAGCTTCAAACAACCGTGAACTCGCGCGT-3′). Using these primers and Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Japan), a 1.9-kbp product was amplified with pSMN5 as the template. The amplified fragment was treated with HindIII, separated by electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel, and cloned intoHindIII-digested pTV118N vector. The recombinant plasmid was purified, and the insert was sequenced. The obtained plasmid was named pTMT4 and expressed in E. coli JM109 by the method described above. The activity of CDase was measured using C12-NBD-dodecanoylsphingosine (C12-NBD-ceramide) as the substrate by the method described previously (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 550 pmol of C12-NBD-ceramide and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) of Triton X-100 and 2.5 mmCaCl2. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate which was developed with solvent I (chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia, 90/20/0.5, v/v). C12-NBD-ceramide was prepared by the method described by Tani et al. (25Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the reverse hydrolysis reaction (condensation) of sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (26Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit of CDase was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of C12-NBD-dodecanoic acid/min from the C12-NBD-ceramide under the conditions described above. A value of 10−3 unit enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit in this study. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were evaluated using the DNASIS computer program developed by Hitachi Software Engineering (Japan). Five peptides were obtained from the purified Pseudomonas CDase after digestion with lysylendopeptidase and subjected to amino acid microsequencing. N-terminal amino acid sequence was also determined using the purified native enzyme. Finally, 64 amino acid residues of the CDase were determined (Table I). PCR was performed using one set of the primers (C89s, 5′-GAYGTSYTSCARCARCC-3′; and C91a, 5′-AAGCTYCASRASCCVTG-3′) and P. aeruginosa strain AN17 genomic DNA as the template. A 359-bp PCR product was obtained (Probe 1) which contained DNA sequences encoding the peptide sequences of C-86, C-89, C-91, and C-121 (Table I). Southern blotting using32P-labeled Probe 1 showed a 2.4-kbp band in the genomic DNA digested with ApaI. A clone, pSCA59, containing a 2.4-kbp insert was isolated from the library enriched with the CDase gene. The nucleotide sequence of pSCA59 was determined, and a putative open reading frame was found. The amino acid sequences of C-86, C-89, C-91, and C-121 were found in the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frame, but N-terminal amino acid sequence was not. Therefore, we screened the genomic library to find the missing sequences using Probe 2 prepared from pSCA59. Southern blotting with32P-labeled Probe 2 of the BamHI digest gave a 1.9-kbp band. A clone, pGCB38, containing a 1.9-kbp insert was isolated from the library enriched with the 5′-end of the CDase gene and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence contained the N-terminal amino acid sequence in the same frame. A partial sequence of the 5′-end of the CDase gene in pSCA59 was also found in pGCB38, indicating that sequences in both clones overlapped (Fig. 1). We cloned and sequenced 2,744 nucleotides of the two contiguous clones pSCA59 and pGCB38, including the coding regions of the CDase gene, and found an open reading frame from position 626–2,635 (Fig. 2). A hydrophobic motif composed of 24 amino acid residues was coded at nucleotides 626–697, starting with ATG. The presence of the hydrophobic motif was also clearly indicated by hydrophobicity plot analysis (Fig. 7 A). This sequence motif, a putative secretion signal peptide, had a positively charged N terminus followed by a hydrophobic core and a string of polar residues (28Abrahamsen L. Moks T. Nilsson B. Hellman U. Uhlen M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The finding of a signal peptide sequence was in good agreement with the observation that Pseudomonas CDase was secreted into the culture medium. A possible Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence started 12 bases upstream of the ATG codon (Fig. 2). The open reading frame was 2,010 base pairs long with 670 codons. The gene encodes a signal sequence of 24 residues and a mature protein of 646 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of the CDase calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence was 70,767, in good agreement with that of the purified CDase estimated on SDS-PAGE (M r= 70,100). The predicted pI was at pH 5.73. All of the peptide sequences shown in Table I were found in the deduced amino acid sequence.FIG. 7Hydropathy plots for Pseudomonas(A) and Mycobacterium(B) CDases. The deduced amino acid sequence of two bacterial CDases were analyzed by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17287) Google Scholar) for hydrophobicity plotting. Amino acid residues are numbered beginning with the first methionine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expression plasmid pTCD11 was constructed by insertion of a fragment of the coding sequence with a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence and a putative signal sequence into the HindIII site of plasmid pTV119N (Fig. 3). In pTCD11, transcription of recombinant genes is controlled by the promoter plac and can be induced by IPTG. E. coli JM109 cells transformed with pTCD11 were cultured in medium containing 0.1 mm IPTG and separated from the medium by centrifugation. The CDase activity of the cell lysate was assayed with C12-NBD-ceramide as the substrate. The expression of the CDase in E. coli increased with time after induction with IPTG and reached more than 30 units per liter of culture at 22 h (Fig. 4 A), whereas strain AN17 of P. aeruginosa produced CDase at about 2 units per liter of culture (Fig. 4 B). Mock transfectants carrying the plasmid pTV119N without the CDase gene showed no CDase activity, indicating that the observed enzyme activity was due entirely to expression of the cloned CDase gene. The recombinant enzyme, which could be transported to the periplasmic space in soluble form, was extracted by sonication and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular weight of the recombinant CDase was estimated to be 70,100 by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C), which was consistent with that of the purified CDase from P. aeruginosa strain AN17 (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that deduced from thePseudomonas CDase gene. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant CDase was determined using a peptide sequencer and found to be identical to that of the native enzyme (DDLPYRFGL), indicating that the signal peptide of the recombinant CDase was cleaved off at the same site of the sequence of the native enzyme in host cells. Substrate specificity as well as optimum pH and metal-ion requirements of the recombinant CDase were identical to those of the native enzyme (data not shown).FIG. 4Production of CDase by E. coliJM109 containing pTCD11 (A), P. aeruginosa strain AN17 (B), and SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant CDase (C). A, time course for production of recombinant CDase after induction by IPTG. E. coli JM109 cells transformed with pTCD11 were cultured by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” After addition of IPTG, culture was continued at 37 °C for 22 h. At the indicated times, CDase activity of the cell lysate was determined. B, production of CDase by P. aeruginosa strain AN17. Cells were transferred to PY medium (0.5% polypepton, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.2) containing sphingomyelin at a concentration of 0.01%. Following incubation at 37 °C for 46 h. CDase activity in the culture supernatant was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”C, the final preparation of recombinant CDase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were stained with Gelcode® Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). Lane 1, standard proteins; lane 2, purified recombinant CDase. Standard proteins (molecular weights in parentheses) were: phosphorylaseb (94,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,100).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) No significant sequence similarity was found in other known functional proteins including human acid CDase. However, we found sequences homologous toPseudomonas CDase in the hypothetical proteins with unknown functions encoded in M. tuberculosis, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Arabidopsis thaliana using the GenBankTM data bank (accession numbers Z95972, U82513 andAB016885, respectively). Comparison of the CDase with these three sequences revealed identities of about 40%. Fig. 5 shows the alignment ofPseudomonas CDase and Mycobacterium hypothetical protein Rv0669c. In this study, we cloned the homologue Rv0669c from the cosmid MTCI376 of M. tuberculosis using the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression plasmid pTMT4 carrying the cloned Rv0669c was thus constructed and used to transform E. coli JM109. Interestingly, cell lysates of the transformed E. coli carrying Rv0669c hydrolyzed C12-NBD-ceramide to produce NBD-dodecanoic acid, whereas mock transfectants did not (Fig. 6 A). This result clearly indicated that the CDase homologue Rv0669c encoded the CDase. It is particularly interesting to note that the recombinant protein ofM. tuberculosis functioned as a CDase at alkaline pH with an optimum at pH 8.5 (Fig. 6 B). The profile for the pH optimum of Mycobacterium CDase was found to be very close to that ofPseudomonas CDase (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, metal ion dependence of Mycobacterium CDase was completely different from that of Pseudomonas enzyme (Fig. 6 C).Pseudomonas CDase was activated by Ca2+ and completely inhibited by EDTA at 2 mm, whereasMycobacterium enzyme was strongly inhibited by Ca2+ and not affected by EDTA at the same concentration. Mg2+ was found to inhibit the activities of both CDases at 2 mm.FIG. 6Expression of Mycobacterium CDase homologue in E. coli JM109 cells (A), pH-dependence of Mycobacterium CDase (B), cation-dependence of the recombinant CDases (C). Rv0069c was expressed in E. coli JM109 by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the reaction mixture contained 100 pmol C12-NBD-ceramide and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the samples were evaporated, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate which was developed with solvent I. Lane 1, C12-NBD-ceramide; lane 2, C12-NBD-dodecanoic acid; lane 3, cell extract of E. coli JM109 containing pTMT4 with C12-NBD-ceramide; lane 4, cell extract of mock (pTV118N) transfectant with C12-NBD-ceramide. B, CDase activity was determined by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this experiment, 150 mm GTA buffer (50 mm3,3-dimethylglutaric acid, 50 mm Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, and 50 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol) at the indicated pH was used. C, reaction mixtures containing CDase, 2 mm of each cation, and 100 pmol of C12-NBD-ceramide in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100 were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The hydrolysis of C12-NBD-ceramide was determined by the method described under “Experimental Procedures”. The amounts of enzyme used were 5.4 microunits for recombinant PseudomonasCDase, and 4.6 microunits for recombinant MycobacteriumCDase. Values are the means for duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the Pseudomonas enzyme,Mycobacterium CDase lacked the putative signal sequence (Fig. 5), and this was confirmed by hydrophobicity plot analysis (Fig. 7 B). In the present study, we cloned, sequenced, and expressed the gene encoding CDase which exhibited an alkaline pH optimum fromP. aeruginosa strain AN17. This is the first report for the gene cloning of not only alkaline but also prokaryotic CDase. The deduced amino acid sequence has no significant sequence similarity with other known proteins including cloned human acid CDase (6Koch J. Gärtner S. Li C.-M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O.

However, sequences homologous to the Pseudomonas CDase were found in the hypothetical proteins in M. tuberculosis, D. discoideum, and A. thaliana. These proteins showed about 40% amino acid identity to Pseudomonas CDase. We cloned and expressed the gene of M. tuberculosis Rv0669c in E. coli JM109 in this study. The recombinant CDases from M. tuberculosis, a Gram-positive tubercle bacillus, and P. aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, showed alkaline pH optima although the low similarity of the amino acid sequences of both CDases suggested that some of the properties of the enzymes might differ from each other. In fact, P. aeruginosa CDase required Ca2+ for expression of its activity (21Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas theM. tuberculosis enzyme did not (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, Rv0669c lacked the putative signal peptide sequences (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that Mycobacterium CDase resides in the cytosol. This is in contrast to thePseudomonas CDase, which is released into the culture medium. The CDase secreted by P. aeruginosa may contribute to its pathogenicity as a kind of exotoxin, similarly to that of phospholipase C, elastase, and alkaline proteases (29Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Over the last few decades, the incidence of tuberculosis, a chronic infectious disease caused by M. tuberculosis, has been increasing worldwide and is becoming a serious social problem. Analysis of the complete genome sequence of M. tuberculosis has revealed that the bacillus clearly differs from other bacteria in that a very large proportion of its genes encoded enzymes involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis (30Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar). The enzyme encoded by the homologue gene in M. tuberculosis, which was identified for the first time in this study, might function by decomposing the ceramides of host cells, although the pathogenic significance of MycobacteriumCDase remains to be clarified. CDase of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 is a powerful tool for studying the structure and function of ceramide, but the level of production of the enzyme by this strain is low. Cloning and expression of the Pseudomonas CDase gene resolved the difficulty in the preparation of large amounts of CDase, i.e. the production of CDase by transformed E. coli cells carrying the CDase gene reached 30 units/liter of culture, which is 15-fold higher than that by the wild-type strain of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 (Fig. 4, A and B). Zhang et al. (31Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

In both structures, the side chains of residues 10 and 11 are exposed on the surface of the molecules and hence mutation of these residues would not be expected to produce significant changes in the global fold. Data obtained from 1H NMR experiments in the current study confirm this is indeed the case. The high degree of surface exposure of these residues and their lack of structural perturbation means that changes in activity among these peptides can be correlated directly to different residue side chains having different binding interactions at different nAChR subtypes.Preliminary studies have shown that PnIA and PnIB differentially inhibit the nicotine-induced catecholamine release from bovine chromaffin cells (2Broxton N.

To further elucidate the role of the residues at positions 10 and 11 in conferring nAChR subtype selectivity, the modified toxins [A10L]PnIA and [N11S]PnIA (see Table I) were synthesized. The aim of this study was to determine the selectivity of both the native and modified α-conotoxins PnIA and PnIB for the different nAChR subtypes, which constitute the whole-cell ACh-induced current in mammalian peripheral neurons, and to provide information as to the relative contribution of these nAChR subunits to the whole-cell response. These studies reveal significant differences in the selectivity and potency of PnIA and PnIB that arise through a key mutation at position 10 of these α-conotoxins.RESULTSRapid focal application of 500 μm ACh to dissociated rat intracardiac ganglion neurons, in the presence of 100 nm atropine, resulted in a characteristic biphasic inward current comprising an initial transient peak which rapidly decayed to a steady-state current (Fig. 1,A and B). The ratio of peak to steady-state current amplitude varied between neurons, which may be attributable to the heterogeneous mRNA expression of different nAChR subunits reported in rat intracardiac neurons (19Poth K. Nutter T.J. Cuevas J. Parker M.J. Adams D.J. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 586-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peak whole-cell ACh-evoked current in all neurons was reversibly inhibited >95% by 1 μm mecamylamine (data not shown), a non-selective nicotinic AChR antagonist (12Fieber L.A. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since inhibition of the steady-state current by the α-conotoxins examined was variable, all measurements describe the inhibition of peak current. α-Conotoxin PnIA inhibited the ACh-induced current in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A), with an IC50 of 14 nm. PnIA did not completely inhibited the peak current, producing maximal reduction in amplitude of 87 ± 2% (n = 6) at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1 C). α-Conotoxin PnIB was less potent than PnIA, inhibiting the peak ACh-induced current (Fig. 1 B) with an IC50 value of 33 nm (Fig. 1 C). PnIB also did not completely block the peak nicotinic current, with a concentration of 10 μm, causing a maximum reduction of only 68 ± 3% (n = 5) (Fig. 1 C). PnIA and PnIB were each effective at reducing ACh-induced current in all neurons examined.FIG. 1Effects of the native toxins, PnIA and PnIB, on the nicotinic ACh-evoked currents in rat intracardiac neurons.Rapid application of 500 μm ACh in the presence of atropine (100 nm) evokes a characteristic biphasic response, with an initial peak which rapidly decays to a steady-state level.

[N11S]PnIA was the least potent inhibitor of the ACh-induced current in these neurons, having an IC50 of 375 nm, with 17 ± 1% (n = 4) of the current resistant to 10 μm [N11S]PnIA (Fig. 2 A). A plateau was not reached in the dose-response relationship, but the fitted curve predicts a maximum inhibition of 91% (Fig. 2 C), similar to that achieved with PnIA. Higher concentrations were not tested due to limited availability of the toxin. [N11S]PnIA was effective in reducing the ACh-induced current in all neurons examined. In contrast, [A10L]PnIA was the most potent of the α-conotoxins examined. However, the nicotinic ACh-induced current in ∼20% of neurons was insensitive to block by [A10L]PnIA. The IC50 value for the [A10L]PnIA-sensitive component of the current was 1.4 nm, with 56 ± 6% (n = 4) of the total nicotinic ACh-induced current insensitive to block by [A10L]PnIA (Fig. 2 C). The current remaining in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of [A10L]PnIA was not inhibited further by α-bungarotoxin (Fig. 2 B), a selective inhibitor of neuronal nAChRs containing the α7 subunit (20Couturier S.

The residual peak current remaining following application of 1 μm α-bungarotoxin (58 ± 5% of control, n = 5), was not significantly different (p > 0.25) from the current resistant to 1 μm [A10L]PnIA (56 ± 6%, n = 4), and could be further inhibited by PnIB and PnIA (Fig. 3 B). A comparison of the residual current amplitudes obtained in the presence of maximally effective concentrations of α-bungarotoxin, α-conotoxins, and mecamylamine are summarized in Fig. 3 C.To determine if PnIA can inhibit the α3β4 nAChR subtype, cytisine, which is more potent than ACh at activating the α3β4 receptor in a mammalian cell line (21Lewis T.M. Harkness P.C. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Millar N.S. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was used to activate whole-cell currents. PnIA (1 μm) inhibited the current evoked by cytisine (300 μm) by 37 ± 5% (n = 5) (data not shown), but even at a concentration of 10 μm, PnIA blocked a smaller proportion of the cytisine-evoked current than the ACh-evoked current. The residual cytisine-induced current reflects an increased contribution of a PnIA-insensitive nAChR subtype to the whole-cell current in rat intracardiac neurons.To accurately interpret the observed changes in activity of the PnIA mutants, it was necessary to establish whether the substitutions at positions 10 and 11 produced any changes to the backbone structure of these peptides. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY 1H NMR spectra were recorded for the peptides and were assigned using standard methods, as described for the related α-conotoxin GI (22Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TOCSY spectra were used to correlate peaks to particular amino acid types and the NOESY spectra were used to delineate the sequence specific location of these amino acids (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Secondary chemical shifts were then calculated by subtracting random coil shifts (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) from the αH chemical shifts for each of the constituent residues in the four peptides. These secondary shifts are highly diagnostic of local structural elements (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the secondary shifts are almost identical for all four peptides, suggesting that the structures are similar. Further, the pattern of secondary shifts is consistent with the overlapping three-dimensional structures of PnIA and PnIB observed in the crystalline state derived by x-ray methods (6Hu S.-H.

Craik D.J. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11323-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In particular, the pattern of negative secondary shifts in the middle section of all four peptides is consistent with the reported α-helix between residues 5 and 12 in PnIA and PnIB.FIG. 4Secondary αH chemical shifts, i.e. differences between observed chemical shifts and random coil shifts, for PnIA, [A10L]PnIA, [N11S]PnIA, and PnIB. The different mutants are identified by their amino acids at positions 10 and 11; the sequences at all other positions are identical. The random coil shifts used include corrections for residues preceding Pro in the sequence (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol.

Hasson A. Oren R. Burlingame A.L. Gordon D. Spira M.E. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9523-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the native α-conotoxins PnIA and PnIB both inhibit the nicotinic ACh-induced whole-cell current in rat intracardiac ganglion neurons in a dose-dependent manner. PnIA was 3-fold more potent and able to inhibit ∼90% of the ACh-induced current at a maximally effective concentration, compared with ∼70% for PnIB. The modified toxin [N11S]PnIA was an order of magnitude less potent than PnIB but also caused maximal inhibition of ∼90%. [A10L]PnIA was an order of magnitude more potent than PnIA (IC50 of 1.4 nm) but caused a maximal inhibition of only ∼45% of the peak current. The inhibition of ACh-evoked currents by native (PnIA, PnIB) and modified α-conotoxins ([A10L]PnIA, [N11S]PnIA) are summarized in Table II. Hill coefficients obtained from fits of the inhibitory dose-response curves were consistently less than unity, the significance of which is unclear, but are similar to those obtained for inhibition of α3β2 and α7 receptors expressed in oocytes by the α-conotoxins, MII (4Cartier G.E.C.

Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10335-10344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mRNA expression of the α7 subunit (19Poth K. Nutter T.J. Cuevas J. Parker M.J. Adams D.J. Luetje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 586-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 value of 0.12 nm for α-bungarotoxin inhibition of the ACh-induced current obtained in rat intracardiac neurons (25Cuevas J. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10335-10344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is more than 4 orders of magnitude lower than that obtained from α7 homomers expressed inXenopus oocytes (26Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the native α7 receptors are not α7 homomers. In this study, bath application of α-bungarotoxin (1 μm) produced a maximal inhibition (42 ± 5%) that was similar to that obtained previously in rat intracardiac neurons (47 ± 2%) (25Cuevas J. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10335-10344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and similar to the maximal inhibition seen in the present study with [A10L]PnIA. Furthermore, inhibition of the whole-cell current by α-bungarotoxin and [A10L]PnIA was not additive, suggesting that [A10L]PnIA and α-bungarotoxin selectively inhibit the same α7 component in these neurons. The potency and selectivity of conotoxin [A10L]PnIA make it the best conotoxin-derived pharmacological probe for α7 receptors. Previous studies on α-conotoxin ImI have suggested that the major binding determinants for the α7 receptor are found in the first loop (Asp5-Pro6-Arg7) with an additional contribution to binding made by Trp10 in the second loop (22Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Servent D. Thanh H.L. Antil S. Bertrand D. Corringer P.-J. Changeux J.-P. Ménez A. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inspection of the primary (see Table I) and tertiary structures of [A10L]PnIA and ImI suggest that conotoxin [A10L]PnIA most likely binds at a different “microsite.” More detailed structure-function studies will be required to determine the precise nature and site of interaction of [A10L]PnIA with the α7 receptor.The α-conotoxin EpI isolated from Conus episcopatus has been shown previously to block α3β2 and α3β4 nicotinic receptors in rat intracardiac ganglion neurons (3Loughnan M. Bond T. Atkins A. Cuevas J. Adams D.J. Broxton N.M. Livett B.G. Down J.G. Jones A. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15667-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both EpI and PnIA are able to further reduce the nicotinic ACh-induced current in the presence of a maximal concentration of [A10L]PnIA or α-bungarotoxin. [A10L]PnIA does not cause further block of either the ACh- or cytisine-evoked current in the presence of 1 μm PnIA (n = 3, data not shown), indicating that PnIA blocks the α7 component as well as additional components of the nAChR-mediated current in these neurons. The ACh-induced current in all cells was inhibited ∼90% by [N11S]PnIA, suggesting that substitution of asparagine at position 11 for serine does not affect PnIA subtype selectivity, despite a ∼30-fold reduction in potency. The results with [A10L]PnIA suggest that position 10 has an important influence on selectivity, with the larger, more hydrophobic leucine conferring selectivity for the α7 subunit of the nAChR and increased potency.The NMR data clearly confirm that the changes in potency and selectivity brought about by mutations at positions 10 and 11 are not due to structural changes. αH secondary NMR chemical shifts provide a very sensitive fingerprint of both local and global structural change and confirm that the backbone structures are identical. The signs and magnitudes of the secondary shifts show that, like PnIA and PnIB, both mutants possess an α-helix between residues 5 and 12. The highly conserved nature of this helix upon substitution contrasts with the variation in the nature and extent of the helix when the number of amino acids between conserved cysteine residues is changed, as seen from our recent structural studies on conotoxins MII (29Hill J.M. Oomen C.J. Miranda L.P. Bingham J.P. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15621-15630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), GI (22Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 42: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inspection of the crystal structures of PnIA and PnIB shows that residues 10 and 11 are both on the face of the helix exposed to the solvent, rather than packed toward the disulfide core of the peptides (see Fig. 5). The high surface exposure favors direct interactions of these residues with complementary binding sites on nAChRs. The larger hydrophobic surface at residue 10 in [A10L]PnIA is presumably complementary with binding to the α7, but unfavorable for binding to the other subunit combinations in these neurons.FIG. 5Ribbon representation of the α-conotoxin PnIA structure (6Hu S.-H.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), their precise function in many cases is poorly understood. Neuronal nAChRs containing the α7 subunit have been identified in chick sympathetic neurons (32Yu C.R. Role L.W. J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), rat hippocampal neurons (33Alkondon M. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 265: 1455-1473PubMed Google Scholar), and chick ciliary ganglion (34Chiappinelli V.A. Giacobini E. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of the α7 component in many of these systems remains unclear. Presynaptic nAChRs containing the α7 subunit have been shown to modulate neurotransmitter release (35McGehee D. Heath M. Gelber S. Role L.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 36Li X. Rainnie D.G. McCarley R.W. Greene R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1904-1912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the receptors containing the α7 subunit are involved in synaptic transmission in chick ciliary ganglia (37Chang K.T. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3701-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α7 subunit does not appear to form functional postsynaptic nAChRs in rat parasympathetic neurons, as synaptic transmission in the rat submandibular ganglion is not affected by either α-bungarotoxin (1 μm) or [A10L]PnIA. Bath application of PnIA (1 μm), however, causes partial inhibition of synaptic transmission in rat parasympathetic ganglia, reducing excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude by approximately 35%. 4A. B. Smith and D. J. Adams, unpublished observations. The range of selectivities of native and modified α-conotoxins PnIA and PnIB for mammalian nAChRs makes these peptides valuable new tools for investigating the subunit composition of neuronal nAChRs at a functional level. At a molecular level, their small size lends them to relatively easy synthesis and modification and makes them ideal tools for investigating the structure function relationship of the subunits, which constitute neuronal nAChRs. This study shows the importance of individual α-conotoxin residues for defining both affinity and selectivity. With the four peptides investigated, it was possible to dissect four pharmacologically distinct nAChR-mediated currents, including a component mediated by nAChRs containing α7 subunits in rat intracardiac ganglion neurons. The nAChR subunit combinations giving rise to the other three components of the ACh-evoked current in these neurons remain to be fully elucidated, but are likely to include different combinations of those α and β su"

However, recent findings suggest that WT1 may also be involved in a post-transcriptional process. Specifically, WT1 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon 9 (+lysine-threonine-serine (KTS)) preferentially associate with nuclear speckles and co-immunoprecipitate splicing antigens (Larsson, S.

(1998) <i>Genes Dev.</i> 12, 3217–3225) and binds to RNA <i>in vitro</i>(Caricasole, A., Duarte, A., Larsson, S. H., Hastie, N. D., Little, M., Holmes, G., Todorov, I., and Ward, A. (1996) <i>Proc.

To extend these findings, we have fractionated nuclear extracts to see if particles containing WT1 have the properties of ribonucleoprotein (RNP). In summary, WT1 is enriched by oligo(dT) chromatography, as are U2AF65, the U5 small nuclear RNP-associated protein p116 and hnRNP A1. Gel filtration and sedimentation profiles suggest that WT1 is present in RNase-sensitive particles, >2 MDa in size, peaking at ∼60 S, and ∼1.27 g/cm<sup>3</sup> on Nycodenz. Similar results were obtained from two cell lines expressing WT1, fetal kidneys (day E17), and transiently transfected cells, suggesting that the presence of WT1 protein in nuclear poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNP is a general aspect of WT1 function."

Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Conversion of zymogen factor XI to the active form, factor XIa, is accomplished by a single cleavage in each polypeptide, resulting in a pair of 35-kDa C-terminal light chains with homology to the pancreatic digestive enzyme trypsin and two 45-kDa N-terminal heavy chains (4Bouma B. Griffin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sinha D. Seaman F. Walsh P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3768-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although catalytic activity resides in the light chains, it is clear from several lines of evidence that the heavy chain is required for optimal activation of factor IX. The capacity of isolated factor XIa light chain to activate factor IX is <1% that of the intact molecule, even though both the light chain and whole molecule cleave a chromogenic substrate similarly (6Sinha D.

Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These domains have been implicated in binding interactions with molecules and surfaces involved in blood coagulation (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol.

Previously, we prepared recombinant chimeric factor XI molecules in which individual apple domains were replaced with the corresponding domain from the related plasma protease prekallikrein (PK)1 (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PK, the zymogen of the kininogenase plasma kallikrein, shares 58% amino acid homology and similar domain structure with factor XI (14Chung D. Fujikawa K. Mcmullen B. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The two proteases are functionally distinct, however, with PK being a poor activator of factor IX (2Osterud B. Bouma B. Griffin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5946-5951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A chimeric molecule in which the factor XI A3 domain is replaced with that of PK (FXI/PKA3) is a poor activator of factor IX, whereas chimeras with PK substitutions for A1, A2, or A4 activate factor IX normally. These data demonstrate that the A3 domain is required for interactions with factor IX (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe mapping studies of the factor XI A3 domain that identify amino acids at the N and C termini of the domain required for normal activation of factor IX. Human factor XI (10Fujikawa K. Chung D. Hendrickson L. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and PK (14Chung D. Fujikawa K. Mcmullen B. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) cDNAs were gifts from Dr. Dominic Chung (University of Washington, Seattle). The Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit and plasmid pBluescript (SK+ version) were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The human fetal kidney 293 fibroblast cell line was from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1573; Manassas, VA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc., and Cellgro complete serum-free medium was from Mediatech (Herdon, VA). Soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and benzamidine were from Sigma. Goat anti-human factor XI polyclonal IgG, with or without conjugated horseradish peroxidase, for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Gelcode Blue stain for SDS-polyacrylamide gels was from Pierce. Chromogenic substrates S-2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-argininep-nitroaniline) and S-2765 (N α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-l-argininep-nitroaniline) were from Diapharma (West Chester, OH). Factor XI-deficient human plasma was from George King Biomedical (Overland Park, KS). Bovine serum albumin, nitro blue tetrazolium, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were from Sigma. Polybrene was from Aldrich. Recombinant human factor VIII (Recombinate) was from Baxter/Hyland. Purified thrombin and factors IX, X, IXa, Xa, and XIIa were from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Rabbit brain cephalin was prepared from rabbit brain acetone powder (Sigma) by the method of Bell and Alton (16Bell W. Alton H. Nature. 1954; 174: 880-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A 1:10 dilution of this preparation was found to be optimal for clotting assays and was used in all subsequent experiments. Unfractionated heparin was from Pharmacia Hepar, Inc. (Franklin, OH). Mutations to produce alanine substitutions were introduced into the wild-type factor XI cDNA in pBluescript using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit. Proper introduction of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each mutant contains two to four alanine substitutions in adjacent amino acids (see Fig. 1). Factor XI cDNAs were introduced into a mammalian expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter (pJVCMV) (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 293 fibroblasts (5 × 106) were transfected with 40 μg of factor XI cDNA/pJVCMV and 2 μg of pRSVneo, which contains a gene conferring neomycin resistance. Transfection was by electroporation using an Electrocell Manipulator 600 (BTX, Inc., San Diego, CA). Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then switched to the same medium containing the neomycin analog G418 (500 μg/ml). The medium was exchanged every 48 h for 14 days. G418-resistant clones were tested for protein expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clones expressing high levels of protein were expanded in 175-cm2 culture flasks. When cells reached >50% confluence, the medium was replaced with 75 ml of Cellgro complete medium containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml) and lima bean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml) to prevent activation of factor XI. The medium was exchanged every 48 h. After collection, the conditioned medium was supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine and stored at −20 °C pending purification. The chimera FXI/PKA3 (human factor XI in which the A3 domain is replaced with the PK A3 domain) has been described (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FXI/PKA3 cDNA was used as a template for a series of mutagenesis steps changing PK A3 sequence back to factor XI sequence (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis and expression of recombinant protein were carried out as described for alanine mutants. The original FXI/PKA3 construct is referred to as FXI/PKA3-A. A construct with Tyr260, Leu263, and Thr264 at the C terminus of the A3 domain changed to the corresponding amino acids for factor XI (Phe260, Gln263, and Ser264) is referred to as FXI/PKA3-B. Amino acids at positions 183–185 were changed to factor XI sequence in both FXI/PKA3-A and FXI/PKA3-B to create FXI/PKA3-IA and FXI/PKA3-IB, respectively. FXI/PKA3-IA and FXI/PKA3-IB were then changed at amino acids 188–190 to make FXI/PKA3-IIA and FXI/PKA3-IIB, respectively, which in turn were used to prepare FXI/PKA3-IIIA and FXI/PKA3-IIIB with amino acids 195–197 converted to factor XI sequence. The conditioned medium (500–2000 ml) was passed over a 3-ml murine anti-human factor XI monoclonal antibody 1G5.12 column (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After loading, columns were washed with 10 volumes of 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl (TBS), and 5 mmbenzamidine, followed by elution with 2 m sodium thiocyanate in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mmbenzamidine. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an ultrafiltration concentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), dialyzed against TBS, and stored at −80 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purity, and protein concentration was measured by dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). Activated recombinant factor XI (factor XIa) was prepared by diluting zymogen protein to 100–300 μg/ml in TBS containing 5 μg/ml human factor XIIa and incubating at 37 °C. The progress of conversion of the 80-kDa zymogen to the 45-kDa heavy chain and 35-kDa light chain of factor XIa was followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Activated protein was stored at −80 °C. The coagulant activity of recombinant factor XIa in a modified partial thromboplastin time assay was determined as follows. Factor XIa was diluted to 5 μg/ml (30 nm) in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (TBSA), and 1:2 serial dilutions of these preparation were made in TBSA. Sixty microliters of each dilution was mixed with 60 μl of factor XI-deficient plasma and 60 μl of rabbit brain cephalin. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 s, 60 μl of 25 mm CaCl2 was added, and the time to clot formation was determined on a Dataclot 2 fibrometer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). The clotting time was compared with a standard curve prepared with wild-type factor XIa. Recombinant wild-type factor XIa has the same activity as plasma-derived factor XIa in this assay (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Activities of recombinant proteins are given as a percentage of wild-type protein activity. Factor XIa was diluted to 3.5 nm in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (17Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) containing S-2366 (50–1000 μm), and generation of free p-nitroaniline was followed by measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm on a ThermoMax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Reactions volumes were 100 μl. Michaelis-Menten constants (K m andV max) for cleavage of S-2366 were determined by standard methods. The value for V max was converted to nm p-nitroaniline generated per s using an extinction coefficient of 2100 optical density units (405 nm)/mol of p-nitroaniline. Turnover number (k cat) was calculated from the ratio ofV max to enzyme concentration. Factor XI at 50 nm in TBS containing 25 μm ZnCl2 was supplemented with heparin (1 unit/ml final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C. All reactions were 400 μl. At 10-min intervals, 30-μl samples were removed into 10 μl of SDS sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% SDS). Samples were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% powdered milk in TBS. The primary detection antibody was goat anti-human factor XI polyclonal IgG, and the secondary antibody was sheep anti-goat IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Blots were developed with a solution of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Activation of factor IX by factor XIa was assessed by a modification of the method of Wagenvoord et al. (18Wagenvoord R. Hendrix H. Tran T. Hemker H. Haemostasis. 1990; 30: 276-288Google Scholar). All reagents are diluted in TBSA. Human factor IX (0.05–10.0 μm) was incubated with 5 mm CaCl2and 1.0 nm wild-type factor XIa or activated FXI/PKA3 chimera for 60 s at 37 °C in a 50-μl volume. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 25 mm and chilling on ice. The reactions were diluted 1:100 or 1:10, and 10 μl of each dilution was added to 50 μl of a mixture of human factor VIII (8 units/ml), CaCl2 (10 mm), and rabbit brain cephalin (1:5 dilution of stock). Ten microliters of human thrombin (0.6 units/ml) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 60 s to allow the thrombin to activate factor VIII. Subsequently, 30 μl of human factor X (450 nm) was added, and incubation was continued for 10 min. The activation of factor X by factor IXa was stopped by adding EDTA to 25 mm and placing on ice. The final concentrations of reagents were 135 nm factor X, 4 units/ml factor VIII, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1:10 dilution of rabbit brain cephalin. Fifty microliters of each reaction was mixed with 50 μl of 1 mm S-2765, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was followed on the ThermoMax microtiter plate reader. Results were compared with a control curve constructed with known amounts of purified factor IXa. There was a linear correlation between the results of the assay and factor IXa concentration between 20 and 300 pm. Michaelis-Menten plots were prepared for each protein to determine the K m using the average of two sets of experiments. Most alanine mutants and all FXI/PKA3 chimeras were expressed at 1–3 μg/ml of conditioned medium as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This is similar to expression of recombinant wild-type factor XI (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Zhao M.

On SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins ran similarly to wild-type factor XI (Fig. 2). Poor (<50 ng/ml) or no expression was obtained for alanine mutants 11–13, 15, and 18, implying that these proteins were either unstable or poorly secreted. These five proteins were not included in further analysis. Substitutions in mutants 11–13, 15, and 18 involve an area of the apple domain constrained by a pair of disulfide bonds with relatively high homology to the PK sequence (Figs. 1 and 3). Two proteins, mutants 7 and 20, were expressed at somewhat reduced amounts (100–200 ng/ml of conditioned medium). Substitutions in both proteins involve areas in which factor XI and PK are identical. On SDS-polyacrylamide gels, mutant 7 appears to contain additional bands compared with wild-type factor XI, implying altered protein structure or processing (data not shown).FIG. 3Schematic diagram of the human prekallikrein and factor XI A3 domains demonstrating the positions of amino acids required for factor IX activation. A, amino acid sequence and disulfide bond structure of the prekallikrein A3 domain. The positions of prekallikrein A3 sequence converted to factor XI sequence in FXI/PKA3 chimeric proteins are designated by Band I–III as described under “Expermental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 1. Restoring the amino acids shown inblack to the corresponding residues in factor XI is required for restoring factor XIa activity to that of wild-type factor XIa in clotting and factor IX activation assays. Converting the amino acids indicated in gray to factor XI amino acids appears to act synergistically with the residues indicated in black to restore factor XIa activity to that of the wild-type protein.B, amino acid sequence and disulfide bond structure of the factor XI A3 domain.

The positions of disulfide bonds in the prekallikrein and factor XI A3 domains were previously reported by McMullen et al.(15McMullen B. Fujikawa K. Davie E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alanine mutants were tested in a plasma clotting assay that requires activation of factor IX by factor XIa (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the assay is not sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle differences between proteins, it is a useful screen for identifying significant defects. Activity was compared with that of recombinant wild-type factor XIa. A profound decrease in activity (10% of wild-type activity) was noted for mutants 1–3 and 5 at the N terminus of the A3 domain and for mutants 25 and 26 at the C terminus (Table I). These substitutions involve areas in which the amino acid sequences of factor XI and PK are significantly different (Fig. 1). More modest decreases in activity were noted for mutants 7, 10, and 20. As discussed above, mutants 7 and 20 were expressed at lower levels than wild-type factor XI, indicating that there may be some structural aberrations in the molecules. Mutants 7, 10, and 20 involve areas in which factor XI and PK are highly homologous and are therefore less likely to contain factor XI-specific elements required for factor IX activation. The data indicate that amino acids required for factor IX activation are located at the N and C termini of the factor XI A3 domain.Table IProperties of activated recombinant factor XI alanine mutantsFactor XIa speciesClotting activityCleavage of S-2366K mk cat% of plasma XIaμms −1Wild-type100aThe value for wild-type factor XIa was arbitrarily set at 100%.395200Mutant 1<1365215Mutant 2<1365145Mutant 310350175Mutant 471465220Mutant 5<1350140Mutant 674520275Mutant 720440260Mutant 8125385205Mutant 950495225Mutant 1021455160Mutant 14123540250Mutant 1660560180Mutant 1786370200Mutant 1980460205Mutant 2016415155Mutant 2191355155Mutant 2291565220Mutant 23142430130Mutant 24114400160Mutant 25<1320130Mutant 266415210a The value for wild-type factor XIa was arbitrarily set at 100%. Open table in a new tab A major concern when using alanine-scanning mutagenesis is that proteins may be severely altered, resulting in a generalized rather than a specific defect in activity. The following studies were performed to demonstrate that the factor XI alanine mutants retained activities characteristic of wild-type factor XI (other than factor IX activation). All proteins were converted to the active two-chain form when incubated with factor XIIa in a manner similar to recombinant wild-type factor XI (data not shown). To determine that the catalytic (light chain) domains of the recombinant molecules were intact, activated proteins were tested in a chromogenic substrate cleavage assay using the substrate S-2366 (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,17Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for the generation of freep-nitroaniline were similar for all proteins tested (K m = 320–565 μm andk cat = 130–275 s−1) (Table I) and are comparable to previously published results for other recombinant factor XI proteins (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When exposed to certain negatively charged substances such as heparin or the synthetic polysaccharide dextran sulfate, factor XI undergoes autoactivation to factor XIa (17Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol.

This process involves a heparin-binding site in the A3 domain. We tested alanine mutants 1–6 and 22–26 in an autoactivation assay in the presence of heparin. All proteins activated at a rate similar to that of wild-type factor XI as determined by Western blotting, with the exception of mutant 23, which demonstrated significantly delayed activation, and mutant 24, which had slightly delayed activation (data not shown). These two mutant proteins were previously shown to be defective in autoactivation, as they are missing parts of the heparin-binding site in the A3 domain (17Zhao M. Abdel-Razek T. Sun M.-F. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although defective in the autoactivation assay, mutants 23 and 24 have normal activity in the plasma clotting assay. The observations that alanine mutants are activated by factor XIIa, cleave a chromogenic substrate, and autoactivate normally (except for mutants 23 and 24) indicate that substitutions in A3 have not caused severe generalized abnormalities in factor XI function. This strengthens the premise that the defects observed for mutants 1–3, 5, 25, and 26 are specific for factor IX activation. We previously demonstrated that factor XI with the PK A3 domain (FXI/PKA3) functions poorly in a plasma clotting assay (<1% of wild-type activity) (9Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Guided by results with the factor XI alanine mutants, we used FXI/PKA3 as a template to reintroduce factor XI sequence into the A3 domain to restore normal factor IX activation. This “gain-of-function” strategy avoids some potential pitfalls of the “loss-of-function” studies using alanine mutants. The original FXI/PKA3 chimera (FXI/PKA3-A) was modified at the C terminus by replacing Tyr260, Leu263, and Thr264 of the PK sequence with the corresponding amino acids from factor XI to create FXI/PKA3-B (Fig. 1). This alteration involves the area of the A3 domain covered by alanine mutants 25 and 26. As shown in Table II, neither FXI/PKA3-A nor FXI/PKA3-B had significant activity in the clotting assay. These two proteins underwent further modifications in which progressively larger numbers of PK amino acids at the N terminus of A3 were changed to their factor XI counterparts. As shown in Table II, some activity was restored in both the A and B versions of FXI/PKA3 in which His183–Asn185 (sequence covered by alanine mutant 1) is replaced with factor XI sequence (FXI/PKA3-IA and FXI/PKA3-IB). The activity was substantial for FXI/PKA3-IB (40% of normal activity). Activity was restored to normal levels by factor XI sequence at positions 188–191 (covered by alanine mutants 2 and 3) in FXI/PKA3-IIB. That FXI/PKA3-IIA has only 15% of normal activity indicates that factor XI sequence at the C terminus is important. However, FXI/PKA3-IIIA (factor XI sequence for amino acids 195–197 (covered by alanine mutant 5)) has normal factor XIa activity despite having PK sequence exclusively in its C-terminal region. This indicates that factor XI sequence at the C terminus of the A3 domain is not absolutely required for normal factor IX activation. All factor XI/PK chimeric proteins cleaved S-2366 similarly to wild-type protein, indicating that the catalytic domains are intact (Table II). The data indicate that amino acids between His183 and Val191 in factor XI are required for proper interaction with factor IX and that additional sequence at either Ser195–Ile197 or Ser258–Ser264 is also necessary to completely restore activity.Table IIProperties of activated recombinant FXI/PKA3 chimeric moleculesFactor XIa speciesCleavage of S-2366Clotting activityFactor IX activation K mK mk catμms −1% of plasma XIaμmWild-type395200100aThe value for wild-type factor XIa was arbitrarily set at 100%.0.25FXI/PKA3-A485205<1>10.0FXI/PKA3-B395170<1>10.0FXI/PKA3-IA39517553.00FXI/PKA3-IB345120400.59FXI/PKA3-IIA505260151.30FXI/PKA3-IIB415195910.30FXI/PKA3-IIIA5202401400.27FXI/PKA3-IIIB3752001200.18a The value for wild-type factor XIa was arbitrarily set at 100%.

These complexes of peptide and class I MHC (pMHC) are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. If a clonotypic T cell receptor expressed on a circulating T cell binds to the pMHC complex, the cell presenting the pMHC is killed. In this manner, some tumor cells expressing aberrant proteins are recognized and removed by the immune system. However, not all tumors are recognized efficiently. One reason hypothesized for poor T cell recognition of tumor-associated peptides is poor binding of those peptides to class I MHC molecules. Many peptides, derived from the proto-oncogene HER-2/neu have been shown to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells derived from HLA-A2+ patients with breast cancer and other adenocarcinomas. Seven of these peptides were found to bind with intermediate to poor affinity. In particular, GP2 (HER-2/neu residues 654–662) binds very poorly even though it is predicted to bind well based upon the presence of the correct HLA-A2.1 peptide-binding motif. Altering the anchor residues to those most favored by HLA-A2.1 did not significantly improve binding affinity. The crystallographic structure shows that unlike other class I-peptide structures, the center of the peptide does not assume one specific conformation and does not make stabilizing contacts with the peptide-binding cleft.

These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and bind to newly formed class I molecules. Peptide binding appears to be the final step in assembly of the complex (1Lehner P.J. Trowsdale J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R605-R608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following peptide binding, the complexes are transported to the plasma membrane. At the plasma membrane, clonotypic T cell receptors on the surface of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may recognize the peptide-MHC complex (pMHC). If the pMHC is recognized by the T cell receptor, the T cell is activated and the cell presenting the pMHC is killed. A normal cell will have a large assortment of pMHC on the cell surface that are not recognized by CTL. However, viral or mutated self-proteins are degraded by these same mechanisms, and many of the resulting pMHC are recognized by CTL. In this manner, virus-infected or mutated cells are targeted for lysis by cytotoxic T cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Ploegh H.L. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Self-proteins that are expressed in abnormally high amounts or in abnormal cell types may also be targets for CTL (3Peoples G.E. Goedegebuure P.S. Smith R. Linehan D.C. Yoshino I. Eberlein T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Class I MHC molecules bind many peptides with diverse sequences and high affinity (4Batalia M.A. Collins E.J. Biopoly. 1997; 43: 281-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To bind all these peptides, the class I protein primarily interacts with the invariant portions of the peptides, the N and C termini (5Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Class I MHC also uses a subset of amino acid side chains within the peptide termed “anchors” to generate significant binding (6Falk K. Rotzchke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). These peptide anchor residues bind within “specificity pockets” that are primarily formed by the polymorphic residues within the peptide-binding cleft of the MHC molecule (7Garrett T.P.J. Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1989; 341: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Peptides that bind with high affinity to a given allotype are typically found to have one of a few preferred amino acids at each anchor position. The corresponding hypothesis is that peptides that do not have those preferred amino acids at the anchor positions will not bind well. The combination of amino acids that may bind at the anchor positions is known as the peptide-binding motif (8Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). These motifs have proven to be extremely valuable in predicting peptides that will bind to class I MHC. Other residues within the peptide besides the anchors may be used to generate increased binding affinity (9Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Ruppert J. Sidney J. Celis E. Kubo R.T. Grey H.M. Sette A.

Substituting the anchor residues of poor binding peptides with those that are most preferred by the allotype can generate high affinity binding. (10Ruppert J. Sidney J. Celis E. Kubo R.T. Grey H.M.

Some of these altered peptide ligands (APL) are even effective therapeutics (13Overwijk W.W. Tsung A. Irvine K.R. Parkhurst M.R. Goletz T.J. Tsung K. Carroll M.W. Liu C. Moss B. Rosenberg S.A. Restifo N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We show here that there are also peptides for which altering the anchor residues does not significantly increase binding affinity. It is not clear from the previously available data in the literature why these peptides bind poorly.HER-2/neu (c-erb-2) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase with homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of HER-2/neu in many adenocarcinomas, including breast and ovarian tumors, correlates with a poor prognosis for remission and recovery (14Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been found in cancer patients that overexpress HER-2/neu, and these tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are able to recognize and lyse the solid tumor (3Peoples G.E.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3387-3390PubMed Google Scholar), but these CTL do not eliminate the tumor. It has also been shown that several peptide epitopes derived from the gene product of HER-2/neu are presented by class I MHC molecules to circulating CTL. As with many other tumor-associated antigens, most of these peptides bind poorly to HLA-A2.1 (A2). There are many potential reasons for the lack of immune removal of tumors including the down-regulation of class I MHC or down-regulation of the protein from which the peptide is derived. It has also been proposed that one reason for poor recognition by CTL is weak binding of the immunogenic peptides to class I MHC (3Peoples G.E. Goedegebuure P.S. Smith R. Linehan D.C. Yoshino I. Eberlein T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Here we show that HER-2/neu-derived peptides, identified in the literature as recognized by CTL, bind with a range of affinities, but all are lower affinity than two index peptides of high affinity. One peptide was chosen for further study. This peptide, GP2 (IISAVVGIL), binds very poorly to A2 but has anchor residues that are present in high affinity peptides (Ile at position 2 and Leu at position 9). Its inherently poor affinity is not significantly increased by substitution of its anchor residues. To understand why this peptide binds poorly, the crystallographic structure of the A2-GP2 complex was determined. Unlike all previously determined peptide-class I MHC (pMHC) structures, there is a large region of unresolved electron density in the center of the peptide. We interpret this to mean that the peptide assumes more than one conformation within the peptide-binding cleft. We hypothesize that the observed poor binding is due to the lack of important secondary interactions within the center of the peptide.DISCUSSIONOne hypothesis used to explain why tumors are not recognized and eliminated by the immune system is that potentially immunologically reactive peptides do not bind well to class I MHC molecules. If the peptides dissociate from class I MHC molecules too quickly, the cells presenting the peptides do not have a sufficient concentration of the specific pMHC at the surface of the cell to be recognized by circulating T cells. We examined binding of a selection of known immunologically recognized peptide ligands from the tyrosine kinase family member HER-2/neu. Despite the presence of CTL that recognize these peptides bound to A2, the tumors are not eliminated. These HER-2/neu peptides displayed a spectrum of binding affinities, but all were lower than the level observed for high affinity binders, such as ML or RT. Of particular interest to the immunology of tumor recognition was the clustering of many of these peptides in the “low affinity” category. Remarkably, all of these peptides, (GP2, C84, and F56) have good anchor residues for A2.There are two primary reasons to examine this phenomena in detail. The first is to understand how class I MHC binds peptides. There is a great deal known about how class I MHC binds many peptides with great sequence diversity, but there is very little information about how the protein binds any particular peptide well or poorly. There are now many examples of crystal structures of high affinity peptides bound to class I MHC. GP2 is a perfect example of a poor binding peptide and as such offers the first opportunity to understand poor binding. The second reason to examine GP2 is that poor affinity peptides are potentially better targets for immunotherapy. The rationale for this has to do with T cell education. T cells are selected for survival by two mechanisms (positive and negative selection) in the thymus (35Chan S. Correia-Neves M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). If a self-peptide binds to class I MHC with high affinity, there is a larger concentration of pMHC in the thymus and thus a greater chance that T cells would be able to recognize the complex well. Presumably, this set of T cells would be deleted from the T cell receptor repertoire, and they would not be in the periphery. If the self-peptide binds with poor affinity, the concentration of that peptide-MHC molecule in the thymus may be too low for recognition during the selection process. Therefore, there is a greater probability of finding these T cells in the periphery.A complex of A2 with GP2 bound has poor thermal stability (T m, 36.4 °C) and a very short cell surface half-life (∼21 min). Many laboratories including ours have improved the binding affinity of peptides by changing the anchor residues to those most preferred by A2 (13Overwijk W.W. Tsung A. Irvine K.R. Parkhurst M.R. Goletz T.J. Tsung K. Carroll M.W. Liu C. Moss B. Rosenberg S.A. Restifo N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 36Romero P. Gervois N. Schneider J. Escobar P.

As an example, we show that a small change in the anchor position of the melanoma peptide MelA results in a peptide with much greater binding affinity. However, trials with substitutions of GP2 at the anchor positions showed that the affinity was not significantly improved (Table I). Our goal is to be able to design APL for cancer immunotherapy. To be able to do this in a reasonable fashion, we needed to determine the crystallographic structure of A2-GP2 and determine why this peptide binds poorly.The crystallographic structure shows uninterpretable electron density within the center of the peptide. Our interpretation of these data is that the peptide does not assume one unique conformation in the center as has been seen for all other single peptide-MHC structures to date (reviewed in Ref. 4Batalia M.A. Collins E.J. Biopoly. 1997; 43: 281-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is analogous to the situation found in the crystal structure of a class I MHC complex that contained a mixture of many different peptides (37Guo H.C. Jardetzky T.S. Garrett T.P. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 38Kono K. Rongcun Y. Charo J. Ichihara F. Celis E. Sette A. Appella E. Sekikawa T.

Immunother. Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1995; 18: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest that anchor substitutions do not significantly increase the affinity of GP2 because they do not address the fundamental problem that the peptide has in binding. The center does not make stabilizing contacts with the binding cleft of the class I MHC molecule.This result begs another important immunological question. Does the flexibility in the center of the peptide increase or decrease immunogenicity? On the one hand, the flexibility decreases the already small concentration of a specific molecular surface that can interact with the T cell receptor on a circulating T cell. On the other hand, multiple peptide conformations generate more molecular surfaces that can be potentially recognized by circulating T cells. Perhaps in the context of a peptide that binds well, increased flexibility is more immunogenic, but in the context of a poor binding peptide increased flexibility does not increase immunogenicity because of the reduced concentration effect.There is increasing interest in using peptides that bind to class I MHC for immunotherapy. As is the case of vaccination used to prevent viral infection, the potential therapeutic value is significant. As more antigens are discovered that are recognized by CTL and yet bind poorly to class I MHC molecules, the rules that predict binding affinity will be more critical. The phenomena observed here for GP2 certainly applies to other poor binding peptides whose binding affinity is not increased by altering the anchor residues. Increased affinity can be obtained for many of these peptides, but a full understanding of how peptides bind to class I MHC is still needed. By examining the binding of GP2 at the atomic level, we have made another step toward understanding peptide binding well enough to make predictions that will increase peptide affinity and minimize immunological consequences.

These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and bind to newly formed class I molecules. Peptide binding appears to be the final step in assembly of the complex (1Lehner P.J.

These data suggest that anchor substitutions do not significantly increase the affinity of GP2 because they do not address the fundamental problem that the peptide has in binding. The center does not make stabilizing contacts with the binding cleft of the class I MHC molecule.This result begs another important immunological question. Does the flexibility in the center of the peptide increase or decrease immunogenicity? On the one hand, the flexibility decreases the already small concentration of a specific molecular surface that can interact with the T cell receptor on a circulating T cell. On the other hand, multiple peptide conformations generate more molecular surfaces that can be potentially recognized by circulating T cells. Perhaps in the context of a peptide that binds well, increased flexibility is more immunogenic, but in the context of a poor binding peptide increased flexibility does not increase immunogenicity because of the reduced concentration effect.There is increasing interest in using peptides that bind to class I MHC for immunotherapy. As is the case of vaccination used to prevent viral infection, the potential therapeutic value is significant. As more antigens are discovered that are recognized by CTL and yet bind poorly to class I MHC molecules, the rules that predict binding affinity will be more critical. The phenomena observed here for GP2 certainly applies to other poor binding peptides whose binding affinity is not increased by altering the anchor residues. Increased affinity can be obtained for many of these peptides, but a full understanding of how peptides bind to class I MHC is still needed. By examining the binding of GP2 at the atomic level, we have made another step toward understanding peptide binding well enough to make predictions that will increase peptide affinity and minimize immunological consequences. One hypothesis used to explain why tumors are not recognized and eliminated by the immune system is that potentially immunologically reactive peptides do not bind well to class I MHC molecules. If the peptides dissociate from class I MHC molecules too quickly, the cells presenting the peptides do not have a sufficient concentration of the specific pMHC at the surface of the cell to be recognized by circulating T cells. We examined binding of a selection of known immunologically recognized peptide ligands from the tyrosine kinase family member HER-2/neu. Despite the presence of CTL that recognize these peptides bound to A2, the tumors are not eliminated. These HER-2/neu peptides displayed a spectrum of binding affinities, but all were lower than the level observed for high affinity binders, such as ML or RT. Of particular interest to the immunology of tumor recognition was the clustering of many of these peptides in the “low affinity” category. Remarkably, all of these peptides, (GP2, C84, and F56) have good anchor residues for A2. There are two primary reasons to examine this phenomena in detail. The first is to understand how class I MHC binds peptides. There is a great deal known about how class I MHC binds many peptides with great sequence diversity, but there is very little information about how the protein binds any particular peptide well or poorly. There are now many examples of crystal structures of high affinity peptides bound to class I MHC. GP2 is a perfect example of a poor binding peptide and as such offers the first opportunity to understand poor binding. The second reason to examine GP2 is that poor affinity peptides are potentially better targets for immunotherapy. The rationale for this has to do with T cell education. T cells are selected for survival by two mechanisms (positive and negative selection) in the thymus (35Chan S. Correia-Neves M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). If a self-peptide binds to class I MHC with high affinity, there is a larger concentration of pMHC in the thymus and thus a greater chance that T cells would be able to recognize the complex well. Presumably, this set of T cells would be deleted from the T cell receptor repertoire, and they would not be in the periphery. If the self-peptide binds with poor affinity, the concentration of that peptide-MHC molecule in the thymus may be too low for recognition during the selection process. Therefore, there is a greater probability of finding these T cells in the periphery. A complex of A2 with GP2 bound has poor thermal stability (T m, 36.4 °C) and a very short cell surface half-life (∼21 min). Many laboratories including ours have improved the binding affinity of peptides by changing the anchor residues to those most preferred by A2 (13Overwijk W.W. Tsung A. Irvine K.R. Parkhurst M.R.

As an example, we show that a small change in the anchor position of the melanoma peptide MelA results in a peptide with much greater binding affinity. However, trials with substitutions of GP2 at the anchor positions showed that the affinity was not significantly improved (Table I). Our goal is to be able to design APL for cancer immunotherapy. To be able to do this in a reasonable fashion, we needed to determine the crystallographic structure of A2-GP2 and determine why this peptide binds poorly. The crystallographic structure shows uninterpretable electron density within the center of the peptide. Our interpretation of these data is that the peptide does not assume one unique conformation in the center as has been seen for all other single peptide-MHC structures to date (reviewed in Ref. 4Batalia M.A. Collins E.J. Biopoly. 1997; 43: 281-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this is analogous to the situation found in the crystal structure of a class I MHC complex that contained a mixture of many different peptides (37Guo H.C. Jardetzky T.S. Garrett T.P.

ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase brefeldin A Chinese hamster ovary guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate The ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs)1 were originally identified as cofactors for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs, the α-subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase. ARFs have now been associated with intracellular membrane trafficking events such as recruitment of clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor protein or coatomer protein to Golgi membranes, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As a subfamily of the Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins, ARF proteins transmit signals to downstream effectors in a guanine nucleotide-dependent manner. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) act on ARFs to catalyze replacement of bound GDP with GTP, converting them to the active GTP-bound form, while GTPase-activating proteins hydrolyze the bound GTP, converting them to the inactive GDP-bound form.Six mammalian ARF genes have been cloned. Based on phylogenetic analysis, deduced amino acid sequence, protein size, and gene structure, ARFs can be divided into three classes: class I (ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3), class II (ARF4 and ARF5), and class III (ARF6) (3Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARF6 is found in plasma membranes or endosomes, and is involved in peripheral vesicle trafficking such as endocytosis and exocytosis (4D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 5Galas M. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M. J. Biol.

However, GTP-bound forms of class I and II ARFs can be associated with Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes (7Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G.

Both ARF1 and ARF5 are equally effective in promoting the recruitment of the AP-1 adaptor complex in Golgi (9Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of ARF1 or ARF4 inhibit endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle transport (10Balch W.E. Kahn R.A. Schwaninger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13053-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and expression of either ARF1 or ARF4 genes corrects the impairment of secretion in yeast induced by ARF deletion (11Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2606-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, different GEFs seem to be involved in the activation of class I and class II ARFs. Several class I ARF-specific GEFs have been cloned and purified, such as cytohesin-1, a brefeldin A (BFA)-insensitive 55-kDa protein, and a BFA-sensitive 200-kDa protein (2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, a BFA-insensitive GEF (GBF1) was identified in CHO-K1 cells (12Claude A. Zhao B. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan C. Berger S.J. Yan J. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BFA-sensitive 200-kDa protein acts on class I ARFs (13Mansour S.J. Skaug J. Zhao X. Giordano J. Scherer S.W. Melancon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7968-7973Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the BFA-insensitive GBF1 is specific for ARF5 (12Claude A. Zhao B. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan C. Berger S.J. Yan J. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both ARF1 and ARF5 specifically translocate to the Golgi (8Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), possibly due to the GEFs located in this organelle.Regardless of the fact that different GEFs act on class I and class II ARFs, both classes of ARFs share many overlapping cellular functions (9Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Balch W.E. Kahn R.A. Schwaninger R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2606-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the 3–10-fold lower cellular concentrations of class II ARFs compared with class I ARFs, it is possible that class II ARFs have only supplementary role to class I ARFs. However, it is also possible that class II ARFs have unique cellular functions that cannot be replaced by class I ARFs.To define the cellular actions of class II ARFs we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that bind to ARF5. We employed a constitutively active form of ARF5 in which Gln71 has been mutated to Leu to inhibit GTP hydrolysis (14Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our studies revealed a protein named arfophilin that selectively binds to active class II ARFs.RESULTSYeast two-hybrid screening using pGBT9-ARF5-Q71L identified a novel ARF5-binding protein among 4 × 106 HF7c yeast cells containing both pGBT9-ARF5-Q71L and an activation domain vector containing a human kidney cDNA library (Fig. 1). The cDNA sequence of the protein, termed arfophilin, is identical to a previously undefined 4080-base pair human mRNA (KIAA0665 gene EMBL/GenBank accession no.AB014565). Arfophilin cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 756 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 82.4 kDa. Primary structure analysis indicated that arfophilin has four possible coiled-coil domains, located at amino acids 531–561, 564–601, 602–648, and 655–694.Because both yeast and E. coli did not make full-length arfophilin, we used a truncated form containing amino acids 321–756 for both yeast two hybrid binding assays and GST pull-down experiments. Since yeast does not express human ARF5 protein from a high copy number plasmid construct (16Deitz S.B. Wu C. Silve S. Howell K.E. Melancon P. Kahn R.A. Franzusoff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3275-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we employed a pGBT9 vector inducing very low levels of protein expression. The growth rate of SFY526 yeast transformed by pGBT9-ARFs was similar to that of untransformed yeast, indicating that very low level expression of ARF5 was not toxic to this yeast. The SFY526 yeast strain showed β-galactosidase activity after cotransformation by both arfophilin-(321–756) and ARF5-Q71L. However, neither the native form of ARF5 nor the GDP-bound form of ARF5 (ARF5-T31N) showed β-galactosidase activity when cotransformed with arfophilin-(321–756), indicating that arfophilin interacts only with the GTP-bound form of ARF5 (Table I). To determine whether expression of ARF5 or ARF5-T31N at a higher level resulted in detectable interaction with arfophilin, we expressed these proteins fused to the GAL4DNA binding domain using a pAS2–1 vector inducing high level protein expression detectable by Western blotting. SFY526 yeast transformed by both pAS2–1-ARF5 s and pACT2-arfophilin-(321–756) expressed the fused ARF5 proteins (Fig. 2), but these yeast colonies did not grow more than 1 mm size, indicating that high level expression of either ARF5 or ARF5 mutants was toxic to SFY526. Even though overexpression of ARF5s was toxic, SFY526 yeast transformed by both pAS2–1-ARF5-Q71L and pACT2-arfophilin-(321–756) showed β-galactosidase activity, while neither pAS2–1-ARF5 nor pAS2–1-ARF5-T31N showed β-galactosidase activity when cotransformed with pACT2-arfophilin-(321–756) (confirmed in two independent yeast transformations).Table IYeast two-hybrid interaction assay between arfophilin-(321–756) and various ARF constructsGAL4 DNA bindingβ-Galactosidase filter assay (GAL4-activating)pGAD424apGBT9, pGAD424, and pGAD10 vectors use a truncated form of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter inducing very low protein expression.-mouse α-actinpGAD424-arfophilinpGAD10apGBT9, pGAD424, and pGAD10 vectors use a truncated form of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter inducing very low protein expression.-arfaptin-1bPreviously our laboratory reported that arfaptin-1 binds to GTP-bound form of either ARF3 or ARF5 (27).pGBT9apGBT9, pGAD424, and pGAD10 vectors use a truncated form of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter inducing very low protein expression.-ARF5-Q71L—cColor development was not observed after 24-h incubation at 30 °C.BluedBlue color started to develop within 30 min of incubation in all positive samples.BluepGBT9-ARF5———pGBT9-ARF5-T31N———pGBT9-N3-ARF5-Q71L——BluepGBT9-ARF5-C3-Q71L—BlueBluepGBT9-ARF3-Q71L——BluepGBT9-N5-ARF3-Q71L—BlueBluea pGBT9, pGAD424, and pGAD10 vectors use a truncated form of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter inducing very low protein expression.b Previously our laboratory reported that arfaptin-1 binds to GTP-bound form of either ARF3 or ARF5 (27Kanoh H.

Open table in a new tab FIG. 2Expression of ARF5 mutants fused in GAL4 DNA binding domain in SFY526 yeast. SFY 526 yeast cells were transformed by both pACT2-arfophilin and pAS2–1-ARF5 mutants. After a 7-day cultivation on both leucine- and tryptophan-deficient selection plates, several 1-mm size independent colonies were combined (n = 2) and cultivated overnight in a selection liquid medium. Overnight cultures were spun down (1000 × gfor 5 min), resuspended in YPD complete medium, and cultivated for another 7 h. Yeast protein was extracted using 8 murea and 5% SDS. Protein samples equivalent to 0.75 OD600units of cells were electrophoresed on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and expression of each ARF5 mutant fused in GAL4 DNA binding domain was determined by Western blotting using a GAL4 DNA-BD monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). For control, untransformed SFY526 yeast cultivated in YPD medium was used. The pAS2–1 vector makes a 22-kDa GAL4 DNA-binding domain protein; therefore, pAS2–1-ARF5 makes a 42-kDa fusion protein in transformed yeast, which is consistent with our Western blotting results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Northern blot analysis showed that arfophilin was expressed as a mRNA of approximately 6 kilobases mainly in human heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3 A). Extended exposure showed the presence of a weak band corresponding to arfophilin message in other tissues such as kidney, pancreas, brain, placenta, and liver (data not shown). However, because of smearing and the less amount of mRNA in these samples (Fig. 3 B), these results are not definitive.FIG. 3Northern blot analysis of arfophilin in various human tissues.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of ARF3 and ARF5 indicates that the N and C termini have the least homology (Fig. 4 A). For this reason, we constructed ARF5-Q71L containing N- or C-terminal ARF3 sequences (Fig. 4 B). N3-ARF5-Q71L, which contains the N-terminal 17 amino acids of ARF3, did not interact with arfophilin, while ARF5-C3-Q71L, which contains the C-terminal 8 amino acids of ARF3, showed interaction with arfophilin (Table I). ARF3-Q71L also interacted with arfophilin when its N-terminal 17 amino acids were exchanged with those of ARF5 (N5-ARF3-Q71L), confirming that the N terminus of ARF5 is involved in binding to arfophilin in a yeast two-hybrid binding assay (Table I and Fig. 4 B). ARF5-Q71L, ARF5-C3-Q71L, and N5-ARF3-Q71L fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain did not show β-galactosidase activity when cotransformed with mouse α-actin fused to the GAL4 activation domain, suggesting that the binding of these ARF mutants to arfophilin is specific and that they are not autoactivating. N3-ARF5-Q71L and ARF3-Q71L showed β-galactosidase activity when contransformed with arfaptin-1 (Table I), indicating that they were adequately expressed in a functional form.FIG. 4Construction of ARF3/ARF5 chimeras to determine the arfophilin binding site in ARF5.

The native form of ARF5 was produced in CHO-K1 cells, and the whole cytosol fraction of the cells was used for binding to GST-arfophilin in vitro. GTPγS treatment resulted in ARF5 binding to GST-arfophilin but not to GST alone, and incubation with GDPβS caused dissociation of ARF from arfophilin (Fig. 5 A). The GTP-bound form of ARF3 did not bind to arfophilin, while the GTP-bound form of ARF3 containing N-terminal ARF5 amino acids did, confirming that N terminus of ARF5 is essential for binding to arfophilin (Fig. 5 B).FIG. 5In vitro interaction of GST-arfophilin-(321–756) with various ARF constructs. Each ARF mutant was overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells, and 500 μl of cytosol fraction was used for GST pull-down experiments. A, native form of ARF5 was incubated with various concentrations of GTPγS or GDPβS at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently these mixtures were incubated with 14 μg of GST or GST-arfophilin-(321–756) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, 50 μl of SDS sample buffer was added to each sample and boiled for 10 min. Each 20 μl of sample preparation was used for 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ARF5 association was determined by Western blotting. 10 μl of CHO-K1 cytosol overexpressing ARF5 was used for standard. Another independent experiment was performed with similar results. B, the arfophilin binding domain in ARF5 was determined in vitrousing the N5-ARF3 mutant. Each ARF3 mutant was incubated with 21 μg of GST or GST-arfophilin-(321–756) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, 50 μl of SDS sample buffer was added to each sample and boiled for 10 min. Each 20 μl of sample preparation was used for 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ARF3 association was determined by Western blotting. 10 μl of CHO-K1 cytosol overexpressing ARF was used for standard.

Fig. 6 shows that the GTP-bound form of ARF5 associated with arfophilin, while the GTP-bound form of ARF5 containing the ARF3 N terminus did not. The N-terminal sequences of ARFs are well conserved in each class (Fig. 7 A). To determine whether ARF4 can also bind to arfophilin, we constructed ARF5 with its N-terminal amino acids mutated to those of ARF4 (ARF5-V5I,A7S,I12L). Arfophilin-(321–756) bound to the GTP-bound forms of both ARF5 and ARF5-V5I,A7S,I12L (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that arfophilin is a specific target protein for the GTP-bound forms of class II ARFs. We did not determine whether ARF6 could bind to arfophilin because the N terminus of ARF6 is quite different from those of class I and II ARFs and is therefore unlikely to bind to arfophilin.FIG. 6Association between arfophilin and the GTP-bound form of ARF5 in CHO-K1 cell homogenates.

Three independent experiments were performed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recombinant arfophilin overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells was mainly localized in the cytosol, but a small amount was found in the particulate fraction, possibly due to the presence of endogenous class II ARFs. Arfophilin was solubilized from the particulate fraction by 1% Triton X-100, suggesting that it was associated with membranes (Fig. 9 A). When a CHO-K1 cell homogenate expressing arfophilin was incubated in 30 °C for 30 min, a significant amount of arfophilin was associated with the membrane fraction. This translocation of arfophilin may be related to activation of ARF5 in CHO-K1 cell cytosol by the ARF5-specific GEF, GBF1 (12Claude A. Zhao B. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan C. Berger S.J. Yan J. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS clearly promoted arfophilin translocation to the membrane fraction while GDPβS triggered dissociation of arfophilin from this fraction (Fig. 9 B). Adding ARF5-Q71L to the cytosol had the same effect as GTPγS (Fig. 9 C). Both ARF5-Q71L and N3-ARF5-Q71L translocated to the membrane fraction in vitro, but only ARF5-Q71L promoted translocation of arfophilin to membrane fraction, indicating that only class II ARFs are carriers for arfophilin (Fig. 9 C).FIG. 9The GTP-bound form of ARF5 in complex with arfophilin translocates to membranes.

Total particulate (P) and cytosol (S) fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. These were collected separately and adjusted to equal volumes in ARF binding buffer. After SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis, arfophilin was detected by Western blotting.

We also determined the domains in both arfophilin and ARF5 that are involved in the binding.The N terminus of ARF5 (amino acids 1–17), which is different from the N termini of class I ARFs, was essential for binding to arfophilin. In previous studies, analysis of the GTP-dependent conformational change of ARF1 indicated that the N terminus of ARF1 is the domain at which it interacts with its effectors and that N-terminal myristoylation of ARF1 is critical for this change (17Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The consistency between our findings and the proposed model for ARF1 interaction with its effectors suggests that arfophilin is a true target for the GTP-bound form of ARF5.All classes of ARFs activate phospholipase D and cholera toxin in vitro (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but the cellular roles of each ARF seem to be diverse. ARF6 (class III) is clearly distinct from the other ARFs based on its cellular localization and functions (4D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 5Galas M. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, class I and II ARFs locate to similar cellular organelles and share several cellular functions. For this reason many researchers believe that class II ARFs have only a supplementary role to class I ARFs, and much work is therefore focused on class I ARFs. The cellular function(s) of class II ARFs is not known, and it has been suggested that there is no functional difference between class I and class II ARFs (18Roth M.G. Cell. 1997; 97: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of a class II ARF-binding protein suggests for the first time that there may be a unique cellular pathway for class II ARFs, involving arfophilin, that cannot be replaced by other classes of ARFs.The observation that arfophilin binds the GTP-bound form of ARF5 but not the GDP-bound form suggests that it is a downstream effector of ARF5, but its cellular role is unknown. Several lines of evidence suggest that it may be involved in vesicle trafficking especially in Golgi. The GTP-bound form of ARF5 translocates to intracellular membranes such as Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes"
https://openalex.org/W2101937540,"Type II restriction endonucleases usually recognize 4–6-base pair (bp) sites on DNA and cleave each site in a separate reaction. A few type II endonucleases have 8-bp recognition sites, but these seem unsuited for restriction, since their sites are rare on most DNA. Moreover, only one endonuclease that recognizes a target containing 8 bp has been examined to date, and this enzyme,SfiI, needs two copies of this site for its DNA cleavage reaction. In this study, several endonucleases with 8-bp sites were tested on plasmids that have either one or two copies of the relevant sequence to determine if they also need two sites. SgfI,SrfI, FseI, PacI, PmeI,Sse8781I, and SdaI all acted through equal and independent reactions at each site. AscI cleaved the DNA with one site at the same rate as that with two sites but acted processively on the latter. In contrast, SgrAI showed a marked preference for the plasmid with two sites and cleaved both sites on this DNA in a concerted manner, like SfiI. Endonucleases that require two copies of an 8-bp sequence may be widespread in nature, where, despite this seemingly inappropriate requirement, they may function in DNA restriction.

Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 26: 312-313Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The latter are particularly valuable as tools for the analysis of genomic DNA because they usually cleave DNA into larger DNA fragments than the enzymes cutting at 4- or 6-bp sequences, due to the relative rarity of their sites (2Qiang B-Q. Schildkraut I. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, doubts exist over whether a restriction enzyme with an 8-bp site could provide a bacterial cell with an effective defense against foreign DNA (3Naito T. Kusano K. Kobayashi I. Science. 1995; 267: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Restriction demands at least one recognition site on the incoming DNA, and its efficiency increases with the number of sites (4Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 19: 585-627Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The probability of DNA escaping restriction, by being modified at all sites before being cleaved at any one site, declines logarithmically with the number of sites. Yet an 8-bp sequence must occur less frequently on DNA than any 4- or 6-bp element from that sequence, so phage or plasmid DNA may often lack an 8-bp site or contain only a small number of such sites. Hence, if the defense against phage infections by a restriction-modification system confers a selective advantage to a bacterial cell, evolutionary pressures should result in a contraction of the length of the recognition sequence (5Kobayashi I. Russo V. Martienssen R. Riggs A. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 155-172Google Scholar). Most of the current information about the mode of action of type II restriction enzymes derives from a relatively small number of enzymes, almost all of which recognize either a 4- or a 6-bp sequence, such asBamHI, EcoRV, MunI, PvuII, or TaqI (Refs. 6Dorner L.F. Bitinaite J. Whitaker R.D. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Baldwin G.S. Sessions R.B. Erskine S.G. Halford S.E. J.

In each of these examples, the protein is a dimer of identical subunits that interacts symmetrically with a palindromic DNA sequence, so that the two active sites in the enzyme are positioned on the scissile phosphodiester bonds in each strand. In the presence of Mg2+, the cofactor for DNA cleavage, the two strands are cut in parallel reactions. The cleavage of both strands is normally completed before the enzyme dissociates from the DNA, although, in some instances, the enzyme dissociates after cutting just one strand and then returns to that site to cut the second strand (11Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). On DNA with multiple sites, these enzymes usually act in a distributive manner at each individual copy of the recognition sequence. However, they sometimes act processively on a DNA with two or more sites. For example, EcoRI can cleave one site, translocate to another site by an intramolecular process, cut that site, and only then leave the DNA (12Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. Gene Amplif. Anal. 1987; 5: 103-118PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the restriction enzymes in the type IIe group, such as EcoRII and NaeI, require two copies of their recognition sequence (14Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Yang C.C. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9657-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both EcoRII and NaeI are reported to be homodimeric proteins that have two distinct DNA-binding sites. One binding site has the catalytic functions for DNA cleavage, but this remains inactive unless a second copy of the recognition sequence binds to an allosteric site elsewhere in the dimer (16Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18623-18630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Baxter B.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The DNA at the allosteric site is not cleaved (19Pein C-D. Reuter M. Meisel A. Cech D. Krüger D.H.

To date, a reaction mechanism has been established for only one of the type II enzymes that recognizes a site with 8 specified bp: theSfiI endonuclease from Streptomyces fimbriatus(21Wentzell L.M.

In contrast to both the orthodox enzymes such asEcoRV and the type IIe enzymes such as EcoRII,SfiI is a tetrameric protein that has two identical binding sites for its palindromic recognition sequence, each presumably made from two subunits. However, SfiI has no activity when only one DNA-binding site is occupied. Instead, it has to bind two copies of its recognition sequence before being able to cleave DNA. The two sites can be in cis, on the same molecule of DNA, or intrans, on separate molecules of DNA. In the former case,SfiI tethers the intervening DNA in a loop, while, in the latter, it bridges the two DNA molecules. As with other proteins that span two sites (28Rippe K. von Hippel P.H. Langowski J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 500-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), SfiI prefers sites in cisover sites in trans. It generally cleaves plasmids with two sites more rapidly than plasmids with one site. Moreover, the turnover of SfiI on plasmids with two sites is normally completed by the liberation of DNA cut in both strands at both sites; only a small fraction of the DNA is liberated after cutting just one site. The concerted action of SfiI at two recognition sites is reminiscent of the enzymes that mediate DNA rearrangements by site-specific recombination or transposition (29Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 157-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a role forSfiI in re-arrangements has been rejected (30Bilcock D.T. Halford S.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Like the orthodox restriction enzymes (31Grasby J.A. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), phosphodiester hydrolysis bySfiI inverts the stereoconfiguration of the phosphate, so its reaction cannot involve a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (32Mizuuchi K. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. Adzuma K. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4640-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Enzymes that catalyze both DNA breakage and religation normally conserve the energy of the phosphodiester bond, a prerequisite for the religation step, by forming a covalent intermediate (29Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 157-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, SfiI can restrict DNA that has two or more SfiI sites, but it is incompetent at restricting DNA with one site (30Bilcock D.T. Halford S.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mode of action of SfiI thus exacerbates the doubts over whether an enzyme recognizing an 8-bp sequence could defend a cell against phage or plasmid DNA. However, the recognition sequence for SfiI is unusual (33Qiang B-Q. Schildkraut I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4507-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in that it contains 8 specified bp but these are interrupted by a unspecified spacer of 5 bp (Table I). Apart from one isoschizomer ofSfiI, all of the other type II enzymes that cleave DNA at 8-bp sites recognize uninterrupted sequences of 8 consecutive bp (Table I). Hence, while the type II enzymes with continuous recognition sites of 8 bp might act like SfiI, they may differ fromSfiI and behave instead like the orthodox enzymes such asBamHI or EcoRV. These possibilities were examined by assaying several restriction enzymes on plasmids that have either one or two copies of the relevant sequence in order to determine whether they act concertedly at two sites or cleave each site in a separate reaction.Table IRecognition sequencesEnzymeSpeciesaIn some instances, the species within the genus has not been identified.Recognition sequenceb↓, the point of cleavage; N, any base; R, purine; Y, pyrimidine.SfiIStreptomyces fimbriatasGGCCNNNNN↓NGGCCSgfIStreptomyces griseoruberGCGAT↓CGCSrfIStreptomyces sp.GCCC↓GGGCFseIFrankia sp.GGCCGG↓CCSgrAIStreptomyces griseusGR↓CCGGYGSse83871IStreptomyces sp.CCTGCA↓GGSdaIcSdaI is an isoschizomer of Sse8387I.Streptomyces diastalicusCCTGCA↓GGAscIArthobacter sp.GG↓CGCGCCPacIPseudomonas alcaligenesTTAAT↓TAAPmeIPseudomonas mendocinaGTTT↓AAACSacIStreptomyces achromogenesGAGCT↓CSalIStreptomyces albus GG↓TCGACSphIStreptomyces phaeochromogenesGCATG↓Ca In some instances, the species within the genus has not been identified.b ↓, the point of cleavage; N, any base; R, purine; Y, pyrimidine.c SdaI is an isoschizomer of Sse8387I.

The plasmids pAT153 (34Twigg A.J. Sherratt D.J. Nature. 1980; 283: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and pNEB193 (New England Biolabs) have been described before; the latter is identical to pUC19 (35Yanisch-Perron C. Viera C. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) except for an enlarged multiple cloning site (MCS) with a number of additional restriction sites. Two derivatives of pAT153, pDB7 and pDB8 (Fig. 1 a), and one of pNEB193, pAB1 (Fig. 1 b), were constructed by standard methods (36Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The duplex used in the construction of pDB7 was produced by annealing two 50-base synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides that were complementary to each other except for 4 bases at their 5′ termini; the resultant 46-bp duplex had 4-base 5′-extensions that matched an EagI terminus at one end and a StyI terminus at the other (Fig. 1 a). The SgrAI site in this duplex had the same sequence as the intrinsic site on pAT153, with respect to both its purine/pyrimidine degeneracies (Table I) and to its flanking sequence for 3 bp on either side. The duplex used in the construction of pDB8 was made by the same procedure; it had the same sequence as the duplex for pDB7, except that it lacked the SgrAI site and its 4-base 5′-extensions matched, respectively, EcoRI and HindIII termini (Fig. 1 a). The plasmids were used to transformrecA strains of Escherichia coli, either HB101 (36Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or ER2238 (37Kelleher J.E. Raleigh E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were cultured in M9 minimal medium with 1 mCi/liter [methyl-3H]thymidine, and the covalently closed form of the plasmid was purified by density gradient centrifugations (38Halford S.E. Taylor J.D. Vermote C.L.M. Vipond I.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 385-396PubMed Google Scholar). The preparations were largely supercoiled monomeric plasmid, with <10% as either dimeric plasmid or nicked open circle DNA. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 200-μl volumes and were initiated by adding the restriction enzyme (typically 10 units) to the requisite plasmid (10 or 20 nm) in an appropriate buffer. In the first instance, the buffer used with each enzyme was that advised by the supplier. To test for processivity (12Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most enzymes were also examined in modified buffers with elevated ionic strengths. For enzymes where the recommended buffer contains NaCl, the modified buffer had double the concentration of NaCl. Similarly, buffers with KOAc were adjusted to twice the advised level of KOAc. At various times after adding the enzyme, aliquots (15 μl) were removed from the reactions and mixed immediately with 10 μl of an EDTA stop mix (38Halford S.E. Taylor J.D. Vermote C.L.M. Vipond I.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 385-396PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through agarose under conditions that separated the supercoiled substrate and each of the various products from the reaction (Fig. 2). The segments of the agarose gel that encompassed the substrate and each product were analyzed individually by scintillation counting to yield the concentration of each form of the DNA at each time point (38Halford S.E. Taylor J.D. Vermote C.L.M. Vipond I.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 30: 385-396PubMed Google Scholar). For plasmids with two recognition sites, the two linear DNA fragments (L1 and L2) arising from cleavage at both sites were counted together to obtain a single value for the concentration of doubly cut DNA (L1/2). A distinction between the different modes of action seen among the type II restriction enzymes can be made by analyzing the reaction kinetics of the enzyme on two substrates, one with one copy of its recognition sequence and another with two copies. An orthodox enzyme like EcoRV will cleave a circular DNA with one copy of its recognition site first in one strand, converting the supercoiled (SC) substrate to the nicked open circle (OC) form of the DNA, and then in the second strand to produce the full-length linear (FLL) form (Fig. 2 a). However, the hydrolysis of both phosphodiester bonds is often much faster than the dissociation of the cleaved DNA (8Sasnauskas G. Jeltsch A Pingoud A. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. Gene Amplif. Anal. 1987; 5: 103-118PubMed Google Scholar, 39Erskine S.G. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7567-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these cases, the nicked form exists only as a transient enzyme-bound intermediate, and the sole product that accumulates during a steady-state reaction is the FLL form. A SC DNA with two sites will be cleaved by an orthodox enzyme acting distributively first at one site to yield FLL DNA and then at the other site to give two linear fragments, L1 and L2 (Fig. 2 b). The reaction on a two-site DNA should therefore follow a sequential A → B → C pathway, where the concentration of B first rises and then falls in a manner specified by the relative rates of the A → B and the B → C steps and where the formation of C is preceded by a characteristic lag phase (40Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar). If the recognition sites on the one- and two-site substrates are all equal to each other, then the initial rate for the utilization of the SC DNA with one site (v 1) should equal that for the utilization of the SC DNA with two sites (v 2A), and the latter should also equal the rate for the conversion of the FLL DNA to L1 and L2 (v 2B). A type II restriction enzyme that acts processively on a DNA with multiple sites should also utilize the two-site substrate at the same rate as the one-site substrate. But if the enzyme then travels along the DNA to another site and cuts that site before departing from the DNA, the SC substrate with two sites will be converted quickly to the doubly cut products, without an intervening accumulation of FLL DNA and without a lag phase preceding the formation of L1 and L2. However, the processivity is unlikely to be 100% efficient, and the enzyme will sometimes depart from the DNA before cutting the second site. Nevertheless, processivity will diminish the yield of FLL DNA from the two-site substrate, relative to that from an orthodox enzyme acting distributively. Moreover, the degree of processivity is likely to decrease as the ionic strength of the reaction is increased (12Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. Gene Amplif. Anal. 1987; 5: 103-118PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, an enzyme that acts processively at low ionic strength is likely to act in a distributive manner at high ionic strength. In contrast, a restriction enzyme that follows the mechanism proposed for the type IIe enzymes will utilize the substrate with two sites more rapidly than that with one site, since the interaction with the second site, which is needed to activate the enzyme, will be aided if this is provided in cis rather than in trans. Having cleaved one site on a two-site substrate, a type IIe enzyme would cleave the residual site at a slow rate, so a large amount of FLL DNA should accumulate during the reaction. An enzyme that acts concertedly at two recognition sites, likeSfiI, would also utilize a two-site plasmid more rapidly than a one-site plasmid. However, in contrast to a type IIe enzyme, a concerted reaction on a two-site plasmid will give directly the final products cut at both sites, L1 and L2. A diminished yield of FLL DNA from a SC DNA with two sites could thus be due to either concerted or processive actions, but these can be distinguished by analyzing the reactions at varied ionic strengths. Both the difference in the reaction rates of SfiI on plasmids with one or two sites and the degree of concertedness on plasmids with two sites depend on the concentration of NaCl in the reaction (22Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In reactions lacking NaCl,SfiI cleaves DNA with one site almost as readily as DNA with two sites; under these conditions, the protein binds to its recognition sites with sufficiently high affinity so that even the relatively weak interactions with sites in trans still permit the maximal reaction rate (27Embleton M.L. Williams S.A. Watson M.A. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A small amount of salt prevents the interactions intrans, so SfiI reactions on DNA with one site are blocked at lower levels of NaCl than those on DNA with two sites (22Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In high salt, SfiI cleaves DNA with two sites much more rapidly than DNA with one site. But the progressive destabilization of the complex of SfiI and two DNA sites with increasing ionic strength results in the progressive liberation of products from the two-site substrate that have been cleaved in three, two, or one phosphodiester bonds in place of the product cleaved at both sites in both strands (25Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction kinetics of a restriction enzyme on one-site and two-site substrates thus provide a diagnostic test for the mode of action of the enzyme; for independent reactions at individual sites,v 1 = v 2A =v 2B; for processive action on a DNA with two sites, v 1 = v 2A <v 2B; for activation by a second site,v 1 < v 2A >v 2B; for concerted action at two sites,v 1 < v 2A <v 2B. However, data at one ionic strength that yield a match to one of the above sets of relative values forv 1, v 2A, andv 2B may be insufficient for the diagnosis. An unambiguous distinction between these possibilities requires data at varied ionic strengths. A meaningful comparison of the activities on one- and two-site substrates requires the following conditions to be met. First, the plasmids must be isolated from recombination-deficient strains to prevent the one-site DNA from recombining to its dimeric form with two sites; recA strains were used here. Second, the DNA sequences flanking each recognition site on the two substrates must all be the same, since restriction activity is often affected by the flanking DNA (41Thomas M. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 314-328Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 42Halford S.E. Johnson N.P. Grinsted J. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Taylor J.D. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 28: 6198-6207Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar); plasmid substrates were designed to meet this requirement (Fig. 1). Third, the two-site substrate must have an appropriate length of DNA between the sites. Lengths of <300 bp may be inappropriate, because DNA looping between closely spaced sites depends on both the helical periodicity and the bending of the intervening DNA (26Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Conversely, on linear DNA, the stability of a loop between sites separated by >300 bp decreases as the separation increases, but this effect is largely nullified by DNA supercoiling (28Rippe K. von Hippel P.H. Langowski J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 500-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). On SC DNA, increasing the separation of the sites above 400 bp has at most only a marginal effect on loop stability (44Oram M. Marko J.F. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 396-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Jian H. Schlick T. Vologodskii A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All of the tests described here used SC plasmids with, in the case of the two-site substrates, >500 bp between the sites. Fourth, the reactions must employ lower concentrations of enzyme than substrate. Otherwise, the enzyme may bind independently to each site on the two-site DNA and cleave this DNA at double the rate of the one-site DNA. This study used commercial preparations of restriction enzymes, whose concentrations were specified in terms of units of activity rather than molarity. Nevertheless, the reactions are likely to have used lower concentrations of enzyme than DNA. For several enzymes, varied numbers of units were added to the reactions, and in all cases, the reaction velocities increased linearly with the number of units (data not shown). This behavior is characteristic of a steady-state reaction with substrate in excess of the enzyme. If the reactions had contained enzyme in excess of substrate, the rates would not have varied with the amount of enzyme. A further concern arises from the use of SC substrates. If an enzyme is more active on SC DNA than on linear DNA (or vice versa), the rate for the conversion of a SC DNA with two sites to the FLL form will differ from that for the subsequent conversion of FLL DNA to L1 and L2. Several of the enzymes were therefore tested on both SC and linear DNA substrates, the latter being generated by cleaving the plasmid with another restriction enzyme; in all cases, the SC and linearized substrates gave the same reaction rates (data not shown). The above strategy was applied first to a set of four enzymes with 8-bp recognition sites:SgfI, SgrAI, SrfI, andFseI. The first three of these were selected because they, like SfiI, are from Streptomyces species (Table I). FseI was chosen because its recognition sequence is the same as that for SfiI except for the absence of the 5-bp interruption in the SfiI site (Table I). Plasmids with one or two recognition sites for each enzyme were constructed from pAT153, which has one site for SgrAI and none for the other enzymes (Fig. 1 a). The first construct, pDB7, contains two sites for SgrAI, separated by 571 bp, and one site for the other enzymes. The second, pDB8, contains two sites for SgfI, SrfI, and FseI, separated in each case by 949 bp. For each enzyme, parallel experiments were carried out on the one-site and two-site plasmids. Samples were withdrawn from the reactions at varied times and analyzed by electrophoresis through agarose. Typical gels, from SgfI reactions on pDB7 and pDB8, are shown in Fig. 2, a and b, respectively (others not shown). With both plasmids, the intact SC, the nicked OC, and the FLL forms of the DNA were isolated from each other, as were the fragments produced by cutting both sites on the two-site DNA, L1 and L2. The concentrations of each form of the DNA, at each time point sampled during the reaction, were then determined (Fig. 3). Rates for the utilization of the one- and two-site substrates, v 1 andv 2A, respectively, were measured from the initial linear decline in the concentration of SC DNA with time, while the rate for the second reaction on the two-site substrate,v 2B, was assessed relative tov 2A from the time course for the production and decay of the FLL DNA. If v 2A =v 2B, the maximal amount of FLL DNA produced during the reaction will be 40% of the total DNA, but if the amount of FLL DNA rises to a maximum of >40% of the total DNA, thenv 2A > v 2B; conversely, a maximum of <40% indicates that v 2A <v 2B (modeling not shown). The reaction of SgfI on a SC plasmid with one cognate site yielded virtually none"

Iron, in its many inorganic and organic forms, is the fourth most abundant element on earth (1Briat J.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, at physiological pH and under aerobic conditions, iron forms hydroxides and oxyhydroxides at exceedingly low solubilities of 10−17to 10−18m (1 μm being the threshold concentration to support life) (2Huyer M. Page W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Barchini E. Cowart R.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this reason, organisms acquire insoluble Fe3+ by complexing it with ferric-specific chelators, i.e. siderophores (2Huyer M. Page W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the organism, the reduction of complexed Fe3+ is accomplished either before or after transport into the cell. Ferric reductase catalyzes the reduction of complexed Fe3+ to complexed Fe2+ using NAD(P)H as the electron donor (4Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. Labbe P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The resulting Fe2+ is subsequently released and incorporated into iron-containing proteins (5Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Assimilatory ferric reductase activities have been identified and characterized in animals, plants, yeast, and bacteria. In general, these enzymes are monomeric to homotetrameric with molecular weights ranging from 26,000 to 69,000 per monomer. The majority of the eukaryotic ferric reductases is membrane-bound and contains cytochromeb as well as covalently or non-covalently bound flavin (6Berczi A. Fredlund K.M. Moller I.M. Arch. Biochem.

Plant. 1990; 79: 339-346Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, prokaryotic ferric reductases lack cytochromes and bound flavin but require exogenous FMN for optimal activity (10Fonteclave M. Coves J. Pierre J.-L. Biometals. 1994; 7: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar). Dissimilatory ferric reductases catalyze the reduction of Fe3+ as the terminal electron acceptor in energy metabolism (11Gorby Y.A. Lovley D.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 1991: 867-870Crossref Google Scholar). Iron-reducing organisms are found among the Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera of the Proteobacteria. They include the following:Shewanella putrifacience, strain GS-15, Geobacter metallireducens, Geobacter sulfurreducens,Desulfuromonas acetoxidans, Bacillus species,Thermotoga maritima, and other isolated bacteria (12Caccavo Jr., F.

(17Vargas M. Kashefi K. Blunt-Harris E.L. Lovley D. Nature. 1998; 395: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) reported iron-reducing activities in cell suspensions of certain hyperthermophilic Archaea including Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The authors (17Vargas M. Kashefi K. Blunt-Harris E.L. Lovley D. Nature. 1998; 395: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Archaeon, Pyrobaculum islandicum, is capable of utilizing Fe3+-citrate as electron acceptor for growth. Our knowledge about dissimilatory and assimilatory iron reduction in Archaea is scarce. Since little is known about the metabolism of iron by the Archaea, the purpose of this study was to investigate ferric iron reduction in the Archaeon A. fulgidus. A. fulgidus is an anaerobic, sulfate-reducing Archaeon first isolated from marine thermal vents in Southern Italy (18Zellner G. Stackebrandt E. Kneifel H. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. De Marcario E.C. Zabel H.-P. Stetter K.O. Winter J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1989; 11: 151-160Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the purification and characterization of a ferric reductase from this extremely thermophilic Archaeon. The A. fulgidus enzyme is the first reported ferric reductase isolated from an Archaeon. A. fulgidus VC-16 (DSM 4304) was grown anaerobically with 10 mm sodium lactate and 30 mm sodium sulfate at 83 °C. The medium was prepared according to published methods (18Zellner G. Stackebrandt E. Kneifel H. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. De Marcario E.C. Zabel H.-P. Stetter K.O. Winter J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1989; 11: 151-160Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the carbonate buffer system was replaced by 20 mmPIPES,1 pH 7.0 (pH adjusted at room temperature), and sodium acetate was omitted. Large scale cultures were grown in 70-liter batches using a custom-built 100-liter glass-lined steel fermentor (Pfaudler, Rochester, NY). The cells were harvested in late log phase (24 h after inoculation) at an optical density (OD660) of 0.5–0.6 by concentrating with an A/G Technology hollow fiber unit (Needham, MA, nominal molecular weight cut-off 500,000). The concentrated cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g. Cell yields were approximately 80 g wet weight per 70 liters of culture. All purification procedures were performed aerobically at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. Frozen cells were resuspended in 150 ml of 50 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mg DNase II. The cells were lysed by passing the cell suspension twice through a French pressure cell (Amicon) at 10,000 pounds/square inch. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 90 min. A part of the soluble fraction (10 ml, 180 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 25 ml of PIPES buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, and ferric reductase was eluted with PIPES buffer containing 60 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was applied to a 5-ml Red-agarose affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated with 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. After washing the column with 25 ml of the PIPES buffer containing 0.7 m NaCl, the ferric reductase was eluted with 0.9 m NaCl in PIPES buffer. Ammonium sulfate was added to the eluent to a concentration of 1.7m, and the proteins were applied onto a 1-ml butyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PIPES buffer containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with buffer containing 1.25 m(NH4)2SO4, and protein containing ferric reductase activity was eluted with buffer containing 1.15m (NH4)2SO4. The purified protein was stored either at 4 °C or at −20 °C for long term. The ferric reductase assay was adapted from the procedure described by Berczi et al. (6Berczi A. Fredlund K.M. Moller I.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The assay was performed anaerobically in stoppered quartz cuvettes at 85 °C. The assay mixture contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.25 mm Fe3+-EDTA, 5 μm flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and 0.18–36 μg of protein. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH or NADPH to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the oxidation of NADH or NADPH was monitored at 340 nm using a DU 640 spectrophotometer equipped with a high performance temperature controller (Beckman). Electron acceptors other than Fe3+-EDTA were used at a concentration of 0.25 mm. NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase activity was measured with 50 μm FMN or FAD, and Fe3+-EDTA was omitted. One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of NAD(P)H oxidized per min. The pH optimum of the ferric reductase enzyme was determined using the following buffers: 50 mm piperazine at pH 6.0, 6.5, and 6.7, 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4, and 50 mm Tricine at pH 7.9. The pH stability of ferric reductase was determined by incubating the enzyme at room temperature in the buffers listed above. Samples were taken after 1 and 24 h, and ferric reductase activity was determined. The temperature optimum was determined by performing the ferric reductase assay at the indicated temperatures. The temperature stability of the purified enzyme was determined by incubating the enzyme in stoppered serum vials at the indicated temperatures. Samples were removed at the indicated times, and the activity was measured at 85 °C. The protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins were separated on 20% homogenous polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phastsystem. Prior to loading, the protein samples were incubated in SDS gel-loading buffer for 30 min at 100 °C (19Schröder I. Wolin C.D. Cavicchioli R. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The apparent molecular weight of the purified, denatured ferric reductase was determined from the mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight standards were bovine albumin (M r 66,000), chicken egg albumin (M r 45,000), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (M r 36,000), bovine carbonic anhydrase (M r 29,000), bovine pancreas trypsinogen (M r 24,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r 20,000), and bovine milk α-lactalbumin (M r 14, 200) (Sigma). The apparent molecular weight of the native ferric reductase was determined by size exclusion chromatography with a Superose 6 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The column was run in 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The following molecular weight markers from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech were used: ribonuclease A (M r 13, 700), chymotrypsinogen A (M r 25,000), ovalbumin (M r 43,000), and bovine serum albumin (M r 67,000). The purified protein was run on a 20% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by the Protein Microsequencing Facility at UCLA. The redox potentials of Fe3+-EDTA, Fe3+-NTA, and Fe3+-Citrate were determined with an Omni 90 potentiostat set to cycle the voltage at 50 mV/s (Cypress Systems Inc.). The potentiostat was equipped with an Ag/AgCl2 reference electrode, a platinum auxiliary electrode, and a gold working electrode. Voltammetry was were performed under anaerobic conditions in 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. The Fe3+ complexes were at a concentration of 0.4 mm. By using a modified ferric reductase assay adapted to 85 °C, high ferric reductase activity was detected in the soluble protein fraction of A. fulgidusVC-16 grown on lactate as carbon and energy source and sulfate as the electron acceptor. With NADPH as the electron donor and Fe3+-EDTA as the electron acceptor, the enzyme activity in the soluble fraction was determined to be 1 unit/mg protein. Addition of synthetic FMN to the assay stimulated the activity in the soluble fraction by 20-fold (i.e. 20 units/mg protein) (Table I). In contrast, the purified protein strictly required FMN as a catalytic intermediate for activity (see below). All assay components were stable at 85 °C for the duration of the assay (at least 2 min). The membrane fraction did not contain any measurable ferric reductase activity (<0.05 units/mg). Cell extract prepared from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, did not exhibit ferric reductase activity (data not shown).Table IPurification of the ferric reductase from A. fulgidusPreparationProteinUnitsaUnit is defined as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per min.RecoverySpecific activityPurificationmg%unitsaUnit is defined as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per min./mg-foldSoluble fraction180.03600100201Q-Sepharose15.18332492.321911Red-agarose0.9792825.795948Butyl-Sepharose0.2259116.43503175a Unit is defined as micromoles of NADPH oxidized per min. Open table in a new tab Ferric reductase was purified to homogeneity using Q-Sepharose ion exchange, Red-agarose affinity, and butyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Fig. 1 and Table I). After the final purification step, the enzyme had been enriched 175-fold with a yield of 16%. Based on this yield, ferric reductase was calculated to comprise about 0.75% of the total soluble A. fulgidusprotein (w/w). By using SDS-PAGE, it was determined that the purified ferric reductase consists of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 18,000 (Fig. 1). The molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined to be 40,000 by size exclusion chromatography, suggesting that ferric reductase exists as a homodimer (data not shown). After purification, ferric reductase did not display any significant absorption in the visible range indicating that chromophores such as flavin, heme, and/or Fe-S centers were absent (data not shown). During protein purification, it was noted that ferric reductase activity was gradually lost. When the soluble A. fulgidus protein was subjected to a desalting column, the activity was almost abolished suggesting that a low molecular weight compound was required to retain activity. A yellow-colored fraction that had been eluted from the desalting column in the column volume restored ferric reductase activity. This yellow compound exhibited a visible absorption spectrum characteristic of flavins (data not shown). The preparation was not further characterized. Synthetic FMN, FAD, but not riboflavin, also restored ferric reductase activity (Table II, data for FAD and riboflavin not shown). Without added flavin, no activity was observed demonstrating that purified ferric reduction was strictly dependent on either FMN or FAD.Table IIFMN dependence of purified ferric reductase activity from A. fulgidus determined with NADPH as the electron donorAdditions to enzyme assaySpecific activityFe3+-EDTAEnzymeFMNmmμgμm%0.250.251000.250.20<100.25080.2505<1 Open table in a new tab To examine whether flavin could serve as the electron acceptor in place of Fe3+-EDTA, activity of the purified enzyme was measured in the absence of Fe3+-EDTA using a 10-fold higher concentration of FMN, FAD, or riboflavin than in the ferric reductase assay (Table II and Table III). Both FMN and FAD, but not riboflavin, served as electron acceptors with NADH or NADPH as electron donors. Therefore, the ferric reductase also functions as an NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase similar to the ferric reductases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli (7Shatwell K.P. Dancis A.

In contrast, FAD remains oxidized in the presence of Fe3+-EDTA consistent with the notion that FAD serves here as an electron mediator (Fig. 2 B).

Open table in a new tab Since the A. fulgidus ferric reductase lacked any associated flavin, a reconstitution of the enzyme with flavin was attempted. Ferric reductase was incubated with 1 mm FMN for 10 min at 60 °C. After incubation, the enzyme was subjected to a desalting and subsequently to an ion exchange chromatography column (i.e.Q-Sepharose). Whereas free FMN eluted in the total volume of the desalting column and did not bind to the Q-Sepharose column, the ferric reductase enzyme emerged brightly yellow-colored from the void volume of the desalting and the NaCl eluent of the Q-Sepharose column. This result demonstrates that the ferric reductase could be reconstituted with FMN. The FMN is, therefore, non-covalently bound to the enzyme. Based on the extinction coefficient for free FMN (12.2 mm−1 cm−1 at 450 nm) the amount of FMN per monomer was determined to be 1.4 mol/mol. The kinetic properties of the ferric reductase were determined at 85 °C and are summarized in Table III. With Fe3+-EDTA as the electron acceptor, the purified ferric reductase exhibited a slightly higher affinity and V max for NADH than for NADPH as the electron donor. Based on the molecular weight of the dimeric ferric reductase deduced from the gene sequence (i.e. 37, 318, see below) turnover numbers of 3069 and 2180 s−1 for NADH and NADPH oxidation, respectively, were calculated. TheK m for FMN as catalytic intermediate in ferric iron reduction and as electron acceptor in place of Fe3+-EDTA were identical (data not shown) and more than 200-fold lower than that for Fe3+-EDTA (Table III). The V maxvalues with FMN and FAD were about 12-fold slower than that determined with Fe3+-EDTA. The corresponding turnover numbers were 174 s−1 for FMN reduction and 216 s−1 for FAD reduction. Ferric reductase also exhibited activity with other complexes that contained Fe3+as the electron acceptor (Table IV). The highest activity was obtained with sodium ferricyanide; it was 2.5 times higher than the activity measured with Fe3+-EDTA. Activities of 12% or less were obtained with other ferric complexes such as Fe3+-NTA and Fe3+-citrate. With dichlorophenolindophenol, an artificial electron acceptor of many flavoproteins, ferric reductase activity was half that with Fe3+-EDTA. All electron acceptors were reduced only when catalytic amounts of FMN were present. No activity was obtained with uncomplexed Fe3+, i.e. FeCl3 and Fe(OH)3 (data not shown), with the menaquinone analog dimethylnaphthoquinone or with Fe2+-EDTA (Table IV). The latter compound served as a control to demonstrate that the Fe3+ and not the EDTA part of the complex was reduced by the enzyme. Finally, ferric reductase did not reduce EDTA-chelated Ag+ and Cu2+ (data not shown).Table IVSubstrate specificity for various electron acceptors of the ferric reductase from A. fulgidusElectron acceptoraThe electron acceptors were 0.25 mm final concentration.E 0′ (V)Specific activitybThe activity was determined with NADPH as the electron donor and 5 μm FMN present.%Fe3+-EDTA0.104cThe redox potential of the Fe3+ complexes is given as E′ as it was determined, pH 7.0, and at 0.4 mm concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”).100Fe3+-NTA0.144cThe redox potential of the Fe3+ complexes is given as E′ as it was determined, pH 7.0, and at 0.4 mm concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”).12Fe3+-citrate0.146cThe redox potential of the Fe3+ complexes is given as E′ as it was determined, pH 7.0, and at 0.4 mm concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”).6Fe2+-EDTAND<1Ferricyanide0.36252DCPIP0.21758DMN−0.08<1a The electron acceptors were 0.25 mm final concentration.b The activity was determined with NADPH as the electron donor and 5 μm FMN present.c The redox potential of the Fe3+ complexes is given as E′ as it was determined, pH 7.0, and at 0.4 mm concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab The A. fulgidus ferric reductase exhibited a pH optimum of 7.0 (Fig. 3). To ensure that the decrease of enzyme activity seen below and above pH 7.0 was not due to enzyme instability, ferric reductase was incubated in buffers at the different pH values for 24 h. The enzyme activity was unchanged under all conditions suggesting that the loss of activity below and above the pH optimum is due to protonation and deprotonation of active site residues. Ferric reductase activity was highest at 88 °C (Fig. 4). This temperature is close to the optimal growth temperature of A. fulgidus (i.e.83 °C). To evaluate the enzyme's temperature stability, ferric reductase was incubated at various temperatures, and its activity was measured at 85 °C (Fig. 5). The enzyme was highly stable at room temperature retaining more than 90% of its activity over 4 weeks, but it denatured with a half-life of 4 min when incubated at 100 °C. At incubation temperatures of 65 and 85 °C the half-life was 6.5 and 2 h, respectively.FIG. 5Thermal stability of the A. fulgidus ferric reductase.

At various times samples were withdrawn, and ferric reductase activity was measured at 85 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 19 N-terminal amino acids of the A. fulgidus ferric reductase were determined to be Met-Asp-Val-Glu-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Lys-Ile-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Tyr-Ile-Val-Thr-Ser-Glu. The amino acid sequence was used to search the A. fulgidusgenomic sequence data base of The Institute for Genomic Research. A 100% match was found to a hypothetical protein encoded by the predicted coding region AF0830 (24Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K.

The hypothetical protein contains 169 amino acids, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 18,659. This molecular weight is consistent with that of the purified enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The gene product of AF0830 is thus identified as a ferric reductase or, alternatively, as a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase. The corresponding gene is designated fer forferric reductase. The enzyme has a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.84. Various data bases were searched for similar proteins. However, no homology existed to any known ferric reductase. Homology of theA. fulgidus ferric reductase was found to members of a family of NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductases and to other hypothetical proteins from a variety of prokaryotic organisms (Fig. 6). The NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase family includes the HpaC proteins from E. coli,Photorhabidus luminescence, Klebsiella pneumoniae(here called HpaH), and the E. coli NmoB protein all of which are involved in oxidative cleavage of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (25Prieto M.A. Diaz E.

We recently showed that apoE stimulates endothelial production of heparan sulfate (HS) enriched in heparin-like sequences. Because heparin and HS are potent inhibitors of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, in this study we determined apoE effects on SMC HS production and cell growth. In confluent SMCs, apoE (10 μg/ml) increased <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> incorporation into PG in media by 25–30%. The increase in the medium was exclusively due to an increase in HSPGs (2.2-fold), and apoE did not alter chondroitin and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. In proliferating SMCs, apoE inhibited [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by 50%; however, despite decreasing cell number, apoE increased the ratio of<sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> to [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine from 2 to 3.6, suggesting increased HS per cell. Purified HSPGs from apoE-stimulated cells inhibited cell proliferation in the absence of apoE. ApoE did not inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells, which are resistant to heparin inhibition. Analysis of the conditioned medium from apoE-stimulated cells revealed that the HSPG increase was in perlecan and that apoE also stimulated perlecan mRNA expression by >2-fold. The ability of apoE isoforms to inhibit cell proliferation correlated with their ability to stimulate perlecan expression. An anti-perlecan antibody completely abrogated the antiproliferative effect of apoE. Thus, these data show that perlecan is a potent inhibitor of SMC proliferation and is required to mediate the antiproliferative effect of apoE. Because other growth modulators also regulate perlecan expression, this may be a key pathway in the regulation of SMC growth."
https://openalex.org/W2030693876,"Although sphingomyelin (SPH) is a major constituent of all lipoproteins, its physiological function in plasma is not known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that SPH inhibits lipid peroxidation in low density lipoproteins (LDL) because of its effects on surface fluidity and packing density and that the relative resistance of the buoyant LDL to oxidation, compared with the dense LDL, is partly due to their higher SPH content. Depletion of SPH by treatment with SPHase resulted in shortened lag times and increased rates of oxidation in both LDL subfractions, as measured by the conjugated diene formation in the presence of Cu2+. Oxidation of LDL by soybean lipoxygenase was similarly stimulated by the degradation of SPH. Oxidation-induced fluorescence decay of diphenylhexatriene-labeled phosphatidylcholine (PC), equilibrated with LDL-PC, was accelerated significantly by the enzymatic depletion of SPH from the lipoprotein. Oxidation of 16:0–18:2 PC in the proteoliposomes was inhibited progressively by the incorporation of increasing amounts of egg SPH into the liposomes. Treatment of SPH-containing proteoliposomes with SPHase reversed the effect of SPH, showing that the presence of intact SPH is necessary for the inhibition of oxidation. Although the incorporation of SPH into the same liposome as the PC (intrinsic SPH) protected the PC against oxidation, the addition of SPH liposomes to PC liposomes (extrinsic SPH) was not effective. Oxidation of 16:0–18:2 PC in liposomes was also inhibited by the incorporation of dipalmitoyl-PC, but not by free cholesterol. These results suggest that SPH acts as a physiological inhibitor of lipoprotein oxidation, possibly by modifying the fluidity of the phospholipid monolayer and thereby inhibiting the lateral propagation of the lipid peroxy radicals.

Patients with a higher percentage of dense LDL in their plasma (Pattern B) are known to be at an increased risk for atherosclerosis (7Austin M.A. Int. J. Clin. Lab.

Med. 1993; 94: 350-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The possible mechanisms for the increased oxidative susceptibility of small dense LDL fractions is not well understood. Although a higher concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids was reported in the dense LDL, this parameter did not correlate with the difference in the oxidation rates between dense and buoyant LDLs (4de Graaf J. Hak-Lemmers H.L.M. Hectors M.P.C. Demacker P.N.M. Hendriks J.C.M. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Arteriosclerosis. 1991; 11: 298-306Crossref Google Scholar). Tribble et al. (6Tribble D.L. Van den Berg J.J.M. Motchnik P.A. Ames B.N. Lewis D.M. Chait A. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) found significantly lower levels of ubiquinol-10 and α-tocopherol in the dense LDL, compared with the buoyant LDL. However, the variation in these antioxidants could account for less than 35% of the variation in oxidation rates (6Tribble D.L. Van den Berg J.J.M. Motchnik P.A. Ames B.N. Lewis D.M. Chait A. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the antioxidant status of LDL is in general not correlated with the lag phase of oxidation (9Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). On the basis of the oxidizability of selectively localized probes in LDL particles, Tribbleet al. (10Tribble D.L. Krauss R.M. Lansberg M.G. Thiel P.M. van den Berg J.J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 662-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the greater susceptibility of small dense LDL is due to differences in the surface lipid composition rather than the core lipid or protein composition. In an earlier study (5Tribble D.L. Holl L.G. Wood P.D. Krauss R.M. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), they found an inverse correlation between the free cholesterol (FC) content of the LDL particle and its rate of oxidation and suggested that FC might protect against peroxidation of the surface lipids by altering the fluidity of the monolayer. However, the effect of FC on the oxidative susceptibility of LDL or defined liposomes was not experimentally tested.In our previous studies on the lipid composition of LDL subfractions, we found a positive correlation between the size of the LDL particle and its sphingomyelin (SPH)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because SPH is generally colocalized with FC in various cell membranes and lipoproteins (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar, 13Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the observed correlation between the FC concentration and resistance to oxidation is actually related to the SPH content rather than the FC content of the lipoprotein. The basis for this hypothesis is that SPH is known to decrease the fluidity of the monolayer and that the fluidity of the monolayer plays a significant role in the rate of lipid oxidation (14Wiseman H. Quinn P. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Janero D.R. Burghardt B. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1989; 63: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that SPH inhibits the oxidation of lipoprotein FC by cholesterol oxidase by increasing the packing density of the surface monolayer (16Slotte J.P. Grönberg L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2235-2242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here show that altering the SPH content of the isolated LDL significantly affects its oxidizability in the presence of Cu2+ or lipoxygenase. Furthermore, we show that the incorporation of SPH into synthetic liposomes containing unsaturated PC greatly inhibits the oxidation of PC and that this effect can be reversed by treatment with sphingomyelinase (SPHase). We propose that SPH inhibits the rate of peroxidation of PC in the surface of the lipoproteins by retarding the lateral propagation of the lipid-free radicals because of its membrane-rigidifying properties. This inhibition may be physiologically significant because of the high concentrations of SPH found in certain lipoprotein fractions and in the interstitial fluid.DISCUSSIONSPH is the most abundant phospholipid in the lipoproteins next to PC, comprising up to 30% of the total phospholipids in certain lipoproteins (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration is further increased in apoprotein E deficiency (25Jeong T.S. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and in aging and atherosclerosis (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar). Although its importance as a structural component of lipoproteins is well recognized, its possible involvement in the metabolism of the lipoproteins has not received much attention because it is relatively inert in the plasma and there is no plasma enzyme for which it is a substrate. We have previously demonstrated that SPH is a strong inhibitor of cholesterol esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (26Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. J. Biol.

Recent studies by Arimoto et al. (27Arimoto I. Saito H. Kawashima Y. Miyajima K. Handa T. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lobo and Wilton (28Lobo L.I.B. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) show that SPH also inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase, suggesting that it may have broader physiological function as an inhibitor of PC hydrolysis, thus helping maintain the structural integrity of lipoprotein particle. A similar role has been proposed for membrane SPH in the protection of membrane PC from the action of cellular phospholipase A (29Koumanov K. Wolf C. Bereziat G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate another possible mechanism by which SPH preserves the integrity of lipoprotein structure, namely the protection of surface PC against oxidation, which is also known to lead to extensive degradation of PC (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The importance of oxidative modification of lipoproteins in the development of atherosclerosis has been studied extensively in recent years (3Diaz M.N. Frei B. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Several studies showed that oxidized LDL not only exerts chemotactic and cytotoxic effects but is also taken up by macrophages rapidly through an unregulated pathway, leading to the formation of foam cells (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Haberland M.E. Steinbrecher U.P. Monogr. Hum. Genet. 1992; 14: 35-61Crossref Google Scholar, 3Diaz M.N. Frei B. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidation of HDL lipids renders this lipoprotein less efficient in the promotion of cholesterol efflux (30Morel D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although some studies reported that the antioxidant protection of LDL, as indicated by the increase in the lag time of CD formation, is not directly correlated with the atherogenic risk (31Fruebis J. Bird D.A. Pattison J. Palinski W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2455-2464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increasing the resistance of LDL to oxidation is generally accepted to be beneficial. While previous studies showed that large buoyant LDL are more resistant to oxidation than the small dense LDL, the possible mechanism for this is not established. Based on the correlation between the FC content and the oxidizability, Tribble et al. (5Tribble D.L. Holl L.G. Wood P.D. Krauss R.M. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) suggested that the FC content of LDL particles may be an important determinant of oxidation. However the effect of FC on lipoprotein oxidation has not been experimentally demonstrated. Our previous studies showed that the SPH/PC ratios are also positively correlated with the size of LDL particles (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore the susceptibility to oxidation is also inversely correlated with the SPH content. The results presented here show that the high concentration SPH may contribute in part to the resistance of the large buoyant LDL particles to oxidation.The mechanism by which SPH inhibits PC oxidation is yet to be established. An examination of the structure of SPH reveals the presence of no easily exchangeable hydrogen atoms, and therefore, it cannot act as a chain-breaking reagent. It does not chelate metal ions and thus cannot prevent metal ion-induced amplification of the hydroperoxy radicals. However one property of SPH that may contribute to its antioxidant function is its ability to decrease the fluidity of a membrane or monolayer because of its saturated hydrocarbon chains (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar). Studies by Wiseman and colleagues (14Wiseman H. Quinn P. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that tamoxifen and other steroid molecules have “membrane-rigidifying” effects that correlate strongly with their antioxidant properties. SPH may belong to this class of antioxidants, which act by retarding the propagation of oxidation reaction, rather than by preventing the initial formation of lipid-free radicals. The fact that only the intrinsic SPH protects the PC while the externally added SPH cannot supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, treatment of the lipoproteins or liposomes with SPHase abolished the effect of SPH, suggesting the requirement of an intact SPH molecule. Ceramide, the product of SPHase action, is more hydrophobic than SPH and may be localized deeper in the PC monolayer than SPH and therefore may not block the contact of adjacent PC molecules. Thus, the propagation of the free radical reaction along the PC monolayer may be impeded physically by the presence of SPH but not by ceramide. Similar inhibition was found when dipalmitoyl-PC was incorporated into 16:0–18:2 PC liposomes, showing that the presence of a long chain saturated phospholipid molecule prevents the oxidation of unsaturated PC in the same monolayer. However, the presence of FC at a similar concentration did not have any effect. Unlike some of the well known antioxidants that scavenge the free radicals, the amount of SPH needed to block the oxidation by the physical modification of the monolayer would be expected to be relatively high. The physiological concentration of SPH and hence the SPH/PC ratio in certain lipoproteins is indeed quite high (0.406 in large LDL) (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at such SPH/PC ratios the PC oxidation is significantly inhibited in the defined systems (Fig. 4). In contrast to FC, which can be oxidized (32Chang Y.H. Abdalla D.S.P. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Patel R.P. Diczfalusy U. Dzeletovic S. Wilson M.T. Darleyusmar V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus can contribute to the lipoprotein modification, plasma SPH is very resistant to oxidation under physiological conditions because its acyl groups are predominantly saturated or monounsaturated (34Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It may thus insulate the unsaturated phospholipids of the lipoproteins against oxidizing agents in the plasma as well as in the subendothelial space. The oxidation of cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase has also been shown to be inhibited by SPH in vitro (16Slotte J.P. Grönberg L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2235-2242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that the lipoproteins in the interstitial fluid have high SPH/PC ratios compared with plasma lipoproteins (35Reichl D. Sterchi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and this may be physiologically important in the protection of unsaturated phospholipids against oxidation in this compartment. Studies by Tabas and colleagues (22Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) show that the arterial SPHase may be involved in the aggregation of LDL particles, leading to an increased uptake by macrophages. The results presented here suggest another possible mechanism by which arterial SPHase may influence the atherogenicity of LDL, because the depletion of LDL SPH by this enzyme would increase the susceptibility of LDL to the oxidation in the subendothelial space and convert it into a more atherogenic particle. Oxidative modification of the low density lipoproteins (LDL)1 is believed to play a critical role in the infiltration of monocytes and in the formation of lipid-laden foam cells found in the atherosclerotic lesion (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Haberland M.E. Steinbrecher U.P. Monogr. Hum. Genet. 1992; 14: 35-61Crossref Google Scholar, 3Diaz M.N. Frei B. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Several studies showed that the small dense LDL fractions are more susceptible to in vitro oxidation than the large buoyant LDL fractions (4de Graaf J. Hak-Lemmers H.L.M. Hectors M.P.C. Demacker P.N.M. Hendriks J.C.M. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Arteriosclerosis. 1991; 11: 298-306Crossref Google Scholar, 5Tribble D.L. Holl L.G. Wood P.D. Krauss R.M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Patients with a higher percentage of dense LDL in their plasma (Pattern B) are known to be at an increased risk for atherosclerosis (7Austin M.A. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1994; 24: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Chait A. Brazg R.L. Tribble D.L. Krauss R.M. Am. J. Med. 1993; 94: 350-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The possible mechanisms for the increased oxidative susceptibility of small dense LDL fractions is not well understood. Although a higher concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids was reported in the dense LDL, this parameter did not correlate with the difference in the oxidation rates between dense and buoyant LDLs (4de Graaf J. Hak-Lemmers H.L.M. Hectors M.P.C. Demacker P.N.M. Hendriks J.C.M. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Arteriosclerosis. 1991; 11: 298-306Crossref Google Scholar). Tribble et al. (6Tribble D.L. Van den Berg J.J.M. Motchnik P.A. Ames B.N. Lewis D.M. Chait A. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) found significantly lower levels of ubiquinol-10 and α-tocopherol in the dense LDL, compared with the buoyant LDL. However, the variation in these antioxidants could account for less than 35% of the variation in oxidation rates (6Tribble D.L. Van den Berg J.J.M. Motchnik P.A. Ames B.N. Lewis D.M. Chait A. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the antioxidant status of LDL is in general not correlated with the lag phase of oxidation (9Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). On the basis of the oxidizability of selectively localized probes in LDL particles, Tribbleet al. (10Tribble D.L. Krauss R.M. Lansberg M.G. Thiel P.M. van den Berg J.J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 662-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the greater susceptibility of small dense LDL is due to differences in the surface lipid composition rather than the core lipid or protein composition. In an earlier study (5Tribble D.L. Holl L.G. Wood P.D. Krauss R.M. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), they found an inverse correlation between the free cholesterol (FC) content of the LDL particle and its rate of oxidation and suggested that FC might protect against peroxidation of the surface lipids by altering the fluidity of the monolayer. However, the effect of FC on the oxidative susceptibility of LDL or defined liposomes was not experimentally tested. In our previous studies on the lipid composition of LDL subfractions, we found a positive correlation between the size of the LDL particle and its sphingomyelin (SPH)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because SPH is generally colocalized with FC in various cell membranes and lipoproteins (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar, 13Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the observed correlation between the FC concentration and resistance to oxidation is actually related to the SPH content rather than the FC content of the lipoprotein. The basis for this hypothesis is that SPH is known to decrease the fluidity of the monolayer and that the fluidity of the monolayer plays a significant role in the rate of lipid oxidation (14Wiseman H. Quinn P. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Janero D.R. Burghardt B. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1989; 63: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that SPH inhibits the oxidation of lipoprotein FC by cholesterol oxidase by increasing the packing density of the surface monolayer (16Slotte J.P. Grönberg L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2235-2242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here show that altering the SPH content of the isolated LDL significantly affects its oxidizability in the presence of Cu2+ or lipoxygenase. Furthermore, we show that the incorporation of SPH into synthetic liposomes containing unsaturated PC greatly inhibits the oxidation of PC and that this effect can be reversed by treatment with sphingomyelinase (SPHase). We propose that SPH inhibits the rate of peroxidation of PC in the surface of the lipoproteins by retarding the lateral propagation of the lipid-free radicals because of its membrane-rigidifying properties. This inhibition may be physiologically significant because of the high concentrations of SPH found in certain lipoprotein fractions and in the interstitial fluid. DISCUSSIONSPH is the most abundant phospholipid in the lipoproteins next to PC, comprising up to 30% of the total phospholipids in certain lipoproteins (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration is further increased in apoprotein E deficiency (25Jeong T.S. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. Pownall H.J. Tall A.R. Jiang X.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and in aging and atherosclerosis (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar). Although its importance as a structural component of lipoproteins is well recognized, its possible involvement in the metabolism of the lipoproteins has not received much attention because it is relatively inert in the plasma and there is no plasma enzyme for which it is a substrate. We have previously demonstrated that SPH is a strong inhibitor of cholesterol esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (26Subbaiah P.V. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20156-20163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that, because of its structural similarities to PC, it may act as a competitive inhibitor of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase as well as various other phospholipases.

However the effect of FC on lipoprotein oxidation has not been experimentally demonstrated. Our previous studies showed that the SPH/PC ratios are also positively correlated with the size of LDL particles (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore the susceptibility to oxidation is also inversely correlated with the SPH content. The results presented here show that the high concentration SPH may contribute in part to the resistance of the large buoyant LDL particles to oxidation. The mechanism by which SPH inhibits PC oxidation is yet to be established. An examination of the structure of SPH reveals the presence of no easily exchangeable hydrogen atoms, and therefore, it cannot act as a chain-breaking reagent. It does not chelate metal ions and thus cannot prevent metal ion-induced amplification of the hydroperoxy radicals. However one property of SPH that may contribute to its antioxidant function is its ability to decrease the fluidity of a membrane or monolayer because of its saturated hydrocarbon chains (12Barenholz Y. Shinitzky M. Physiology of Membrane Fluidity. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131-174Google Scholar). Studies by Wiseman and colleagues (14Wiseman H. Quinn P. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that tamoxifen and other steroid molecules have “membrane-rigidifying” effects that correlate strongly with their antioxidant properties. SPH may belong to this class of antioxidants, which act by retarding the propagation of oxidation reaction, rather than by preventing the initial formation of lipid-free radicals. The fact that only the intrinsic SPH protects the PC while the externally added SPH cannot supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, treatment of the lipoproteins or liposomes with SPHase abolished the effect of SPH, suggesting the requirement of an intact SPH molecule. Ceramide, the product of SPHase action, is more hydrophobic than SPH and may be localized deeper in the PC monolayer than SPH and therefore may not block the contact of adjacent PC molecules. Thus, the propagation of the free radical reaction along the PC monolayer may be impeded physically by the presence of SPH but not by ceramide. Similar inhibition was found when dipalmitoyl-PC was incorporated into 16:0–18:2 PC liposomes, showing that the presence of a long chain saturated phospholipid molecule prevents the oxidation of unsaturated PC in the same monolayer. However, the presence of FC at a similar concentration did not have any effect. Unlike some of the well known antioxidants that scavenge the free radicals, the amount of SPH needed to block the oxidation by the physical modification of the monolayer would be expected to be relatively high. The physiological concentration of SPH and hence the SPH/PC ratio in certain lipoproteins is indeed quite high (0.406 in large LDL) (11Liu M. Krul E.S. Subbaiah P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5139-5147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at such SPH/PC ratios the PC oxidation is significantly inhibited in the defined systems (Fig. 4). In contrast to FC, which can be oxidized (32Chang Y.H. Abdalla D.S.P. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Patel R.P. Diczfalusy U. Dzeletovic S. Wilson M.T. Darleyusmar V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus can contribute to the lipoprotein modification, plasma SPH is very resistant to oxidation under physiological conditions because its acyl groups are predominantly saturated or monounsaturated (34Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It may thus insulate the unsaturated phospholipids of the lipoproteins against oxidizing agents in the plasma as well as in the subendothelial space. The oxidation of cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase has also been shown to be inhibited by SPH in vitro (16Slotte J.P. Grönberg L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2235-2242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that the lipoproteins in the interstitial fluid have high SPH/PC ratios compared with plasma lipoproteins (35Reichl D. Sterchi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and this may be physiologically important in the protection of unsaturated phospholipids against oxidation in this compartment. Studies by Tabas and colleagues (22Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) show that the arterial SPHase may be involved in the aggregation of LDL particles, leading to an increased uptake by macrophages. The results presented here suggest another possible mechanism by which arterial SPHase may influence the atherogenicity of LDL, because the depletion of LDL SPH by this enzyme would increase the susceptibility of LDL to the oxidation in the subendothelial space and convert it into a more atherogenic particle."

The macromolecular organization of membrane-bound factor VIII has been studied by electron crystallography for the first time. For this purpose two-dimensional crystals of human factor VIII were grown onto phosphatidylserine-containing phospholipid monolayers, under near to physiological conditions (pH and salt concentration). Electron crystallographic analysis revealed that the factor VIII molecules were organized as monomers onto the lipid layer, with unit cell dimensions:a = 81.5Å, b = 67.2 Å, γ = 66.5°, P1 symmetry. Based on a homology-derived molecular model of the factor VIII (FVIII) A domains, the FVIII projection structure solved at 15-Å resolution presents the A1, A2, and A3 domain heterotrimer tilted approximately 65° relative to the membrane plane. The A1 domain is projecting on top of the A3, C1, and C2 domains and with the A2 domain protruding partially between A1 and A3. This organization of factor VIII allows the factor IXa protease and epidermal growth factor-like domain binding sites (localized in the A2 and A3 domains, respectively) to be situated at the appropriate position for the binding of factor IXa. The conformation of the lipid-bound FVIII is therefore very close to that for the activated factor VIIIa predicted in the FX-ase complex.

Cooper D.N. The Molecular Genetics of Haemostasis and Its Inherited Disorders. Oxford University, Oxford, UK1994Google Scholar). Deficiency in FVIII is responsible for hemophilia A (classic hemophilia), an X-chromosome-linked bleeding disorder (2Patek A.J. Taylor F.H. L J. Clin. Invest. 1937; 16: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During coagulation, FVIII is proteolytically cleaved to an unstable active heterodimeric form (FVIIIa) by trace amounts of thrombin or factor Xa (FXa) (3Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). FVIIIa functions as a cofactor, responsible for the efficient activation of factor X (FX) by activated factor IX (FIXa) in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids (PL) and Ca2+ ion (4Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the membrane-bound FX-ase complex (FX/FVIIIa/FIXa) results in the release of FXa, which associates with the cofactor factor Va (FVa) and prothrombin into the membrane-bound prothrombinase complex. The released thrombin further cleaves fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, which stabilizes the growing clot and arrests bleeding (5Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The binding of FVIIIa to FIXa enhances the catalytic reaction by at least 5 orders of magnitude (6Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of this amplifying effect is not yet known, it seems to be strongly related to the formation of the FX-ase complex onto negatively charged membranes: increasing both the collision frequencies by restricting the reactants to a two-dimensional surface, and the specificity of the FIXa active site (7von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human FVIII is a large plasma glycoprotein synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 264,763 Da, corresponding to the mature 2332 amino acid sequence, determined from translation of the cloned gene. With N-linked carbohydrate chains, the molecular mass of FVIII reaches 330 kDa (9Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The observation of clear internal sequence homology in FVIII led to the designation of six regions: three A domains, two C domains, and a large heavily glycosylated B domain (see Fig. 1 A). This domain structure of FVIII is identical to the homologous coagulation protein FV (10Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6800-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The A domains have approximately 40% identity with each other and with the A domains of FV, as well as with the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin. The C domains are homologous to several proteins, including the lipid-binding lectin discoidin I, and also exhibit 40% identity to the C domains of FV. The B domains of FVIII and FV do not show identity with each other or with any other known protein (8Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Haemophilia. 1998; 4: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Prior to secretion into plasma, cleavage at the A3-B junction and within the B domain itself generates a series of metal ion-linked heterodimers consisting of a light chain (LC) and a heavy chain (HC) (12Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). LC comprises one A domain and two C domains (A3-C1-C2) and contains a binding site located to the EGF-like domains of FIXa on A3 (13Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.-W.H.P. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A.

Baleja J.D. Gilbert G.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HC (A1-A2-B) contains the binding sites to the FIXa protease domain in A2 (16Fay P.J. Beattie T.

Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27428-27434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preparations of plasma-derived human FVIII contain a heterogeneous mixture of dimers because of the range of different sizes for HC, resulting from additional cleavage sites within the B domain. There is a common LC of mass 78–80 kDa, containing residues 1649–2332, and a variable size HC from 90-kDa molecular mass (without the B domain) up to a maximum of 220–230 kDa, when the full B domain is included. All variable size dimers of FVIII after proteolytic activation by thrombin give fully active FVIIIa with removal of B domain remnants and an activation peptide at the LC N terminus (21Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). The heterogeneity of FVIII and its low concentration in plasma (∼1 nm) has rendered structural studies of FVIII extremely difficult. Previous electron microscopy studies led to a characterization of the size and shape of FVIII molecules in solution (22Mosesson M.W. Fass D.N. Lollar P. DiOrio J.P. Parker C.G. Knutson G.J. Hainfeld J.F. Wall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1983-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Fowler W.E. Fay P.J. Arvan D. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A globular core of approximately 12 nm diameter with a thin rod-like protruding portion (suggested to be the B domain) up to 50 nm long, were defined. In addition, fluorescence energy transfer studies further suggested close association of HC and LC (24Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these initial structural studies, increasing knowledge of the genetic and molecular basis of FVIII, and more recent structure-function studies, no structural data are available on the macromolecular organization of membrane-bound FVIII (8Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper we report our success in obtaining two-dimensional crystals of human FVIII grown onto a negatively charged phospholipid monolayer. Subsequent electron crystallographic analysis resulted in a two-dimensional projection structure at 15-Å resolution. The domain organization of FVIII, as suggested from our two-dimensional map, is consistent with homology-derived molecular models for the FVIII A domain heterotrimer (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar) and membrane-bound C1-C2 domains (26Villoutreix B.O. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Baumgartner S.

Dis. 1998; 24: 448-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and with a FVIIIa “docking” model for the FVIIIa/FIXa complex based on the known binding sites of FVIIIa for FIXa and expected orientation to phospholipid membrane surfaces (25Pemberton S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Human FVIII (3500–7000 IU/mg) was obtained from immunoaffinity purified FVIII concentrate using an anti-HC antibody (29Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at 180 μg/ml (∼700 nm) in 25 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine-HCl, 55% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.0) at −80 °C. Prior to use in two-dimensional crystallization trials, purified FVIII was buffer-exchanged into 20 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 6.0) by gel filtration on an HR10/10-G25 Sephadex superfine column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To confirm the presence of FVIII as HC-LC heterodimers, high resolution gel filtration of FVIII in the presence and absence of 20 mm EDTA was performed using a Superdex 200 PC3.2/30 column mounted in a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stock solutions of DOPS (10 mg/ml) and DOPC (50 mg/ml) were prepared in chloroform from lyophilized DOPS and DOPC (Alexis, Laufelingen, Switzerland) and stored at −80 °C under N2. For the lipid-layer crystallization technique experiments, 500 μm solutions of pure DOPS, DOPS/DOPC = 1/4, and DOPS/DOPC = 4/1 in chloroform/n-hexane = 1/1 (v/v) were prepared. For some experiments egg PC and bovine brain PS were used (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). 16 μl of the protein solution (40 μg/ml) was used in each crystallization trial. Crystallization experiments were conducted as described previously (30Brisson A. Olofsson A. Ringler P. Schmutz M. Stoylova S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stoylova S.

Membrane-bound two-dimensional crystals of FVIII formed at the air/buffer interface were transferred onto carbon-coated grids (hexagonal 400 mesh, copper electron microscopy grids from Agar Sci, Stansted, Essex, UK), negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate solution, and observed in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. All micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification of × 37,300. Selected negatives were digitized with a Leafscan-45 scanner (Leaf System, Inc) at a 20 μm/pixel increment and further analyzed using the crystallographic image processing software packages CRISP (33Hovmoller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and MRC (34Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct.

After lattice refinement of the best Fourier transforms, the Fourier projection maps were calculated using parts of the CCP4 crystallographic suite including the Pluto (npo) graphic facilities (Refs. 37Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr.

The protein density contours from the projection map of the FVIII molecule were compared with the overall shape and volume of homology-derived molecular models for the FVIII A1/A2/A3 heterotrimer (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of human ceruloplasmin (39Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and the FVIII C1 domain, 2B. Villoutreix, personal communication. using the molecular graphic software Insight II (MSI, Cambridge, UK). The FVIII C1 model was derived similarly to the FV C1 and C2 domain models (26Villoutreix B.O. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Baumgartner S. Dahlback B. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 268-275Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) based on galactose oxidase (40Ito N. Phillips S.E. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 794-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and was also used as the guide model for FVIII C2 shape and volume because the C1 and C2 domains of both FVIII and FV are predicted by homology modeling techniques to be very similar (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar,27Pellequer J.-L Gale A.J. Griffin J.H. Getzoff E.D. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 448-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The immuno-purified human FVIII preparation consists of a mixture of polypeptides representing subunits of a series of metal ion-linked HC-LC heterodimers (Fig. 1). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis shows a constant size LC doublet (A3-C1-C2) of mass between 76–80 kDa, together with a variable size HC ranging from 90 kDa (A1-A2 alone) up to 230 kDa (A1-A2-B). There is probably less than 1% single chain FVIII (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2). A small amount of human albumin is also present in this preparation to stabilize the very low levels of FVIII. To confirm that FVIII in crystallization experiments consisted essentially of HC-LC heterodimers with absence of free LC, FVIII was subjected to high resolution gel filtration in crystallization buffer in the presence or absence of added 20 mm EDTA (to encourage dissociation of the HC-LC heterodimer). Fig. 2 shows the results of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel analysis of column fractions. In the presence of Ca2+ (crystallization buffer) virtually all LC and HC were associated in a high molecular weight complex, eluting very early in the column profile (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–2): very little free LC was found, eluting late in the profile (probably less than 1% of the total). As expected, in the presence of EDTA, LC and HC were largely separated. Some undissociated HC-LC may be seen in the first fractions (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2–3), but most free HC polypeptides elute later (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–8), roughly in order of molecular size, whereas free LC elutes much later (Fig. 2 B,lanes 10–14). Isolated LC elutes even later than albumin, which may be due to a more globular folding than albumin or to nonspecific interaction with the gel-filtration matrix. As nonactivated FVIII shows high affinity for negatively charged PL surfaces (41Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Yakhyaev V. Greco N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27918-27926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), two-dimensional crystals of FVIII were grown onto phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) monolayers by the lipid layer crystallization method. In this technique, protein concentrates at the buffer/lipid monolayer interface, where specific binding to the DOPS head groups and protein-protein interactions lead to the formation of protein domains and two-dimensional crystals. In excess of 200 crystallization trials were carried out with human FVIII at room temperature and incubation times varying between 6 and 36 h. 250 negatively stained electron microscopy grids were prepared for observation, and 1000 electron micrographs recorded. The yield of protein domains formed onto the lipid monolayer increased with lowering of the DOPS content of the lipid mixture. Well defined variations in the shape and size of these domains were clearly observed when changing the lipid composition of the monolayer. With 100% DOPS, few flat membranes were observed, whereas numerous filaments and collapsed vesicular structures were found. Many of these structures presented a one-dimensional order and/or lamellar order, possibly in result of vesicular lipid bi- and multilayer formation, flattened by the staining procedure. The incubations with higher DOPC content presented large, mostly circular protein domains covering more than 80% of the grid surface. These were often heavily stained and thick, resulting from the superposition of more than one lipid monolayer and/or protein aggregates formation. However the domains, even if clearly visible, did not exhibit any tendency for two-dimensional organization on the PL surface. The same ratios were studied with egg PC and bovine brain PS mixtures. Very nice thin, flat protein domains were observed on the monolayers; however, again no two-dimensional crystal order was found. Only the lipid monolayers formed with DOPS/DOPC = 4/1 (v/v) induced the packing of the bound FVIII molecules in two-dimensional crystals and ordered tubes (Fig. 3). The yield of the two-dimensional areas was relatively low (20%), but their crystalline order was sufficient to conduct further electron crystallographic analysis. Ten of the best two-dimensional areas were selected for further crystallographic analysis. The Fourier transforms and resulting projection maps of these two-dimensional crystalline areas exhibited similar features including: (i) similar unit cell dimensions, (ii) the protein density corresponding to one molecule within the unit cell presented similar shape and dimensions, (iii) a well defined density peak with two additional lower density peaks at the same positions within the projection maps were located. By merging the six best crystalline areas on a common origin, a final Fourier projection map for the membrane-bound FVIII was calculated at 15-Å resolution, showing that the FVIII molecules are organized onto the PL surface in monomers within unit cell dimensions of a = 81.5 ± 1.6Å, b = 67.2 ± 2.7Å, γ = 66.5 ± 0.7° (P1 symmetry of the plane group). The surface covered by one FVIII molecule is 81 × 45 ± 3 Å (3726 Å2), which corresponds to 75% of the unit cell surface. Lipids only and low-protein density contact regions (Fig. 4) fill the remaining 25%. The protein density in projection of a FVIII molecule is similar to the surface covered by one FVa molecule, defined by the same type of structural study (31Stoylova S. Mann K. Brisson A.

FV is the closest known protein to FVIII by sequence identity, and FVa has the same domain composition (A1-A2/A3-C1-C2) as the FVIII heterodimer lacking the B domain. Furthermore, the main protein density peak (23 Å in diameter) corresponds exactly in size to the main density peak in the FVa projection structure, there assigned to the C domains (Fig. 4). By comparison between our projection map, the known domain organization of FVIII, and homology-derived molecular models for the A (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar) and C domains,2 the best defined and most pronounced density peak in the projection map (23 Å diameter) was assigned to the C2 domain housing the membrane-binding part of the molecule (Fig. 4). We propose that the C1 and C2 domains double β-barrel structure is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane (27Pellequer J.-L Gale A.J. Griffin J.H. Getzoff E.D. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 448-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Stoylova S. Mann K. Brisson A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and overlapped by the A3 and A1 domains, giving this most prominent density peak in the projection map (Figs. 4 and5). We further suggest that the remaining two more elongated density peaks in the molecular contour result from the superposition of the A1 domain over the A3 and the A2 domains, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, fitting of the homology models for the A1, A2, A3 heterotrimer and the C1-C2 double β-barrel into the FVIII projection structure allowed an assignment of the protein densities to individual domains (Fig. 5). The only clear way to fit the heterotrimer A domain model within the molecular outline from the projection map is by tilting the model such that its pseudo 3-fold axis makes an angle of approximately 25 Å to the membrane surface, which when viewed from above (toward the membrane) presents an almost side-on orientation. In the proposed phospholipid-bound FVIII conformation, the long axis of the membrane-bound C2 domain is almost perpendicular to the membrane plane, whereas the C1 domain is more laterally positioned above the C2 domain, contacting the C terminus of A3. The A1 domain overlaps both the C1-C2 domain pairing and A3, positioned most distal to the membrane and main protein density in projection. The A2 domain is sandwiched between A1 and A3, extending away from the central mass of the molecule. A few loops protrude laterally from the molecular contour of A3 in the heterotrimeric A domain model: these would not be well defined by the negative-staining procedure, because of their low protein density, flexibility, and distance from the PL monolayer (Figs. 5 and6). To obtain two-dimensional crystals of a soluble protein on a lipid monolayer, high affinity of the protein toward a lipid-like ligand residing within the monolayer is necessary. In the case of FVIII, DOPS serves as the lipid ligand, as the K D of FVIII binding to a PS-containing monolayer is about 2.2 nm (41Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Yakhyaev V. Greco N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27918-27926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neither isolated HC (41Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Yakhyaev V. Greco N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27918-27926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) nor albumin has any specific binding capacity to the PL surface, thus their presence in the protein solution should not interfere with the two-dimensional crystallization. Further, as the concentrations of single chain FVIII and free LC are each estimated to be less than 1% (Fig. 2), the probability of obtaining two-dimensional crystals from these components is extremely low. The relatively low overall FVIII concentration (∼40 μg/ml) in the crystallization experiments and the multiple glycosylation sites of the B domain are likely causes for the low yield of two-dimensional crystals, as crystallization is a co-operative phenomenon ideally requiring a large pool of identically oriented and stable molecules. Obtaining two-dimensional crystals, however, in such conditions demonstrates the aptitude of the lipid layer technique to give structural information from small numbers of molecules if there is a strong and specific binding to the lipid monolayer. From the electron crystallographic and molecular modeling data, only the heterodimeric HC-LC form of FVIII lacking the B domain, could fit to the calculated projection structure. No protein densities could be assigned to part or all of the B domain, which represents 40% of the mass of the largest species of the protein. The possibility exists that variable lengths of the B domain are located in gaps between the main protein contours, remaining unresolved because of their flexibility and multiple glycosylation state. Alternatively, the absence of the B domain in the two-dimensional crystals could be due to the potential of only the A1-A2/A3-C1-C2 dimers to crystallize. This is in support of the view that two-dimensional crystallization is induced by the concentration of molecules with the same conformation and identically oriented at a gas/liquid, or liquid/solid interface (two-dimensional surface). In addition, it may contribute to the low yield of two-dimensional crystals, as only a small portion of FVIII dimers lack the B domain. The larger dimensions (10 and 12 nm) previously obtained for the FVIII core (lacking the B domain), by scanning transmission electron microscopy (22Mosesson M.W. Fass D.N. Lollar P. DiOrio J.P. Parker C.G. Knutson G.J. Hainfeld J.F. Wall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1983-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy of rotary shadowed FVIII molecules (23Fowler W.E. Fay P.J. Arvan D. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), can be ascribed to the fact that in these latter studies the FVIII molecules assumed different orientations, being further flattened when adsorbed to the carbon support film. The most successful fitting of an assembly of homology-derived domain models of FVIII to the projection structure resulted in the A domain heterotrimer oriented with the pseudo 3-fold axis at a shallow angle to the membrane (approximately 25°). The longer dimension of the FVIII molecular contour (81.5 Å) matches the heterotrimer dimensions in the A domain homology model (81–83 Å, an agreement which lends support to the validity of this particular model). From this it can be assigned that the C1 and C2 domains are situated directly underneath the A domains. When viewed side-on (perpendicular to the pseudo 3-fold axis), the heterotrimer model has a diameter of 81–83 Å, and its overall maximum “height” is 60 Å, wider than the 45 Å dimension given by the experimental protein density. However it should be noted that, of this, only 40 Å is of high protein density, with a further 20 Å profile of a lower density, mainly isolated loops (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar). As pictured in the homology model, these loops would extend into the space between the FVIII molecules in the projection map and could not fall entirely within the molecular contour. This is not surprising, as they are flexible and situated at least 60 Å above the membrane surface. In this case the uranyl acetate stain will accumulate around the membrane binding region, and only the high density part of the heterotrimer will be well outlined (Fig. 5). In an earlier hypothetical model of the FVIIIa/FIXa complex (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar) the A domain heterotrimer was oriented with the pseudo 3-fold axis parallel to the PL surface (25Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2242-2413Crossref Google Scholar). We have now used the FVIII structural information derived from the projection map to construct a further FVIIIa/FIXa model, shown in a simplified schematic form in Fig. 6 A. This model accommodates the following: (i) the suggested orientations of the A and C domains relative to the membrane and to each other, in accord with the projection map and placing C- and N termini closely in space where required; (ii) the known binding sites on FVIII A2 and A3 for the protease and EGF-like domains of FIXa (13Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.-W.H.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); and (iii) the experimentally determined height of the FIXa active site above the membrane surface (44Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is not affected by FVIIIa binding. The FVIII domains, as resolved in projection, are therefore arranged following a geometry consistent with biochemical (binding sites for FIXa), biophysical (height of the FIXa active site) and primary structure data (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 domains sequence). A further implication of this consistency is that following activation by proteolysis, FVIIIa would not show large-scale conformational changes to enable the formation of the FVIIIa/FIXa complex, prior to interaction with FX on a membrane surface. Previously, the projection structure of FVa by electron crystallography, has been reported (31Stoylova S. Mann K. Brisson A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was of interest therefore to compare the two-dimensional maps of FVa and FVIII (Fig. 6,A and B). Although FVa and FVIII are homologous proteins, their projection maps display some striking differences. First, the more pronounced protein density peak (23 Å in diameter, Fig. 4, ★) present in both projection structures and assigned to the C1-C2, is situated differently to the A domains. In the FVIII/FIXa model based on the FVIII projection map, the C1 and C2 domains are localized underneath the heterotrimer contour (Fig. 6 A). For FVa, however, the C1 and C2 domains appear to be well defined outside the main contour of the A domains, indicating a cylindrical structure attached with a thin bridge to the A3 domain and housing the double β-barrel structure (Fig. 6 B) (26Villoutreix B.O. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Baumgartner S. Dahlback B. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 268-275Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Pellequer J.-L Gale A.J. Griffin J.H. Getzoff E.D. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 448-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Stoylova S. Mann K. Brisson A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, the surface covered by the main density of one FVa molecule is 80 × 55 Å which is distinct to that of FVIII (81 × 46 Å). This may indicate a slight difference in the tilt of the A domains heterotrimer to the membrane surface, which is consistent with a different orientation of the C1-C2 domains to the A domains in FVa and FVIII (Fig. 6, A and B). The proposed side-on views of FVIII and FVa in the FVIIIa/FIXa and FVa/FXa models (Fig. 6, A and B), are based on the known atomic structures of FXa and FIXa from x-ray crystallography (45Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 46Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Carden A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and the projection structures of FVIII and FVa from EM crystallography (31Stoylova S. Mann K. Brisson A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dimensions of the enzyme, FIXa and FXa determine the position of the enzyme-binding regions within the FVa and FVIII, respectively. The active site of FXa has been reported to be localized at 69 Å from the lipid surface (47Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the FIXa active site is further away (73 Å) (44Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the slightly different FVa and FVIII domain organization (Fig. 6, A andB). It should be also taken in account that the projection map of FVa represents an active conformation, whereas that of FVIII represents an inactive conformation. It seems likely therefore, that activation of FVIII may result in the reorientation of the C1-C2 domains to the A domains. It has been also reported that the conformation of C2 itself may alter on FVIII activation and removal of the LC N-terminal acidic sequence (48Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), resulting in somewhat higher affinity binding of FVIIIa to the PL surface compared with FVIII (41Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Yakhyaev V. Greco N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27918-27926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The projection map of FVIII also suggests an extended conformation of the membrane-bound LC, not allowing its N- and C-terminal parts to be in close proximity (Fig. 6 A). It should be mentioned in this respect that both terminal ends of FVIII LC encompass the binding sites for the FVIII carrier protein, von Willebrand factor, suggesting that both ends are in close proximity. It would be tempting to speculate, therefore, that binding of FVIII LC to the membrane surface is associated with a reorientation of the terminal parts to each other. The three-dimensional structure of FVIII at 15 Å resolution is currently under analysis and will allow a more precise fitting of the A and C domains models within the molecular contours. We are undertaking further studies to complete the information for the conformational changes during FVIII activation and formation of the FX-ase complex. We are most grateful to Dr. Bruno Villoutreix, University Hospital (Malmo, Sweden), for generously providing the coordinates of the FVIII C1 homology model; to Dr. J. Jaeger, Astbury Center of Structural Biology (University of Leeds, UK), for support with implementation of the latest MRC software on SGI machines and the software for plotting the final projection map; to Mr. P.

We recently reported that seven amino acids (547–553) overlapping the amino-terminal end of the rat GR ligand-binding domain are necessary for hsp90 binding, and consequently steroid binding. The role of a LXXLL motif at the COOH terminus of this sequence has now been analyzed by determining the properties of Leu to Ser mutations in full-length GR and glutathioneS-transferase chimeras. Surprisingly, these mutations decreased steroid binding capacity without altering receptor levels, steroid binding affinity, or hsp90 binding. Single mutations in the context of the full-length receptor did not affect the transcriptional activity but the double mutant (L550S/L553S) was virtually inactive. This biological inactivity was found to be due to an increased rate of steroid dissociation from the activated mutant complex. These results, coupled with those from trypsin digestion studies, suggest a model in which the GR ligand-binding domain is viewed as having a “hinged pocket,” with the hinge being in the region of the trypsin digestion site at Arg651. The pocket would normally be kept shut via the intramolecular interactions of the LXXLL motif at amino acids 550–554 acting as a hydrophobic clasp.

While the initially discovered members of this superfamily bind steroid and thyroid hormones, the majority of the family members still have no defined ligand (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar, 2Enmark E. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Those receptors that bind hormone are ligand activated transcription factors and are thus of interest both as models for the control of gene transcription and as mediators of hormone action. Steroid binding to a receptor requires both a properly folded protein and an intact ligand-binding domain (LBD).1 In general, the carboxyl-terminal ∼250 amino acids of receptors encodes the LBD, although the precise boundaries have rarely been defined. For rat glucocorticoid receptors (GR), the last 246 amino acids (positions 550–795) encompass the LBD (3Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Some receptors, such as the estrogen receptor, contain additional residues after the LBD, commonly called the F domain. However, these added amino acids do not appear to be required for ligand binding (4Pakdel F. Le Goff P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was initially thought that any mutation in the LBD was detrimental for steroid binding. Subsequent research, although, has revealed that many mutations are without effect (5Simons Jr., S.S. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 49-130Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and some increase the affinity and/or selectivity of receptors (6Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Benhamou B. Garcia T. Lerouge T. Vergezac A. Gofflo D. Bigogne C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Science. 1992; 255: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Defining the determinants of protein folding that are required for steroid binding has proven to be a difficult task. As with many protein domains, LBDs are transferable and retain their activity when attached to other proteins (8Giguere V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 9Mattioni T. Louvion J.F. Picard D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This led to the view that receptor LBDs were independent entities containing all of the information necessary for ligand binding. It was, therefore, surprising to find that the GR LBD was not stable as an isolated unit but required other, upstream sequences, which did not have to be those of GR, in order to obtain a stable protein (3Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Another crucial component for hormone binding to GRs is hsp90. In fact, the GR cannot bind hormone unless the receptor is already complexed with hsp90 (10Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp90 is an ubiquitous cellular protein that is part of a multiprotein complex with chaperone activity (12Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). When hsp90 dissociates from GRs, steroid binding is lost but can be regenerated by incubating immobilized GRs with reticulocyte lysate or with a five-protein, minimal chaperone system consisting of hsp90, hsp70, Hop, hsp40, and p23 (11Scherrer L.C.

Several sequences of the GR have been implicated in the binding of hsp90, but most are near the middle of the GR LBD (amino acids 568–671 of the rat GR (14Howard K.J. Holley S.J. Yamamoto K.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that a more amino-terminal sequence of 547–553, which lies at the border of the GR LBD, was essential for the binding of hsp90 (17Xu M.

This seven-amino sequence appeared to be specifically required, as a polyalanine spacer was incapable of maintaining hsp90 binding, and consequently steroid binding activity. No common sequence required for hsp90 binding has yet been discerned among the numerous transcription factors and proteins kinases with which hsp90 forms complexes (reviewed in Refs. 12Pratt W.B.

Indeed, three different regions of both the human GR (15Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Jibard N. Hollenberg S.M. Giguere V. Evans R.M. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol.

O'Malley B.W. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21165-21173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were sufficient to confer hsp90 binding. It is generally thought that, like other chaperones, hsp90 initially binds to exposed hydrophobic residues of partially denatured proteins and that this binding assists the protein in folding to its final, native conformation (20Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar, 21Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A.

However, for those proteins that undergo ATP-dependent assembly into stable heterocomplexes with hsp90, such as steroid receptors, this simple model is not sufficient. In addition to creating steroid-binding sites, hsp90 complexation with GRs also opens up the LBD to permit both the attack of thiol residues by a thiol-derivatizing agent (24Stancato L.F.

Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 64-93Google Scholar) that the hsp90-based chaperone machinery directs the partial unfolding of the LBD, thus opening the hydrophobic steroid binding cavity for access by steroid. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of amino acids 547–553 of rat GR in the binding of hsp90 and steroid. We noted that this seven-amino acid sequence contains an LXXLL motif, which has been found to mediate some protein-protein interactions (28Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 29Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several point mutations of this motif were, therefore, prepared to assess its function in the context of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) chimeras and full-length GRs. Both the kinetics and thermal stabilities of steroid and hsp90 binding were monitored along with the susceptibility of the receptors to protease digestion. These studies demonstrated that the seven amino acids 547–553 are important for two separable activities, hsp90 binding and steroid binding. A molecular model for some of the determinants of these two activities is presented that is based on the x-ray structure of the progesterone LBD (31Williams S.P. Sigler P.B.

Vent DNA polymerase and the restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. The GeneEditor in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System were from Promega. LipofectAMINE Reagent was obtained Life Technologies, Inc. Enzymatic manipulations were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Hydrofluor scintillation mixture was from National Diagnostics. TPCK-treated trypsin was obtained from Sigma and soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Calbiochem. The pSVLGR vector was a gift from Dr. Keith Yamamoto (34Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.-C. Gustafsson J.-A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Constructs obtained by the GeneEditor in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System were transformed into JM109 cells. All other constructs were transformed into DH5α cells. Construction of the GST520C and GST547C vectors has been previously described (17Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The GeneEditor in vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis System was used to create the GST520C and GST547C mutants. GST547C/L550S was created using the oligo 547CΔStyI (5′-TGCACCCCTACCTCAGTGTCACTGCTGGAG-3′), GST520C/L550S was created using the oligo L550S (5′-CTCACCCCTACCTCAGTGTCACTGCTGGAG-3′), GST520C/L553S was created using the oligo L553S (5′-ACCTTGGTGTCATCGCTGGAGGTGATT-3′), and GST520C/L550S/L553S was created using the oligo L550S/L553S (5′-CTCACCCCTACCTCAGTGTCATCGCTGGAGGTGATTGAA-3′). Mutants were confirmed by the Thermo Sequenase kit using the oligo-GG/Ala (5′-AGTA TTAGCATGGCCTTTG-3′). For the pSVLGR mutant series, a two-step PCR procedure was performed using the Vent DNA polymerase. The PCR primers are as follows: for pSVLGR/L550S, the 5′-end primer is 5′-ACCCCTACCTCAGTGTCACTGCTGGAGGTG-3′ and the 3′-end primer is 5′-CAGTGACACTGAGGTAGGGGTGAGCTGTGG-3′; for pSVLGR/L553S, the 5′-end primer is 5′-TTGCTGTCATCGCTGGAGGTGATTGAACCC-3′ and the 3′-end primer is 5′-CACCTCCAGCGATGACACCAAGGTAGGGGT-3′; for pSVLGR/L550S/L553S, the 5′-end prime is 5′-ACCCCTACCTCAGTGTCATCGCTGGAGGTGATTGAACCC-3′ and the 3′-end primer is 5′-CACCTCCAGCGATGACACTGAGGTAGGGGTGAGCTGTGG-3′. Two additional PCR oligos were used to create the BstBI cloning site at the 5′-end and the SapI cloning site at the 3′-end: oligo-BstBI, 5′-TCATTGATAAAATTCGAAGGAAAAACTGCC-3′, and oligo-SapI, 5′-TAACTCTTGGCTCTTCAGACCTTCCTTAGG-3′. These PCR products and the wild type pSVLGR vector were digested withBstBI and SapI, and the fragments containing the mutations were ligated into the BstBI/SapI linearized pSVLGR vector using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The entire PCR sequences for pSVLGR/L550S and pSVLGR/L550S/L553S were sequenced to confirm mutations using oligos LXXLL number 1 (5′-GCTGACATGTGGAAGCTGCAA-3′) and LXXLL number 2 (5′-TTGACGATGGCTTTTCCTAGC-3′) (sequencing performed by Bioserve, Laurel, MD). The pSVLGR/L553S PCR sequence was confirmed using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit with oligos LXXLL number 1, LXXLL number 2, PC-P1 (5′-ACAATAGTTCCTGCAGC-3′), and PC-P4 (5′-CACTGCTGCAATCACTTGAC-3′). Colony selection was carried out on LB plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin (Diagene Diagnostics, Inc.) and then grown in LB broth (Quality Biologicals, Inc.). Plasmid DNAs were extracted and purified by the JETstar purification system (GENOMED GmbH, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). Monolayer cultures of COS-7 and CV-1 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5 and 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, respectively. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with 10 μg/100-mm dish of cDNA plasmids for wild type and mutant pSVLGR and GST fusion proteins was used to overexpress the proteins, as described previously (35Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosols of transfected cells containing the steroid-free receptors were obtained by the lysis of cells at −80 °C and centrifugation at 15,000 × gas described previously (36Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [3H]Dex binding assays all contained 20 mm sodium molybdate. Experiments for Scatchard analysis were conducted at 0 °C for 18 h with 30% cytosol and 0.625–50 nm [3H]Dex ± 100-fold excess of nonradioactive Dex. Unbound [3H]Dex was removed with dextran-coated charcoal, and the supernatant was counted in Hydrofluor. The affinity (K d) was determined by plotting the ratio of bound steroid/free steroid versus bound steroid. For the temperature sensitivity assays, the 30% cytosol extracts were incubated with 50 nm [3H]Dex ± 100-fold excess nonradioactive Dex. Overexpressed receptor proteins were visualized following Western blot analysis (see below) using enhanced chemiluminescence. Gel shift bands were quantitated on a Macintosh Power G3 computer using the public domain program NIH Image 1.6 (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). An equal size region of the film without any bands was used to calculate the background. The intensity of the specific protein band was then determined by subtracting the background value from that of the receptor protein. To normalize the steroid binding per unit receptor protein, the specific disintegrations/min of [3H]steroid bound to each receptor were divided by the above calculated amount of receptor protein. Forty ng of wild type and mutant pSVLGR constructs, 1 μg of a GREtkLUC reporter, 200 ng of a Renilla pRLtkLUC reporter (Promega), and enough pBSK+ vector to bring total DNA concentration to 3 μg/60-mm dish, were transiently transfected into CV-1 cells. As recommended by the supplier, 10 μl of LipofectAMINE was combined with the 3 μg of DNA in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and added to the cells for 3 h. At the end of the transfection period, cells were washed, replenished with complete media, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then treated with EtOH ± Dex or Dex 21-mesylate (Dex-Mes) for an additional 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were harvested in 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (0.5 ml/dish, Promega). Luciferase activity was assayed using luciferin reagents in the Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit. The proteolytic fragments were generated by incubating 30% cytosol containing steroid-free receptor with 0 to 25 μg/ml trypsin (TPCK treated) for 1 h at 0 °C. A 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor was then added to prevent further proteolysis, and the samples were frozen at −80 °C. Aliquots (200 μl) of undiluted cytosol from transfected COS-7 cells were immunoadsorbed with 15% anti-GST antibody or nonimmune IgG and subsequently incubated with 8-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoadsorbed GST fusion proteins were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immune pellets an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 m NaCl, followed by one wash with 1 ml of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Immune pellets containing stripped fusion proteins were suspended in 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Dithiothreitol (1 μl) was added to each incubation to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 2 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) were added to all assays to yield a final assay volume of 56 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 5 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate), and GST fusions and hsp90 were assayed in each sample by Western blotting. A portion of each immune pellet was assayed for steroid binding by incubation overnight in 100 μl of TEGM buffer plus 4 mmdithiothreitol and 50 nm [3H]triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Samples were then washed twice with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously (13Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The steroid binding is expressed as counts/minute of [3H]TA bound/anti-GST immune pellet prepared from 100 μl of cytosol. Prior to immunoadsorption, the BuGR2 antibody was prebound to protein A-Sepharose pellets by incubating 65 μl of a 20% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C with 45 μl of antibody at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, followed by centrifugation and washing with Hepes buffer. The transfected wild type GR and L550S/L553S mutant GR that had been prebound with [3H]Dex ± 500-fold excess [1H]Dex were allowed to dissociate for various lengths of time and then adjusted to contain 20 mm molybdate to block further dissociation of hsp90. The receptors were then immunoadsorbed from 600 μl of diluted cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 13 μl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with BuGR2 antibody, followed by washing the immunopellets three times with 1 ml of TEGM. For assay of GST fusion proteins and associated hsp90, immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% β- mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 0.01% aP1 for fusion proteins, 1 μg/ml BUGR-2 for full-length GR, and 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated counter antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. For quantitative Western blotting, the GST/GR HBD fusion proteins, or hsp90, were excised from the immunoblots and counted for associated 125I-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (for GR) or anti-mouse (for hsp90) radioactivity. The determined ratio of hsp90 per unit of GR chimera was then expressed as a percent of that found for the GST520C control or, in the case of full-length GR, as a percent of the zero time control. Alternatively, full-length or chimeric GR that were overexpressed in COS-7 cells were usually separated on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as previously reported (26Modarress K.J. Opoku J. Xu M. Sarlis N.J. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23986-23994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Trypsinized receptors were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using 30% cytosol samples as described previously in detail (26Modarress K.J. Opoku J. Xu M. Sarlis N.J. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23986-23994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant pSVLGR receptors were detected using an anti-GR antibody, aP1 (1:10,000), whereas the wild type and mutant GST-GR fusion receptors were detected using an anti-GST antibody (1:2,000) or hGRα (1:5,000). Examination of the seven-amino acid sequence previously found to be required for hsp90 binding to GR (amino acids 547–553) (17Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) revealed the majority of an LXXLL sequence at the carboxyl end. Such sequences have recently been shown to be important for protein-protein interactions between steroid receptors and coactivators (28Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 29Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a double mutation of this motif (L553G/L554G) has been reported to eliminate the cell-free affinity labeling of GR by Dex-Mes and the biological activity of Dex in whole cells (37Milhon J. Kohli K. Stallcup M.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that this same LXXLL sequence might be a critical component for hsp90 binding to GR. To investigate this hypothesis, we prepared the Leu553 and/or Leu550 point mutants of full-length GR (from pSVLGR) and of GST chimeras containing the GR LBD plus an additional amino-terminal 3 (547–795 = 547C) or 30 (520–795 = 520C) amino acids (Fig. 1). The GST547C construct was selected in order to examine the effect of mutations in the context of a chimera with the minimum GR segment that both bound steroid and contained the sequence of 547–553 (17Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, trypsin digestions of steroid-free GST547C would not be expected to yield the characteristic 16-kDa fragment (3Xu M. Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21430-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to be able to look at the effect of these mutations on the tertiary structure of GR, the GST520C chimera was also selected, as proteolysis of this ligand-free chimera does afford the 16-kDa species (38Xu M. Modarress K.J. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 155: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This construct would further reveal any contributions of the hinge region in hsp90 binding to GR. In order to examine the biological consequences of these mutations, full-length GR mutants were prepared. Western blots indicated that each mutant was expressed at about same level as the wild type construct (Fig. 2, insets). Surprisingly, though, the level of [3H]steroid binding was not similarly constant. The single mutations decreased the amount of binding of the chimeras by about 75% while the double mutant displayed almost no binding (Fig. 2, A and B). In all cases, the effect of each mutation was muted in the context of the full-length receptor (Fig. 2 C). However, Scatchard analysis revealed that each mutation did not alter the affinity of those receptors that did bind steroid (Table I). This decrease in binding with maintenance of wild type affinity could be explained by a heterogeneity among the receptors, some of which were unable to bind steroid. Alternatively, the kinetics of binding could be very different among the mutant GRs. However, [3H]Dex binding to each of the GST520C chimeras was found to reach and maintain plateau values over 2–17 h at 0 °C (data not shown). Therefore, the decreased binding of the mutants GRs in Fig. 2 did not simply result from an insufficient time to reach maximal binding but appeared to reflect receptor heterogeneity.Table IK d values of mutated receptor constructsConstructsMutations present in receptorWild typeL550SL553SL550S/L553SGST547C5.2 ± 2.17.5 ± 4.0NDaND, not determined.NDGST520C4.2 ± 0.73.2 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.13.9 ± 2.1Full-length2.0 ± 0.71.7 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.5a ND, not determined.

Previously, we showed that murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C7 did not cross-react with human glycosphingolipids but identified the LOS epitope that is widely expressed in vivo and in vitro (Gulati, S., McQuillen, D. P., Mandrell, R. E., Jani, D. B., and Rice, P. A. (1996) J. Infect. Dis. 174, 1223–1237). In the present study, we analyzed the structure of gonococcal strain WG LOS containing the 2C7 epitope and investigated the structural requirements for expression of the epitope. We determined that the WG LOS components are Hep[1]-elongated forms of 15253 LOS that have a lactose on both Hep[1] and Hep[2] (Yamasaki, R., Kerwood, D. E., Schneider, H., Quinn, K. P., Griffiss, J. M., and Mandrell, R. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30345–30351). In addition, we found that expression of the 2C7 epitope within the LOS is blocked when the Hep[2]-lactose is elongated. Based on the structural data of these LOS and the results obtained from immunochemical analyses, we conclude the following: 1) mAb 2C7 requires both the 15253 OS minimum structure and theN-linked fatty acids in the lipoidal moiety for expression of the epitope; 2) mAb 2C7 binds to the LOS that elongates the lactose on Hep[1] of the 15253 OS, but not the one on Hep[2]; and 3) the 2C7 epitope is expressed on gonococcal LOS despite the presence of human carbohydrate epitopes such as a lactosamine or itsN-acetylgalactosaminylated (globo) form. Our study shows that the conserved epitope defined by mAb 2C7 could potentially be used as a safe site for the development of a vaccine candidate.

Different OS structures thus produced result in heterogeneous antigenic expression of LOS whose molecular masses vary in the range of 3–7 kDa (6Schneider H. Hale T.L. Zollinger W.D. Seid Jr., R.C. Hammack C.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 544-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to complex LOS expression, studies by us and others (8Mandrell R.E. Griffiss J.M. Macher B.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Yamasaki R. Bacon B.E. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10566-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that gonococci may mimic human glycolipids or may change serum sensitivity by modifying their LOS (15Nairn C.A. Cole J.A. Patel P.V. Parsons N.J. Fox J.E. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 3295-3306PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parsons N.J. Patel P.V. Tan E.L. Andrade J.R.C. Nairn C.A. Goldner M. Cole J.A.

Apicella M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1649-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 4.5-kDa LOS produced by strain F62 contains a lactoneotetraose moiety that is linked to the Hep[1] residue of the core trisaccharide as described above (11Yamasaki R. Bacon B.E. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10566-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This tetraose is the carbohydrate moiety also found in a human glycosphingolipid, paragloboside (8Mandrell R.E. Griffiss J.M. Macher B.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Yamasaki R. Bacon B.E. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10566-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that gonococci utilize exogenous cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid and sialylate their LOS (17Mandrell R.E. Lesse A.J. Sugai J.V. Shero M. Griffiss J.M. Cole J.A. Parsons N.J. Smith H. Morse S.A. Apicella M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1649-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As a result of sialylation, gonococci become resistant to complement-mediated killing (15Nairn C.A. Cole J.A. Patel P.V. Parsons N.J. Fox J.E. Smith H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 3295-3306PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parsons N.J. Patel P.V. Tan E.L. Andrade J.R.C. Nairn C.A. Goldner M. Cole J.A. Smith H. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, gonococci may evade human immune defenses by mimicking human carbohydrate epitopes or altering their serum sensitivities. Despite the frequency of antigenic heterogeneity of gonococcal LOS often accompanied by cross-reaction with human glycosphingolipids or gangliosides, our previous studies (18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) had indicated the possibility to overcome the potential problems inherent in the variability of gonococcal LOS in order to develop LOS-based vaccines. Our recent studies showed that murine mAbs, 3G9 and 2C7, do not cross-react with human glycosphingolipids or ganglioside (18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Of the epitopes defined by these mAbs, the 2C7 epitope is widely expressed in vivoand in vitro (7Mandrell R. Schneider H. Apicella M. Zollinger W. Rice P.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, mAb 2C7 is bactericidal and opsonic against gonococci converted to serum resistance by sialylation or strains that are otherwise intrinsically serum-resistant (18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further study with mAb 2C7 showed that its anti-idiotypic antibody elicited a bactericidal and opsonic immune response in experimental immunization (19Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Sharon J. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicated that mAb 2C7-defined epitope could potentially be utilized as a safe vaccine target. Both previous and very recent work have provided some insights on the mAb 2C7-defined epitope. First, mAb 2C7 did not bind to the lipid A moiety of the LOS but bound to its tyraminated OS, which suggested that the mAb recognizes the OS moiety of the LOS (18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Second, inert binding of the mAb to some LOS samples has shown that LOS lacking OS on the Hep[2] may not have the 2C7 epitope (18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Muhlecker W. Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Ram S. Rice P.A. Reinhold V.N. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, immunoblot analysis using truncated gonococcal LOS has suggested the importance of a lactose on Hep[2] for expression of 2C7 epitope (21Banerjee A. Wang R. Ulion S.N. Rice P.A. Gotschlich E.C. Stein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10872-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, those previous studies have not yet precisely confirmed whether mAb 2C7 recognizes gonococcal LOS of a specific OS elongation pattern. Neither the 2C7 epitope nor the structural requirements necessary for its expression have been defined. Among LOS recognized by the mAb 2C7 (7Mandrell R. Schneider H. Apicella M. Zollinger W. Rice P.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gulati S. McQuillen D.P. Mandrell R.E. Jani D.B. Rice P.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Banerjee A. Wang R. Ulion S.N. Rice P.A. Gotschlich E.C. Stein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10872-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), LOS produced by an isolate from disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), 15253, is the only one whose OS structure has been determined (13Yamasaki R. Kerwood D.E. Schneider H. Quinn K.P. Griffiss J.M. Mandrell R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30345-30351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Definition of LOS structure other than 15253 LOS is essential for us to determine not only the specific OS elongation pattern that mAb 2C7 recognizes but also the common epitope expressed among various gonococcal LOS. Therefore, in the present study, we studied the structures of LOS components produced by another DGI isolate, WG (22Rice P.A. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1982; 70: 157-167Google Scholar). In addition to the structural analysis, we investigated structural requirements for the binding of mAb 2C7 to several additional gonococcal LOS thereby characterizing the 2C7 epitope. We determined that the major WG LOS contains a Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc (lactoneotetraose) and a Galβ1–4Glc (lactose), respectively, on Hep[1] and Hep[2] of the GlcNAc-Hep[2]-Hep[1] trisaccharide core. mAb 2C7 recognizes the inner 15253 LOS present in WG LOS as a minimum structure and requiresN-linked fatty acids in the lipid A for maximum expression of its epitope. In addition, mAb 2C7 binds to LOS whose OS are elongated from the lactose on Hep[1] of the 15253 OS but not on Hep[2], and the 2C7 epitope is expressed on gonococcal LOS despite the presence of human carbohydrate epitopes such as lactosamine or itsN-acetylgalactosaminylated (globo) form. We used the following gonococcal LOS that have been prepared previously: F62 (11Yamasaki R. Bacon B.E. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M.

Partial deacylation with NaOH and dephosphorylation of LOS were done as described previously (10Yamasaki R. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Apicella M.A. Mol.

Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); LOS were treated in anhydrous hydrazine at room temperature (∼25 °C) for 2 h. The resulting LOS were further treated with 4 m KOH for 4 h at 120 °C for complete deacylation (25Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J.

Intact LOS and chemically and enzymatically modified LOS were separated with a Bio-Rad mini-PROTEAN 2 Cell (Bio-Rad), and blots were immunostained with subsequent treatments of mAbs, goat anti-mouse IgG, or IgM Abs (alkaline phosphatase conjugate) and Western BlueTM Stabilized Substrate (Promega Co.

Immunol. 1991; 28: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) by using anti-mouse IgG (alkaline phosphatase conjugate) and the substrate as described above. ELISA was done as follows: wells (Maxi Soap, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with LOS samples (up to 200 ng) were reacted sequentially with a primary antibody, a corresponding secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase conjugate), and then with a substrate solution (p-nitrophosphate). Absorbancies at 405 nm were measured with a Multiskan MS (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). After determining the concentration of mAb 2C7 for ∼50% binding to the intact 15253 LOS, the binding of the mAb to the LOS (100 ng) was measured in the presence of inhibitors (25–800 ng). The secondary antibodies used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of OS, composition, and methylation analyses were done as described in previous studies (10Yamasaki R. Nasholds W.

A major OS component (dephosphorylated) was obtained after gel chromatography (a Bio-Gel P-6 column, <400 mesh, 1.6 × 90 cm, 100 mmammonium acetate) and subsequent desalting with Bio-Gel P-2 chromatography. For gas chromatography-MS analysis, a JEOL AX505HA spectrometer was used. The following partially methylated alditol acetates were identified in the major WG OS component: 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-Me-Gal; 2,3,6-tri-O-Me-Glc; 2,4,6-tri-O-Me-Gal; 3,6-di-O-Me-GlcN(Me)Ac; 3,4,6-tri-O-Me-GlcN(Me)Ac; 2,6,7-tri-O-Me-Hep; and 4,6,7-tri-O-Me-Hep. The partially methylated alditol acetates gave identical fragmentation patterns to those as reported previously (11Yamasaki R. Bacon B.E. Nasholds W. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M.

Negative ESI (electrospray ionization) mass spectra of de-O-acylated WG LOS were obtained with a triple stage quadruple mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT TSQ 700) equipped with the ESI ion source (28Zhao M.

Samples were dissolved in water/acetonitrile = 1:1 (v/v) including 0.1% ammonia solution. The ESI mass spectrometric conditions are as follows: potential difference in the negative ion mode, 3 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; sample flow rate, 5 ml/min; sheath and auxiliary gas, nitrogen; sheath gas pressure, 60 pounds/square inch; collision gas, argon; collision energy, 30 eV; collision gas pressure, 0.4 Pa. The data were processed with a DEC Station 5000/120 computer. The FAB (fast atom bombardment)-mass spectra of oligosaccharides (OS) were obtained with the Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 mass spectrometer equipped with the FAB ion source (29Tamura J. Neumann K.W.

From a panel of LOS recognized by mAb 2C7, we selected a DGI isolate, WG. This strain produces two LOS components whose molecular weights are higher than 15253 LOS, and mAb 2C7 binds to both (Fig. 1). To obtain the molecular mass and preliminary composition of the WG LOS, we analyzed theO-de-acylated WG LOS by negative electrospray ion MS (ESI-MS). Treatment of the LOS with anhydrous hydrazine at room temperature (∼25 °C) for 2 h gave a water-soluble de-O-acylated LOS preparation. This ESI-MS analysis indicated that the major O-deacylated WG LOS has the following general structure: (Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-(de-O-acylated lipid A) with (PEA)0–2. This composition was indicated by the presence of three sets of triply and doubly charged ions of the LOS and singly charged ions of its OS (Fig. 2 and Table I); for example, the most abundant triply charged ion at m/z 1038.1 and a doubly charged ion atm/z 1558.1 correspond to the composition of (Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-PEA-(de-O-acylated lipid A). Its OS counterpart (singly charged) is seen in Fig. 2 as a dehydrated form at m/z 2163.7. The mass differences between the OS-de-O-acylated lipid A with (PEA)0–1 and their OS (Table I) confirmed that the intact LOS was de-O-acylated with the hydrazine treatment described above.Table IObserved and calculated molecular weights for the de-O-deacylated WG LOS and its OSObserved M rCalculatedM rProposed composition3240.9 (1079.3aTriply charged ion.,1619.1bDoubly charged ion.)3241.2 (1079.4aTriply charged ion.,1619.6bDoubly charged ion.)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-(PEA)2-(de-O-acylated lipid A)3118.2 (1038.1aTriply charged ion.,1558.1bDoubly charged ion.)3118.2 (1038.4aTriply charged ion.,1558.1bDoubly charged ion.)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-PEA-(de-O-acylated lipid A)2994.6 (997.2aTriply charged ion.,1496.3bDoubly charged ion.)2995.1 (997.4aTriply charged ion.,1496.6bDoubly charged ion.)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-(de-O-acylated lipid A)2775.4 (1386.7bDoubly charged ion.)2775.1 (1386.5bDoubly charged ion.)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDO-(de-O-acylated lipid A)2182.7 (2163.7cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)2181.7 (2162.7cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)2-PEA2059.4 (2040.4cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)2058.7 (2039.7cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-(KDO)21962.3 (1943.3cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)1961.6 (1942.6cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDO-PEA1839.3 (1820.3cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)1838.6 (1819.6cSingly charged ion (as a dehydrated form).)(Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDOa Triply charged ion.b Doubly charged ion.c Singly charged ion (as a dehydrated form). Open table in a new tab Out of singly charged ions, the mass of 1820.3 corresponding to (Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDO (Fig. 2) was also detected in ESI/MS-MS (data not shown) of the doubly charged ion at m/z 1496.3 of Fig. 2. This ESI/MS-MS analysis confirmed that the ion at m/z 1820.3 is due to the OS moiety. In addition, the peak at m/z 2146.8 in Fig. 2suggested the presence of the OS derived from a minor LOS component, an adduct of HexNAc to (Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDO-PEA, whose identity will be described later. The molecular compositions of the major WG LOS predicted with the above ESI-MS was also confirmed by FAB-MS and compositional analysis described below. FAB-MS analysis (Fig. 3) of a major WG OS (dephosphorylated), obtained after P-6 gel chromatography, indicated the presence of the ion at m/z 1837.9 and its dehydrated form (at m/z 1820.2). This molecular ion at m/z1837.9 corresponds to (Hex)5-(HexNAc)2-(Hep)2-KDO, and this result was consistent with the presence the singly charged ion atm/z 1820.3 in the ESI/MS analysis (Fig. 2 and Table I). The FAB-MS spectrum also indicated the following sequence ions together with their hydrated forms: 1675.7 (-Hex), 1472.6 (-Hex-HexNAc), 1310.6 (-Hex-HexNAc-Hex), and 1148.0 (-Hex-HexNAc-Hex-Hex). Compositional analysis of the major OS showed the molar ratio of Gal/Glc/GlcNAc/Hep/KDO is 2.8:2.1:1.7:1.8:1, which showed the HexNAc in the above sequence ions to be GlcNAc. The ESI-MS, FAB-MS, and the compositional analysis confirmed the molecular mass of the LOS and the composition of the OS moiety. As predicted from the MS and compositional results, the one-dimensional NMR analysis (Fig. 4) of the major WG OS (dephosphorylated) showed the presence of nine a"

Contrary to these hypotheses, we show that MARCKS peptide with actin-cross-linking activity has an extended structure in aqueous solution but assumes a more compact structure upon phosphorylation. We hypothesize that structural changes in the MARCKS peptide induced by phosphorylation create a dynamic structure that, on average, has only one actin-binding site. Moreover, independent of the state of phosphorylation, this peptide is monomeric rather than dimeric, implying that two distinct actin-binding sites are responsible for the actin-cross-linking activity of unphosphorylated MARCKS.

MARCKS is an acidic protein (pI 4.0) of 309 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass ranging from 65 to 85 kDa because of anomalous migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (9Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 31: 22310-22315Google Scholar) and contains three highly conserved domains (6Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 8Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first is a basic (pI 12.2) effector, phosphorylation site domain (PSD), which in rodents contains twelve lysines, one arginine, five phenylalanines, five serines, one glycine, and one leucine. Three of the serines (Ser152, Ser156, and Ser163) are phosphorylated by PKC (10Heemskerk F.M. Chen H.C. Huang F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Herget T. Oehrlein S.A. Pappin D.C. Rozengurt E. Parker P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The second conserved domain of MARCKS is the myristoylated amino-terminal domain that, in conjunction with the PSD, helps anchor the protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane (12Graff J.M. Gordon J.I. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1989; 246: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An important feature of the MARCKS protein is its ability to cycle between membrane and cytosolic fractions in a PKC phosphorylation-dependent manner (4Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,13Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In a nonphosphorylated state, MARCKS is tightly associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane independently of a cytosolic-face protein receptor (14George D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24879-24885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and translocates to the cytosol following PKC-mediated phosphorylation. The third conserved region is the MARCKS homology domain, which contains the splice junction for a single intron, and nothing is known regarding its function. In addition to its role in associating MARCKS with the plasma membrane, the phosphorylation site domain of the MARCKS protein serves as an important binding site for both filamentous (F)-actin and calmodulin. MARCKS both binds to and cross-links F-actin (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 15Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between MARCKS and F-actin occurs in the phosphorylation site domain, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MARCKS inhibits its capacity to cross-link F-actin while only diminishing its capacity to bind F-actin (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). By virtue of its action in cross-linking actin filaments at the plasma membrane, the MARCKS protein may play a significant role in translating extracellular signals to calcium/calmodulin-dependent and PKC-regulated intracellular events associated with actin plasticity and actin-plasma membrane interaction (16Wiederkehr A. Staple J. Caroni P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Watson D.G. Lenox R.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All of the known interactions involving MARCKS, membrane, calcium/calmodulin, and F-actin, involve the 25-amino acid PSD and are mediated by reversible PKC phosphorylation. Although frequently depicted as an α-helix (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 6Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), several reports on MARCKS-PSD propose that it has little, if any, well defined structure (9Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 31: 22310-22315Google Scholar, 19Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Matsubara M.

J. 1997; 25: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Many thermodynamic and kinetic studies of interactions between MARCKS and phospholipid membranes have led to the notion of an “myristoyl-electrostatic switch” (18McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and electron paramagnetic resonance studies have suggested that MARCKS-PSD binds to membranes in an extended conformation (19Qin Z. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies using circular dichroism (20Matsubara M. Yamauchi E. Hayashi N. Taniguchi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and NMR (21Porumb T. Crivici A. Blackshear P.J. Ikura M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) both concluded that MARCKS-PSD binds to calcium/calmodulin in a nonhelical structure, but electron paramagnetic resonance studies on the same system are consistent with MARCKS-PSD bound in an α-helical conformation (22Qin Z. Wertz S.L. Jacob J. Savino Y. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13272-13276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the conformational properties of MARCKS-PSD when bound to F-actin. Given the important role of phosphorylation in modulating the many interactions of MARCKS, we have examined the 25-amino acid MARCKS-PSD as a function of phosphorylation. NMR and molecular dynamics simulations both reveal significant conformational changes between the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides. Based on the conformational studies and actin cross-linking results, a new model is proposed in which MARCKS phosphorylation results in a large conformational change that, in turn, blocks one of two actin-binding sites and thus inhibits actin cross-linking. NMR data were collected with a Varian Unity 600 MHz at the University of Florida Center for Structural Biology and a Varian Unity Plus 720 MHz at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Peptides for all experiments were synthesized at Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. Samples containing between 1 and 5 mm peptide were prepared with 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 0.3 mm 3-trimethylsilyl (2,2,3,3-2H4) propionic acid for an internal chemical shift standard (0.0 ppm). Unless otherwise indicated, the pH (uncorrected for D2O) of each sample was adjusted to between 4.5 and 5.5 by using small volumes of concentrated HCl or KOH. Different experiments were collected with the salt concentration adjusted between 0 and 100 mm KCl. The temperature of the samples during data collection was either 15 or 20 °C. NOESY data with 300-ms mixing times were also collected at 4 °C for both peptides; at that temperature we found similar patterns of cross-peaks but more spectral overlap than from data collected at higher temperatures. We checked for aggregation by collecting one-dimensional spectra at 10-fold dilutions at several different values of pH, and we observed only very small changes in some of the chemical shifts of the amide peaks. Data were obtained with the transmitter centered on the H2O peak, which was reduced using presaturation or by excitation sculpting (23Callihan D. West J. Kumar S. Schweitzer B.I. Logan T.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proton spectral widths were between 10 and 13 ppm. Data were collected with 2048 or 4096 complex and 512 complex points in the acquisition and indirect dimensions, respectively. Two-dimensional TOCSY (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) data were collected using an MLEV-17 mixing sequence applied for 60 ms with an 8.8 kHz radio frequency field strength. NOESY (25Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) data were collected using mixing times between 100 and 300 ms. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was achieved by the method of States and co-workers (26States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Data were processed using NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) by first eliminating the residual water peak using spectral deconvolution followed by appodization with squared cosine functions, zero-filling to twice the original data size, Fourier transformation, and base-line correction. Data were sequentially assigned using standard methods (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) using NMRview (29Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Overlap of the one-dimensional spectra prevented a complete pH titration. Instead, we collected a series of TOCSY and NOESY data sets under identical conditions (100 mm KCl, 20 °C) except the pH, which was adjusted to the following values: 4.61, 5.65, 6.31, 6.88, 7.09, and 7.51. Rapid amide exchange prevented quantitative use of the data above pH 7.0. Analysis of data sets from adjacent values of pH allowed for unambiguous assignment of all residues. MARCKS peptide models were built using InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Energy minimization and dynamics simulations were done with Discover or Discover3 running on an Onyx2 16 processor computer (Silicon Graphics) in the University of Florida Brain Institute. The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide was built in an extended conformation, solvated with a 5 Å layer of explicit water molecules and energy minimized using the cvff forcefield. The nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide was then constructed from the phosphorylated peptide and simulated with no restraints. The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide was simulated twice, once with NMR distance restraints added as pseudo potentials to the forcefield and a second time with no restraints. The distance restraints were from grouping the NOESY cross-peaks from Fig. 2 into strong (<3.0 Å), medium (<4.0 Å), and weak (<5.0 Å) categories and adding these distances as simple harmonic potentials. All minimization and dynamics protocols included cross-terms, charges, and Morse potentials. Cut-off distances were between 10 and 30 Å. Following initial minimization, the peptide/water assemblies were subjected to 100 ps of dynamics at 298 K using 1 fs time steps; history files were stored every 100 fs. Structures from the dynamics trajectory were picked at 5-ps intervals and energy minimized using 1000 iterations of steepest descents (to < 100 kcal/mol × Å) followed by conjugate gradients to an energy derivative of less than 5 kcal/mol × Å. The water molecules created a very slowly converging energy minimum with little structural changes in the peptide at small derivatives. The peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis and diluted to 240 μm in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.1, or 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using absorption optics (collecting data at 258 nm) in a Beckman XLA centrifuge and analyzed as described previously (30Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 120-μl samples reached equilibrium in 48 h at 38,600 RPM at 20 °C. Densities were determined by table or pycnometry. Partial specific volumes (v̄) were calculated (31Kirschner M.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1900-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and compared with results obtained from simultaneous measurement of the sedimentation equilibrium gradient in 90% D2O and in H2O (32Edelstein S.J. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 306-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For sedimentation equilibrium studies including both actin and MARCKS, samples were prepared in 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaAz, 5.0 mm Tris, pH 7.9, with 12 μm actin and 6.0 μm MARCKS peptide. Equilibrium was achieved at 14,400 RPM after 72 h at 4 °C. The gradient was analyzed using a method of implicit constraints as described previously (30Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, at 290 nm the extinction coefficients of MARCKS peptides were negligible relative to that of actin, because the MARCKS peptides have no aromatic residues other than phenylalanine. The concentration gradient measured at 290 nm could therefore be assumed to directly reflect the sum of the concentration of all detectable actin species. Curve fitting was based on the theoretical molecular weights of actin or of actin in complex with MARCKS peptides at a stoichiometry of 1:1 and 2:1 actin:MARCKS. The species are assumed to be in chemical equilibrium at all radii, with dissociation constant K d describing the site-specific interaction between actin and either of the two postulated binding sites on MARCKS, that is, the binding sites were considered to be independent and equal. Final curve fitting was constrained by the initial concentrations of both actin and MARCKS, and the fitting parameters included only the concentrations of actin and MARCKS at a single radius and K d . Gel-filtered rabbit skeletal muscle actin was converted to Mg2+-actin, polymerized, and diluted to a final concentration of 7.8 μm in 2.0 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmCaCl2 (buffer F). These actin filaments were incubated with varying concentrations of MARCKS peptides for 15 min and then pelleted at 18,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with quantification of the actin band by densitometry. The amount of pelleted actin was calculated based on a G-actin control for which it was assumed that no actin pelleted. 90° light scattering assays were performed at 400 nm in quartz cuvettes at 22 °C. A 7.8 μm Mg2+-F-actin stock with varying concentrations of MARCKS peptides was prepared in buffer F as for the pelleting assay. Light scattering intensity increased for the first 15 min after mixing actin with peptide and then stabilized. The maximum increment in intensity was approximately 8-fold. The experiments for the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide were repeated in buffer F in which the salt concentration was substituted with either 0 or 100 mm NaCl. A helical wheel representation of MARCKS PSD suggests that it might form an α-helix (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 6Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used NMR to examine the solution conformations of both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the 25-amino acid MARCKS PSD. The amino acid sequence of the mouse MARCKS PSD is KKKKKRFS*FKKS*FKLSGFS*FKKSKK, where S* represents the serines that are phosphorylated. Fig. 1 shows the fingerprint region of TOCSY spectra (top panels) and the amide region of NOESY spectra (bottom panels) for both phosphorylated (left panels) and nonphosphorylated (right panels) MARCKS peptides. The backbone resonances of the phosphorylated peptide could be fully assigned, but because of overlap and a lack of any amide to amide NOEs, we were unable to fully assign the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide spectra. Several differences between the two peptides are apparent from the spectra in Fig. 1. First, the chemical shift dispersion in the amide region is greater for the phosphorylated than the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. The differences between the two are primarily a result of large changes in the phosphorylated serines. However, many peaks other than serines shift between the two samples, with the phosphorylated peptide shifts generally more downfield than for those from the nonphosphorylated peptide. The Hα resonances for G17 are well resolved in the phosphorylated peptide and significantly overlapped in the nonphosphorylated peptide, suggesting more structure in the phosphorylated than in the nonphosphorylated peptide around the glycine. Second, bulk water interacts to a much larger extent with backbone amides in the nonphosphorylated peptide than in the phosphorylated peptide. This difference in interaction is observed both in TOCSY and NOESY spectra collected without presaturation of water (23Callihan D. West J. Kumar S. Schweitzer B.I. Logan T.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The only significant interaction between water and the backbone amides in the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide is for the first observable resonance (K2). These results show that the phosphorylated peptide backbone amides are more protected from solvent than those in the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. We interpret this increased protection as representing more backbone intramolecular interactions in the phosphorylated than in the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. Third, the phosphorylated peptide yields a large number of relatively strong adjacent amide to amide NOE peaks, whereas the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide has absolutely no peaks in the same region. No longer range amide-to-amide peaks are present in the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide spectrum, but there are several Hα(i)-HN(i+2) cross-peaks (Fig. 2). There are no medium or long range NOE cross-peaks in the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide NOESY spectra. The patterns of NOEs seen in the phosphorylated peptide do not correspond to any regular secondary structure and are most consistent with a series of partial turns or “nascent helix” (33Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Wright P.E. Lerner R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Fourth, the phosphorylated peptide NOESY spectrum shows many more interactions between phenylalanine aromatic rings and backbone amide protons than the nonphosphorylated peptide spectrum. This suggests that the rings are more compact and in closer proximity to the backbone in the phosphorylated than in the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. All of the NOESY and TOCSY data (Fig. 2) suggest a significant population of compact or “turn-like” conformations for the phosphorylated peptide and completely extended or “random” conformations for the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. Although the two peptides have very different NMR spectra, neither shows convincing evidence for either an α (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) or 310 helix (28Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 34Miick S.M. Martinez G.V. Riori W.R. Todd A.P. Millhauser G.L. Nature. 1992; 359: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide has a net charge of +13. The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide with three phosphoserines has a pH-dependent net charge that varies between +13 (low pH) to +10 (intermediate pH) to +7 (high pH). Ionic interactions clearly play a major role in the biophysical properties of MARCKS PSD. Fig. 3 shows regions of TOCSY spectra for the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide at four different values of pH (4.61, 5.65, 6.31, and 6.88). Values of pH greater than 7 led to a severe reduction in amide intensities because of exchange. The groups in the phosphorylated peptide that titrate over this range of pH are the phosphoserines and the amino terminus. The largest pH-dependent shifts are the amide protons of the phosphoserines, which are all nearly 0.4 ppm downfield with increasing pH. Significantly smaller changes were recorded for the phosphoserine Hα or Hβ resonances; these side chain protons move less than 0.1 ppm over the pH range investigated. In addition to the phosphoserines, chemical shifts of several other amino acids are dependent upon pH. The largest of these shifts were observed in two of the three phenylalanines (Phe13 and Phe20) following the phosphoserines, the glycine (Gly17), and the amino terminus (Lys1). Several other residues showed small but significant pH-dependent shifts including the other phenylalanines (Phe7, Phe9, and Phe18), the nonphosphorylated serines (Ser16 and Ser23), and leucine (Leu15). To our surprise, all of the resonances in all of the lysine residues were constant with pH (except Hα of Lys1). The changes with pH are summarized in Fig. 2. Both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides have salt-dependent chemical shifts (data not shown). In both peptides, all the resonances shift upfield with increasing salt. Unlike the pH results, every amide resonance shifts with salt. The groups with the largest shifts are those that have a large pH dependence. The amino acids with no pH dependence show small (∼0.01 ppm) changes when going from low to 100 mm KCl. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides reveal dramatically different conformations. Fig. 4 shows families of energy minimized structures obtained at regular intervals from molecular dynamics trajectories. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” all of the simulations were done with explicit water and charges on the peptides. The nonphosphorylated peptide has 13 positive charges that lead to significant ionic repulsion. Thus, the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide family of conformers are fully extended. In contrast, the presence of three phosphates on the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide adds either 3 or 6 negative charges, depending on the pH. Most of the simulations were done with singly charged phosphates to match the intermediate pH values used in the NMR experiments. The negatively charged phosphates placed along the phosphorylated peptide act to transiently attract different positively charged lysines or arginine. The dynamics simulations reveal multiple positively charged groups taking turns interacting with a given phosphate. The result of the transient ionic interactions is to create a compact “cup-like” backbone structure from a series of turns held together through “lever arm” actions of the side chains. Fig. 5 shows the end-to-end distances of the phosphorylated peptide with NMR restraints, the phosphorylated peptide without NMR restraints, and the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide as a function of time in the MD trajectories.FIG. 5Distances between the α carbons of residue 1 and 25. End-to-end distances for the nonphosphorylated peptide (top values), the phosphorylated peptide with no NMR restraints (middle values), and the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide with NMR restraints (bottom values) are plotted against molecular dynamics simulation time. All structures started at the same phosphorylated MARCKS peptide-minimized conformation, but the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide rapidly elongated to its extended structure. The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide with no NMR restraints is similar to the one with restraints but is slightly less compact or cup-like. All simulations were done with explicit water at 298 K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The MD simulations described above on the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide included NMR NOESY distance restraints as pseudo-potentials, so it is not surprising that the computed structures account for the NMR data. Therefore, we repeated the simulations on the phosphorylated peptide without any NMR restraints and found similar results to the simulations with restraints (structures not shown). The equilibrium distribution of the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide in an analytical ultracentrifuge corresponded to that expected for a 3054-Da monomer with a partial specific volume (v̄) of 0.77 ml/g as calculated from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 6). The steeper gradient seen with the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide cannot be accounted for by its slightly greater molecular mass (3292 Da) but could indicate some extent of oligomerization or a difference in v̄. A comparison of the sedimentation gradient of the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide in H2O and D2O solutions suggested thatv̄ was 0.74 ml/g (Fig. 6, inset), with an identical result when v̄ was calculated from the peptide sequence after adjustment for phosphorylated amino acids. Using this value for v̄, the equilibrium gradient for the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide was also seen to be consistent with monomer. Results were similar, with no evidence for dimer or other oligomers, at both pH 6.1 (Fig. 6) and pH 7.0 (data not shown). In the presence of the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide, G-actin sediments in the analytical ultracentrifuge precisely as expected for a monomeric protein of 42 kDa. In the presence of the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide, the data no longer fit the theoretical curve for an actin monomer (Fig. 7, upper panel) but instead show evidence of aggregation. Repetition of the experiment with a second preparation of actin gave identical results. One explanation compatible with the observed degree of aggregation would be for the nonphosphorylated peptide to have two or more actin-binding sites on which it can cross-link actin. A model for the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide with two independent and equal actin-binding sites can be shown to adequately fit the data when the site-specific dissociation constant equals 17 μm. Other more complicated models are tenable but cannot be justified as superior to the fit achieved for this simple model of interaction. In a pelleting assay in 20 mm NaCl, the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide was able to induce pelleting of 7.8 μmF-actin at low concentrations, with 50% of the actin pelleted when the peptide concentration was 1.0 μm (Fig. 8 A). The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide also induces F-actin pelleting, but only at much higher concentrations, with nearly 50% of the F-actin pelleted at a peptide concentration of 7.0 μm. Under these conditions in the absence of MARCKS, less than 5% of the F-actin pelleted. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide efficiently cross-links actin filaments by binding to separate filaments with each of its two actin-binding sites. Pelleting by the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide implies that it can also cross-link actin filaments but with much lower affinity than the nonphosphorylated peptide. Cross-linking was not inhibited at very high concentrations of the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide, a result that could be explained if the dose response of the pelleting assay is not linear with respect to the extent of cross-linking, so that only a small fraction of residual cross-link was sufficient to pellet nearly all of the F-actin. Alternatively, saturation by ligand of both of two cross-linked filaments may not lead to loss of cross-linking if the peptide is able to bind to two distinct sites on actin. Data from light scattering were qualitatively similar to data from the pelleting assay. The nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide much more efficiently increased scattering intensity than the phosphorylated peptide both in maximal extent of increase and increase at comparable concentrations of peptides (Fig. 8 B). In separate assays, neither MARCKS peptide had any effect on either the elongation rate or steady-state F-actin levels for pyrene-labeled actin (data not shown). These results suggest that the scattering intensity is a measure of the extent of actin-filament cross-linking induced by MARCKS. Although the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide cross-links F-actin in 100 mm NaCl, the results showed a large dependence on salt concentration, with significantly decreased cross-linking at higher salt concentrations. Our NMR, sedimentation, cross-linking, and molecular dynamics data support the following conclusions. 1) The phosphorylated MARCKS peptide forms a more compact structure than the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide. The phosphorylated peptide differs from the nonphosphorylated peptide by the addition of phosphates to three serines. NMR data and molecular dynamics simulations both demonstrate that there are large conformational changes resulting from the phosphates. All data support fully extended structures for the nonphosphorylated peptide and a compact structure for the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide. The compactness is a result of transient interactions between the negatively charged phosphates and several different positively charged lysines or arginine. Although this “compactness” might be considered a “nascent helix” (33Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Wright P.E. Lerner R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we see no NOE interactions that would be fully consistent with an α-helix. 2) The nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide has two actin-binding sites. The observation that nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide cross-links actin (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that either it had one actin-binding site and forms dimers or that it has two actin-binding sites. Our sedimentation results conclusively show that the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide is monomeric in solution. This finding is not surprising considering the +13 charge on the peptide at neutral pH. We cannot rule out the possibility that the nonphosphorylated peptide dimerizes in the presence of actin filaments, but it seems unlikely considering the relatively uniform distribution of positive charges across the molecule. Aggregation of G-actin by the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide confirms the 2:1 actin:nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide binding stoichiometry. The apparent binding constant of 17 μm is consistent with the extent of dimerization but may have no bearing on actual affinity of MARCKS for F-actin, where the binding site may depend on conformational changes or intersubunit contacts that are specific to F-actin. All available evidence (based on co-localization) currently suggests that both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides have selective affinity for F-actin (6Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). 3) The nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide cross-links actin at much lower concentrations than the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide. Previous reports demonstrated that both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides bound to actin filaments but that only the nonphosphorylated peptide cross-linked actin (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Our actin cross-linking assay has shown that the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide does cross-link actin but only at 7-fold greater concentrations than the nonphosphorylated peptide. Moreover, our sedimentation results suggest little or no phosphorylated MARCKS peptide dimer in solution. At least two models for the modulation of actin cross-linking emerge from these studies. In both models, the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptides contain two actin-binding sites. In the absence of phosphates (the nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide), both actin-binding sites interact with actin filaments with relatively high affinity and thus cross-link two different filaments. In the first model, the addition of three phosphates leads to a molecule (the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide) that has one high affinity actin-binding site and a second site with roughly 7-fold lower affinity for actin because of ionic or steric interactions. In this model, the observed conformational changes are simply coincident to and not directly controlling the actin cross-linking. In the second model, the conformational changes in the phosphorylated MARCKS peptide, which arise from the addition of the three phosphates, mask one of the two actin-binding sites. This conformational masking is the direct result of the compactness of the molecule. Based in part on our observations that there appears to be no dominant phosphoserine-lysine salt bridge, the compact structures are transient and would expose the second actin-binding site roughly one-seventh of the time. In this model, the conformational changes provide the direct control of actin cross-linking. Why would it be important to regulate the cross-linking activity of MARCKS by phosphorylation? The presence of two-binding sites allows for F-actin to be cross-linked into a variety of specific structures. Neither the low speed pelleting nor light scattering assays specify whether nonphosphorylated MARCKS peptide cross-links F-actin into parallel bundles, orthogonal networks, or random aggregates of filaments. Previous studies using electron microscopic techniques have also not been conclusive, with published images showing examples of each of these types of structures (5Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Because nonphosphorylated MARCKS localizes to the plasma membrane, perhaps specifically to focal adhesions, it is reasonable to speculate that MARCKS regulates cytoskeletal-membrane interactions, either controlling membrane stability or providing a potential communication link between extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton. Several lines of evidence suggest that MARCKS may play an important role in neuroplastic events during brain development, in the adult animal during learning, and in the long term response to psychotropic drugs used in the treatment of manic-depressive illness (35Stumpo D.J.

A. 1998; 95: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In fact over the course of brain maturation, MARCKS expression decreases in the majority of brain regions but remains elevated in areas associated with a high level of plasticity including hippocampus and olfactory bulb (39McNamara R.K. Lenox R.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 379: 48-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40McNamara R.K. Lenox R.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 337-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The PKC-dependent interaction of the PSD region of MARCKS with the plasma membrane, calmodulin, and F-actin indicates that MARCKS is well positioned to modulate regional actin-membrane plasticity in response to specific patterns of PKC and calcium-calmodulin signaling during long term events requiring cytoskeletal remodeling in both the developing and adult brain. A better understanding of the biophysical properties of MARCKS in actin cross-linking will offer novel strategies for elucidating the mechanisms of signal-dependent plastic changes in cell systems.

We have previously demonstrated down-regulation of the collagen α2(I) gene, encoding one of the subunits of Type I collagen in an epithelial-like cell line from rat liver, K16 cells upon their conversion to a tumorigenic line, W8, after treatment with the carcinogen 2-N-(acetoxyacetyl)-aminofluorine (3Smith B.D. Niles R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The promoter-5′ region of the α2 gene was methylated in the nonexpressing W8 cells and not in the expressing K16 cells (5Smith B.D. Marsilio E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reporter gene expression downstream of the 218-bp1 promoter and the 54-bp 5′ region of the rat and human collagen α2(I) genes was inactivated by in vitro DNA methylation in transient transfection experiments, whereas an analogous expression plasmid with the SV40 early promoter/enhancer driving expression was not (6Guenette D.K. Ritzenthaler J.D. Foley J. Jackson J.D. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a minimal collagen α2(I) promoter containing the preinitiation region (−41 to +54) driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene was inactivated by DNA methylation (7Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The inhibition of reporter gene expression was attributable to CpG methylation, specifically of collagen α2(I) sequences. However, all the methylation sites were located in the first exon, not in the promoter. DNA methylation in the promoter and 5′ region of genes often correlates with decreased transcription of vertebrate genes, and many studies indicate that this methylation is often causally involved in down-regulation of gene expression (8Umezawa A.

In certain cases, methylation inhibits binding of positive transactivating factors. Alternatively, DNA methylation can induce the binding of the nonspecific methyl-sensitive proteins, such as MeCP1 or MeCP2, that bind to methylated cytosine regardless of surrounding bases and act as global repressors by condensing chromatin. In addition, a family of closely related proteins called methylated DNA-binding protein (MDBP) or regulatory factor for X box (RFX) 1–4 (15Huang L.H. Wang R. Gama-Sosa M.A. Shenoy S. Ehrlich M.

Methylation-dependent binding sites were located for this protein at the beginning of the human genes for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase; α-galactosidase A; human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A2, -A3, and -A25 antigens; and the apoferritin H gene (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the first two X-linked genes, DNA methylation may help down-regulate gene expression on the inactive X chromosome by increasing binding of MDBP at the three MDBP sites in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase promoter/5′ region (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The MDBP sites at the beginning of the first exon of the α-galactosidase A gene are at least partially methylated on the inactive X chromosome but completely unmethylated on the active X chromosome (21Samac S. Rice J.C. Ehrlich M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 541-544PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosine methylation-independent sites have been identified that contain T residues replacing 5-methylcysteine residues (22Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), can bind in a cytosine methylation-independent or -dependent fashion to their cognate sites, depending on the sequence of these sites. These constitutively expressed proteins can act as repressors or activators in a context-dependent fashion (28Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Katan-Khaykovich Y. Shaul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24504-24512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An activation domain containing a glutamine-rich region is found in the N-terminal half of RFX1, whereas a region with repressor activity overlaps the C-terminal dimerization domain. In our previous studies (7Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that methylation sites within the first exon, which inactivated the α2(I) collagen promoter, bind to a sequence-specific methylation-responsive protein. Also, there was decreased formation of a TATA binding complex on methylated DNA ligands in gel shift experiments. This report demonstrates that MDBP/RFX1 binds to the first 20 bases of the first exon. When this sequence, which matches the consensus sequence for MDBP at 10 out of 14 positions in the center of the oligonucleotide, is methylated at its one CpG dinucleotide pair or is mutated to TpG at this site, there is increased binding of MDBP/RFX and inhibition of collagen gene transcription. Therefore, MDBP/RFX protein is likely to contribute to down-regulation of collagen gene repression and might do so in response to increased methylation associated with oncogenic transformation. Rat skin fibroblasts cells (FR) (CRL-1213, American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1%l-glutamine. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially according to Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Extractions of protein from isolated nuclei were performed at higher salt conditions than normal using 500 mm NaCl or 420 mm NaCl rather than 350 mm NaCl in Buffer C. All buffers contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin (40 μg/ml), aprotinin (200 μg/ml), pepstatin A (40 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) as well as the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (1 mm). Protein concentration of the extracts was determined by the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Collagen sequences (Table I) or MDBP/RFX consensus sequences (Table II) withHindIII overhangs were synthesized (Oligo Etc. and Integrated DNA Technology) as complementary strands, annealed to make double stranded oligonucleotides and radiolabeled using the [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment to fill in theHindIII overhang. For the DNA mobility shift assay, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 90,000–100,000 cpm/200 fmol of labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and nuclear extract containing 4.5–5.0 μg of protein. Double-stranded annealed complementary oligonucleotides (Oligo Etc. and Integrated DNA Technology) were used as competitors (Tables I and II). Separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 4–5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with a standard Tris-borate electrophoresis buffer at 300 V in the cold (4 °C). Autoradiography was performed by overnight exposure to Kodak Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The intensities of the bands were quantified using Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). In the antibody experiment, the nuclear extract and antibodies were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature before the radiolabeled probe was added, followed by another 20 min incubation with the probe. The antibody (kindly supplied by Dr. W. Reith to Dr. M. Ehrlich) is a polyclonal antibody to recombinant RFX1 (31Herrero Sanchez C. Reith W. Silacci P. Mach B. Mol. Cell.

Open table in a new tab The RFX1 cDNA in the sense orientation in the pBK-RSV vector (Stratagene) was transcribed and translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega; TNT translation kit) following the manufacturer's protocol. The in vitro translated proteins were used in electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. Mutation at the +7 and at +23 sites (C to T) in the collagen α2(I) gene (all positions given relative to the transcription start site) were performed by site-directed mutagenesis based upon Kunkel's method (Muta-Gene phagemid mutagenesis kit, Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. The mutated constructs were then cloned into pH 20 (−220 to +54 of the collagen α2(I) fused to the luciferase coding sequence) atSmaI-HindIII sites. The DNA sequence of the mutated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) prior to their use in transfection and in vitro transcription assays. Plasmid DNA was transfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.) into rat fibroblasts 24 h after plating cells. Plasmids containing the wild type or mutated bp in −220 to +54 of collagen α2(I) promoter/5′ region driving expression of the luciferase coding sequence were co-transfected with a reference plasmid, pCMV-green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH) containing the CMV immediate early promoter driving expression of the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein. CMV-green fluorescent protein was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed under standard conditions (Luciferase kit; Promega Corp.). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and scraped with lysis reagent. The cells and solution were centrifuged at 12,000 × g to pellet the debris. The cell extract was mixed with the luciferase assay reagent, and light emission was measured in a scintillation counter. The luciferase activity was assayed in duplicate within the linear range of the instrument. Ten readings at 60-s intervals were averaged in each assay. Values were normalized to fluorescence of the green fluorescent protein. The reaction mixture forin vitro transcription contained 50–90 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of super-coiled template DNA (purified on a CsCl gradient), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mmMgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 600 μm of each of rNTP in a final volume of 25 μl. Reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 175 μl of stop solution, which contained 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 3 μg/ml tRNA, pH 5.2. After extraction of protein with phenol/chloroform, the RNA was precipitated by ethanol. To detect the newly synthesized transcript, antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a sequence in the luciferase gene was generated (Table I). The primer was end labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, hybridized to in vitrotranscription products and extended using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The primer-extended products were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 7 m urea. Transcription reaction and primer extension reactions always included an RNase inhibitor (RNase inhibitor protein, cloned human pancreatic RNase A lytic enzyme inhibitor, Ambion, Inc.). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. In our earlier study (7Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the −25 to +30 sequence of α2(I) promoter could bind sequence-specific nuclear proteins preferentially when CpGs were methylated. This sequence contains two CpG sites, at +7 and +23, respectively, relative to the transcription start site. In order to investigate which sites are important for the methylation responsiveness, a gel shift experiment was performed using the wild type and mutated probes (both unmethylated and methylated) with rat fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig. 1). The DNA fragment with a CpG to TpG transition at position +23 specifically complexed with proteins in the extract in a similar manner as the wild type DNA fragment. There was a 3-fold increase in binding when the CpG at position +7 was methylated whether or not the +23 site was mutated. This result suggests that the +23 CpG site is not important for the increased binding upon cytosine methylation. On the other hand, there was no difference in binding between unmethylated and methylated DNA fragments when the ligand had a CpG to TpG mutation at the +7 position, and only the +23 CpG was differentially methylated. This indicates that only the +7 site is important for increasing protein binding on methylated constructs. In addition, the amount of complex formation with the +7 mutated DNA fragment was approximately 3 times more than with the analogous wild type unmethylated fragment. Ten base pairs out of 14 in the CpG methylated sequence from position −1 to +13 of the collagen α2(I) 5′ region match the consensus sequence for the transcription regulatory protein MDBP/RFX (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the CpG of this sequence is in the same position as the CpG of several previously described methylation-dependent MDBP/RFX sites (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lastly, CpG to TpG transitions in the methylation-dependent sites have been shown to increase binding by MDBP/RFX in a similar fashion to cytosine methylation at these sites. Therefore, we suspected that the collagen α2(I) sequence in this region is an MDBP/RFX site. Four short oligonucleotides from different parts of the 55-bp α2(I) initiator region DNA fragment (position −25 to +30) initially were used as ligands in electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether there was methylation sensitive binding of a nuclear protein to these shorter probes. Nuclear extracts from rat skin fibroblasts were used in these assays with oligonucleotide duplexes containing α2(I) sequences −20 to +1, −14 to +6, +10 to +30, or −1 to +20 bordered by a HindIII site (AAGCTT) added to ends of both strands (see Table I). The sequence in the beginning of the first exon of the α2(I) gene containing the region homologous to MDBP/RFX was the only sequence that resulted in a methylation responsive formation of a specific complex when used as a radiolabeled ligand (data not shown). Two specific, slowly migrating DNA-protein complexes formed with the −1 to +20 oligonucleotide that migrated only slightly faster (commensurate with the small size of the ligand) than the methylation-responsive complexes formed from the longer −25 to +30 oligonucleotide. Furthermore, just as methylation increased the amount of this specific complex formation from the −25 to +30 oligonucleotide, methylation increased binding by the smaller −1 to +20 oligonucleotide 2.5–3-fold (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). This complex formation was specific, as it is competed by an excess of the identical unlabeled sequence (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7) but not a similar excess of other tested α2(I) sequences (−14 to +6, +10 to +30, and −20 to +1) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6 and 8). Competition for binding to methylated sequence (−1 to +20) probe increased when the specific competitor was methylated (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and7), whereas methylation of the +10 to 30 competitor did not visibly change the amount of labeled complex formation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 8). The ability of various other oligonucleotide duplexes to compete for complex formation with the methylated α2(I) probe was also tested (Fig. 3 A). Sequences unrelated to MDBP/RFX sites, namely mTAE (Fig. 3 A, lane 9; Table I) and a sequence in the α1(I) gene (Fig. 3 A, lane 8; Table I) did not compete for complex formation. In contrast, the known binding sites for MDBP/RFX sequences (Table II) competed at 50-fold molar excess over the labeled ligand (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–7). These include EP (a high affinity, cytosine methylation-independent MDBP/RFX binding site present in hepatitis B viral enhancer (29Katan-Khaykovich Y. Shaul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24504-24512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) Py1 (a similar binding site in polyomavirus enhancer B), and pB1 (an in vitro methylated cytosine methylation-dependent site in the plasmid pBR322 (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). In addition, two methylation-dependent human MDBP/RFX sites, the human α-galactosidase A site, close to the transcription start site (α-GalA, +49), and the human apoferritin H (hFer +202) site, as well as a cytosine methylation-independent site known as X-box in the MHC class II gene promoters, competed effectively for binding to the α2(I) site (29Katan-Khaykovich Y. Shaul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24504-24512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The complexes that formed on all of these MDBP/RFX sites co-migrated with the α2(I) promoter-protein complexes with the same rat fibroblast nuclear extract (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–7). In addition, the collagen sequence was as methylation sensitive under our conditions as pB1 and was more sensitive than α-GalA or hFer sequences (not shown). Use of antiserum specific for the RFX1 polypeptide of MDBP/RFX complex also indicated that the methylation-responsive protein recognizing the −1 to +20 sequence of the α2(I) gene is MDBP/RFX. Preincubating the reaction mixture for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with this antibody resulted in much slower migration of the protein-DNA complex formed between the nuclear protein and the α2(I) sequence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). The same supershift was obtained when the known MDBP/RFX-specific EP DNA sequence was used as the ligand (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). Presumably, the large size of the MDBP/RFX dimer complexed with the antibody, as well as with the DNA ligand, was responsible for these supershifted α2(I) or EP ligands not entering the gel. Further evidence for the identity of the protein binding in a sequence-specific and methylation-specific manner to the methylated −1 to +20 sequence from the α2(I) gene was provided in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro translated MDBP/RFX1 protein. This protein product formed a complex with the methylated −1 to +20 sequence that comigrated with a complex formed between the same ligand and rat fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2and 8). Because MDBP/RFX from nuclear extracts contains different related homodimers or heterodimers of related polypeptide chains and the RFX1 homodimer is the largest of these, it is not surprising that the main complex seen from the in vitrotranslation product corresponds to the slower moving of the two bands observed in binding reactions with the nuclear extract. We also tested the ability of RFX1 antiserum to supershift complex formed using thein vitro transcribed/translated MDBP/RFX1protein (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). The same supershift was seen as for the nuclear protein Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 6). Rabbit control antiserum did not bind to the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). To test for control of gene expression at this sequence in the beginning of the α2(I) gene, C to T mutations at +7 and/or +23 sites were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the α2(I) promoter-luciferase construct, pH 20, containing the −220 to +54 region of the promoter. These expression plasmids were transfected into rat fibroblast cells. The +7 mutation inhibited transcription to a greater extent (80 ± 2.6% (S.D.)) than did the +23 mutation (47 ± 3.8%) (Fig. 5 A). The same constructs were used in an in vitro transcription assay. The +7 mutation decreased the transcription by 56% but the +23 mutation decreased only 23% (Fig. 5 B) in a representative experiment repeated three times. Therefore, a CpG-to-TpG mutation at the +7 site, which increases the formation of specific protein complexes in vitro, also decreases transcription in vivo and in reaction mixtures containing a nuclear extract. This mutation had more of an effect on transcription than did an analogous mutation at position +23, which does not match the MDBP/RFX consensus sequences. One of the unusual characteristics of MDBP/RFX proteins is their behavior with respect to CpG-containing recognition sites. These sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins show increased binding to these sites in their CpG-methylated form. The sequence specificity of the binding site distinguishes these proteins from methylated DNA-binding proteins, such as MeCP1, MeCP2, DBP-m, and MDBP-2-H1 (22Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Khan R.

We demonstrated that the MDBP/RFX could bind to a sequence at the very beginning of the α2(I) gene first exon in the rodent and human genomes in a methylation-dependent manner. Similar methylation-responsive MDBP sites are present at the beginning of the human genes for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase; HLA-A2, -A3, -A25 antigens; and α-galactosidase A (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). MDBP/RFX also binds to many of its sites in a cytosine methylation-independent manner if 1–3 of the CpGs in the consensus sequence are replaced by TpG or TpA. There is a CpG site 7 base pairs downstream from the transcription start site of the α2(I) gene that is within the MDBP/RFX site. This CpG matches the central CpG of the MDBP/RFX consensus sequence (Fig. 2 A), which confers methylation-dependent binding on other methylation-responsive binding sites for this family of closely related proteins (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The location of this MDBP/RFX site in the α2(I) gene was defined by homology to many known MDBP/RFX sites, electrophoretic mobility shift assays with rat fibroblast nuclear extracts and with thein vitro transcription/translation product from an MDBP/RFX1 template, and supershift assays using specific antibody to MDBP/RFX1 (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4). When we replaced this unmethylated CpG within the MDBP/RFX site with a TpG, there was increased specific complex formation comparable to the increase seen upon methylation of this CpG dinucleotide pair (Fig. 1), just as has been observed with other methylation-dependent MDBP/RFX sites (19Zhang X.Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the next downstream CpG in this region of the α2(I) gene, namely, the CpG at position +23, was converted to a TpG, there was no effect on complex formation with MDBP/RFX proteins in a nuclear extract, as expected, because this dinucleotide is outside the MDBP/RFX site. A reporter containing the α2(I) promoter/5′ region gene driving expression of a luciferase gene was equivalently mutated at the CpG at position +7. The observed decrease in promoter activity in the TpG mutant in both transfection experiments in cultured rat fibroblast andin vitro transcription with fibroblast extracts may be due to increased binding of MDBP/RFX to the mutated sequence (Fig. 5). Although this mutation may also affect formation of the preinitiation complex for transcription in a manner independent of MDBP/RFX binding, a similar mutation in a more downstream methylation-dependent MDBP/RFX site (48 bp downstream of the major transcription start site) in the human α-galactosidase A also decreases gene expression in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, when that MDBP/RFX site was mutated to a yeast GAL4 binding site and yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain chimeras with mammalian transcription factors were present, a hybrid GAL4 DNA-binding domain-MDBP/RFX down-regulated reporter gene expression, whereas the intact GAL4 transcription factor and a hybrid GAL4 DNA-binding domain-VP16 activation domain up-regulated expression of the reporter gene. 2M. Ehrlich, manuscript in preparation. All of the homo- and heterodimeric members of the MDBP/RFX1–3 family of DNA-binding protein exhibit methylation-dependent binding to certain of their cognate sites (16Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, RFX5 is a more distant member of this family, which is involved in positive regulation of major histocompatibility type II genes and does not display methylation-dependent binding (17Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Yeast proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage are also present in this family (36Wu S.Y. McLeod M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1479-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). MDBP/RFX family members have very similar DNA binding domains but different N-terminal regions. RFX2–4 show appreciable tissue-specificity in their distribution, whereas RFX1 is present at similar levels in a variety of examined tissues (16Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RFX1 homodimer, a large protein with 979-amino acids per subunit, contains both transcription repression and activation domains, the ability of which to positively or negatively modulate transcription may vary depending upon the location of its cognate sites in a given gene region and the other proteins with which it interacts (28Katan Y. Agami R. Shaul Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Katan-Khaykovich Y. Shaul Y. J. Biol.

Positive regulation of transcription by MDBP/RFX has been demonstrated for the methylation-independent binding site in the EP sequence of the hepatitis B virus enhancer (38Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, one of us previously demonstrated that a low affinity methylation-independent binding site beginning at position +5 of the CMV IE transcription unit can down-regulate transcription when its binding by MDBP/RFX is increased by mutation (39Zhang X.Y.

MDBP/RFX interacts with c-Abl, greatly stimulating its autophosphorylation (47Agami R. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have preliminary data using antibody supershifting experiment suggesting that c-Abl protein is present in the complex formed with the collagen sequence. 3P. K. Sengupta and B. D. Smith, unpublished data. MDBP/RFX can also interact with at least one TAFII factor. 4M. Ehrlich, unpublished data. Furthermore, MDBP/RFX binding sites implicated in transcription control are sometimes located in the proximal promoter region (48Liu M. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15433-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or intron sequences (49Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M. Ichinose I. Zajac-Kaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as well as in DNA sequences immediately downstream of or spanning the transcription start site, as in the α2(I) sequence described in this report. In the proximal promoter of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), there is an MBDP/RFX binding site that overlaps with a cAMP response element-binding site (48Liu M. Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15433-15439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 50Lee B.H. Liu M. Mathews M.B. J.

Using mutation analysis in and surrounding the RFX binding site, it was demonstrated that binding of RFX protein inversely correlates with transcription activation of the promoter. Therefore, MDBP/RFX plays an inhibitory role along with the retinoblastoma-related tumor suppressor protein, p107, in inhibiting activation of the PCNA promoter activity. RFX also represses gene expression of c-Myc at a site in the first intron (26Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Wu K.Z. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6865-6869PubMed Google Scholar, 52Blake M. Niklinski J. Zajac-Kaye M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6060-6066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that MDBP/RFX behaves as transcriptional repressor in the context of methylated collagen α2(I) sequence. We have previously demonstrated that in a rat cell line that has lost expression of this gene, there is methylation in the promoter region and that treatment of this cell line with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine results in the gain of expression of this gene (43Smith K.J. Smith W.J. Hamilton T. Skelton H.G. Graham J.S. Okerberg C. Moeller R. Hackley Jr., B.E. Am. J. Dermatopathol. 1998; 20: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because abnormal hypermethylation of the 5′ region of tumor suppressor genes is so frequent in cancer and down-regulation of collagen gene expression has been proposed to contribute to carcinogenesis, abnormal methylation of the 5′ region of the α2(I) gene, including the MDBP/RFX site, might occur in cancers and play a role in down-regulation of the expression of this gene. Future genomic sequencing experiments will allow testing of this hypothesis and of the possibility that the RFX/MDBP is a transcriptional repressor involved in tissue-specific regulation of the collagen α2(I) gene transcription in response to naturally occurring differential methylation."

Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure proaerolysin is organized as a dimer in which the two monomers are arranged in an antiparallel fashion with the two NH2-terminal domains clasping each other in a crossover fashion (3Parker M.W.

Dimeric aerolysin was also observed in solution at high toxin concentrations (4van der Goot F.G. Ausio J. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15224-15232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mature aerolysin is then able to oligomerize by circular assembly of seven monomers (11Wilmsen H.U. Leonard K.R.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) which leads to the formation of a central channel in a manner similar to that which has been observed for other toxins as well as for GroEL, Trp RNA-binding attenuation protein, and the proteasome (for review, see Ref. 13Antson A. Dodson E. Dodson G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The aerolysin heptamer exposes hydrophobic surfaces (14van der Goot F.G. Wong K.R. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) which enable the complex to spontaneously insert into a lipid bilayer and form a channel (15Wilmsen H.U. Pattus F. Buckley J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Here we have analyzed the stability of both proaerolysin and the aerolysin heptamer. We show that the unfolding of proaerolysin occurs in at least two steps and is reversible under nonreducing conditions. The two disulfide bridges in the proaerolysin molecule greatly contribute to the overall stability of the protein. These studies moreover show that the NH2-terminal domain 1 of the toxin constitutes a separate folding domain and is the most stable part of the toxin. The second part of this work concerns the analysis of the effects of heptamerization on the stability of aerolysin. Urea (8m) had no effect on the structure of the complex. Partial unfolding, without disassembly of the complex, was, however, observed in GdnHCl2 (6 m). Again the disulfide bonds were found to significantly contribute to the overall stability. In order to identify regions of the protein involved in maintaining the oligomer assembled, limited proteolysis studies were performed. Results from NH2-terminal sequencing of the fragments indicated that domains 1 and 2 could be entirely removed and that domains 3 and 4 are crucial for the maintenance and the stability of the heptameric complex.DISCUSSIONIn the present work we have analyzed the stability of the pore-forming toxin aerolysin both in its precursor form and in its heptameric complex. Unfolding of the proaerolysin in urea was biphasic. The first phase could be attributed to the unfolding of the COOH-terminal elongated lobe (domains 2 to 4) of the proaerolysin molecule and the second to the unfolding of domain 1 (NH2-terminal domain) which was by far the most stable part of the protein. Both the large COOH-terminal domain and the NH2-terminal domain 1 were found to owe their stability in part to the presence of a disulfide bridge (Cys159-Cys164 and Cys19-Cys75, respectively). It was somewhat surprising to find that the Cys159-Cys164 (Fig. 1) had a role in stability since this bridge links two cysteines that are only 5 amino acids apart in the primary sequence. This bridge was also found to protect a surface exposed loop at the top of domain 2 from proteolysis.The stability of the toxin was dramatically enhanced upon heptamerization of aerolysin. Incubation for 24 h with 8m urea failed to disassemble the subunits and did not even affect the fluorescence of tryptophan residues indicating that they were still in a rigid environment. Also, incubation of the heptamer with 1% SDS for 3 h did not affect the tertiary structure as witnessed by near ultraviolet circular dichroism (not shown). Loosening of the structure, without separating the subunits, however, required a 24-h incubation with 4 m of the more potent chaotropic reagent GdnHCl. Such incredible stability is reminiscent of fibrillar protein aggregates which form upon self-assembly of prion protein or Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide (26Janek K. Behlke J. Zipper J. Fabian H.

Extremely high stability is also found in enzymes produced by extremophilic bacteria (29Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In many of these proteins, increased stability is reached by association of subunits (30Jaenicke R. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).To identify the regions of the protein that are responsible for maintaining the heptamer so tightly assembled, we established proteolysis conditions that would cleave the protein but not fully disassemble the complex. Not surprisingly, considering our observations on the very high stability of the complex, the heptamer was very insensitive to proteolysis. Nicking required either very high trypsin concentrations and several days of incubation or treatment at 70 °C with the engineered thermostable enzyme boilysin (23Van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that the resistance of the heptamer to proteolysis under physiological conditions would be an explanation for the inability of mammalian cells to recover after aerolysin treatment. We have indeed never seen recovery of aerolysin-treated cells in contrast to the situation reported for Staphylococcal α-toxin (31Walev I. Palmer M. Martin E. Jonas D. Weller U. Hohn B.H. Husmann M. Bhakdi S. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Vibrio cholerae El Tor cytolysin (32Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), two toxins that have modes of action very similar to that of aerolysin. In contrast to the aerolysin heptamer, the Staphylococcal α-toxin heptamer is heat labile and sensitive to proteases (33Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vecsey-Semjen B. Knapp S. Möllby R. van der Goot F.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4296-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and might therefore be degraded by cellular proteases after internalization of plasma membrane patches that contain the pore. This type of repair mechanism has indeed been proposed but remains to be demonstrated.The analysis of the fragments obtained after harsh proteolytic treatment showed that the truncated complexes contained residues ≈180 to 307 and 401 to 427 of aerolysin, which constitute domains 3 and 4 (Fig. 8, in dark gray). These results suggest that domain 1 and domain 2 could be excised from the heptamer without provoking complete disassembly of the complex. This indicates that domain 1 is not involved in maintaining the heptamer assembled, even though it is the most stable part of proaerolysin and appears to be crucial for dimerization at high toxin concentrations. Heptamerization, in contrast to dimerization, might therefore not occur through a domain-swapping interaction. Alternatively it could occur by a swapping mechanism involving different domains. The fact that domain 2, which is the largest domain in the protein (Figs. 1 and 8), could also be excised from the complex in addition to domain 1 is in agreement with the model of the aerolysin channel proposed by Parkeret al. (3Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). According to this model, domain 1 of one monomer interacts with domain 2 of the next monomer in the circular assembly. Therefore, upon removal of domain 1, domain 2 would no longer be involved in monomer-monomer contacts and could become accessible to proteases.FIG. 8Region in aerolysin involved in maintaining the heptamer assembled. Limited proteolysis studies suggest that two amino acid stretches, 180–307 and 401–427, which composed domains 3 and 4, are involved in the maintenance of the aerolysin heptamer. These amino acids have been underlined with a black bar on the figure. The two disulfide bonds are also indicated on the primary sequence of aerolysin. Domain 1, residues 1 to 82, areunboxed; domain 2, residues 83–178, 311–398 areboxed in gray; domain 3, residues 179–194, 224–274, 299–310, and 399–409 are boxed inblack; domain 4, 195–223, 275–298, 410–427 areboxed in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus domains 3 and 4, and more specifically residues 180 to 307 and 401–427, are sufficient to maintain the complex assembled and to confer SDS resistance since the truncated heptamers could be detected after SDS-PAGE. Domains 3 and 4 are exclusively composed of β-strands and random structure indicating that, as for amyloids, stable self-assembly of aerolysin involves β-sheet domains (26Janek K. Behlke J. Zipper J.

Self-association of β-sheet domains resulting in the formation of pathogenic protein aggregates is a characteristic feature of various medical disorders including Huntington's, Alzheimer, and Creutzfeld-Jacob's diseases (36Carrell R.W.

Further studies on the dissociation and reassociation mechanisms of aerolysin, which forms a smaller complex that is more amenable to biochemical and spectroscopical analyzes, are likely to contribute to understanding the aggregation processes of these pathogenic protein complexes.

Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that the resistance of the heptamer to proteolysis under physiological conditions would be an explanation for the inability of mammalian cells to recover after aerolysin treatment. We have indeed never seen recovery of aerolysin-treated cells in contrast to the situation reported for Staphylococcal α-toxin (31Walev I. Palmer M. Martin E. Jonas D. Weller U. Hohn B.H. Husmann M. Bhakdi S. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Vibrio cholerae El Tor cytolysin (32Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), two toxins that have modes of action very similar to that of aerolysin. In contrast to the aerolysin heptamer, the Staphylococcal α-toxin heptamer is heat labile and sensitive to proteases (33Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vecsey-Semjen B. Knapp S. Möllby R. van der Goot F.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4296-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and might therefore be degraded by cellular proteases after internalization of plasma membrane patches that contain the pore. This type of repair mechanism has indeed been proposed but remains to be demonstrated. The analysis of the fragments obtained after harsh proteolytic treatment showed that the truncated complexes contained residues ≈180 to 307 and 401 to 427 of aerolysin, which constitute domains 3 and 4 (Fig. 8, in dark gray). These results suggest that domain 1 and domain 2 could be excised from the heptamer without provoking complete disassembly of the complex. This indicates that domain 1 is not involved in maintaining the heptamer assembled, even though it is the most stable part of proaerolysin and appears to be crucial for dimerization at high toxin concentrations. Heptamerization, in contrast to dimerization, might therefore not occur through a domain-swapping interaction. Alternatively it could occur by a swapping mechanism involving different domains. The fact that domain 2, which is the largest domain in the protein (Figs. 1 and 8), could also be excised from the complex in addition to domain 1 is in agreement with the model of the aerolysin channel proposed by Parkeret al. (3Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). According to this model, domain 1 of one monomer interacts with domain 2 of the next monomer in the circular assembly. Therefore, upon removal of domain 1, domain 2 would no longer be involved in monomer-monomer contacts and could become accessible to proteases. Thus domains 3 and 4, and more specifically residues 180 to 307 and 401–427, are sufficient to maintain the complex assembled and to confer SDS resistance since the truncated heptamers could be detected after SDS-PAGE. Domains 3 and 4 are exclusively composed of β-strands and random structure indicating that, as for amyloids, stable self-assembly of aerolysin involves β-sheet domains (26Janek K. Behlke J. Zipper J.

Self-association of β-sheet domains resulting in the formation of pathogenic protein aggregates is a characteristic feature of various medical disorders including Huntington's, Alzheimer, and Creutzfeld-Jacob's diseases (36Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Further studies on the dissociation and reassociation mechanisms of aerolysin, which forms a smaller complex that is more amenable to biochemical and spectroscopical analyzes, are likely to contribute to understanding the aggregation processes of these pathogenic protein complexes.

Whenever DNA is damaged or incompletely replicated, cell cycle checkpoint proteins act to delay cell cycle progression until the aberrant DNA is repaired or replication is completed. Without this protective delay, cell division would occur in the presence of damaged or unreplicated DNA, which would result in genetic mutations or cell death (1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, therad1 +, rad3 +,rad9 +, rad17 +,rad26 +, and hus1 + genes are involved in DNA damage and replication checkpoints (3Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Similarly, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint is dependent on RAD9,RAD17, RAD24, MEC1/ESR1,RAD53, MEC3, and PDS1/ESP2(3Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The function and structure of many of these checkpoint genes share a high degree of conservation between fission and budding yeast, because some of them are orthologous. For example, the S. pombe rad1 + gene is structurally related to RAD17of S. cerevisiae (6Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); the S. pombe rad3 + gene is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase group and is a homologue of the S. cerevisiae RAD53gene (7Hoekstra M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); and the S. pombe rad17 + gene, which shares some sequence similarity with replication factor C (RF-C),1 is the homologue of the budding yeast RAD24 gene (8Griffiths D.J. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Moreover, human homologues of S. pombe rad1 +, rad9 +,rad17 +, and hus1 + have been identified as Hrad1, Hrad9,Hrad17, and Hhus1, respectively (9Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I.

Genetic data in yeast and recent biochemical studies in yeast and human suggest that an early step in the DNA damage checkpoint response may involve the activation of Rad3p/ATM/ATR and Chk1 kinases. Phosphorylation of Chk1 does not occur when checkpoint radgenes are inactive, placing chk1 downstream ofrad genes in the cascade of events (16Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Chk1 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc25c, and it is known that when phosphorylated on Ser216, Cdc25c is sequestered, and thus inhibited, by 14-3-3 (17Furnari B. Rhind N.

In the last few months, there have been three independent reports of the cloning of Hrad17, the human homologue of theRad17 gene from S. pombe (11Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P.

The HRad17 protein has a significant amino acid identity with S. pombeRad17p and has been demonstrated to interact physically with HRad1 but not with HRad9 (11Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18340-18346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that Hrad17 is highly expressed in human testis and tumor tissues (22Bao S. Chang M.S. Auclair D. Sun Y. Wang Y. Wong W.K. Zhang J. Liu Y. Qian X. Sutherland R. Magi-Galluzi C. Weisberg E. Cheng E.Y. Hao L. Sasaki H. Campbell M.S. Kraeft S.K. Loda M. Lo K.M. Chen L.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2023-2028PubMed Google Scholar), and Liet al. (23Li L. Peterson C.A. Kanter-Smoler G. Wei Y.F. Ramagli L.S. Sunnerhagen P. Siciliano M.J. Legerski R.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) confirmed the cell-cycle checkpoint functionality of Hrad17, using a complementation assay in S. pombe rad17 mutants. In the present work, we investigated the intracellular localization of HRad17, and we report that it predominantly localizes to the nucleolus. To further investigate the possible biological roles of Hrad17, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to identify potential HRad17 binding partners. We found that HRad17 interacts and colocalizes with NHP2L1, the human homologue of an essential S. cerevisiae nuclear protein, NHP2 (24Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. Yeast. 1991; 7: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, the localization of HRad17 was found to be sensitive to UV irradiation, as the protein then translocated out of the nucleoli and assumed a more diffuse nuclear distribution. These results suggest a functional link between HRad17 and NHP2L1 and implicate the nucleolus as an important site in the DNA damage checkpoint response. The entire open reading frame (ORF) of HRad17 was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers, 5′-CTGGATCCGCATGAATCAGGTAACAGACT-3′ and 5′-GAAGTCGACTATGTCCCATCACTCTCGT-3′. The PCR products were digested byBamHI and SalI and cloned into vector pAS-2 (CLONTECH, Palo Atlo, CA). The ORF sequence of human Chk1 was retrieved from the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF016582), amplified by PCR, and cloned into vector pACT-2 (CLONTECH). The nucleotide sequence of these constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. The human testis matchmaker cDNA library was purchased fromCLONTECH. The procedures for yeast two-hybrid screening and elimination of false positives were performed exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, six million yeast transformants were screened, and 20 positive clones were selected based on His3 and lacZ reporter gene expression. After cycloheximide counterselection and yeast mating to eliminate false positives, a total of six clones remained positive. Plasmids of these six positive clones were isolated from yeast strain CG1945 and transformed into Escherichia coli strain KC8. Automated sequencing allowed for the identification of two of these six clones as NHP2L1 and two others as KIP. We then proceeded with yeast cotransformation experiments to confirm the two-hybrid interaction. Hrad17 was cut from the pAS-2-Hrad17 construct by BamHI and SalI and then cloned into pQE32 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The ORF region of NHP2L1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen). For cloning NHP2L1 and KIP coding sequences in frame into vector pFLAG-CMV2 (Kodak, New Haven, CT), PCR was used to amplify the ORFs corresponding to each gene. The amplified fragments were cloned into the NotI andSalI sites of pFLAG-CMV2. The primers were as follows: for NHP2L1, 5′-TATGCGGCCGCGATGACTGAGGCTGATGTGAAT-3′ and 5′-GCGGTCGACTTAGACTAAGAGCCTTTCAAT-3′, and for KIP, 5′-AATGCGGCCGCGATGGGGGGCTCGGGCAGTCGC-3′ and 5′-TGCGTCGACTCACAGGACAATCTTAAAGGA-3′. The nucleotide sequence of these constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The pQE constructs were transformed into E. coli. strain M15 (pREP4). The expression of His tag fusion protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3–5 h. The bacterial pellets were sonicated in PBS with protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then lysed with 1% Triton X-100. The purification of His tag fusion proteins was carried out by His.Bind Quick columns (Novagen, Madison, WI). Monoclonal antibodies against HRad17 (31E9) were developed by immunizing mice with His6-HRad17 and screening the culture supernatants with recombinant HRad17 protein using ELISA. NHP2L1 polyclonal antiserum (R86) was raised in rabbits against two synthetic peptides derived from the amino acid sequences, KQLRKGANEATKTLNRG and SQLKQQIQSIQQSIERLLV from NHP2L1. The polyclonal antiserum was further purified by Affi-10 gel (Bio-Rad) column coupled with His-tagged NHP2L1. After extensive washing with 10 mmTris (pH 7.5) and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mmNaCl, the antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11) and dialyzed with PBS for two days. Human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) HeLa cell lysates were prepared from cultured cells grown to 75–90% confluence on 10-cm dishes. Following two washes with cold PBS, the cells were scraped and solubilized for 1 h in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmNaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and spun to collect cell extracts (supernatants). For immunoprecipitation assays, the whole cell extract was diluted with the same volume of double distilled H2O to reduce ionic strength interference. Antibodies were incubated with cell extract at 4 °C for 2 h. A protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose mixture (20 μl 1:1) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine hemoglobin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3), solubilized in SDS sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried milk, probed with anti-HRad17 antibody (1:500 dilution), and processed with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For cultures used in immunoprecipitation assays, HeLa cells were grown to approximately 60–80% confluence on 10-cm dishes. 20 μg of DNA in 40 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen) were added to the cells. For cultures used for indirect immunofluorescence detection experiments, HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, placed in 3-cm dishes, and transfected with 1–2 μg of DNA in 5 μl of Superfect reagent. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2–3 h, the DNA-Superfect complex was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 48 h after transfection, the cells were either fixed for microscopic analysis (immunofluorescence) or lysed, and cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min, washed in PBS, and incubated with polyclonal R86 antiserum or monoclonal 31E9 antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) were applied at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, DNA was labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and coverslips were mounted in antifade solution (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). For double immunofluorescence labeling, both primary or secondary antibodies were mixed and applied together. Confocal images were recorded using a LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and printed with the Fujix Pictrography 3000 color printer (Fujifilm, Japan) using Adobe PhotoShop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For immunogold labeling, HeLa cells were fixed for 30 min with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Zamboni fixative (2% paraformadehyde and 1:6 dilution of a saturated picric acid solution in 0.1 m PBS). Samples were then cryoprotected and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described (25Xu Y. Slayter H.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ultrathin cryosections were prepared and incubated with the primary antiserum for 30 min, followed by incubation for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG and gold conjugates of 10 nm gold particle size (10 μg/ml). Sections were thoroughly washed with PBS and stained for 2 min in 1% neutral uranyl acetate and then 2 min in 4% unbuffered uranyl acetate. Samples were mounted in a thin film of 1.25% methylcellulose (Fluka Chemical Co., Donkokomo, NY) and examined with a JEOL 100-cx transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA). UV doses were delivered with a single pulse using the UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Culture medium was removed prior to UV irradiation and replaced immediately after treatment. In most of these experiments, a dose of 40 J/m2 was used, and the cells were observed after an additional 2 h of culture. To address the subcellular distribution of HRad17, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HRad17 were generated. The mAb 31E9 was found to recognize a protein of 75 kDa by Western blotting of HeLa total cell lysates (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) and immunoprecipitation (lanes 2 and 3). This corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of HRad17. The two major bands below Hrad17 come from the IgG used for immunoprecipitation, as confirmed by an experiment where a control antibody (25G10) was used (not shown). The 31E9 antibody also recognizes a single 75-kDa band in extracts of insect cells expressing HRad17 (data not shown). Immunostaining analysis of HeLa cells with the 31E9 antibody showed that HRad17 localized to the nucleus, exhibiting a punctate pattern with concentration mostly in the nucleoli (Fig. 1 B). Using the yeast two-hybrid method with HRad17 as the bait protein, approximately six million human testis cDNA library transformants were screened, and a total of six colonies were found that wereHIS3 and lacZ positive. Two of them were identified by sequencing as NHP2L1, representing two different mRNA transcripts, 0.7 and 1.3 kilobases, as described previously by others (26Saito H. Fujiwara T. Shin S. Okui K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Another two colonies were identified asCIB/KIP (27Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction between KIP/NHP2L1 and HRad17 was further confirmed by cotransformation of HRad17 with NHP2L1 and KIP into yeast strain CG1945. In addition, pACT-2-PCNA and pACT-2-Chk1 were constructed as controls. The result showed that NHP2L1 and KIP can specifically interact with HRad17 using the yeast two-hybrid method (Fig. 2 A). To investigate whether NHP2L1 and KIP interact with HRad17 in mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. HeLa cells were transfected with N-terminal FLAG-tagged NHP2L1 or KIP. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either 31E9 or anti-FLAG mAbs and analyzed by Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with the 31E9 anti-HRad17 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody revealed Hrad17 and NHP2L1 in the same immunocomplex (Fig. 2 C). The opposite experiment, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with 31E9, also showed an association between HRad17 and NHP2L1 (Fig. 2 D). As was the case for Fig. 1, the two major bands seen in Fig. 2 (C and D) come from the IgG used for immunoprecipitation, as confirmed by a set of experiments where lysates were substituted for lysis buffer alone (not shown). These results demonstrate that HRad17 and NHP2L1 can interact in HeLa cells. However, we were unable to detect co-immunoprecipitation of HRad17 and KIP (Fig. 2, C and D). Although NHP2 shares some similarity withNHP2L1, a search of the GenBankTM data base revealed an open reading frame from S. cerevisiae even more closely related to NHP2L1. S. cerevisiae NHP2 and human NHP2L1 have only 33% identity (Fig. 3), but this novel S. cerevisiae ORF (GenBankTMaccession number S15037) is 69% identical to human NHP2L1. Therefore, the homology of NHP2L1 to this new gene is likely to be much more relevant than its homology to NHP2. Similarly, we found a C. elegans sequence (Swiss-Prot number Q21568) that is 77% identical to NHP2L1, suggesting that this is a highly conserved protein. Because HRad17 and NHP2L1 could interact in HeLa cells, we set out to examine whether NHP2L1 localized in the nucleolus. First, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged NHP2L1. Immunofluorescent labeling with the anti-FLAG antibody showed that NHP2L1 indeed located to the nucleoli (Fig. 4 A). Second, a GFP-NHP2L1 fusion construct was made to transfected into HeLa cells. Again, the NHP2L1 green signal was found to reside in the nucleoli (data not shown). Third, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum, R86, was raised against NHP2L1 using two NHP2L1 synthetic peptides, and an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was prepared. The affinity-purified antibody specifically recognized one band in the nuclear preparation of HeLa cells, whose size corresponds to that of NHP2L1 (Fig. 4 E). Staining of HeLa cells with this affinity-purified antibody predominantly localized to the nucleoli, with only fainter, punctate labeling in other nuclear regions (Fig. 4 B). Control experiments using preimmunized rabbit serum and synthetic peptides for immunocompetition did not show a nucleolar signal (Fig. 4, Cand D). These results demonstrate that NHP2L1 is a nucleolar protein. To more precisely determine where HRad17 and NHP2L1 resided within the nucleolus, immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections prepared from HeLa cells was performed. The anti-HRad17 monoclonal antibody 31E9 was incompatible with our electron microscopy fixation procedures. However, immunogold labeling with polyclonal anti-NHP2L1 antiserum R86 showed that NHP2L1 is largely concentrated in the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus (Fig. 5). No signal was found in the same region when preimmunized serum was used. To test whether HRad17 and NHP2L1 colocalized in the nucleolus, double staining experiments were performed. Using simultaneous labeling of HeLa cells with anti-HRad17 and anti-NHP2L1 antibodies followed by rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, large overlapping areas of staining could be visualized in the nucleoli. These are shown inyellow in the superimposed confocal images (Fig. 6). To investigate whether the localization of HRad17 may be responsive to DNA damage, HeLa cells were irradiated with UV light (40 J/m 2M.-S. Chang, H. Sasaki, M. S. Campbell, S.-K. Kraeft, R. Sutherland, C.-Y. Yang, Y. Liu, D. Auclair, L. Hao, H. Sonoda, L. H. Ferland, and L. B. Chen, unpublished observations. ) and cultured for another 2 h. Interestingly, HRad17 staining was no longer seen in the nucleoli, although the nucleolar structures could still be detected by phase contrast microscopy. Instead, we observed only the punctate nuclear labeling pattern after UV treatment (Fig. 7 B). The total amount of HRad17 protein appeared unchanged (Fig. 7 A), however, suggesting that the disappearance of HRad17 nucleolar labeling was caused by protein redistribution rather than degradation. This effect was also observed with lower UV doses, but complete disappearance of Hrad17 nucleolar labeling occurred only after longer post-irradiation incubation periods (e.g. 16 h at 20 J/m2). In control experiments, MPP10, a human U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein component (29Westendorf J.M. Konstantinov K.N. Wormsley S. Shu M.D. Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Klier F.G. Gerace L. Baserga S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) still localized to the nucleolus after UV irradiation (Fig. 7, C and D). Finally, redistribution of HRad17 was also be observed when the cells were treated with methyl methanesulfonate, mitomycin C, adriamycin, or a combination of γ irradiation andcis-platinum, 2M.-S. Chang, H. Sasaki, M. S. Campbell, S.-K. Kraeft, R. Sutherland, C.-Y. Yang, Y. Liu, D. Auclair, L. Hao, H. Sonoda, L. H. Ferland, and L. B. Chen, unpublished observations.suggesting that this translocation of HRad17 out of the nucleolus indeed accompanies DNA damage. In contrast, the localization of NHP2L1 remained nucleolar when these DNA damage stimuli were used (data not shown). We recently isolated an Hrad17 cDNA clone on the basis of its high levels of expression in human testis and tumor tissues (22Bao S. Chang M.S. Auclair D. Sun Y. Wang Y. Wong W.K. Zhang J. Liu Y. Qian X. Sutherland R. Magi-Galluzi C. Weisberg E. Cheng E.Y. Hao L. Sasaki H. Campbell M.S. Kraeft S.K. Loda M. Lo K.M. Chen L.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2023-2028PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we used the yeast two-hybrid method to identify interacting proteins. Our screen revealed two HRad17 interacting proteins, NHP2L1 and KIP. KIP is related to the phosphatase calcineurin B and was reported to bind to DNA-dependent protein kinase (28Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is a relative of Rad3p/ATM/ATR kinases, with a C-terminal domain homologous to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and is required for V(D)J rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes, recombination, and repair of radiation-induced double-stranded breaks (30Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Therefore, KIP may participate in the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair via the regulation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes (28Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although HRad17 and KIP could clearly interact within the confines of the yeast two-hybrid system, we could not detect such an association in human cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Although this does not rule out that anin vivo interaction may occur in human cells, we concentrated our efforts on the other Hrad17-binding protein, NHP2L1. NHP2L1 is a putative human homologue of the NHP2gene in S. cerevisiae (26Saito H. Fujiwara T. Shin S. Okui K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NHP2 is related to the high mobility group (HMG) proteins based on the contents of basic and acidic amino acids, and is essential in yeast (24Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. Yeast. 1991; 7: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Typically, HMG proteins have a molecular mass that is <30 kDa and are highly charged. HMG domains can bind to a variety of non-B-DNA structures, such as B-Z DNA junction and platinated DNA (31Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 32Baxevanis A.D. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An RNA binding motif that was hypothesized to deliver additional activity to the ribosome was also found in NHP2 (33Koonin E.V. Bork P. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2166-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). No obvious HMG domain or RNA-binding motif can be identified in human NHP2L1 protein. Two other homologues of humanNHP2L1 were identified in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae (Fig. 3). To assess the importance of the new yeastNHP2L1, we used the single step method (34Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) to create a null mutant of NHP2L1 in S. cerevisiae. After screening more than 200 transformants containing HIS3 orTRP1 marker genes, however, we were unable to obtain a null mutant of NHP2L1 in S. cerevisiae,2 suggesting that NHP2L1 may be an essential gene in yeast. HRad17 and NHP2L1 were found to localize to the nucleolus. The nucleolus is the site of rDNA transcription, processing of rDNA transcripts, and formation of preribosomal particles (35Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). It can be divided into three compartments, the fibrillar centers (FCs), the dense fibrillar component (DFC), and the granular component. Early work showed that the FC is a reservoir for rDNA and RNA polymerase I (36Thiry M. Thiry-Blaise L. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 235-243PubMed Google Scholar,37Scheer U. Rose K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DFC is thought to be the likely site of rRNA transcription, because nascent Br-UTP-labeled rRNA was detected at the boundary of FC and DFC (38Dundr M. Raska I. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Hozak P. Cook P.R. Schofer C. Mosgoller W. Wachtler F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 639-648PubMed Google Scholar). However, another line of evidence attributed the site of rRNA transcription to the FC region (40Thiry M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). Later rRNA processing and preribosome assembly take place in the granular component region (35Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of NHP2L1 showed that it resides primarily in the DFC region of nucleolus (Fig. 4), suggesting that the function of NHP2L1 may be related to rRNA transcription or processing. We were unable to determine the precise location of Hrad17 within the nucleolus. However, its localization in the nucleolus suggests it may play a role in one or more nucleolar processes. Recently, it has been reported that nucleolar function may be involved in the aging process. In aging S. cerevisiae cells, the Sir complex, consisting of Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p, is found to relocalize from the telomere to the nucleolus, and the number of the extrachromosomal rDNA circles is dramatically increased (41Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2449-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 42Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. Guarente L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 44Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L. Science. 1997; 277: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In humans, the Werner syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature aging. The Werner syndrome protein, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase, was found to localize within the nucleolus in human cells (45Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6887-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The S. pombe Rad17p protein is required for DNA damage and replication checkpoints. If HRad17 plays a similar checkpoint function, its localization raises the possibility of a heretofore unsuspected role for the nucleolus in the DNA damage response. DNA damage induced by UV light has been well studied, and a variety of DNA repair mechanisms are triggered to restore the genomic integrity in most organisms (46Park M.S. Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H. Coulon C.H. Strniste G.F. Marrone B.L. MacInnes M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8368-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the rapidity of the cellular response to genome damage one would expect that both the damage sensing mechanisms and the immediate downstream elements of the signal transduction pathway would be constitutively present within the nucleus. Indeed, both ATM and Hrad1, two human proteins with known cell cycle checkpoint functionalities (7Hoekstra M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 47Freire R. Murguia J.R. Tarsounas M. Lowndes N.F. Moens P.B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2560-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), display constant protein levels after such DNA damaging stresses as UV or γ irradiation or treatment with the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (47Freire R. Murguia J.R. Tarsounas M. Lowndes N.F. Moens P.B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2560-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 48Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadanandan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our finding of a stable level of Hrad17 protein upon UV irradiation fits well with these observations and suggests that perhaps the entire apparatus of DNA damage sensing and repair is constitutively present in the nucleus, circumventing the need for time-consuming protein synthesis in the response to DNA damage. However, ATM and Hrad1 display punctate nuclear labeling patterns excluding nucleoli in the basal state, and this pattern did not change when the cells were treated with DNA damaging agents (49Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Zhang N. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).2 This contrasts with the observations reported here of a strong Hrad17 staining in the nucleoli, in addition to fainter, punctate nuclear labeling. Most striking is the disappearance of Hrad17 nucleolar labeling following DNA damage, apparently because of a redistribution of Hrad17 protein to its extranucleolar pool. The significance of this redistribution remains to be determined, but it may be noteworthy that other proteins involved in DNA repair have been shown to redistribute in response to UV irradiation, including theXeroderma pigmentosum type G protein and BRCA1 (46Park M.S. Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H. Coulon C.H. Strniste G.F. Marrone B.L. MacInnes M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8368-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 50Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). One plausible function of HRad17 in the cell cycle checkpoint process is suggested by its similarity to RF-C components. Human RF-C is a complex composed of five proteins of molecular masses 36, 37, 38, 40, and 140 kDa. During DNA replication, the RF-C complex recognizes primed DNA at the 3′-OH of the pre-Okazaki fragment and recruits trimeric PCNA molecules onto DNA in the presence of ATP. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by RF-C is required for polymerase δ to join the complex and initiate chain elongation (51Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, HRad17 may interact with the RF-C complex and interfere with its replication activity, causing cell cycle arrest. In fact, we have found HRad17 and RFC140 in the same immunocomplex generated with Hrad17 antibody 31E9 and RFC140 monoclonal antibodies from Dr. Bruce Stillman, Cold Spring Harbor.2 In summary, we characterized the nuclear localization of the putative checkpoint protein Hrad17 as an overall dotted pattern with prominent staining in the nucleoli. The nucleolar portion of Hrad17 redistributed upon treatment with DNA damaging agents indicating a possible role of this organelle and of Hrad17 in the DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways.

However, the biological significance of LPS deacylation during infection of the mammalian host is uncertain, particularly because the ability of acyloxyacyl hydrolase, the leukocyte enzyme that deacylates purified LPS, to attack LPS residing in the bacterial cell envelope has not been established. We recently showed that the cellular and extracellular components of a rabbit sterile inflammatory exudate are capable of extensive and selective removal of secondary acyl chains from purified LPS. We now report that LPS as a constituent of the bacterial envelope is also subject to deacylation in the same inflammatory setting. Using Escherichia coli LCD25, a strain that exclusively incorporates radiolabeled acetate into fatty acids, we quantitated LPS deacylation as the loss of radiolabeled secondary (laurate and myristate) and primary fatty acids (3-hydroxymyristate) from the LPS backbone. Isolated mononuclear cells and neutrophils removed 50% and 20–30%, respectively, of the secondary acyl chains of the LPS of ingested whole bacteria. When bacteria were killed extracellularly during incubation with ascitic fluid, no LPS deacylation occurred. In this setting, the addition of neutrophils had no effect, but addition of mononuclear cells resulted in removal of >40% of the secondary acyl chains by 20 h. Deacylation of LPS was always restricted to the secondary acyl chains. Thus, in an inflammatory exudate, primarily in mononuclear phagocytes, the LPS in whole bacteria undergoes substantial and selective acyloxyacyl hydrolase-like deacylation, both after phagocytosis of intact bacteria and after uptake of LPS shed from extracellularly killed bacteria. This study demonstrates for the first time that the destruction of Gram-negative bacteria by a mammalian host is not restricted to degradation of phospholipids, protein, and RNA, but also includes extensive deacylation of the envelope LPS.

Underacylated and underphosphorylated biosynthetic precursors and chemically synthesized analogs of lipid A (the endotoxic part of LPS) possess greatly diminished endotoxic activity and can act as antagonists in human cell bioassays (1Takada H. Kotani S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 16: 477-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Erwin A.L. Munford R.S. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 405-434Google Scholar). Mammalian enzyme systems capable of removing acyl and phosphate groups from lipid A may therefore play an important role in host defense against Gram-negative bacteria and their LPS. Thus far, only one mammalian enzyme, acyloxyacyl hydrolase, has been shown to deacylate LPS (3Hall C.L. Munford R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Munford R.S. Hall C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15613-15619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that both the cells and extracellular fluid of a sterile inflammatory exudate actively deacylate purified LPS ex vivo in an acyloxyacyl hydrolase-like fashion (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been much more difficult to analyze LPS breakdown products when the LPS is presented in intact bacteria, because methods for selectively labeling the acyl chains of LPS during their biosynthesis do not exist and because the fatty acids released from LPS by leukocytes are rapidly incorporated into cellular lipids (6Patriarca P. Beckerdite S. Pettis P. Elsbach P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a result, it is still unknown whether the mammalian host is also capable of degrading and detoxifying LPS in its natural setting, the bacterial outer membrane. This is especially important because whole bacteria can signal mammalian host cells with greater potency than isolated LPS (7Katz S.S. Chen K. Chen S. Doerfler M.E. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because introduction of purified LPS and live bacteria into animals yield different cellular distributions and subsequent fates of immunologically detectable LPS (8Ge Y. Ezzell R.M. Tompkins R.G. Warren H.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now describe methods that allow quantitative separation of all of the major classes of radiolabeled bacterial molecules and their degradation products, permitting for the first time a reliable quantitative assessment of LPS deacylation during extracellular and intracellular antibacterial action of the mammalian host. We show that in this inflammatory setting, loss of bacterial viability was not only accompanied by hydrolysis of large portions of the bacterial phospholipids, RNA, and protein (6Patriarca P. Beckerdite S. Pettis P. Elsbach P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Elsbach P. Pettis P. Beckerdite S. Franson R. J.

Unlabeled 18:1, PE, PG, PC, LPE, and LPG standards were from Sigma. [14C]LPS was purified from Escherichia coliLCD25 as described previously (11Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E. coli LCD25, an aceEF, gltA strain of E. coli K12 unable to produce acetate or use acetate as a carbon or energy source, was grown in modified minimal E medium (12Cronan Jr., J. Batchelor J.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1973; 11: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with twice the stated concentrations of salts, glucose, and amino acids as described by Munford et al. (11Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Bacteria were grown overnight at 30 °C in liquid 2× E medium containing 0.8 mm sodium acetate, sedimented in a microcentrifuge at 3000 × g, washed once in sterile physiological saline, and then subcultured for 20 h at 30 °C at a starting concentration of 2.4 × 107 bacteria/ml. Bacterial LPS and PL were labeled using 0.3 mm (17 μCi/ml) sodium [2-14C]acetate, yielding ∼15,000 cpm incorporated/106 bacteria. Protein and RNA were labeled using the growth conditions described above, except subcultures were grown with 0.3 mm unlabeled sodium acetate and were supplemented with 5.5 μCi/mll-[35S]methionine (yielding 700 to 2000 cpm/106 bacteria) or 2 μCi/ml 2-[14C]uracil (yielding 300 cpm/106 bacteria). After labeling, the bacteria were sedimented in a Microfuge at 3000 × gand cultured an additional 30 min at 37 °C in an equal volume of fresh modified E medium containing 0.8 mm unlabeled sodium acetate to drive cell-associated radiolabeled precursors into macromolecules. Sterile HSA was added to 1% (to remove unesterified fatty acids), and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Sterile inflammatory peritoneal exudates were collected from New Zealand White rabbits, and cells (PMN and mononuclear cells (MNC)) and AF were isolated as described previously (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To provide a biological fluid containing opsonins but devoid of antibacterial activity, AF from complement (C6)-deficient rabbit exudates was incubated with CM-Sephadex resin to remove cationic proteins as described previously (13Weinrauch Y. Foreman A. Shu C. Zarember K. Levy O. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), yielding unbound C6-deficient AF (C6d UBAF). Labeled E. coli LCD25 were incubated (final concentration of 1 × 108/ml) with 90% (v:v) AF alone or with rabbit exudate cells as indicated in 90% (v:v) AF or 50% (v:v) C6d UBAF in HBSS+ containing 1% HSA. All incubations (200-μl volume) were buffered to pH 7.3–7.4 with 20 mmHEPES. For protein degradation experiments, incubations with leukocytes contained 0.5 mm cycloheximide to inhibit potential host cell reincorporation of labeled amino acids from degraded bacterial protein (9Elsbach P. Pettis P. Beckerdite S. Franson R. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 490-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leukocyte concentration was 1 × 107/ml for protein and RNA degradation and 1.5–2.0 × 107/ml for LPS and phospholipid degradation. Incubations proceeded at 37 °C with gentle (100 rpm) shaking in air for 1 h and thereafter at 37 °C without shaking in 5% CO2 to maintain pH. To ensure effective resuspension of clumped leukocytes, supernatant fluid (200 μl) was removed from tubes and replaced with 300 μl of divalent cation-poor buffer (HBSS− containing 0.1% HSA). Resuspended cells were then recombined with the supernatant fluid, and samples were precipitated for >20 min at 4 °C with 500 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were poured over 24-mm circular glass microfibre (GF/C) filters, and tubes and filtered sediment were washed 3 times with 1.5 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Filters were washed once with ice-cold 95% ethanol and air-dried. Precipitates were solubilized with 100 μl of 2% SDS and counted in a Beckman LS6000IC liquid scintillation counter using Aquasol-2 scintillant. At the indicated times, samples containing bacteria labeled with sodium [2-14C]acetate were extracted according to the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). At time = 0, mean partitioning (± S.E.) of the total bacterial radiolabeled material in this step was 74.6 ± 0.8% into chloroform, 23.9 ± 0.8% into the interface (IF), and 1.5 ± 0.2% into H2O/methanol, with essentially complete recovery of cpm. After growth of the bacteria with [14C]acetate, 68% of the total incorporated cpm were in the PLs. Intact PLs and the radiolabeled products of PL degradation were quantitatively recovered in the CHCl3phase of the initial Bligh and Dyer extraction. Degradation of bacterial PL was measured using a two-step TLC procedure. First, radiolabeled lipids in the CHCl3 phase were resolved by TLC on silica gel G using solvent system 1 (TLC1, see below). Intact bacterial PL remained at the origin in this system, along with other radiolabeled species including partially deacylated bacterial PL (lyso-PG and lyso-PE) and leukocyte PL (mainly PC, radiolabeled by incorporation of labeled FFAs released from bacterial lipids). These lipids were eluted from the silica and resolved by TLC on silica gel G using solvent system 2 (TLC2, see below). Radiolabeled species on all TLC plates were detected and quantitated by proportional argon ionization using an AMBIS-1000 detector (Ambis Inc., San Diego, CA). Radiolabeled species were identified by comparison with the migration of unlabeled authentic standards (NFA (18:1), PE, PG, CL, LPG, LPE) detected by staining with iodine vapor. In unincubated (time = 0) bacteria, ≥98% of the radiolabeled lipids in the chloroform phase remained at the origin of TLC1; 91.1 ± 2.4% (mean ± S.E.) of these counts were in intact PL. The % of bacterial phospholipids that remained intact during subsequent incubation was calculated by the following formula: (% of total cpm in CHCl3 phase) × (% of CHCl3 phase cpm at the origin in TLC1) × (% of this material comprising PE + PG + CL, as determined by TLC2)/(% of total cpm in intact bacterial PL at time = 0). Intact and partially deacylated LPS were quantitatively recovered at the IF of the initial Bligh and Dyer extraction (see Fig. 1, Table IA and Ref.5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS deacylation was measured as the loss of radiolabeled LPS-derived fatty acids (3-OH-14:0, 12:0, and 14:0) from the interface. After release from the IF, these fatty acids accumulated in the chloroform phase as FFAs or fatty acids esterified into host cell lipids (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPartitioning and relative amounts of 3-OH-14:0 in the fatty acids of E. coli LCD25 LPSWhole bacteriaCHCl3IFA3-OH-14:011.2 ± 0.9≤0.7 ± 0.2aProbably an overestimate due to incomplete resolution from neighboring radiolabeled spots (see Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 5).9.9 ± 0.6LPSIF of bacteriaB3-OH-14:01.001.0012:00.230.24 ± 0.0114:00.320.44 ± 0.01a Probably an overestimate due to incomplete resolution from neighboring radiolabeled spots (see Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 5). Open table in a new tab To measure the fatty acid composition of the LPS collected from the IF, this material was dried under N2 and hydrolyzed with 4n HCl and 4 n NaOH as described previously (15Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 464-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then acidified to pH 4.0 with acetic acid and extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. Of the cpm recovered after hydrolysis of the IF, 95.8 ± 1.2% was recovered after re-extraction. Of these cpm, 92–100% partitioned into the chloroform phase. The LPS-derived FA were then resolved and quantitated using TLC in two steps. First, the hydroxylated (3-OH-14:0) and nonhydroxylated (NFA) (12:0, 14:0) fatty acids were separated by TLC1. Second, to resolve 12:0 and 14:0, the NFA from TLC1 were eluted from the silica gel and separated by reverse-phase TLC using KC18-substituted silica gel and solvent system 3 (TLC3, see below). Labeled species on all TLC plates were detected and quantitated by AMBIS-1000 or by autoradiography. Labeled FFA standards (3-OH-14:0 derived from purified 14C-acetate-labeled E. coli LPS after acid/base hydrolysis and [14C]12:0, [3H]14:0, and [14C]16:0 obtained from commercial sources) were run on TLC in parallel to identify labeled species from experimental samples. The total cpm in 3-OH-14:0 in the interface at a given time was calculated as follows: (total cpm in hydrolyzed IF) × (% re-extracted into CHCl3) × (% of this material migrating as 3-OH-14:0 in TLC1). The total cpm in 12:0 or 14:0 in the interface at a given time was calculated as follows: (total cpm in hydrolyzed IF) × (% re-extracted into CHCl3) × (% of this material migrating as NFA in TLC1) × (% of this material migrating as either 12:0 or 14:0 in TLC3). LPS deacylation is expressed as % loss of each fatty acid from the interface over time, using the values for each acyl species obtained from unincubated bacterial suspensions (time = 0) as 100%. Three TLC systems were used, as described previously (16Munford R.S. Hunter J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10116-10121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC1—Silica gel G plates were developed for 45–50 min with petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1; v:v:v) to separate PL/lyso-PL (at origin), 3-OH 14:0, NFA, and triglycerides (at solvent front). Samples were run in parallel with standards: 3-OH-[14C]14:0 (purified by TLC from hydrolyzed 14C acetate-labeled E. coli or purified LPS) and [1-14C]12:0. TLC2—Silica gel G plates were developed for 100–110 min with chloroform/methanol/H2O/acetic acid (65:25:4:1; v:v:v:v) to separate various PL and lyso-PL species. Migration of unlabeled 18:1, PE, PG, PC LPE, and LPG standards was determined after detection by iodine vapor staining. TLC3 —Reverse-phase KC18 plates were developed twice for 45–50 min each with acetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1; v:v) to separate individual fatty acids in samples or radiolabeled standards (n-[9,10-3H]12:0, (n-[9,10(n)-3H]14:0; [1-14C]16:0, [1-14C]18:0) loaded in parallel lanes. Labeled lipid standards were detected by AMBIS and/or by en3Hance (NEN Life Science Products) autoradiography. After visualization with AMBIS-1000, radioactive spots of silica G were scraped from the plate and eluted by washing once with 200–500 μl of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (55:33:9:4; v:v:v:v), once with an equal volume of chloroform, and once again with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (55:33:9:4; v:v:v:v). Each wash step was preceded by a 10-min incubation at 42 °C. Recovery of radiolabeled lipids after elution was 83.7 ± 1.5% and was essentially the same for PL and various FA species. After a 1-h incubation (see assay conditions), samples containing bacteria and leukocytes were centrifuged at 70–100 × g to separate leukocyte-associated and extracellular bacteria. The leukocyte pellet was washed once with HBSS+ containing 0.1% HSA and once with HBSS− containing 0.1% HSA to remove adherent but nonphagocytosed bacteria. Radioactivity in the pellet, supernatant, and washes was measured by scintillation counting. In addition, cell smears were prepared after 15- and 60-min by cytospin and were stained with HEMA-3. After 1 h at 37 °C, samples were taken, diluted with sterile saline, and plated on nutrient broth agar as described previously (13Weinrauch Y. Foreman A. Shu C. Zarember K. Levy O. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1916-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Viability was measured as the number of colonies formed after incubation at 37 °C for 18–24 h. To measure deacylation of LPS in E. coli LCD25 during extracellular killing by AF and intracellular killing by inflammatory exudate cells, it was necessary to resolve LPS-derived fatty acids from FA linked to other bacterial macromolecules (principally phospholipids) that were labeled during growth in [14C]acetate-supplemented medium. Acetate-labeled LPS purified from E. coli LCD25 contained mainly three fatty acid species: 3-OH-14:0 (see Fig. 2 A, lane 2), 12:0 and 14:0 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) (11Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); see also Ref. 5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. All 3-OH-14:0 and nearly all 12:0 in E. coli is found in the lipid A moiety of LPS, whereas 14:0 in E. coliis divided roughly equally between PL and LPS (17Somerville Jr., J. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Using the extraction procedure of Bligh and Dyer (see Fig. 1), essentially all compounds in E. coli LCD25 that contained labeled 3-OH-14:0 were recovered in the IF between the aqueous and CHCl3 phases (Table IA and Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4), and virtually none were recovered in the CHCl3 phase (Table IA and Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Since 3-OH-14:0 is unique to the lipid A moiety of bacterial LPS, this finding indicates that nearly all bacterial LPS was recovered in the IF. Similar complete recovery of partially deacylated LPS in the IF was shown recently (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, during this extraction procedure, ≥95% PL, FFAs, and other degradation products of PL were recovered in the chloroform phase (18Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the IF of extracted bacteria contained fatty-acylated compounds other than LPS, acyl groups from these contaminants co-migrated chiefly with 16:0 on TLC (comparelanes 3 and 6 of Fig. 2 B). Evidence that these contaminants contained little or no 12:0 and 14:0 is provided by the closely similar relative amounts of 3-OH-14:0, 12:0, and 14:0 in the interface of extracted bacteria and purified LPS (Table IB). Thus, measurement of the loss of 3-OH-14:0, 12:0, and 14:0 from the IF allowed clear assessment of LPS deacylation. For analysis of deacylation of phospholipids, we used the chloroform phase of the same extracts of cell suspensions that provided the IF for determination of LPS deacylation. In TLC1, intact PL and lyso-PL remained at the origin of the chromatogram (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–9). The percentage of this radiolabeled material that consisted of intact bacterial PL (PE, PG, or CL) was determined using TLC2. By 20 h in AF (Fig. 2 A, lane 7), the labeled species at the origin of TLC1 represented almost exclusively monoacyl catabolites of bacterial PL (LPE and LPG (not shown)), whereas after ingestion by PMN (Fig. 2 A, lane 8) or MNC (Fig. 2 A, lane 9), some of the label at the origin was contained in the phagocyte lipid PC (not shown). Labeled species that co-migrated with the solvent front also accumulated; these were probably neutral lipids (e.g.triglycerides), reflecting leukocyte incorporation of labeled FA that were released from bacterial lipids, as reported previously (3Hall C.L. Munford R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,6Patriarca P. Beckerdite S. Pettis P. Elsbach P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Wright G.C. Weiss J. Kim K.S. Verheij H. Elsbach P. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1925-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in a recent publication (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine LPS deacylation during extracellular bacterial killing, [14C]acetate-labeled E. coli LCD25 were incubated with 90% AF, resulting in rapid killing of E. coli LCD25 (≥97% by 1 h, data not shown). This killing was accompanied by hydrolysis of >95% bacterial PL by 1 h (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, no loss of 3-OH-14:0, 12:0, or 14:0 from bacterial LPS was observed even after incubation for 20 h (Fig. 3 A). We have shown recently that acyloxyacyl hydrolase activity is much greater in inflammatory exudate leukocytes than in AF (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LPS deacylation may require either uptake of LPS shed from killed bacteria or ingestion of intact bacteria. When bacteria were incubated with inflammatory exudate leukocytes in the presence of AF, bacterial killing and PL hydrolysis took place principally extracellularly, i.e. before ingestion. This was evident from our inability to observe intact bacteria inside phagocytes by light microscopy (not shown). Moreover, the rate and extent of bacterial PL hydrolysis by AF plus phagocytes paralleled much more closely the effects of AF alone than those of PMN and MNC toward ingested bacteria (compare Figs. 3 and4). The addition of MNC but not of PMN to AF resulted in substantial loss of 12:0 and 14:0 from bacterial LPS (Fig. 3), in a pattern closely similar to that seen when these cells take up purified LPS (5Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of [14C]acetate-labeled E. coli LCD25 with either PMN or MNC in the presence of C6-deficient UBAF, which lacks antibacterial activity (not shown) but contains complement-derived opsonins present in the exudate, resulted in substantial bacterial ingestion. After 1 h, 61% of the radiolabeled bacteria were associated with PMN, which contained an average of 4 bacteria/cell (as judged by light microscopy; not shown). Similarly, MNC took up 65% of bacterial radiolabel after 1 h, with an average of 7 bacteria/cell. Accompanying this uptake, PMN and MNC caused 99 and 86% loss of bacterial colony-forming units within 1 h and up to 70 and 90% hydrolysis of bacterial PL, respectively, within 8–20 h (Fig. 4). PMN caused significant (albeit slower and less extensive) loss of 12:0 and 14:0 from bacterial LPS reaching 20–30% by 20 h (Fig. 4). MNC more rapidly and extensively deacylated LPS, as is shown by the loss of nearly 50% of the 12:0 and 14:0 from the interface by 4 h. No deacylation occurred in C6-deficient UBAF alone (data not shown). Thus, whereas only MNC effectively deacylated cell-free LPS after extracellular killing of bacteria by inflammatory fluid, PMN as well as MNC caused LPS deacylation after ingestion of intact bacteria. Under all conditions tested, 3-OH-14:0 was quantitatively retained in the interface (Figs. 3 and 4), demonstrating that the acyloxyacyl bonds of lipid A were the sole target of the LPS-deacylating activity manifest during and after killing of E. coli by inflammatory exudates. The preceding findings show a dramatic difference in the deacylation of PL and LPS during killing by either AF or PMN. To determine whether degradation of bacterial macromolecules under these conditions is generally slow and limited (as for LPS) or more rapid and extensive (as for PL), degradation of biosynthetically labeled bacterial RNA and proteins was determined during extracellular killing of E. coli LCD25 by AF or during intracellular killing by inflammatory exudate leukocytes (≥85% PMN). In AF alone, degradation of RNA was maximal at 2 h, reaching 70%, whereas protein degradation reached a plateau of 10% by 1 h (Fig. 5 A). Ingestion by exudate leukocytes was accompanied by rapid degradation of RNA that reached its maximum of 65–75% by 2 h, whereas protein degradation reached a plateau of ∼30% by 1 h (Fig. 5 B). Thus, like PL, degradation of RNA and proteins inE. coli LCD25 is rapid, reaching an early plateau. Degradation of RNA by both cellular and extracellular components of the rabbit exudate was particularly extensive, as has been shown previously in different bacterial species (9Elsbach P. Pettis P. Beckerdite S. Franson R. J. Bacteriol. 1973;"

For this study it is especially important to note that, even without modification of [Fe-S] type and organization, proteins are still able to control the reactivities of the clusters they contain. For example, [4Fe-4S] clusters with four cysteine ligands can utilize three different redox couples. The +3/+2 couple is used in a class of proteins designated the high potential iron proteins (18Bertini I. Gori-Savellini G. Luchinat C. J. Bio. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 114-118Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Przysiecki C.T. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2542-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Luchinat C.

Even when a particular [4Fe-4S] redox couple has been selected the reactivity of these proteins can be extended further by protein modulation of the reduction potential (E 0′) of a particular redox couple.

Biol. 1996; 66: 43-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), while ferredoxins that contain structurally indistinguishable [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters have reduction potentials ranging from −280 to −715 mV in different native proteins (21Stephens P.J.

Commun. 1996; 229: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This study is focused on the question of how a protein could control the E 0′ of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster that is ligated via a typical CysXXCysXXCys motif and one remote Cys ligand. Early studies of protein control of [4Fe-4S]2+/+ E 0′ focused on three structurally characterized, related proteins. The [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster of Azotobacter vinelandiiferredoxin I (AvFdI)1 has an unusually low E 0′ of ∼ −630 mV at pH 8 (31Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the analogous clusters in Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus 2The organism P. asaccharolyticus was formerly named Peptococcus aerogenes. ferredoxin (PaFd) and Clostridium acidiuriciferredoxin (CaFd) have E 0′ ∼ −430 mV (32Stombaugh N.A. Sundquist J.E. Burris R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2633-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus the E 0′ for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters contained within these proteins vary by over 200 mV. Early comparisons of the structures and sequences for these three proteins showed that the peptide folding around the analogous clusters is highly conserved with respect to the location of the four Cys ligands, the Cys dihedral angles, and the eight amide groups H-bonded to sulfur atoms of the cluster (33Backes G. Mino Y. Loehr T.M. Meyer M.A. Cusanovich W.V. Sweeney W.V. Adman E.T. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 2055-2064Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These similarities have also been confirmed by the new 1.4-Å structures ofAvFdI (34Stout C.D. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Schipke C.G. Goodin D.B. McRee D.E. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8228-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and by the 0.95-Å structure ofCaFd (36Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, these factors do not appear to be responsible for the observed differences in reduction potential among these proteins that all use the same [4Fe-4S]2+/+couple. Another long standing idea is that proteins might control [4Fe-4S]2+/+ E 0′ by introducing or removing charged residues. Thus, removing a negative surface charge near the cluster should make the cluster easier to reduce (raiseE 0′), while adding a negative charge should make it more difficult to reduce (lower E 0′) (18Bertini I.

Indeed, the lower potential AvFdI does have more negatively charged residues near its [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster than CaFd or PaFd (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. LaMar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This idea was attractive because it predicted that the formation of salt bridges between redox partners, when they bind to each other, might serve to raise the potential of the electron acceptor while lowering the potential of the electron donor, thus facilitating electron transfer (37Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3082-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test this idea a number of site-directed variants of the lowerE 0′ AvFdI were constructed by changing the negatively charged surface residues near its [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster to their neutral or positively charged counterparts in the higher E 0′ PaFd (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. LaMar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray structures of the mutant proteins proved that the orientations of the residues were the same in the mutantAvFdIs as they were in native PaFd. Surprisingly, however, the E 0′ of the AvFd [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster was unaffected by these mutations (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. LaMar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusion from that study was that differences in surface charged residues were not responsible for the large differences in reduction potential observed for the [4Fe-4S]2+/+clusters of AvFdI and PaFd. Another factor that has been suggested to be important is the relative solvent accessibility of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters in the two classes of proteins with one group predicting that the higherE 0′ of PaFd arises from the presence of buried water molecules (21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 44Jensen G.M. Warshel A. Stephens P.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25625-25627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent 0.95-Å resolution x-ray structure of a protein in the PaFd class, however, failed to reveal the presence of any internal water molecules (36Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Comparison of high resolution structures of AvFdI (34Stout C.D. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. J. Mol.

In this study we use site-directed mutagenesis to manipulate side chain and backbone dipoles that are close to the [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster of AvFdI (but not directly H-bonded to the sulfur atoms of the cluster) in order to examine an additional recent proposal that these factors are of critical importance in protein control ofE 0′ (21Stephens P.J.

For mutagenesis T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., while all restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Thein vitro mutagenesis was performed as described previously (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. LaMar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a MutaGene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad and the following oligonucleotides with the altered base(s) indicated in bold. The sequences are 5′-CCGGACGAGTGCCAGGACTGCGCGCTC-3′ for I40Q, 5′-CCGGACGAGTGCAACGACTGCGCGCTC-3′ for I40N, and 5′-GTTGAAGTCTGCGGCGTAGACTGTTTC-3′ for P21G. For all the mutants at Ile34 position, oligonucleotides with a mixed sequence were used to generate the mutants: 5′-GGGCCGAACTTCCTGGTC(CA)A(GC)CATCCGGACG-3′. The success of the mutagenesis was confirmed at the DNA level by dideoxy-DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The overexpression of the FdI variants in their native background in A. vinelandii was carried out as described previously (46Vazquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except that the parent strain used for the overexpression was A. vinelandii LM100, a strain that does not synthesize native FdI, and electroporation (BTX TransPorator Plus™ electroporation system; BTX, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used instead of the triparental mating method in the transformation process. Cell growth and the purification and triclinic crystallization of native FdI and FdI variants was carried out as described previously (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A.

Martı́n A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a precautionary measure, the FdI variants were initially purified anaerobically in the presence of dithionite. The anaerobically purified protein was then exposed to the air to test its air stability. Once it was established that they were air-stable, further experiments including fast protein liquid chromatography (MonoQ, with a linear gradient of 0.15–0.5 m NaCl in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and triclinic crystallization (43Shen B.H. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. LaMar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were done aerobically. For spectroscopic studies all samples were prepared anaerobically under argon in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box (O2 < 1 ppm) using degassed buffers. Samples were first concentrated to the desired level using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Reductions were carried out by addition of Na2S2O4 to 2.0 mm and incubation until no further change in absorption at >350 nm could be observed (usually this required about 20 min). UV-visible spectra were obtained with a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 Ez spectrometer, interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. TheE 0′ calculations were carried out using the program POLARIS, which was developed by Warshel et al. in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California. This program is now commercially available from A. Warshel's group. In this study we used version 6.30 of this program on the spp2000 computer at the University of California, Irvine Office of Academic Computing. POLARIS was developed to calculate the free energies and electrostatic properties of molecules and macromolecules in solution using a Protein Dipole Langevin Dipole (PDLD) model. A detailed description of how the calculations are done for [Fe-S] proteins is found in Ref. 21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and will only be briefly considered here. The calculations begin with a protein structure in a Protein Data Base (PDB) file format. In this case the starting point for calculations was the new 1.35-Å structure of the oxidized state of native FdI (34Stout C.D. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (7FDI). A number of PDB files were then created from that structure by modeling the I34N, I34Q, I40N, I40Q, or P21G mutations using the Insight II package (MSI, San Diego). The program replaces the wild-type residue with a mutant residue after local energy minimization. The actual I40N x-ray structures were also used as a starting point for calculations where indicated (accession code 1b0v). Once a structure had been obtained in PDB format, the next step was to convert that structure to a form suitable for PDLD calculations using a program called PREPARE that is included in the POLARIS package. This procedure involved deletion of all unwanted atoms (in this case the crystallographically observed ordered water molecules) and addition of H atoms if necessary. In the case of side chains that are capable of free rotation, the relative (Coulombic) energies of four orientations were evaluated and the configuration of minimum energy was selected (21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For His residues, the relative energies of the Nδd- and Nεe-protonated forms were evaluated similarly, and the configuration of minimum energy was chosen. Then, with the exceptions indicated below, all atoms were assigned charges including the atoms of the [Fe-S] cluster of interest, in this case the [4Fe-4S]Cys4 cluster in its oxidized and reduced states (21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The iron and inorganic sulfide atoms of the other [3Fe-4S]Cys3 cluster were treated as uncharged and assigned as zero. Additionally, the β-CH2and α-CH moieties of all ligating Cys residues were treated as uncharged, while non-ligand Cys residues were treated as normal amino acids. All the ionizable residues were treated as uncharged (total charge of the residue is zero). During the first part of the PDLD calculation, the Coulombic interactions of the [4Fe-4S]Cys4 cluster, in its oxidized and reduced states, with all other protein atoms was calculated. This included charge-charge interactions and charge-induced dipole interactions. The next part of the calculations involved construction of a Langevin dipole grid representing water molecules around the protein, and the interactions between the grid dipoles and the cluster were calculated. In this case the grid filled a sphere of radiusr L = 25 Å and was composed of two sections, an inner section with 1-Å spacing in a 12-Å radius and an outer section with a 3-Å spacing. For the oxidized state of the cluster, the dipoles on the constructed grid were optimized by sampling a set of 30 grids to give the maximum energy, and then the optimized grid was used without reoptimization for the reduced cluster. The final step involved calculation of the interaction of the cluster charges with the bulk media more than 25 Å away from the cluster. In the actual calculation process, the PDLD calculation is not only carried out on the starting protein structure, but also on molecular dynamics generated structures from the program. This is to take advantage of the fact that the average results based on a series of structures generated by molecular dynamics are more accurate than the single result from the x-ray crystal structure (21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The molecular dynamics simulations were done using a program called ENZYMIX that is attached to the POLARIS program. The molecular dynamics simulations were done at 300 K, generating a snapshot structure every 500 fs. A total of 50 structures were generated for each protein and each of them was subjected to PDLD calculation. The final results were averaged (21Stephens P.J. Jollie D.R. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2491-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Purified water of resistivity ∼18 MΩ cm (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used in all experiments. The buffers MES, HEPES, and TAPS and the co-adsorbate neomycin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. An AutoLab electrochemical analyzer (EcoChemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to record DC voltammograms. The three-electrode configuration featuring all glass-cells has been described previously (48Armstrong F.A. Butt J.N. Sucheta A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sample compartment (typically holding 500 μl) was maintained at 0 °C to optimize stability. AllE 0′ values are given with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode. The saturated calomel electrode was held at 22 °C which we have adopted as E (saturated calomel reference electrode) = +243 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode. E 0′ values from cyclic voltammetry were calculated as the average of the anodic and the cathodic peak potentials, E 0′ = ½(E pa + E pc). The pyrolytic graphite “edge” electrode (surface area typically 0.18 cm2) was polished prior to each experiment with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish; 1.0 μm) and then it was sonicated extensively to remove traces of Al2O3. All experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box with an inert atmosphere of N2 (<1 ppm). Prior to the electrochemical experiments, all protein samples were checked for purity by running fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with a Mono Q column equilbrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Bulk electrochemistry solutions contained 0.05–0.1 mm protein in 60 mm mixed buffer (15 mm HEPES, 15 mmMES, 15 mm TAPS, 15 mm acetate), with 0.1m NaCl as supporting electrolyte and 4 mmneomycin. Neomycin stabilizes the protein-electrode interactions. For the investigation of pH dependence, protein solutions were dialyzed extensively against the buffered solution at the required pH, using an Amicon 8MC diafiltration unit equipped with a microvolume assembly and a YM-3 membrane. Due to the altered solubility properties of the I40N, I40Q, and P21G variants of FdI with respect to the native protein, it was not possible to crystallize these mutants using the conditions for native FdI (49Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or seeding procedures (50Shen B. Jollie D.R. Diller T.C. Stout C.D. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A large number of trials were carried out in an anaerobic glove box to screen for new crystallization conditions. For I40N FdI, brown, diamond-shaped, thin plates, approximately 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm in size, were grown by vapor diffusion from a solution containing 3 μl of 10 mg/ml protein in 0.4m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and 3 μl of 4.2 m(NH4)2SO4 and 20 mmNaCl in 100 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.5 (reservoir solution). The crystallization droplets were equilibrated against 1.0 ml of the reservoir solution at room temperature, and crystals appeared after 4–5 days. Similar screening as well as seeding experiments with the I40Q and P21G mutants of FdI were unsuccessful. The thin, plate-like I40N FdI crystals exhibited highly mosaic diffraction in the direction parallel with the thin dimension of the crystal when frozen at 100 K using a variety of cryoprotectants. Therefore, data were collected from a single crystal of I40N FdI mounted aerobically in a thin-walled, glass capillary using the reservoir solution as a synthetic mother liquor. Data were collected at 18 °C using CuKα radiation from a Siemens SRA x-ray generator operated at 55 kV, 90 mA, and equipped with a graphite monochromator and a Mar Research 34.5-cm diameter image plate scanner. Data were recorded in 1° oscillations through a total rotation range of 162° with an exposure time of 10 min/frame. The data were indexed, integrated, merged, and scaled with Mosflm and Scala (51Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 76"

In Dictyostelium discoideum, Skp1 is encoded by two similar genes, fpa1 andfpa2 (5West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus based on immunofluorescence localization. 1S. Compton, K. Dobson, M. Sweetinburgh, and C. M. West, unpublished data. 1S. Compton, K. Dobson, M. Sweetinburgh, and C. M. West, unpublished data. Dictyostelium Skp1 is modified by an unusual linear pentasaccharide, Galα1–6Galα1-Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAc, attached to a HyPro2 residue at amino acid position 143 (6Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As the first glycosyltransferase in the modification of Pro-143, the hypothetical Skp1-HyPro GlcNAc-transferase is poised to control the glycosylation of Skp1 at this amino acid position. In support of such a regulatory role, a Skp1 isoform that is hydroxylated at Pro-143 but is not glycosylated can be detected when the fpa1 gene is overexpressed (6Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Skp1-HyPro GlcNAc-transferase is likely to be distinct from previously described GlcNAc-transferases based on the novelty of the GlcNAc-HyPro linkage formed. Most known protein GlcNAc-transferases are compartmentalized within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (7Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Abeijon C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5784-5790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a Ser/Thr GlcNAc-transferase has been described that functions in the cytoplasmic compartment (11Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Although glycosylation of Skp1 in a compartment of its function, the cytoplasm, might be simplest, there is precedence for bidirectional trafficking of proteins across the membrane of the rER for secretion or degradation (15Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which might also be utilized by Skp1. This more complex scenario would accommodate the hydroxylation of Pro-143, as all known prolyl hydroxylases are also located within the rER (16Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Determining whether Skp1 is modified in the cytoplasm or a compartment of the secretory pathway is important for understanding the regulation and significance of this pathway. Studies on another glycosyltransferase in the Skp1-HyPro modification pathway, a GDP-Fuc:Galβ1–3HexNAc α1,2Fuc-transferase, strongly suggested that it is compartmentalized in the cytoplasm (17West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This Skp1 α1,2Fuc-transferase activity was purified to near-homogeneity from a cytosolic extract of Dictyostelium and was found to be absolutely dependent on DTT and Mg2+. Negligible activity could be detected in the vesicle fraction of the cell. The requirement for DTT implied that the enzyme normally functions in a reducing environment, i.e. the cytoplasm rather than the lumen of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the α1,2Fuc-transferase exhibited submicromolar K m values for GDP-Fuc and Skp1. These exceptionally high affinities, relative to those of Golgi enzymes, reinforced the cytoplasmic localization model, where substrates would not be as concentrated as they are in the Golgi. A similar high affinity for its donor substrate was reported for the cytoplasmic Ser/Thr GlcNAc-transferase (11Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the compartmentalization of the Skp1 α1,2Fuc-transferase and its role in modifying Skp1 remains to be confirmed by genetic studies, the findings suggest that Skp1 is modified by a novel, sequentially acting, six-enzyme pathway residing in the cytoplasm. To investigate the properties and compartmentalization of the Skp1-HyPro GlcNAc-transferase, an assay was developed to guide its identification and purification. An activity has been detected in a cytosolic extract of Dictyostelium that appears to transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to Skp1-HyPro-143. By using a combination of conventional chromatography and affinity chromatography based on a resin containing a novel UDP-GlcNAc linkage, a candidateM r 51,000 protein has been purified to near-homogeneity. The kinetic properties of the purified Skp1-HyPro GlcNAc-transferase activity and its absolute dependence on a reducing environment suggest, as for the Skp1 α1,2Fuc-transferase activity described above, that the first glycosyltransferase in the Skp1 HyPro modification pathway also resides in the cytoplasm. Skp1A-Myc was purified from strain HW120 through the mAb 3F9 affinity column step as described (6Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recombinant Skp1A-His10 was purified on a nickel chelating column as described (17West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and further on a mAb 3F9 affinity column. Purified proteins were concentrated in Centriplus-10 ultrafiltration concentrators (Amicon) to about 10 μm, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 133–155 of Skp1, KIFNIKDFTPEEEEQIRKENEW and KIFNIKNDFT(4-OH)PEEEQIRKENEW, were synthesized by the ICBR Protein Core at the University of Florida and verified by amino acid composition and matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometry analyses. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, dried, and dissolved in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, at 20 mg/ml. UDP-[3H-6]GlcNAc (NEN Life Science Products) had a specific activity of 34.8 Ci/mmol. GlcNAc-transferase activity was assayed by the transfer of [3H]GlcNAc from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc to Skp1A-Myc or peptide-(133–155). Typically, assays contained 1 μm Skp1A-Myc, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3–0.66 μmUDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc in a final volume of 35 μl. 1 mm ATP and 6 mm NaF were included in assays of S100 (where S100 is the cytosolic cell fraction isolated as the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h) and DEAE column fractions. Following addition of enzyme, reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by addition of either 500 μl of ice-cold 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, or 35 μl of 2× Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer containing 60 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Reactions stopped with 2× sample buffer were boiled for 3 min and resolved on a 7–20% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 in 45% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 1 h, destained in 5% (v/v) methanol, 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid overnight, and rinsed in H2O for 0.5–1 h. Gel slices corresponding to the position of soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r 20,100), which comigrated with Skp1A-Myc, or to the peptide, were excised and incubated in 10% TS-2 (Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL), 0.6% 2,5-diphenyloxazole, 0.015% 1,4-bis[2-(4-methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene in toluene (Scintanalysis grade). After 72 h, 3H incorporation was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6500). Negative control samples were quenched at zero time or lacked added Skp1, and values (15–35 dpm) were subtracted. The SDS-PAGE assay was more sensitive than the trichloroacetic acid assay and was used for the kinetic results shown. Reactions quenched with trichloroacetic acid were incubated on ice and vacuum-filtered over a GF/C (Whatman) glass fiber filter prewetted with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The reaction tube was rinsed with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid which was also transferred to the filter, and the filter was rinsed three more times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filter was then rinsed 4× with 1 ml each of ice-cold acetone. Filters were counted in 10 ml of Scintiverse BioHP mixture (Fisher) as above. Negative control values, ranging from 200 to 500 dpm, were derived from reactions lacking added enzyme and were subtracted from the results given. In the assay of some particulate fractions, the reaction mixture was clarified at 100,000 × g for 70 min prior to analysis by the SDS-PAGE method. In addition, some supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb 9E10 conjugated to activated Sepharose CL-4B beads at 15 mg/ml (18Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar); the washed precipitates were then analyzed by the SDS-PAGE method. 5-Hg-dUMP was synthesized as described (19Zeng Y. Shabalin Y. Szumilo T. Pastuszak I. Drake R.R. Elbein A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Ethanol-precipitated 5-Hg-dUMP was washed with ethyl acetate:ethanol (1:4), dissolved in 50 ml of H2O, and loaded onto a 10-ml Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove residual Hg2+ as described (20Dale R.M.K. Martin E. Livingston D.C. Ward D.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2447-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction contained 5-Hg-dUMP to be used for the coupling reaction. The yield of mercuration, measured by the shift of absorbance spectrum from 260 to 267 nm was 71%. Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as follows. The dried material was swollen in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, at room temperature overnight and washed on a Buchner funnel with a large excess of H2O. Free thiol groups were released by suspending the gel in 1% (w/v) DTT in 0.3 mNaHCO3, 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.4, for 1 h. The gel was washed with a large excess of 0.5 mNaCl, 0.1 m acetic acid, 1 mmNa2EDTA, followed by H2O. The gel was then resuspended in the Chelex 100 flow-through fraction of 5-Hg-dUMP with gentle mixing on a shaking platform for 2 h at room temperature. The coupling yield was determined from the decrease of absorbance at 267 nm. Synthesis of 5-Hg-UDP-GlcNAc was performed as above for 5-Hg-dUMP except the Chelex 100 resin step was omitted, with a 70% yield. 5-(3-Amino)allyl-UDP-GlcNAc was synthesized from 5-Hg-UDP-GlcNAc and purified over a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column as described (19Zeng Y. Shabalin Y. Szumilo T. Pastuszak I. Drake R.R. Elbein A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The product exhibited absorbance maxima at 240 and 287 nm and a minimum at 262 nm, typical for a compound with an exocyclic double bond with a pyrimidine ring. Fractions containing 5-(3-amino)allyl-UDP-GlcNAc were pooled giving a 63% yield, dried under vacuum centrifugation, dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide, and adjusted with triethylamine to pH 7.5, measured with pH paper. Two ml of NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was washed with 10 ml of dimethylformamide on a Buchner funnel, and the gel was resuspended in the 5-(3-amino)allyl-UDP-GlcNAc solution. The coupling reaction was performed for 24 h with gentle mixing on a shaking platform at room temperature; however, maximal coupling, monitored by the decrease of absorbance at 287 nm, occurred in 2 h. The dimethylformamide was then replaced by 1 maminoethanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 2 h. One ml of gel was packed in a HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, followed by 0.1m boric acid, pH 8.0, and stored in 2 m NaCl, 0.005% thimerosol in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8. Buffer pH values were adjusted at room temperature, and solutions were degassed and chilled, and filtered 1 mDTT was added just prior to use. Protease inhibitors were added to buffers A–C to the following concentrations immediately prior to use: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Buffer A is as follows: 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, protease inhibitors; buffer B is as follows: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, protease inhibitors; buffer C is as follows: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol, protease inhibitors; buffer D is as follows: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80; 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol; buffer E is as follows: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA; and buffer F is as follows: 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 80; 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol. Stationary phase strain Ax3 or HW120 cells grown in HL-5 were filter-lysed and successively centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min and 100,000 × g for 70 min to generate the cytosolic S100 supernatant fraction as described previously (17West C.M.

The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and re-centrifuged, yielding the P3 and P100 (where P100 is the particulate cell fraction equivalent to the pellet formed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h) fractions, respectively. Nuclei were prepared using either Nonidet P-40 or digitonin as described (21Maclean N. Garside K. Bradley M.C. Wood C. Experientia (Basel). 1984; 40: 1207-1214Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The S100 supernatant (800 ml) was pumped onto a 450-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with the same buffer (17West C.M. Scott-Ward T.

Skp1 was quantitatively retained on the column, whereas GlcNAc-transferase activity appeared in the wash fractions, which were frozen at −80 °C. The column was washed with 2 m NaCl in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, prior to reuse. (NH4)2SO4(ultrapure, ICN) was added to the pooled active fractions from the DEAE-Sepharose column to a final concentration of 25% saturation with stirring at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant was brought to 60% (NH4)2SO4 saturation. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 300 ml of 20 or 25% saturated (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B, and recentrifuged to clarify. The 25–60% (NH4)2SO4 cut was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (low-sub) column (2.6 cm x 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 or 25% saturated (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B at 4 °C, washed with the same buffer until the A 280dropped to below 1% of its maximum, and eluted with a linear decreasing 600-ml gradient to buffer B. Fractions were stored at −80 °C. The column was washed in 6 m urea in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, followed by 1 m NaOH, before reuse. The phenyl-Sepharose activity pool was loaded onto a Reactive Red-120 Fast Flow column (1.6 × 5 cm), equilibrated in buffer B, at 4 °C at 80 ml/min. After washing with buffer B until the A 280dropped to 10% of maximum, the column was eluted with a 150-ml 0–2m NaCl linear or step gradient prepared in buffer B. Fractions were assayed after desalting on 9 ml of Sephadex G-25 columns (PD-10 columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer D, and stored at −80 °C. The Reactive Red-120 column was precycled according to manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) prior to reuse. The Reactive Red column activity pool was concentrated in a Centriplus-10 ultrafiltration device (Amicon) to <2 ml and was loaded onto a Superdex 200 (16/60) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was isocratically eluted at 0.8 ml/min at 22 °C, and fractions were stored at −80 °C. The column was calibrated with the following M r standards: horse spleen apoferritin (443,000), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,100). The Superdex 200 activity pool was loaded onto a 1-ml 5-Hg-dUMP column equilibrated in buffer C. DTT was added to the flow-through fraction to 5 mm, which was concentrated in a Centriplus-10 ultrafiltration device to <2 ml. After use, the column was cleaned with 5 mm dUMP and stored in 2m NaCl, 0.005% thimerosol in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8. The concentrated flow-through fraction from the 5-Hg-dUMP column was loaded at 100 μl/min onto the aminoallyl-UDP-GlcNAc-Sepharose column described above. This column was mounted on a Smart HPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated in buffer D, which contained 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80 to stabilize enzyme activity. The column was washed with buffer F until recovery of the original base line and was eluted with a 7.4-ml gradient of 0–2 mm UMP in buffer F at 22 °C and 250 μl/min. To detect enzyme activity, fractions were either desalted on PD-10 columns equilibrated in buffer D or cyclically concentrated and diluted in Microcon-10 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon) with buffer F to reduce UMP to <20 μm. For kinetic studies, active fractions were pooled and desalted on a Fast Desalting PC3.2/10 column mounted on the Smart System HPLC that was equilibrated with buffer E and run at 100 μl/min at 22 °C. The column was washed with 8 m urea, 50 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, prior to reuse. For SDS-PAGE and photoaffinity labeling, the UDP-GlcNAc affinity pool was concentrated to <50 μl in a Microcon-10 ultrafiltration device and applied to a Superdex 75 PC3.2/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer F, which contained 0.01% Tween 80 (v/v). The column was eluted at 0.05 ml/min at 22 °C, collecting 25-μl fractions. The column was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (M r66,000), ovalbumin (M r 43,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r 29,000), and cytochrome C (M r 12,400). Protein concentration was determined by a commercial modification of a Coomassie Blue dye-binding method (22Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar) according the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. After UDP-GlcNAc affinity chromatography, protein was alternatively estimated from itsA 280 value, assuming an extinction coefficient of 1 ml/mg for a 1-cm path length, or by analysis of phenylisothiocyanate-amino acid derivatives after acid hydrolysis of the sample at the ICBR Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory, using norleucine as an internal standard. Column fractions were diluted with equal volumes of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 5 mm DTT and boiled for 2 min. Iodoacetamide was added to 40 mm, and samples were applied to a 7–20% (w/v) linear gradient SDS-PAGE gel (17West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gels were silver-stained (23Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). 0.5 μmol of 5-ASA-UDP-GlcNAc (19Zeng Y. Shabalin Y. Szumilo T. Pastuszak I. Drake R.R. Elbein A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. A. E. Elbein, was reacted with 2 mCi of carrier-free Na125I from NEN Life Science Products as described (24Holmes E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-[125I]ASA-UDP-GlcNAc was preincubated with Superdex 75 fractions at 30 μm in the presence or absence of 700 μm UDP-GlcNAc for 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction mixture was then exposed for 2 min to 254 nm radiation from a 30-watt mineralight at a distance of 1 cm. The reaction was diluted with 2× Laemmli electrophoresis buffer and processed as described in the SDS-PAGE section above. The stained gel was then autoradiographed against Kodak Bio-Max HP film at −80 °C. Kinetic studies were performed on the UDP-GlcNAc affinity pool after passage over a Fast Desalting PC3.2/10 column. Reactions were incubated for 1 h using the SDS-PAGE assay. Gel slices containing [3H]Skp1 or [3H]4-HyPro peptide were rinsed in H2O, minced, and diluted with an equal volume of 1m NaBH4 in 0.2 m NaOH. After incubation at 45 °C for 20 h, the supernatant was neutralized with an equal volume of 0.2 m acetic acid in MeOH and dried under vacuum centrifugation. The radioactive residue was dissolved in 2 ml of H2O, adjusted to pH 9.5 with 2-amino-2-methyl-1 propanol as determined using pH paper, and loaded onto a 1-ml Dowex 1 column pretreated with 5 ml of 1 m HCl and 10 ml of H2O. The flow-through was diluted in Scintiverse-HP scintillation mixture and counted as above. Radioactive gel slices were hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The supernatant was dried by vacuum centrifugation, dissolved in H2O, dried again, dissolved in 100 μl of H2O containing 1 nmol of GlcNH2, and chromatographed on a PA-10 column on a DX-500 HPLC system (Dionex) in 17 mm NaOH at 1 ml/min. The eluant was monitored by pulsed amperometric detection (17West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and fractions were counted in a liquid scintillometer. Strain HW120 expresses a c-Myc-tagged form of Skp1A under the control of the discoidin promoter (6Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Skp1A-Myc isolated from the S100 fraction of this strain contains an abundant isoform that is hydroxylated but not glycosylated at Pro-143. This unglycosylated isoform is predicted to be an acceptor substrate for the hypothetical Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase. An assay for the Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase was developed based on transfer of 3H from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc to Skp1A-Myc, in the presence of 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. The S100 fraction from stationary phase cells of the normal strain Ax3 was initially tested as a source of enzyme. Skp1 was purified after the reaction by SDS-PAGE, and incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting of the gel slice. Addition of Skp1A-Myc stimulated incorporation of3H into the Skp1 band over 3-fold, whereas Skp1A-His10, a recombinant form of Skp1A that is not hydroxylated at Pro-143 (6Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R.

The S100 fraction from strain HW120 exhibited a high level of spontaneous incorporation in the absence of added Skp1A-Myc (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that endogenous Skp1A-Myc was a substrate after cell lysis. Consistent with this interpretation, incorporation was only slightly further stimulated by additional Skp1A-Myc, and the high level of spontaneous incorporation was markedly reduced by mAb 3F9 (Fig. 1 B, solid bars). These results suggested the presence of a Skp1-HyPro GlcNAc-transferase in the S100 fraction of the cell. To gain further evidence that the GlcNAc-transferase activity was specific for the HyPro residue, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 133–155 of Skp1 with 4-HyPro at the equivalent of residue 143 was tested as a substrate. The 4-HyPro peptide induced substantial increases of 3H into the peptide band in the S100 fractions of both strains Ax3 (Fig. 1 A, open bars) and HW120 (Fig. 1 B, open bars). A synthetic peptide containing Pro in place of 4-HyPro was inactive (not shown, see Fig. 6 below). The 4-HyPro peptide markedly reduced incorporation into endogenous Skp1 of strain HW120 (Fig. 1 B). This indicated that the activity that labeled the 4-HyPro peptide was equivalent to the activity that labeled Skp1A-Myc and implied that labeling of Skp1A-Myc was associated with HyPro-143.

Interestingly, interactions between NCp7 and RT appear to promote the recruitment of RT in these nucleoprotein complexes, resulting in the initiation of cDNA synthesis with subsequent elongation (26Lener D.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The yeast Ty3 retrotransposon also encodes an RT enzyme as well as a nucleocapsid protein, designated NCp9, with a unique zinc finger required for Ty3 transposition in yeast (27Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that Ty3 has an unexpected bipartite PBS composed of sequences located at opposite ends of the genome and that the Ty3 cDNA synthesis requires NCp9 and the 3′ PBS for primer tRNAiMet annealing and the 5′ PBS as the transcription start site (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dimerization of Ty3 RNA was also found to necessitate tRNAiMet, the 5′-3′ PBS, and NCp9 (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To compare nucleoprotein complex formation and the early phases of cDNA synthesis in retrotransposons to that in HIV-1, we have established a model system formed of Ty3 RNA composed of the 5′ and 3′ terminal domains with the 5′-3′ PBS, primer tRNA, Ty3 NCp9, and for the first time, Ty3 RT. Our results show that Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes are formed in vitro, allowing Ty3 RT to synthesize strong stop cDNA (ss-cDNA). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of NCp9, but not the zinc finger, was found to be necessary for the formation of active Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe ubiquitous nature of the RT and NC protein among retroviruses and retrotransposons such as yeast Ty3 and DrosophilaCopia prompted us to analyze the reverse transcription process in Ty3 and compare it with that in HIV-1, a distantly related long terminal repeat-containing retroelement belonging to the lentivirus family (12Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ty3 NCp9 and HIV-1 NCp7 are interchangeable in the Ty3 and HIV-1 template/primer systems, although Ty3 reverse transcription clearly differs from that of HIV-1 on the basis of NC protein and PBS sequences as well as on the mechanisms of RNA dimerization and initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-NCp7 compounds (36Rice W.G. Schaeffer C.A. Harten B. Villinger F. South T.L. Summers M.F. Henderson L.E. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. McDougal J.S. Orloff S.L. Mendeleyev J. Kun E. Nature. 1993; 361: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were found to inhibit Ty3 reverse transcription (data not shown), suggesting that yeast Ty3 can be used to screen new anti-NCp7 inhibitors capable of impairing HIV-1 replication.To extensively analyze the reverse transcription process of a retrotransposon, namely yeast Ty3, and to compare it with that of HIV-1, we devised a functional in vitro Ty3 template-primer system consisting of a bipartite Ty3 5′-3′ RNA template, the cognate tRNA primer (tRNAiMet), and NCp9. A purified, recombinant 55-kDa version of Ty3 RT was included in the system, since it was highly active on a synthetic poly(rA):oligo(dT) template-primer (Fig. 1). In addition Ty3 RT was found to be more specific than that of MLV or HIV-1, since it was unable to copy an RNA or a DNA template by self-priming (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, it is important to point out that Ty3 NCp9 (data not shown), like MLV NCp10 or HIV-1 NCp7, can extensively inhibit cDNA synthesis by self-priming using MLV or HIV-1 RT (21Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Trivial explanations for this finding might have included either nuclease contamination and destruction of the RNA templates or an inability of the Ty3 RT to recognize and polymerize from an RNA 3′ hydroxyl. The former notion appears unlikely, based on observations that incubation of Ty3 RT with radiolabeled RNA/DNA to evaluate its DNA polymerase and RNase H activities reveal no breakdown of the single-stranded RNA template. 3J. Rausch, M. Bona-Le Grice, and S. F. J. Le Grice, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, we have shown here that Ty3 RT will support synthesis of poly(dT) (Fig. 1) and of minus-strand strong-stop DNA from its cognate tRNA primer (Fig. 6). This unexpected property of Ty3 RT together with the chaperoning activity of NCp9 (Figs. 4 and 5; see also below) may have evolved to ensure that in intracellular virus-like particles, retrotransposon genomic RNA is selectively reverse-transcribed. This concept is presently under investigation.To further examine the chaperoning properties of Ty3 NCp9 and compare them to HIV-1 NCp7, we synthesized NCp9 deletion mutants and examined their ability to (i) promote nucleoprotein complexes, (ii) direct primer tRNAiMet annealing to the PBSs, and (iii) catalyze Ty3 RNA:tRNA dimerization. We also examined the activity of Ty3 RT to specifically direct minus-strand strong-stop cDNA synthesis, the early product of the reverse transcription process, in Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes. Functions of the NCp9 deletion mutants in nucleoprotein complex formation, tRNA annealing and Ty3 RNA dimerization, and minus-strand cDNA synthesis are summarized in Table I. Clearly, only wild type NCp9 was optimal in all these functional assays. Nevertheless, deletion of the zinc finger (NCp9 dd) only had a moderate inhibitory impact on nucleoprotein complex formation, tRNA annealing, Ty3 RNA dimerization, and tRNA-primed reverse transcription (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). On the other hand, deleting N-terminal residues (Δ3-NCp9) resulted in an almost complete loss of activity in vitro. This is reminiscent of the findings with HIV-1 NCp7 where deletion of the two zinc fingers only had a moderate inhibitory effect on ψ+ RNA dimerization, tRNA3Lys annealing, and tRNA-primed cDNA synthesis, whereas N-terminal deletion resulted in a drastic inhibition of functions in vitro (29De Rocquigny H.

This appears to be achieved in two ways: first, by inhibiting nonspecific self-primed reverse transcription of the genome and of cellular RNAs and nonspecific replication of newly made DNA products (20Li X. Quan Y. Arts E. Li Z. Preston B. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. Darlix J.-L. Kleiman L. Parniak M. Wainberg M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); second, by promoting primer tRNA annealing and minus-strand DNA synthesis (15Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Grüninger-Leitch M. Le Grice S.F.J. Nugeyre M.-T. Barré-Sinoussi F. Darlix J.-L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29De Rocquigny H. Gabus C.

Retrotransposon Ty3 NCp9 was also found to chaperone specific Ty3 RNA reverse transcription by a retroviral RT in a manner similar to HIV-1 NCp7 and MLV NCp10 (data not shown; Ref. 21Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Using MLV RT, this takes place with maximal efficiency with WT NCp9 (Table I). As has been documented for HIV-1 NCp7, the N-terminal and zinc fingers domains are essential for nucleic acid binding (17Dannull J. Surovoy A. Jung G. Moelling K.

Therefore, the zinc finger may well stabilize NCp9 oligomers bound to nucleic acids, causing destabilization of intramolecular structures (39Gregoire C. Gautheret D. Loret E. J. Biol.

It will also allow us to examine the contribution of the bipartite 5′-3′ PBS, tRNAiMet, NCp9, and RT in the mechanism of plus-strand DNA transfer, most probably different from that in HIV-1 (42Auxilien S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6603-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Last, these data on NCp9 reinforce the notion that Ty3 is an ancestor of HIV-1, whereas Ty1 is probably more ancient (44Kim J. Vanguri S. Boeke J. Gabriel A. Voytas D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and characterization of an NC-like activity in Ty1 is presently under investigation.

HIV-1 nucleoprotein complexes resembling the virion nucleocapsid are formed in vitro following binding of NCp7 to viral RNA and primer tRNA3Lys, resulting in the dimerization of viral RNA containing the packaging (psi or Ψ) sequence and annealing of primer tRNA to the PBS (15Barat C.

Interestingly, interactions between NCp7 and RT appear to promote the recruitment of RT in these nucleoprotein complexes, resulting in the initiation of cDNA synthesis with subsequent elongation (26Lener D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33781-33786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), corresponding to the early phases of viral DNA synthesis (3Varmus H. Swanstrom R. Weiss R. Teich N.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The yeast Ty3 retrotransposon also encodes an RT enzyme as well as a nucleocapsid protein, designated NCp9, with a unique zinc finger required for Ty3 transposition in yeast (27Kirchner J. Sandmeyer S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that Ty3 has an unexpected bipartite PBS composed of sequences located at opposite ends of the genome and that the Ty3 cDNA synthesis requires NCp9 and the 3′ PBS for primer tRNAiMet annealing and the 5′ PBS as the transcription start site (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dimerization of Ty3 RNA was also found to necessitate tRNAiMet, the 5′-3′ PBS, and NCp9 (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To compare nucleoprotein complex formation and the early phases of cDNA synthesis in retrotransposons to that in HIV-1, we have established a model system formed of Ty3 RNA composed of the 5′ and 3′ terminal domains with the 5′-3′ PBS, primer tRNA, Ty3 NCp9, and for the first time, Ty3 RT. Our results show that Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes are formed in vitro, allowing Ty3 RT to synthesize strong stop cDNA (ss-cDNA). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of NCp9, but not the zinc finger, was found to be necessary for the formation of active Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes in vitro. DISCUSSIONThe ubiquitous nature of the RT and NC protein among retroviruses and retrotransposons such as yeast Ty3 and DrosophilaCopia prompted us to analyze the reverse transcription process in Ty3 and compare it with that in HIV-1, a distantly related long terminal repeat-containing retroelement belonging to the lentivirus family (12Darlix J.-L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ty3 NCp9 and HIV-1 NCp7 are interchangeable in the Ty3 and HIV-1 template/primer systems, although Ty3 reverse transcription clearly differs from that of HIV-1 on the basis of NC protein and PBS sequences as well as on the mechanisms of RNA dimerization and initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis (1Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J-L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-NCp7 compounds (36Rice W.G. Schaeffer C.A. Harten B. Villinger F. South T.L. Summers M.F. Henderson L.E. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. McDougal J.S. Orloff S.L. Mendeleyev J. Kun E. Nature. 1993; 361: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were found to inhibit Ty3 reverse transcription (data not shown), suggesting that yeast Ty3 can be used to screen new anti-NCp7 inhibitors capable of impairing HIV-1 replication.To extensively analyze the reverse transcription process of a retrotransposon, namely yeast Ty3, and to compare it with that of HIV-1, we devised a functional in vitro Ty3 template-primer system consisting of a bipartite Ty3 5′-3′ RNA template, the cognate tRNA primer (tRNAiMet), and NCp9. A purified, recombinant 55-kDa version of Ty3 RT was included in the system, since it was highly active on a synthetic poly(rA):oligo(dT) template-primer (Fig. 1). In addition Ty3 RT was found to be more specific than that of MLV or HIV-1, since it was unable to copy an RNA or a DNA template by self-priming (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, it is important to point out that Ty3 NCp9 (data not shown), like MLV NCp10 or HIV-1 NCp7, can extensively inhibit cDNA synthesis by self-priming using MLV or HIV-1 RT (21Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J-L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Trivial explanations for this finding might have included either nuclease contamination and destruction of the RNA templates or an inability of the Ty3 RT to recognize and polymerize from an RNA 3′ hydroxyl. The former notion appears unlikely, based on observations that incubation of Ty3 RT with radiolabeled RNA/DNA to evaluate its DNA polymerase and RNase H activities reveal no breakdown of the single-stranded RNA template. 3J. Rausch, M. Bona-Le Grice, and S. F. J. Le Grice, manuscript in preparation. Moreover, we have shown here that Ty3 RT will support synthesis of poly(dT) (Fig. 1) and of minus-strand strong-stop DNA from its cognate tRNA primer (Fig. 6). This unexpected property of Ty3 RT together with the chaperoning activity of NCp9 (Figs. 4 and 5; see also below) may have evolved to ensure that in intracellular virus-like particles, retrotransposon genomic RNA is selectively reverse-transcribed. This concept is presently under investigation.To further examine the chaperoning properties of Ty3 NCp9 and compare them to HIV-1 NCp7, we synthesized NCp9 deletion mutants and examined their ability to (i) promote nucleoprotein complexes, (ii) direct primer tRNAiMet annealing to the PBSs, and (iii) catalyze Ty3 RNA:tRNA dimerization. We also examined the activity of Ty3 RT to specifically direct minus-strand strong-stop cDNA synthesis, the early product of the reverse transcription process, in Ty3 nucleoprotein complexes. Functions of the NCp9 deletion mutants in nucleoprotein complex formation, tRNA annealing and Ty3 RNA dimerization, and minus-strand cDNA synthesis are summarized in Table I. Clearly, only wild type NCp9 was optimal in all these functional assays. Nevertheless, deletion of the zinc finger (NCp9 dd) only had a moderate inhibitory impact on nucleoprotein complex formation, tRNA annealing, Ty3 RNA dimerization, and tRNA-primed reverse transcription (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). On the other hand, deleting N-terminal residues (Δ3-NCp9) resulted in an almost complete loss of activity in vitro. This is reminiscent of the findings with HIV-1 NCp7 where deletion of the two zinc fingers only had a moderate inhibitory effect on ψ+ RNA dimerization, tRNA3Lys annealing, and tRNA-primed cDNA synthesis, whereas N-terminal deletion resulted in a drastic inhibition of functions in vitro (29De Rocquigny H.

This appears to be achieved in two ways: first, by inhibiting nonspecific self-primed reverse transcription of the genome and of cellular RNAs and nonspecific replication of newly made DNA products (20Li X.

Therefore, the zinc finger may well stabilize NCp9 oligomers bound to nucleic acids, causing destabilization of intramolecular structures (39Gregoire C. Gautheret D. Loret E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6603-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Last, these data on NCp9 reinforce the notion that Ty3 is an ancestor of HIV-1, whereas Ty1 is probably more ancient (44Kim J. Vanguri S. Boeke J. Gabriel A. Voytas D. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and characterization of an NC-like activity in Ty1 is presently under investigation.

We determined that the initial burst activity results from the transfer of γ-phosphate from the radiolabeled substrate [α-32P]ATP to unlabeled ADP bound by the DnaK and is the same activity that results in ADP phosphorylation. The purification of DnaK from E. coli cells that carry a disruptedndk gene, ndk::km, results in preparations with greatly reduced ADP kinase activities compared with preparations of DnaK purified from ndk + cells. The reduction in the amount of ADP kinase activity in preparations of DnaK purified from ndk::km cells shows that nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) is responsible for most of the ADP kinase activity present in DnaK preparations isolated fromndk + cells. The remaining ADP kinase activity in preparations from ndk::km cells, which varies between preparations, is also a property of NDP kinase, which is most likely expressed because of a low frequency reversion of the disruptedndk gene.

In addition to functioning in response to heat shock and other forms of stress, many HSP70 proteins, including DnaK, function in a variety of normal metabolic processes, including the folding of nascent polypeptides (3Rothman J.E.

HSP70 proteins function as molecular chaperones in all of these processes, undergoing multiple cycles of binding and release of the polypeptide substrate to facilitate its folding or to protect unfolded states from aggregation and denaturation (8Hartl F.-U.

In vitro, DnaK blocks the aggregation and allows the reactivation of heat-inactivated RNA polymerase (13Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M.

The COOH-terminal domain binds peptides in an extended conformation (22Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 23Zhu X.

The NH2-terminal domain possesses the weak intrinsic ATPase activity associated with every HSP70 protein (24Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

The ATPase activity of HSP70 proteins is therefore crucial for their biological function. A range of quantitative values and functional descriptions of the ATPase activity of DnaK and other HSP70 proteins has been reported. The ATPase activity of unstimulated DnaK has been assignedk cat values ranging from 0.02 to 1.0 min−1 (27Beissinger M. Buchner J. Biol. Chem.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP, but not nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, results in a conformational change of DnaK and in the release of its bound peptide substrate (32Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which initially led to the conclusion that ATP hydrolysis results in a global conformational change of DnaK that in turn results in peptide release. However, because mutants of DnaK that have a defective ATPase activity release peptide (33Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L.

Measurements of the amounts of ATP and ADP bound to DnaK during ATP hydrolysis (35McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol.

We found that a variety of DnaK and HSP70 preparations display initial burst kinetics in ATPase assays carried out with [α-32P]ATP, rapidly producing a stoichiometrically equal amount of [α-32P]ADP when incubated with ATP. We also found that these preparations contain an ADP kinase activity, phosphorylating ADP to ATP in the presence of ATP. However, we subsequently found that the initial burst and ADP kinase activities are associated with a copurifying protein present in amounts that we could not detect by SDS-PAGE1 in the DnaK and HSP70 preparations. DnaK purified from cells with a disruption in the ndk gene, which encodes nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, had greatly reduced levels of the ADP kinase activity, showing that the activity is due primarily to the presence of copurifying nucleoside-diphosphate kinase in DnaK and HSP70 preparations. The presence of this protein likely accounts for results of two papers published while this study was in progress that report initial burst and ADP phosphorylation activities in DnaK preparations similar to those described in this work (1Banecki B.

Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The E. coli strains NA7623 and JC7623 were generously provided to us by the laboratory of Masayori Inouye. Strain NA7623 has the gene encoding nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (ndk) disrupted and is otherwise isogenic to JC7623. The ndk gene of NA7623 is disrupted by a kanamycin-resistance gene, which is inserted into itsEcoRI site as described (41Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The ΔdnaK52allele was transduced into both NA7623 and JC7623 by using P1(GW8306) lysate as described (42McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 764-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strains were TB3200 (ndk::km ΔdnaK) and TB3500 (ndk + ΔdnaK) and were transformed with the DnaK overexpression plasmid pJM6 (43McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bovine Hsc70, purified from bovine brain cells, was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The standard protocol for the purification of DnaK was similar to the method previously described (43McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with some modifications and was as follows. GW8320 (MC4100,ΔdnaK52 sidB1) cells (43McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) carrying the DnaK overexpressing plasmid pJM6 (pBS-Plac dnaK) (43McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were grown at 30 °C to late log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.6) in 2 liters of LB medium with ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. For experiments comparing DnaK purified fromndk + cells to DnaK purified fromndk::km cells, TB3520 was used to produce DnaK instead of GW8320 pJM6 and was grown in LB with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. TB3220 was used to produce DnaK in andk::km background and was grown in LB with ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. Expression of DnaK was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and the culture was shifted to 37 °C and incubated for another 1 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of Buffer L1 (10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) plus 24 ml of buffer L2 (20 mm spermidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm EDTA). The cell suspension was transferred into Oak Ridge centrifuge tubes and lysed by sonication (Heat Systems Sonicator XL, Farmingdale, NY). Following ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was collected, and protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (380 g/liter). The protein was pelleted by ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer B (25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), and dialyzed in a Spectra/Por Membrane molecular weight cut-off = 12,000–14,000 Da (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Los Angeles, CA) against Buffer B (300 ml) two times. The sample was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (250 ml) and resolved by running a linear 50 mm-550 mm KCl gradient over 500 ml in Buffer B. The fractions containing the highest amount of DnaK (as judged by SDS-PAGE) were pooled (50 ml), dialyzed against Buffer B (1000 ml), and applied to an ATP-agarose (Sigma, A2767) column (5 ml). The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer B plus 500 mm NaCl followed by 10 ml of Buffer B and eluted with 20 ml of Buffer B + 5 mmATP. The ATP-agarose eluent was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and free ATP was cleared from the column with Buffer B as judged by the return of theA 280 trace to baseline. DnaK was resolved by running a linear gradient of 50 mm-750 mm KCl over 30 ml in Buffer B. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, quick frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The DEAE-Sepharose FF and MonoQ columns were run on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. DnaK was judged to be >99% pure by the absence of any visible bands other than DnaK on a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. The concentration of DnaK samples was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay solution following the standard protocol. A DnaK sample whose concentration had been precisely determined by amino acid analysis (performed by the Biopolymers Laboratory at the M.I.T. Center for Cancer Research) was used as a standard in all DnaK concentration assays. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained ATPase Buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 11 mm Mg(OAc)2), [α-32P]ATP, or [γ-32P]ATP and DnaK. Radiolabeled ATP stocks were made by adding radiolabeled ATP to unlabeled ATP to give a final activity of 82.6 μCi/ml. The total concentration of ATP was recalculated following the addition of the radiolabeled ATP. Unless otherwise indicated, the ATP and ATPase Buffer were mixed and preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of DnaK, marked as t = 0 in the assays. When present in the reaction mixture, ADP and ovalbumin were preincubated with the ATP prior to the addition of DnaK. The reaction was incubated in a water bath at 30 °C and was stopped at various times by spotting 2 ml of the reaction onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate (J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ). Spotting the mixture on the TLC plate stopped the reaction immediately, as reactions quenched with 1 N HCl prior to spotting and reactions spotted without chemical quenching show the same extent of hydrolysis. The TLC plate was developed in 1 mformic acid, 0.5 m LiCl, dried, and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics storage phosphor screen. Data was obtained using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 Si and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.0. The amount of each radiolabeled species present was determined by volume integration. The data were corrected for the level of background hydrolysis (typically 1% or less). The extent of hydrolysis was expressed as the fraction of ADP or Pi to total nucleotide, or further calculations were made to determine the velocity of the reaction. The velocity of the ATPase reaction in terms of pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min was determined by multiplying the measured Pi/(ATP + Pi) ratio by the starting amount of ATP in the reaction (indicated in the corresponding figure for each reaction) and dividing by time. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained ATPase Buffer, [8-14C]ADP, ATP, and DnaK. Radiolabeled ADP stocks were made by adding radiolabeled ADP to unlabeled ADP to give a final activity of 4.00 μCi/ml. The total concentration of ADP was recalculated following the addition of the radiolabeled ADP. The ATP, ADP, and ATPase Buffer were mixed and preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and ADP phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of the DnaK sample, marked as t = 0 in the assays. When CDP was used as a phosphate acceptor, the procedure used was exactly the same as above, except that [2-14C]CDP was mixed with unlabeled CDP to make the radiolabeled CDP stock. The reaction was incubated in a water bath at 30 °C and was stopped at various times by spotting 2 μl of the reaction onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate. The TLC plate was developed and analyzed exactly as for the ATPase assays described above. The extent of ADP phosphorylation was expressed as the fraction of ATP to total nucleotide, or further calculations were made to determine the velocity of the reaction. The velocity of the ADP kinase reaction in terms of pmol of ADP phosphorylated/min was determined by multiplying the ATP/(ATP + ADP) ratio by the starting amount of ADP in the reaction. The starting concentrations for each reaction were: ADP = 61.2 μmand ATP = 400 μm. When necessary, serial dilutions of the sample were made in ATPase Buffer to obtain a measurable activity. Nucleotide was removed from DnaK by a method similar to that previously described for Hsc70 (49Gao B. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2048-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DnaK was saturated with AMP-PNP (5 mm) in a total volume of 2 ml and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. To remove free AMP-PNP, the sample was applied to a G-25M desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10 column) equilibrated with Buffer B and eluted with 3.5 ml of Buffer B. The sample was dialyzed in a Spectra/Por Membrane molecular weight cut-off = 12,000–14,000 Da against Buffer B (700 ml) three times. The dialyzed sample was applied to a MonoQ column and eluted with a double linear gradient of 50–225 mm KCl over 7.5 ml followed by 225–435 mm KCl over 45 ml in Buffer B. A plasmid was constructed to express NDP kinase with an amino-terminal tag of 10 histidine residues. Two 30-mer primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. designed to amplify the ndk gene from genomic E. coli DNA based on the known sequence of the gene (50Hama H. Almaula N. Lerner C.G. Inouye S. Inouye M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and include a 5′-NdeI and a 3′-BamHI restriction site. TheNdeI-ndk-BamHI product was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The amplification product was purified by subjecting it to agarose gel electrophoresis and by extracting its band using a QIAquick polymerase chain reaction purification kit (Qiagen). The purified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-linearized pET-16b plasmid (Novagen) to create the plasmid pET-16b/ndk. The pET-16b/ndk plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysSE. coli cells to create the strain TB2000. The TB2000 cells were grown in 800 ml of LB with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.6) and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to overexpress His-tagged NDP kinase (Ndk-N-His). Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 1× binding buffer, low salt (5 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and lysed by sonication. Debris was removed from the lysed cells by ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm, 20 min., 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to a 2.5 ml His-Bind immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (Novagen) equilibrated with 1× binding buffer, low salt. For co-purification experiments, the column was washed with 10 ml of 1× binding buffer, low salt followed by 10 ml of 0.5× wash buffer, low salt (30 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9). The gel bed was then resuspended in 0.5× wash buffer, low salt, and the gel suspension was transferred into a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech XK16 column. The XK16 column was attached to a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system, and the gel bed was settled with 0.5× wash buffer, low salt at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A linear gradient of 30–500 mmimidazole was then run over 30 ml in 0.5× wash buffer, low salt, and 1-ml fractions were collected. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Fractions from the Ndk-N-His purification were collected, and a 10-μl aliquot of each sample was mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), incubated in a boiling water bath for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred from the gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and antibody reactions and chemiluminescent detection were performed using a “Western Lights” kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) as described in the manual. The antibody used was affinity purified rabbit α-DnaK (1:5000 dilution). Protein sequencing was performed at the M.I.T. Biopolymers Laboratory. The sample was loaded onto a Applied Biosystems PreSorb sample preparation cartridge with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The sample was then sequenced with an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer. In the experiments described below, we used DnaK that we had purified from DnaK-overproducing E. coli cells by a method that involves three primary chromatographic steps: DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange, ATP-agarose affinity, and MonoQ anion exchange columns. This method is basically the same one used by other groups in the field (e.g. 35, 44, 45). Our preparations of DnaK were determined to be >99% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. ATPase assays using our preparations of DnaK showed that the rate of [α-32P]ADP production appeared constant over time when the molar amount of [α-32P]ATP in the assay was 100-fold or more greater than the molar amount of DnaK. However, when the molar amount of [α-32P]ATP was less than 100-fold greater than the molar amount of DnaK, an initial burst of [α-32P]ADP formation became apparent. When the amount of [α-32P]ATP was only severalfold greater than the amount of DnaK in the assay, the rate of [α-32P]ADP formation clearly showed biphasic kinetics: an initial burst of [α-32P]ADP formation within the first min followed by a much slower steady-state rate of ADP formation. [α-32P]ATP was incubated with several different concentrations of DnaK at 30 °C, and the amount of ADP produced was measured over time (Fig. 1 A). For our preparations of DnaK, the magnitude of the initial burst of ADP production increased directly with the amount of DnaK in the assay. From the results presented in Fig. 1 A, the sizes of the initial bursts were determined by interpolation to be 1.39 μm, 2.87 μm, and 5.13 μm of ADP for 1.44 μm, 2.88 μm, and 5.77 μm of DnaK, respectively. Thus, the molar size of"

Initially the human autoimmune serum was used to select a cDNA of 317 amino acids from a hamster expression library. Using the hamster DNA as a probe, we isolated the human homologous cDNA of 320 amino acids. Human and hamster polypeptides share a 95% amino acid homology. The deduced 36-kDa protein contains a putative amino-terminal NLS signal, nine cysteine-X-X-cysteine motifs highly conserved, and a carboxyl-terminal poly acidic region. Several homologous expressed sequence tags have been identified in data bases suggesting that orthologous proteins are present throughout evolution from worms to humans. A Drosophila expressed sequence tag was further completely sequenced for a full-length protein with 60% amino acid identity to the human homologue. Northern blot analysis revealed that this novel protein is widely distributed in human tissues with significantly higher expression levels in heart and skeletal muscle. Specific antibodies to the recombinant protein and transfection experiments demonstrated by immunofluorescence the localization of the protein predominantly but not exclusively to the nucleolus of interphase mammalian cells. In actinomycin D-treated cells the protein remains associated with the nucleolus but is not segregated, like other ribosomal factors such as upstream binding factor. In mitosis the protein was found to be associated with centromeres and concentrated at the midbody in cytokinesis. Transient distribution of this evolutionarily conserved zinc finger nucleolar autoantigen to the mitotic centromeres may provide the means for several aspects of cell cycle control and transcriptional regulation.

Examples of human autoantibodies directed against nuclear complexes are: (i) anti-RNP sera against specific components involved in the mechanism of processing heterogeneous nuclear RNA into messenger RNA (4Steitz J.A.

Recent new studies have also defined mitotic and meiotic roles for the nucleolus in cell cycle control and gene regulation (9Garcia S.N. Pillus L. Cell. 1999; 97: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In humans, proteins containing zinc finger motifs (10Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar) represent one of the largest known gene families (11Bellefroid E. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Poncelet D.A. Belayew F. Martial A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that up to 1% of all genes in the human genome may encode proteins with zinc finger domains (12Hoovers J.M. Mannens M. John R. Blick J. Van Heyningen V. Porteous D.J. Leschot N.J. Westerveld A. Little P.F. Genomics. 1992; 2: 254-263Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although the structure of a large number of these molecules has been characterized (13Klug A. Rhodes D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Kaptein R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In light of their number, their widespread localization throughout the genome, and their putative role as transcriptional activators, as well as repressors (17Sauer F. Jäckle H. Nature. 1991; 353: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), zinc finger factors form an attractive group of candidate disease genes. We describe here NOA 36 (forNucleOlar Autoantigen), a novel human gene identified by a human anti-NOR serum (18Rendón M.C. Rodrigo R.M. Goenechea L.G. Garcı́a-Herdugo G. Valdivia M.M. Moreno F.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Goenechea L.G. Rendón M.C. Iglesias C. Valdivia M.M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 841-851PubMed Google Scholar). Human, hamster, and fly cloned cDNAs showed a very high sequence homology to a number of ESTs found in several data bases. The deduced protein sequence significantly showed nine highly conserved CXXC motifs indicative of several putative zinc fingers. Immunolocalization of the protein in culture of mammalian cells indicated an association with the interphase nucleolus and a transient relocation to the mitotic centromeres and the midbody. The finding of this new centromere passenger component may contribute to the study of the role of the nucleolus in cell cycle control. CHO (CCL-61), HeLa (CCL-2.2), and 3T3 (CCL-92) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For ribosomal transcription inhibition, CHO cells at 75% confluence were treated with actinomycin D (0.02 μg/ml) for 4–8 h prior to the IF analysis. Human anti-NOR autoimmune serum has been described in a previous report to react at the electron microscopy level with the dense fibrillar component of nucleoli and NOR regions of mitotic chromosomes (18Rendón M.C. Rodrigo R.M. Goenechea L.G. Garcı́a-Herdugo G. Valdivia M.M. Moreno F.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Anti-SM (a gift of Ian Mattaj, EMBL, Germany) is a monoclonal to a major spliceosome antigen. A λ ZAP cDNA expression library of CHO cells (Stratagene) was screened with a human autoimmune serum against the NOR region. This serum had previously been shown to recognize the ribosomal factor UBF as a major autoantigen (18Rendón M.C. Rodrigo R.M. Goenechea L.G. Garcı́a-Herdugo G. Valdivia M.M. Moreno F.J. Exp.

Isolated NOA 36 hamster clones were sequenced for a full-length cDNA by chain termination reaction (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.S. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.42-13.77Google Scholar) using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (GenBankTM accession number for hamster NOA 36is Y12837). The hamster DNA NOA 36 gene was used as a probe to select clones from a HeLa λ ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) (GenBankTM accession number for human NOA 36 isAJ006591). The cDNA sequences were analyzed using the data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) and the BLAST and PROSITE programs were used to search sequence data bases. A Drosophila EST (GenBankTM accession numberAA978679) was obtained from Genome System and sequenced for a full-length NOA 36 cDNA (our GenBankTMaccession number AJ131564). The Northern transfers of RNAs derived from several human tissues were purchased from Invitrogen andCLONTECH and used according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. The DNA template used in the preparation of the radiolabeled probe was a 427–1423-nucleotide fragment of humanNOA 36 cDNA. The probe was used for hybridization at 60 °C overnight in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Washes were twice in 2 × SSC 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and once in 0.1 × SSC 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. A β-actin cDNA was used as a control probe. Truncated hamster NOA 36 polypeptide of 226 amino acids (residues 39–265) was expressed in the pET 3a system in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm), and inclusion bodies were partially isolated under denaturing conditions. Proteins from inclusion bodies were resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE and the specific NOA 36 band was cut out from the gel, eluted in PBS-0.1% SDS, dialyzed against PBS, and used for immunization. For immunoblots, the expressed NOA 36 polypeptide and protein extracts from HeLa and CHO culture cells were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by routine methods (21Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). As primary antibodies, rabbit anti-NOA 36, human anti-NOR autoimmune serum, rabbit anti-UBF serum, or rabbit preimmune were used at appropriate dilutions. Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Roche Diagnostics) were used as the second-stage reagent and chloronaphthol was used to develop the blots. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS (anti-NOA 36 at 1:400 dilution) at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were then washed with PBS for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with fluorescein/rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody at 37 °C for 45 min. After the second antibody staining, the cells were washed twice in PBS and mounted in PBS-glycerol containing Hoechst 33342 at 0.1 μg/ml. In some experiments, double IF analysis was done using human anti-NOR serum (dilution 1:200) for UBF or mouse anti-SM (dilution 1:300) as primary antibody together with rabbit anti-NOA 36 (Fig. 5). For transient transfection, human NOA 36 full-length cDNA was fused by polymerase chain reaction upstream of GFP on vector pGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to generate NOA 36-GFP, and the DNA constructs were purified over Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc.). CHO-transfected cells seeded onto coverslips were grown for 24–48 h before being fixed in acetone for 5 min at −20 °C and mounted in PBS-glycerol for GFP autofluorescence observation. A Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a 63 × NA 1.3 oil-immersion objective was used routinely. Images were taken using T-max Kodax 400 ASA film. Human autoimmune anti-NOR sera have previously been found to stain nucleolar organizer regions and to serve for the cloning and immunological characterization of UBF, the ribosomal transcription factor for RNA polymerase I (7Chan E.K. Imai H. Hamel J.C. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Bolı́var J. Goenechea L.G. Grenett H. Pendón C. Valdivia M.M.

Here we have extended our previous studies with a human anti-NOR serum by cloning and sequencing a hamster cDNA encoding a novel protein of 317 amino acids. This probe was further used to select human homologue cDNAs from a HeLa λ ZAP expression library. The largest human cDNA isolated (Fig. 1) showed an initial ATG preceded by several stop codons in the same frame, suggesting that the complete open reading frame has been identified (GenBankTM accession number AJ006591). This was also correlated with several orthologous EST sequences found in various data bases where the first methionine residue is at the same position as in the human and hamster cDNAs characterized. The complete human open reading frame has 320 amino acid residues for a predicted molecular mass of 36,260 daltons. The analysis of the novel sequence showed a potential nuclear localization signal (PKKK—RKK) at the NH2-terminal region, highly conserved cysteines and histidines residues for several putative zinc fingers, and a poly acidic region at the C-terminal. These domains are widely found in regulatory proteins that have been shown to be implicated in transcription control and/or regulation (22Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) and nucleolar localization (23Schmidt-Zachmann M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Analysis of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic profile of the protein (Fig. 1 B) indicates a predominant hydrophobic part of the molecule between amino acids 50 and 200, and secondary structure analysis predicts that this protein is primarily a coiled coil (Fig. 1 C). Data base searches using PROSITE, BLAST, and FASTA homology indicate that NOA 36 shares homology with a number of ESTs sequenced from various species, from nematodes to mammals (Fig. 2). As shown, NOA 36 shares significantly nine CXXC motifs for four putative zinc fingers of the C2-C2 type and high internal sequence similarity to those ESTs. Complete sequence analysis of the Drosophila EST identified (GenBankTM accession number AA978679) served to us to characterize the full-length of the fly cDNA (our GenBankTM accession number AJ131564 for Dm in Fig. 2). The homology between the human NOA 36 deduced amino acid sequence and other NOA 36 proteins is as follows: 95% identity with hamster cDNA, 98.1% with mouse EST1, 90.2% with mouse EST2, 60.7% with Drosophila EST, and 63.2% with the nematodeBrugia malayi EST. The high conservation throughout the protein sequence suggests that these might be orthologues (26Fitch W.M. Syst. Zool. 1970; 19: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 27Mushegian A.R.

A. 1998; 95: 6239-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). No sequence similarity to NOA 36 was found in yeast proteome, for which the whole genome has been sequenced. This is not surprising because, although almost equal fractions of the human disease genes had regions of significant similarity to nematode and to yeast proteins, a recent study (27Mushegian A.R. Garey J.R. Martin J. Liu L.X. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) identified true orthologues in the complete yeast proteome for only 20% of human proteins.FIG. 2Amino acid sequence comparison of human, hamster, and Drosophila NOA 36 homologues with several ESTs. The homology shared between NOA 36 orthologues is shaded ingray. Species are indicated by the following abbreviations:Hs, human (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAJ006591); Cg, hamster (GenBankTM accession number Y12836); Dm, fly (GenBankTM accession number AJ131564); Mm, mouse (GenBankTM accession numbers AA796666 and AA240412); Bm, worm (GenBankTM accession number AA032099). Mouse and nematode EST sequences were translated to a reading frame encoding NOA 36. Translated amino acid sequences from several human ESTs at the data bases (GenBankTM accession number H82458 and N21079) matched exactly several regions of our cloned NOA 36cDNA. Conserved cysteines in CXXC motifs aredarkly shaded.

A putative NLS signal is underlined, and a double underline indicates the conserved poly acidic region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The molecular characterization of NOA 36 was begun by examining its mRNA levels in various human tissues. Two mRNA blots (Invitrogen, CLONTECH) were proved with radiolabeled NOA 36 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, theNOA 36 transcript is expressed as a unique species of 1.8 kilobases in all tissues examined. However it is noteworthy that the expression varied substantially between tissues, being clearly higher in heart and skeletal muscle. The same result was obtained when hamster mRNAs from various tissues were also analyzed (data not shown). Although the significance of the variation in the level of NOA 36 expression in heart and skeletal muscle is at present unknown, one possibility is that it may be related to higher protein synthesis and/or protein metabolism requirements in those tissues. A detailed analysis of the cysteine residues organization in NOA 36 primary sequence indicated that the new protein shares putative zinc finger motifs at residues 42–109 and 129–193 with the consensus sequence, . . . . . .CX2C. . . . . CX2C. . . . . .CX5C. . . . . CX2CNNNNC. . . . ., described previously for the steroid hormone receptor family. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the cysteine-rich motifs found in NOA 36 are of the GATA CXXC type family (29Kelley C. Blumberg H. Zon L.I. Evans T. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 817-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these structural concordances, it appears that the zinc-binding motifs of NOA 36 may be compatible with a nucleic acid-binding function, although, as demonstrated for other transcription factors containing CXXC motifs, an alternative protein-protein interaction for those domains could not be ruled out. The human autoimmune serum used in this study served initially to select cDNAs from a hamster expression library. Therefore the serum was expected to contain autoantibodies directed to the nucleolar NOA 36 autoantigen. Western blot using recombinant polypeptides and immunofluorescence analysis with specific anti-NOA 36 serum allowed us to demonstrate that NOA 36 is a truly human autoantigen. Specifically, the human autoimmune anti-NOR serum reacts by immunoblots with the full-length and with a NH2-terminal polypeptide of human NOA 36 (Fig. 4 A, right), as does a rabbit polyclonal anti-NOA 36 generated against a recombinant form of the autoantigen (Fig. 4 A, center). Furthermore, using protein extracts from HeLa and CHO cells, we were able to detect, among the putative autoantigens recognized by the human anti-NOR serum, a 38-kDa band (Fig. 4 B, center), which is similar in molecular weight to that recognized by the anti-NOA 36 in hamster and human cells (Fig. 4 B, left). We have observed that the native NOA 36 polypeptide runs more slowly than expected in SDS-PAGE gels (40–38 kDa), probably due to a posttranslational modification in the molecule. Note that, as demonstrated previously (19Goenechea L.G. Rendón M.C. Iglesias C. Valdivia M.M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 841-851PubMed Google Scholar), the main reactivity of the human autoimmune anti-NOR serum used in this study was against the UBF transcription factor for RNA polymerase I (90–92-kDa polypeptides), as shown by specific anti-UBF serum (Fig. 4 B,right). The observation that NOA 36 is a human autoantigen raises interesting questions about its putative linkage with specific autoimmune responses in humans. The generation of autoantibodies and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune diseases. Although the origin of autoimmune diseases is not yet known, several hypothesis, including the processing of cellular antigen during apoptosis, have been put forward and clues have been found (31Sinha A.A. Lopez M.T. McDevitt H.O. Science. 1990; 248: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 32Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Ahearn J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Petri M. Schlissel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). With that in mind, studies to identify the human autoepitope(s) in the NOA 36 polypeptide and the distribution of NOA 36 on in vitro induced apoptosis in culture cells are in progress. Furthermore, future studies with additional anti-NOR sera will be interesting to pursue, to clarify the significance of this new autoantigen in the specific NOR autoimmune response in humans. To determine the cellular localization of NOA 36, specific antibodies were used by IF in several mammalian cell lines. In interphase cells, anti-NOA 36 sera produced a clear nucleolar staining in all cell lines analyzed, including CHO, 3T3, and HeLa (Fig. 5, A–C). As shown, the nucleolar staining was high and similar in rodent cells and significantly less intense in HeLa cells. The explanation for this could be that the immunogen used to generate the specific anti NOA 36 serum was a truncated hamster recombinant protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). High cytoplasmic staining above the background signals observed with preimmune serum was also unequivocally found in all the cell lines tested; this may also represent specific localization of the autoantigen. A similar pattern of NOA 36 fluorescence was seen with cells that had been fixed with either methanol, acetone, and formaldehyde, although more diffuse nuclear staining was evident with formaldehyde-fixed cells (data not shown). The nucleolar localization of the novel autoantigen was demonstrated by double IF analysis with UBF a genuine nucleolar factor (7Chan E.K. Imai H. Hamel J.C. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Rendón M.C. Rodrigo R.M. Goenechea L.G. Garcı́a-Herdugo G. Valdivia M.M. Moreno F.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Goenechea L.G. Rendón M.C. Iglesias C. Valdivia M.M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 841-851PubMed Google Scholar). Double staining with anti-UBF and NOA 36 sera demonstrated the co-localization of both proteins at the nucleolus (Fig. 5, D–F). However, we observed a NOA 36 fluorescence pattern dispersed throughout most of the nucleoli structure, whereas UBF has been described in previous reports to be located at the dense fibrillar component (18Rendón M.C. Rodrigo R.M. Goenechea L.G. Garcı́a-Herdugo G. Valdivia M.M. Moreno F.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a control, double staining with anti-SM serum for splicing factors (Fig. 5,G–I) excluded NOA 36 for nuclear compartments other than the nucleoli. In an attempt to demonstrate further the cellular localization of NOA 36, we transfected human NOA 36 cDNA in hamster (CHO) cells. The GFP was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the NOA 36 human full-length cDNA. NOA 36-GFP fluorescence was also found in the nucleolus, which confirmed the IF results and the specificity of the anti-NOA 36 serum (Fig. 5,J and K). The strong staining also observed at the cytoplasm of transfected cells may indicate overexpression of the transfected construct, although specific localization of a significant amount of NOA 36 at the cytoplasm could not be ruled out, as suggested by the indirect IF results (Fig. 5, A–C). To investigate further the association of NOA 36 with the nucleolus, we performed IF studies in culture cells treated with actinomycin D for ribosomal transcription inhibition. This drug produces nucleolar segregation of the formless fibrillar, granular areas and chromatin in compact nucleoli. As expected and as shown in Fig. 6, the UBF factor moves from the dense fibrillar centers to the edges of the nucleolus (Fig. 6 B). This fibrillar cap observed at the nucleoli in actinomycind-treated cells has been shown previously to contain RNA polymerase I, fibrillarin, and UBF (6Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Spohn W.H. Busch H. Biol. Cell. 1985; 54: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Goenechea L.G. Rendón M.C. Iglesias C. Valdivia M.M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1992; 38: 841-851PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, NOA 36 fluorescence staining at the nucleolus was apparently diminished after the drug treatment (Fig. 6 A) and was concentrated at the center of the nucleolus in regions where UBF was excluded after transcription inhibition (see details in Fig. 6, C–H). This unambiguously indicates that NOA 36 remains associated with the nucleolus but is not co-localized with UBF after the drug treatment. The IF localization of NOA 36 is similar to that described for other nucleolar components characterized previously (34Ochs R.L. Stein T.W. Chan E.K.L. Ruutu M. Tan E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) and suggests that NOA 36 is probably associated with the granular component of the nucleolus, although this still has to be demonstrated by a detailed immunoelectron microscopy analysis. Alltogether these immunolocalization analysis let us to speculate that NOA 36 participates as a component of a heterogeneous antigen complex at the nucleolus responsible for some rare (NOR) autoimmune responses in humans (33Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Petri M. Schlissel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 36Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, the immunolocalization of NOA 36 surprisingly reveals its association with the centromeres of chromosomes during the mitotic cell cycle (Fig. 7). Staining of different stages of mitosis showed several fluorescence dots at the tips of moving chromosomes, a typical feature of the centromere/kinetochore region (Fig. 7, a–f). This was corroborated by double fluorescence staining with a CREST serum to centromere proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, in nocodazole-treated cells the NOA 36 autoantigen remains attached to the centromere in blocked condensed chromosomes (data not shown). One stage further in the cell cycle, in cytokinesis, NOA 36 has returned to the reformed nucleolus, although staining was also concentrated within the intracellular bridge at either side of the midbody (Fig. 7 h). It is well known that centromere/kinetochore assembly is a cell cycle-dependent process that is based on the temporary interaction of multiple components of the complex. This conclusion has been supported by the discovery of a subset of kinetochore proteins that bind transiently to the kinetochore as it matures. Among these proteins are CENP-F (37Rattner J.B. Rao M.J. Fritzler D.W. Yen T.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), CENP-E (38Yen T.J. Compton D.A. Wise D. Zinkowski R.P. Brinkley B.R.

Nature. 1990; 345: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins (41Wells W.A.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Now, NOA 36 can be added to the increasing number of proteins that move to the centromere and to the intracellular bridge at telophase (42Fishkind D.J. Wang Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The transient localization of NOA 36 at the nucleolus and mitotic centromeres could be related to some of the new roles postulated for the nucleolar dynamic. Localization of a nucleolar component to heterochromatic structures (centromeres and telomeres) is a known phenomenon (9Garcia S.N. Pillus L. Cell. 1999; 97: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Haber J.E. Cell. 1999; 97: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the convergence of silencing of heterochromatic regions and nucleolar proteins and support the idea that the nucleolus and silenced heterochromatin may in fact be privileged regulatory sites of gene expression. If NOA 36 as a passenger protein re-locating from interphase nucleoli to mitotic centromeres, performs a function in cell cycle regulatory mechanisms, this is a role that could now be investigated.

While Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor has probably a “chemokine clearance” function, because it does not transduce in response to chemokine binding (2Darbonne W.C. Rice G.C. Mohler M.A. Apple T.

CXCR2 also induces activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 and phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of Crk-associated substrate (5Schraw W.

GROβ is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils, and has growth regulatory activities on alveolar epithelial, capillary endothelial cells, and melanocytes (7Driscoll K.E. Hassenbein D.G.

Moreover, chemokines and their receptors are expressed in different regions of the central nervous system: human cerebellar neurones stain positively for CXCR2 and Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor, which are expressed mainly in Purkinje cells and in neurite processes projecting to Purkinje cells (10Horuk R.

For all these reasons, primary cultures of cerebellar granules have been chosen to study the biochemical pathways activated by GROβ treatment of homogeneous populations of cerebellar neurones. While previous reports demonstrated that, in addition to PLC, chemokine signaling can occur via phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 activation (15Sozzani S. Agwu D.E. Ellenburg M.D. Locati M.

We also report that GROβ mediates the activation of the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and that this effect is not influenced by A-SMase inhibitors.

Der (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cerebellar granule cells were obtained from 8-day-old Wistar rats (17Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and cultured in basal Eagle's medium containing 25 mm KCl and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were used after 8 days of culture when they had fully differentiated. Most of the experiments were comparably carried out in Locke's solution (154 mmNaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, buffered with 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) or in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm glucose. Rat granule cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After extensive washing, primary antibody was applied as indicated by the supplier and incubated at 4–8 °C in PBS. Cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat affinity purified secondary antibody (Sigma). The samples were routinely examined with a microscope (Dialux, Leica, Northvale, NJ) equipped with a ×50 objective. Confocal analysis was carried out with a Leica TCS 4D system, equipped with a 100 × 1.3–0.6 oil immersion lense. Cerebellar granule cells were scraped off the plate in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF, sonicated for 5 s on ice with a probe sonicator (Bandelin, Germany), and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper at 4 °C for 2 h. Blots were incubated for 1 h with 5% non-fat dry milk to block nonspecific binding sites and then incubated with affinity purified rabbit antibody to CXCR2 (K-19). The immunoreactivity was detected with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL). Fluorescence determinations were made using a real time confocal laser microscope (Odyssey, Noran Instruments, Redwood City, CA) equipped with an argon laser and interfaced to an upright microscope (Axioscope, Zeiss, Germany). The unit was driven by Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). An excitation wavelength (λ) of 488 nm was used and emission was monitored at λ > 515 nm, with a confocal slit of 100 μm. The laser beam was set at 30% intensity, with minimum power. Real time acquisition was performed at an effective resolution of 20 Hz. Granule cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min with the dye Ca2+-Green-1 AM (4–5 μm), extensively washed with medium and transferred to the stage of the confocal microscope for fluorescence recording. Images were captured in a video recorder (Sony VO 9600P, Japan) for further analysis. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration induced by GROβ was expressed as the ratio of fluorescence increase after treatment/basal fluorescence (ΔF/F). Cells were continuously superfused with external medium. For this and the following assays the concentration of GROβ was 60 nm, which gave the most reproducible results. Agonists were applied by a gravity-driven perfusion system using independent external pipettes connected to a fast exchanger system (RSC-100, BioLogic, France). Primary cultures of rat granule cells (8-day-old) were incubated for 2–3 h in PBS and stimulated with GROβ. To investigate the effect of the phospholipase inhibitor U73122, this compound was given (10–30 μm) to cells for 30 min before GROβ stimulation. At various times, the reaction was stopped by adding 15% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (1:1 v/v). Inositol phosphates were extracted as described (18Pacini L. Limatola C. Frati L. Luly P. Spinedi A. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and InsP3 mass determination was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells labeled for 4 h with 250 nCi of [1-14C]arachidonic acid were washed and reincubated for 1 h in PBS. When necessary, U73122 was applied for 30–60 min before GROβ stimulation. Labeled cells were stimulated with GROβ and, at fixed times, the reaction was blocked by the addition of ice-cold methanol. Lipids were extracted and analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography as described (18Pacini L. Limatola C. Frati L. Luly P. Spinedi A. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Spots comigrating with authentic DAG standard were scraped off the plates and quantified by scintillation counting. Rat granule cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml of l-[3-14C]serine for 48–72 h in the culture medium. After this time, cells were washed and starved for 2 h in PBS, and stimulated with GROβ for different times from 2 min to 2 h. Reactions were blocked with ice-cold methanol, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described (19Limatola C. Barabino B. Nista A. Santoni A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Granule cells were incubated for 1–2 h in PBS and stimulated with GROβ. To study the effect of inhibitors on SMase activation, cells were preincubated for different times (from 30 min to 2 h) and stimulated still in their presence. At fixed times, GROβ was removed and the reactions were stopped by addition of an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mm NaMoO4, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 750 μm ATP, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for N-SMase and 0.2% Triton X-100 for A-SMase. After a short incubation on ice, cells were scraped off the plates and sonicated for 5 s with a probe sonicator. Proteins were quantified by a BCA assay and the same amounts of proteins (50 μg) were incubated (37 °C/30 min) with 2 μl ofN-[methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (56 mCi/mmol) in 20 mm Hepes, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, for N-SMase and in 250 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5, for A-SMase. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 volumes of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (4:2:1); phospholipids were extracted and [14C]SM levels were quantified by scintillation counting after analysis on high performance thin layer chromatography plates. To study JNK1 activation, granule cells were stimulated in Locke's buffer with GROβ, C6-ceramide, or bacterial SMase for different times (from 15 to 30 min), after which the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin. Cell lysates, typically containing 100 μg of protein, were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with 0.5 μg of an affinity purified anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibody previously conjugated to Protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer containing: 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, and incubated in this same buffer in the presence of 5 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–223), 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm), at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was blocked with hot Laemmli buffer and the samples boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. The relative band intensity was determined by densitometry (Scan Jet 4C HP) and analyzed by computer (Sigma Gel software, Jandel Scientific). To study ERK phosphorylation, cells were preincubated for 1 h in Locke's buffer and then stimulated with GROβ for different times (from 5 to 60 min). For JNKs and p38 cells were stimulated as described above. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper at 4 °C for 2 h. Blots were incubated for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding sites and then for 2 h with the corresponding phospho-specific antibodies. The immunoreactivity was detected with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL). We investigated the expression of CXCR2 in rat cerebellar granules by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. Fig. 1 (Aand B) indicates that granule cells positively stain for CXCR2, revealing the presence of the receptor over the whole cell surface. The specificity of the staining was verified by labeling the cultures with antibodies to CXCR2 preincubated with the CXCR2 peptide used as immunogen (Fig. 1, C and D). CXCR2 expression was further confirmed by Western blot analysis, that revealed the presence of a major protein band (40 kDa) recognized by a specific CXCR2 antibody, as shown in Fig. 2. Normal rabbit IgG was used for controls (not shown).FIG. 2Expression of CXCR2 in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Western blot analysis, performed with a polyclonal antibody to CXCR2.

Molecular weight markers are indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3 A shows the time course of InsP3 accumulation that peaks at 1 min after cell stimulation, reaching 197.5 ± 20.5% of control values, and declining thereafter. We have also investigated the accumulation of DAG in cells prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid. A similar kinetics of [14C]DAG accumulation was observed upon GROβ stimulation (Fig. 3 B): after 1 min of GROβ treatment, [14C]DAG reached 171 ± 4% of control values, remaining above basal values for at least 5 min. Experiments were also performed to study the effect of U73122, a PIP2-PLC inhibitor, on GROβ-mediated InsP3and [14C]DAG accumulation. Cell pretreatment for 30 min with 10 μm U73122 almost completely abolished measurable [14C]DAG accumulation over basal levels, and greatly reduced InsP3 formation after 15 s with GROβ (54% inhibition). When U73122 was used at a concentration of 20 μm, InsP3 accumulation was even more reduced (70% inhibition). The basal levels of InsP3 were comparable both in control and U73122-treated cells. We investigated the Ca2+-mobilizing properties of GROβ on cerebellar granule cells. When bath applied to neurones loaded with Ca2+-Green 1 AM fluorescent dye, GROβ produced an increase of basal fluorescence with ΔF/F = 0.3 ± 0.01 (mean ± S.E.; 107 out of total 245 cells examined, 107/245). The fluorescence increase had a delay of 9 ± 0.5 s, and a time-to-peak, defined as the time from the baseline to peak amplitude, of 69 ± 4 s; the increase in [Ca2+] i was sustained for more than 500 s after chemokine withdrawal. A comparably long delay between CXCR2 stimulation and onset of the Ca2+ response was elsewhere described (20Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.L. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Representative examples of the fluorescence transient induced by GROβ are shown in Fig. 4. To investigate the possibility that GROβ induces the activation of SM hydrolysis, granule cells were prelabeled for 48 h with [14C]serine, and then exposed to GROβ (60 nm). The results are illustrated in Fig. 5. The hydrolysis of cellular [14C]SM begins within the first minutes of cell stimulation, and proceeds for about 90 min, diminishing thereafter (Fig. 5 A). Accordingly, upon GROβ stimulation there was an increase in [14C]ceramide. Cellular [14C]ceramide reached 125.6 ± 3.7% of control values after 15 min of GROβ and returned to control levels after about 90 min (Fig. 5 B). The levels of [14C]ceramide increase did not fully parallel the decrease in [14C]SM, probably because of its metabolism. When vehicle alone was given to cells neither SM nor ceramide levels were altered, for the time observed. To assess whether the hydrolysis of SM induced by GROβ was carried out by more than one type of SMase, we measured the activity of both N- and A-SMases, with an in vitro assay that makes use of the exogenous substrate [14C]SM. As shown in Fig. 6, the N-SMase activity is maximal after 15 min stimulation with GROβ, persists for the following 15 min, and returns to basal levels within 60 min. The activity of the A-SMase was more prolonged, lasting for about 60 min of cell stimulation, and decreased thereafter. Since the A-SMase can be activated by DAG (21Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16759-16762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the mechanism responsible for A-SMase activation upon GROβ stimulation is due to the accumulation of DAG that occurs during GROβ stimulation of rat granules. Accordingly, at concentrations between 20 and 30 μm, the PIP2-PLC inhibitor U73122 abolished GROβ-mediated A-SMase activation (Fig. 7), leaving unaffected the activation of the N-SMase. The polyether antibiotic monensin, an inhibitor of A-SMase because of its ability to alter the pH of endolysosomal compartments (22Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 23Boucher L.M. Wiegmann K. Futtorer A. Pfeffer K. Machleidt T. Schutze S. Mak T.W. Kronke M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2059-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), blocked completely GROβ-induced A-SMase activation at concentrations 0.5–1 μm (Fig. 7). Cell pretreatment for 2 h with imipramine (40 μm) or desipramine (20 μm), both inducing the degradation of cellular acid sphingomyelinase (24Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Grassmé H. Weller M. Koppenhoefer U. Dichgans J. Sandhoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E. Cell Death Diff. 1998; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), also inhibited the activation of A-SMase (Fig. 7). These effects were specific, because N-SMase was not affected by inhibitor treatment (not shown). In addition, neither monensin nor U73122 were effective on constitutive A-SMase activity (3 nmol of [14C]SM/h/mg of protein), while both imipramine and desipramine reduced basal activity (to 1.7 nmol of [14C]SM/h/mg of protein). Furthermore, monensin at 0.5–1 μm did not influence GROβ-induced InsP3accumulation (not shown). Higher doses of monensin (5–10 μm) damaged cells, and were not used. When the effect of monensin and U73122 was investigated on GROβ-stimulated [14C]serine-labeled cells, the variation in [14C]ceramide and [14C]SM levels were comparable to those observed in untreated cells (not shown).FIG. 7GROβ-induced A-SMase activation is inhibited by U73122, monensin, imipramine, and desipramine. Neurones were incubated for 1.5 h in PBS and incubated for further 30 min in the presence of either 30 μm U73122 or 1 μm monensin. Alternatively, cells were incubated for 0.5 h in PBS and incubated for 2 h with 40 μm imipramine or 20 μm desipramine. Cells were then stimulated with 60 nm GROβ in the presence of the inhibitors for 30 min, and samples were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Results are expressed as percentage of [14C]SM hydrolyzed by untreated cells (C, taken as 100%), and represent the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) JNK1 can be efficiently activated by exposing cells to a variety of perturbing agents like ionizing and ultraviolet radiations, peroxides, heat and osmotic shocks, as well as chemokines and inflammatory cytokines (26Kyriakis J.M.

We investigated JNK1 activation upon GROβ cell stimulation by following the phosphorylation of the fusion protein-specific substrate, GST-c-Jun (1–223). Fig. 8 shows that cell treatment for 15 min with GROβ induces the activation of JNK1 as evidenced by GST-c-Jun phosphorylation (166 ± 18% of control value, mean of four different experiments in duplicate ± S.E.Student's t test p < 0.02). A delayed rise was also observed at 60 min of cell stimulation when the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was 122.3 ± 3.8% of control value (mean of 20 separate experiments ± S.E. Student's ttest p < 0.0001). Recent evidence indicates that ceramide generated by different stressing signals can mediate JNK activation (27Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S.

Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accordingly, treating the granule cells for 30 min with 30 μm C6-ceramide induced JNK1 activation: 128 ± 6% (mean of five different experiments ± S.E., Student'st test p < 0.01) of control value. When the cells were stimulated by 50 units/ml bacterial SMase for 30 min, the phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was again increased over the control. These data would suggest that the effect of GROβ on JNK1 may be mediated by ceramide. Interestingly, we observed that neither U73122 (not shown) nor imipramine or desipramine treatment (Fig. 9A) could block GROβ-induced JNK1 activation, suggesting that the activation of A-SMase is not necessary for this activation. The study with monensin was hampered by its effect on the basal kinase activity, while U73122, imipramine, and desipramine did not significantly alter basal JNK activity (data not shown). The observed GROβ-induced JNK1 activation was comparable when granule neurones were stimulated in Locke's medium or in basal Eagle's medium containing 25 mm KCl and 10% fetal calf serum, further indicating that the observed kinase activation was not due to the stress of nutrient withdrawal (data not shown). The activation of JNKs was further confirmed following GROβ-induced JNK phosphorylation with a phospho-specific Ab (Fig. 9 A). With the same approach we have also investigated the activation of ERKs and p38, and the results are shown in Fig. 9 B. GROβ-induced ERK activation in rat granule cells had been already shown in a previous paper (12Ragozzino D. Giovannelli A. Mileo A.M. Limatola C. Santoni A. Eusebi F. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3601-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with a kinase assay. Fig. 9 B also shows that p38 is not activated by 15 min GROβ treatment. The same results were obtained when cells were stimulated for different times (from 5 to 60 min, data not shown).FIG. 9GROβ effect on JNKs, ERKs, and p38 phosphorylation. A, granule neurones were pretreated for 2 h with the indicated inhibitors and then stimulated with GROβ for 15 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-phospho JNKs (upper panel). Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-JNK1 (lower panels) to verify total protein levels. B, granule neurones were stimulated for 15 min with GROβ as described under “Experimental Procedures” and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot to follow ERKs and p38 phosphorylation using anti-phospho specific antibodies (upper panel).

Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chemokines, and their receptors, have been found also in other tissues including the central nervous system (10Horuk R. Martin A.W. Wang Z. Schweitzer L. Gerassimides A. Guo H. Lu Z.

Pathol. 1997; 150: 617-630PubMed Google Scholar). The role of chemokines in the central nervous system during normal and pathological conditions is only recently emerging, but already some close correlations between their expression levels and clinical signs have been traced (31Ransohoff R.M. Tani M. Glabinski A.R. Chernosky A. Krivacic K. Peterson J.W. Chien H.F. Trapp B.D. Metods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Studies with transgenic animals expressing N51/KC, a neutrophil-specific chemokine, established that chemokine expression in the central nervous system is responsible for leukocyte trafficking from the vascular compartment (32Tani M. Fuentes M.E. Peterson J.W. Trapp B.D. Durham S.K. Loy J.K. Bravo R. Ransohoff R.M. Lira S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and that CXCR4 expression is essential for a functional cerebellar development (14Zou Y.R Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). In neural cells, CXCR4 also mediates human immunodeficiency virus type-1-induced apoptosis (33Hesselgesser J. Taub D. Baskar P. Greenberg M. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently suggested additional functions for the CXC chemokines IL-8 and GROα in the central nervous system, namely, the modulation of the synaptic functions of cerebellar Purkinje neurones (11Giovannelli A. Limatola C. Ragozzino D. Mileo A.M. Ruggieri A. Ciotti M.T. Mercanti D. Santoni A. Eusebi F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 92: 122-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To better understand the effects of chemokines on neuronal function and development, it is crucial to describe the set of biochemical pathways activated by these molecules. Here we show that cerebellar granule cells express functional CXCR2 and we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that a chemokine, namely GROβ, activates the SM pathway, with the involvement of both neutral and acid sphingomyelinases. This double activation, even though generating the same lipid second messenger ceramide, may subserve different cellular functions, as proposed for tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1 receptor signaling (34Hofmeister R. Wiegmann K. Korherr C. Bernardo K. Kronke M. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27730-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Peña L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since we have found CXCR2, a GROβ receptor, on granule neurones, we speculate that this receptor mediates the activation of the SMases. Although SM hydrolysis has been recently described for endothelin-1-stimulated rat small arteries (36Ohanian J. Liu G. Heagerty A.M. Kyriakis J.M. Ohanian V. Abstract at FEBS Special Meeting, Amsterdam, June 29 to July 3. Elsevier Science, The Netherlands1997Google Scholar), the activation of the SM cycle has not been shown to be mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, and the mechanisms involved in SMases activation are not known. We also show here that the activation of the A-SMase is dependent on the accumulation of cellular DAG, as reported for tumor necrosis factor-α receptor (22Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), because it is inhibited by U73122, that blocks PIP2-PLC activation. The ceramide produced by SMase activation plays important roles in the regulation of cell cycle arrest, growth, and differentiation (37Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar), and some of its intracellular targets have been identified, including a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (38Dobrowsky R.T.

Ceramide produced in granule neurones during GROβ stimulation could be involved in JNK1 activation, since both exogenous C6-ceramide and bacterial SMase induce JNK1 activation. Nevertheless, the observation that GROβ induces JNK1 activation even upon U73122, imipramine, and desipramine treatment, when A-SMase activity is inhibited, indicates that ceramide produced by this enzyme is not necessary to activate JNK1. Although the coordinated activation of the sphingomyelin pathway and JNK1 by stress induces apoptosis in a number of proliferating cell types (27Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D.

Primary cultures of cortical neurones (44Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Aibel L. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci.

In contrast, the activation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation have been shown to be essential for apoptosis of neurones deprived of growth factors (52Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

The effects of GROβ-induced SMase and JNK1 activation in rat granules is currently under investigation, since we observe that chemokine treatment modulates the survival of cerebellar granule neurones from cell death induced by potassium deprivation. 2C. Limatola, manuscript in preparation. Since recently ceramide has been also reported to modulate, in cultured oligodendrocytes, K+ channel, in aras-dependent way (55Hida H. Takeda M. Soliven B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8712-8719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and since glial cells express several chemokine receptors, among which CXCR2, chemokine-mediated ceramide generation could also be relevant in mediating the regulation of synaptic transmission. Data reported in these paper describe a novel signal transduction pathway for chemokines, and offer new perspectives to understand the role played by chemokines in the central nervous system during development, and in the response to local inflammatory conditions, when their level can increase severalfold (30Glabinski A.R.

https://openalex.org/W1969455728,"We investigated whether mouse short interspersed elements (SINEs) could influence the recombination frequency of foreign DNA. Vectors harboring a reporter gene in combinations of SINEs B1 and/or B2 or a portion of long interspersed element-1 were prepared and tested in vitro by a colony assay using HC11 murine mammary epithelial cells and in vivo by microinjection into fetilized mouse eggs. In transfected HC11 cells, the number of colonies surviving G418 selection increased by 3.5-fold compared with control when the reporter was flanked by fused B1-B2 sequences. Similar results were obtained from microinjection study; in fetuses 11.5 days post coitum, transgene positives in control and SINE-flanked vectors were 16 and 53%, respectively. Individual B1- and B2-harboring vectors showed equivalent activities with each other, as determined by the colony assay (2.8-fold versus 3.2-fold compared with control). We determined the contribution of homologous recombination to the SINE-mediated increase in integration frequency through a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy; in more than half of embryos transgenes underwent homologous recombinations involving B1 sequences. These results demonstrate that the SINE sequences can increase the integration rate of foreign DNA and that such an increase is most likely due to the enhancement of homologous recombination."

The ligand-free and ternary complex structures have been referred to as state I and state III conformers, respectively (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structure of the state I enzyme is incompatible with catalysis. The unfavorable properties include: (i) the PRPP site is exposed to solvent; (ii) an important arginine residue (Arg73) needed for glutamine binding is unfavorably positioned; and (iii) sites for glutamine hydrolysis and reaction of NH3 with PRPP are separated by a 16 Å solvent-exposed space. These barriers to catalysis are corrected in the structure of the state III enzyme-substrate ternary complex. A PRTase “flexible loop” (residues 326–350) has closed over the bound PRPP, thus protecting it from hydrolysis. Arg73 is optimally positioned for binding glutamine and the glutamine, and PRTase sites are connected by a 20 Å NH3 channel. However, the x-ray structures of the two enzyme conformers do not indicate how glutamine binds because in each conformer the glutamine site is closed thus restricting entry to the site. Thus, glutamine must initially bind to a different enzyme conformer. Recently, we have engineered enzymes containing a single tryptophan fluorescence reporter in positions that change conformation upon formation of the enzyme-substrate ternary complex (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Measurements of steady state and pre-steady state intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence have identified an intermediate state II enzyme·PRPP conformer. This conformer can catalyze the reaction of external NH3 with PRPP and can also bind glutamine with high affinity, in contrast to state I enzyme, which does not exhibit high affinity glutamine binding. Thus, PRPP binding transmits an interdomain signal to the glutamine site. From the differences seen in the x-ray structures of the inactive (state I) and fully active (state III) conformers, a structure-based model was developed to explain the interdomain signaling from the PRTase domain to the glutamine site (7Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar,8Krahn J.M. Structural Analysis of Catalytic and Regulatory Mechanism of E. coli Glutamine PRPP Amidotransferase.Ph.D. Dissertation. Purdue University, 1998Google Scholar). Briefly, PRPP binding initiates several large and small conformational changes, which include closure of the 30-residue flexible loop over the bound substrate, a 4° change in the hinge between glutaminase and PRTase domains, and a 7° rotation and 4 Å translation of the neighboring subunit at a molecular 2-fold axis adjacent to the PRPP site. Together these changes lead to reorganization of two structures in the glutaminase domain: a “glutamine loop” (residues 73–84) that includes the Arg73 that is critical for glutamine binding and a C-terminal helix (residues 471–492) that appears to block access to the glutaminase site in both state I and state III enzymes. Contacts between the flexible loop and glutamine loop were proposed to trigger the changes in the glutaminase domain. Here we report the construction and analyses of mutant enzymes to evaluate the structure-based mechanism for interdomain signaling. New tryptophan reporters in the glutaminase domain detect the interdomain signaling upon PRPP binding that was not detected previously (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Wild type E. coli glutamine PRPP amidotransferase was produced from plasmid pETpurF (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed by the method of Kunkelet al. (9Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Koukour R.A.

Ashford S.R. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity exactly as described previously (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glycerol (final concentration, 15%) was added to the enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, prior to storage at −20 °C. The specific activity of the wild type enzyme was approximately 60 units/mg determined by the glutaminase assay. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8.12 for a 1% solution (4Messenger L.J. Zalkin H. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3382-3392Google Scholar). The activity remained constant over a period of several months when stored at −20 °C. Two series of wild type and mutant enzymes were constructed and purified. One series of mutant enzymes was derived from the wild type, and each mutant differed only by the amino acid replacement indicated by the designation. A second series of enzymes was designed for assay of ligand binding using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. These enzymes were engineered to contain a single tryptophan residue in either the PRTase flexible loop (Trp345) (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the glutamine loop (Trp83), or the C-terminal helix (Trp482) (see Fig. 1). The flexible loop is in the PRTase domain, whereas the glutamine loop and the C-terminal helix are in the glutaminase domain. A parental enzyme with C1S/W290F/S345W mutations has been characterized and described (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C1S mutation prevents turnover of the enzyme-glutamine-PRPP ternary complex, whereas the W290F mutation removed the only tryptophan residue in the wild type enzyme. As a result of the C1S mutation, the enzyme had no glutaminase or Gln-PRA activity but retained NH3-PRA activity comparable with that of the wild type. To monitor structural changes in the glutaminase domain, enzymes with C1S/S83W/W290F and C1S/W290F/R482W mutations (Table I) were constructed in a similar way. Additional mutations to probe interdomain signaling were incorporated into the C1S/W290F/S345W parental enzyme (Table II) and into C1S/S83W/W290F and C1S/W290F/R482W enzymes (see Fig. 2).Table IFunctional properties for enzymes with a glutaminase domain tryptophan reporterEnzymePosition of mutationGlutaminaseK m GlnK d GlnK d PRPPGln-PRANH3-PRAunits/mgmmmmμmunits/mgunits/mgWTaWT, wild type.59.5 ± 7.21.57 ± 0.1NDbND, not determined because Trp290 in the wild type enzyme does not monitor changes in conformation (6).K d values for Gln and PRPP, determined with a C1S/W290F/S345W parental enzyme having no changes other than C1S in the glutaminase domain, are given in the first line of Table II.NDbND, not determined because Trp290 in the wild type enzyme does not monitor changes in conformation (6).K d values for Gln and PRPP, determined with a C1S/W290F/S345W parental enzyme having no changes other than C1S in the glutaminase domain, are given in the first line of Table II.51.6 ± 6.2152 ± 6.0S83WGln loop54.4 ± 1.811.5 ± 1.10.13 ± 0.111.9 ± 0.847.2 ± 6.3125 ± 5.0R482WC-terminal helix50.9 ± 0.86.04 ± 0.40.51 ± 0.055.68 ± 0.439.6 ± 2.2174 ± 9.6a WT, wild type.b ND, not determined because Trp290 in the wild type enzyme does not monitor changes in conformation (6Chen S.

All enzymes contained C1S and W290F mutations in addition to those listed. The C1S mutation prevented enzyme turnover.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two assays were used to measure the overall reaction shown by Equation 1. Glutamate and PRA production were determined as described (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The production of glutamate is referred to as a glutaminase activity in Table I and in the text. The assay of PRA production from glutamine and PRPP is referred to as Gln-PRA. In the standard glutaminase and Gln-PRA assays, V m conditions were achieved using 20 mm glutamine. For mutants having a highK m for glutamine, V m was extrapolated from a plot of velocity versus glutamine concentration. For some mutant enzymes, identified in Table I, assays were carried out using 100 mm glutamine. NH3-PRA refers to use of external NH3 for reaction with PRPP to yield PRA. For all assays one enzyme unit gives the production of 1.0 μmol of product/min at 37 °C. Specific activity is units/mg protein. Intrinsic fluorescence of Trp83, Trp345, and Trp482 was used to monitor conformational changes resulting from binding of PRPP or binding of glutamine to the enzyme·PRPP complex. The measurements were carried out at room temperature exactly as described (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using an SLM-8000C spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 300 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 410 nm or in some cases changes in fluorescence were measured at the 345 nm emission maximum following additions of ligand. The bandwidths for excitation and emission were 4 nm. To calculate K d, fluorescence data were fit to the equation F* = (K d +F m L)/(K d +L), where F* =F/F o; F o andF are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of ligands, respectively; F m is the maximum value of F*; L is the ligand concentration; and K d is the dissociation constant. The first glutamine PRPP amidotransferase half-reaction, hydrolysis of glutamine (Equation 2), is dependent upon binding of PRPP to the PRTase domain (4Messenger L.J. Zalkin H. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3382-3392Google Scholar, 5Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol.

Two factors limit glutamine binding to the ligand-free enzyme. First, a conformational change is needed to open the glutamine site to permit access of the substrate. Second, Arg73, which forms a salt bridge with the α-carboxyl group of glutamine (3Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) is improperly positioned for this interaction (2Muchmore C.R.A. Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Zalkin H. Smith J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in glutamine PRPP amidotransferase containing a single tryptophan reporter has been shown to detect sequential conformational changes resulting from binding of first PRPP and then glutamine to the enzyme (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence changes and fluorescence quenching of a Trp345 PRTase flexible loop reporter contributed to the identification of an intermediate state II enzyme·PRPP conformer having high affinity for glutamine. It was proposed that the glutamine site may be open in the state II conformer and that Arg73has been repositioned for glutamine binding. In the previous experiments, PRPP binding was not detected by changes in fluorescence emission of Trp82 and Trp477 reporters in the glutaminase domain, although small molecule quenching of tryptophan fluorescence suggested an altered environment for these reporters in the state II binary complex. Tryptophan residues have now been inserted into position 83 in the glutamine loop and into position 482 in the C-terminal helix to monitor structural changes in the glutaminase domain. The positions of Ser83 and Arg482 are shown in Fig. 1 for the two conformers. Data in Table I indicate that the S83W and R482W enzymes retained more than 70% of the wild type glutaminase, Gln-PRA, and NH3-PRA activities. The Trp83 and Trp482 fluorescence reporters were chosen from a survey of several tryptophan replacements in the glutaminase domain (data not shown). Incorporation of a bulky tryptophan side chain increased theK m value for glutamine 7- and 4-fold in the S83W and R482W enzymes, respectively (Table I). However, given the nearly wild type activity, the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp83 and Trp482 was used to monitor changes in the glutaminase domain in response to substrate binding. Data in Fig. 2 (A and B) show that binding of PRPP quenched the fluorescence of the Trp83and Trp482 reporters by about 25%. Because the site for PRPP binding is 27 Å from Trp83 and 19 Å from Trp482 (measured from C1 of PRPP to Cα atoms), direct interaction with PRPP cannot account for this fluorescence quenching. Rather, interdomain signaling from the PRPP site likely changed the conformation and altered the microenvironment of the Trp reporters in the glutaminase domain. Binding of glutamine to the state II binary enzyme·PRPP complex to form the state III ternary enzyme·substrate complex further quenched the fluorescence of the tryptophan reporters by about 20%. In the absence of PRPP, glutamine binding was not detected. The fluorescence changes in the Trp83 glutamine loop and Trp482 C-terminal helix reporters were used to calculate K d values for PRPP and glutamine, which are given in Table I. The K d for PRPP binding was increased about 4-fold in the S83W enzyme and 2-fold in the R482W enzyme relative to a parental enzyme with a Trp345 reporter (compare data in Table I with line 1 in Table II). In addition, theK d values for glutamine binding in the S83W and R482W enzymes varied only 2-fold from a parental Trp345enzyme having only a C1S mutation in the glutaminase domain (compare Table I with line 1 in Table II). Thus, the S83W and R482W Trp reporters in the glutaminase domain detected the binding of PRPP and glutamine without major disruption of substrate binding or catalysis. The resulting fluorescence changes in the glutaminase domain therefore can be used to monitor interdomain signaling and the state II conformation. From x-ray crystal structures of the state I and state III conformers, it was concluded that interdomain signaling results from closing of the PRTase flexible loop, initiated by PRPP binding, and the ensuing contact of the flexible loop with the glutamine loop (7Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An interaction of the methyl group of Ile335 in the flexible loop with the aromatic ring of Tyr74 in the glutamine loop seen in the active state III conformer (Fig. 1) may have signaled the repositioning of the glutamine loop and the C-terminal helix. However, from the state I and state III crystal structures it was not possible to assess the individual contribution that binding of each substrate made to the overall change in conformation. To assess the consequences of perturbing this interaction on interdomain signaling, we have constructed and analyzed a series of mutations of Ile335and Tyr74 as well as other residues that contribute to signaling and to glutamine binding. Ile335and Tyr74 are invariant residues in more than 20 glutamine PRPP amidotransferase sequences. I335A and I335V replacements were constructed to give hydrophobic side chains of differing size. As shown in Table II, the enzyme with an I335V replacement retained 80–90% of its capacity to hydrolyze glutamine and to transfer the resulting NH3 to the PRTase domain for synthesis of PRA. Values for glutamine K m and K d, given in Table II, provide direct evidence for a signaling defect. As shown in Table II, the K d for binding of PRPP to the valine mutant was unchanged from the wild type. However, values forK d and K m for glutamine were increased 60- and 25-fold, respectively, relative to the wild type. Thus, the binding of glutamine, but not PRPP, was perturbed by the I335V substitution, indicative of the signaling defect. The Trp83 glutamine loop reporter and the Trp482C-terminal helix reporter also detected the glutaminase domain signaling defect because of the I335V mutation. As shown in Fig. 2(E and F), the Val335 replacement interfered with the quenching of Trp83 and Trp482 fluorescence by PRPP binding that normally occurred in the parental enzymes containing Ile335 (Fig. 2,A and B). However, both of the mutant enzymes retained the capacity to bind glutamine and form a ternary complex. Thus, as reported by the microenvironment of the glutaminase domain Trp reporters, PRPP binding to the I335V enzyme led to an altered state II conformer, which, however, still retained the capacity to bind and hydrolyze glutamine. The NH3-PRA activity of the I335V enzyme was only approximately 20% that of the wild type activity, although theK m for NH3 was unchanged (data not shown). The decreased activity might result from an altered structure of the glutamine loop because of interaction of Tyr74 with Val335 rather than with Ile335 in the wild type. According to the current model, external NH3 enters the channel via the glutamine site (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Amino acid replacements in the glutamine domain also perturb NH3-PRA activity (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ile335 with Ala nearly disabled the enzyme. The three measured activities were reduced to 3% or less compared with the wild type enzyme. Although the K d for PRPP binding was similar to that for the wild type, transmission of the binding signal to the glutamine site was defective, as seen by the nearly 50-fold decrease in glutaminase activity (Table II) and by the fluorescence emission signal of the glutaminase domain Trp reporters (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast to enzyme with Ile at position 335 there was no decrease in Trp83 or Trp482 fluorescence when glutamine was added to the I335A enzyme·PRPP complex. Similar results were obtained with enzyme containing a Trp345 flexible loop reporter (data not shown), indicating that the K d was too high to detect glutamine binding under these conditions. Thus, the glutamine site Trp reporters as well as the flexible loop Trp reporter sensed PRPP binding, but the normal state II conformation was not achieved, and glutamine could not bind to the defective binary complex. The reduction in NH3-PRA activity in the I335A enzyme (Table II) suggests a structural defect in the NH3 channel resulting from replacement of the large hydrophobic side chain. Because the channel lacks a scaffold of hydrogen bonds, amino acid replacements with large change in volume, such as I335A, may result in a substantially different channel structure. Inhibition of NH3-PRA activity in the I335A enzyme may even be due to a complete blockade of NH3 entry to the channel. The role of Tyr74 was probed by mutations to Phe and to Ala. The Y74F mutant was characterized by increases inK d and K m for glutamine of 29- and 12-fold, respectively, whereas the K d for PRPP binding was unchanged from the wild type enzyme (Table II). These data reflect a signaling defect. The comparable reduction in Gln-PRA and NH3-PRA activity in the Y74F enzyme suggests that in addition to a role in signaling, Tyr74 is needed for the structure of the NH3 channel. The signaling defects in the Y74A mutant were exacerbated compared with the Phe replacement as shown by the low glutaminase activity, undetectable Gln-PRA activity, and the inability to detect glutamine binding by fluorescence titration. Binding of PRPP to the Y74A enzyme was unchanged from the wild type. Decreased NH3-PRA activity could be due to either a problem of NH3 entry at the glutamine site or a defect in the NH3 channel. According to the crystal structures of the state I and state III enzyme conformers, one role of interdomain signaling is to reposition residues, especially Arg73, to achieve high affinity glutamine binding. In contrast, residues required to catalyze glutamine hydrolysis (Cys1, Asn101, and Gly102) are positioned identically in state I and state III. According to this conclusion, mutations in residues required for glutamine binding should have a similar phenotype to signaling mutants. To test this conclusion Arg73 and Thr76 mutants were constructed. Arg73 and Thr76 are conserved residues in the glutamine loop that interact with the glutamine α-carboxylate (5Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data in Table II show that although PRPP binding was not perturbed in an R73A enzyme, the K d for glutamine binding was too large to detect. As a consequence there was a large decrease in the glutaminase activity of the R73A enzyme. Although the Gln-PRA activity was too low to detect, synthesis of PRA from external NH3was 60% that of the wild type enzyme, indicative of a functional NH3 channel. Similar perturbations in K m and V m values for glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities were obtained earlier for R73H and R73L enzymes (5Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thr76 Oγ also forms a hydrogen bond with the α-carboxyl of the glutamine substrate, although its position is not dependent upon the Ile335-Tyr74 interaction (5Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Krahn J.M. Structural Analysis of Catalytic and Regulatory Mechanism of E. coli Glutamine PRPP Amidotransferase.Ph.D. Dissertation. Purdue University, 1998Google Scholar). The T76A enzyme has increased K d (14-fold) andK m (9-fold) for glutamine, similar to the Y74F enzyme, supporting roles of both Thr76 and Tyr74 in glutamine binding. However, the lower glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities of T76A relative to the Y74F enzyme suggest that the direct interaction of Thr76 with glutamine is important to catalysis. Replacement of Thr76 with Ala (Table II) or Ser (data not shown) resulted in modestly higher NH3-PRA activity relative to the wild type. There was no change inK m for NH3 (not shown). The increase in NH3-PRA activity, although small, was reproducible and supports the earlier suggestion (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that small amino acid side chains in the glutamine loop facilitate access of external NH3 to the NH3 channel. Amino acid residues in a 404–420 peptide sequence and in the C-terminal helix (positions 471–492) contribute to closing of the glutamine site in the state I ligand-free enzyme and in the state III enzyme-substrate ternary complex (2Muchmore C.R.A. Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Krahn J.M. Structural Analysis of Catalytic and Regulatory Mechanism of E. coli Glutamine PRPP Amidotransferase.Ph.D. Dissertation. Purdue University, 1998Google Scholar). Structural changes resulting from PRPP and glutamine binding that were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence may have roles in opening and closing of the site to control access of glutamine and exit of glutamate. To assess functional interactions, we have mutated residues in the 404–420 peptide and the C-terminal helix that may participate in this aspect of the signaling between the PRPP and the glutamine sites. In the active state III but not in the inactive state I conformer, the backbone N of Asp408 forms a hydrogen bond with the ring OH of Tyr74 (Fig. 3). In addition, the Asp408 carboxyl group interacts with Nε and NH2 of Arg482 and with the Lys487side chain in the C-terminal helix. Arg482, in turn, hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl groups of Gly78and Pro75 in the glutamine loop, thus providing an additional link between the primary Ile335-Tyr74 interaction and the glutamine site (Fig. 3). Although Asp408 does not interact directly with the glutamine substrate, the primary defect in the D408A enzyme was a decreased binding affinity for glutamine. The glutamineK d was increased 11-fold in the D408A enzyme. However, upon saturation with glutamine the rate for glutaminase was similar to that of the wild type enzyme. The phenotype of the D408A enzyme is most like that of Y74F, suggesting that the hydrogen bond between the backbone N of Asp408 and OH of Tyr74 is important for glutamine binding and that this interaction does not occur in the D408A enzyme. Interestingly, the glutamine binding affinity was only slightly perturbed in the R482A (Table II) and R482W (Table I) enzymes. Thus, the interactions of Arg482 with Asp408 and with the glutamine loop residues are not essential for communicating the PRPP binding signal to the glutamine site. On the other hand, a deletion of the C-terminal helix (Δ476–505 enzyme) totally abolished glutamine binding and glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities, whereas about one-third of the NH3-PRA activity was retained. This result points to an essential role for the C-terminal helix in the function of the glutamine site but not in NH3 channel function. In the transition from state I to state III, two hydrogen bonds are lost and five are gained from side chains in the C-terminal helix to residues elsewhere in the structure. It is possible that some of the other residues forming these hydrogen bonds (Asp484, Asp485, Lys487, and Arg491) are important to the essential function of the C-terminal helix. Two glutamine PRPP amidotransferase half-reactions take place at physically separated sites in glutaminase and PRTase domains. In the state I ligand-free enzyme the two catalytic sites are disconnected by a 16 Å solvent exposed space, the flexible loop is open and poorly ordered, the PRPP site is solvent accessible, and the glutamine site is closed. PRPP binding triggers a series of conformational changes, which make the resulting state II enzyme conformer competent to utilize external NH3 for synthesis of PRA and to bind glutamine. In this work the state II conformer was detected by changes in fluorescence of tryptophan residues in two glutamine site positions and by activation of the glutamine site upon binding of PRPP to the PRTase domain. Activation was assessed by the K d for glutamine binding and by glutamine K m, glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities. According to the current structure-based model (7Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Krahn J.M. Structural Analysis of Catalytic and Regulatory Mechanism of E. coli Glutamine PRPP Amidotransferase.Ph.D. Dissertation. Purdue University, 1998Google Scholar), the state I to state II transition requires several steps. First, binding of PRPP initiates closing of the PRTase flexible loop over the PRPP site and formation of the NH3 channel to deliver external NH3, entering via the glutamine site, for reaction with PRPP (6Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These steps were monitored previously by changes in fluorescence emission of the Trp345 flexible loop reporter. Next, an interaction between the closed flexible loop and the glutamine loop must reposition Arg73 for high affinity glutamine binding and interactions between the glutamine loop, the C-terminal helix, and the 404–420 peptide must open the glutamine site. Although the precise order and structure of these changes has not been determined and is therefore speculative, they result in the state II conformer in which the PRPP binding signal has been communicated to the glutamine site. Additional changes of 4° in the interdomain hinge and 7° in the neighboring subunit orientation occur between state I and state III and may also influence state II. The analyses of mutant enzymes supports the structure-based insights into the molecular interactions for interdomain signaling. A principal signaling interaction is between the side chains of Ile335 in the flexible loop and Tyr74 in the glutamine loop. Modest changes in either side chain, Ile335to Val or Tyr74 to Phe, resulted in significant increases in K d and K m for glutamine, although the glutaminase V max was not significantly altered. However, replacement of either residue to alanine essentially abolished glutamine binding. It is noteworthy that each of the three tryptophans that were monitored, Trp345, Trp83, and Trp482, detected the same state II structure. That is to say, neither the Trp83 nor the Trp482 glutaminase domain reporters sensed PRPP binding in the Val335 signaling mutant. In the more disruptive Ala335 signaling mutant, fluorescence changes of the Trp345, Trp83, and Trp482 reporters each monitored a defective state II conformer that could not bind glutamine to form the state III ternary complex. The results of enzyme characterization indicate that, in addition to the signaling contact, Ile335 and Tyr74 have at least one other function. Lower Gln-PRA activity relative to glutaminase activity in the Y74F and I335V enzymes suggests less efficient transfer of NH3 through the NH3channel to the PRPP site. There were also large decreases in NH3-PRA activity. These changes are consistent with defects in the NH3 channel. Ile335 and Tyr74 form one wall of the NH3 channel. Because the NH3 channel structure is dependent upon hydrophobic amino acid side chains, replacements of these residues could alter or block the channel. Two factors, however, complicate the analysis of channel function. First, because NH3-PRA activity likely depends on entry from the glutamine site as well as transfer through the channel, changes of NH3-PRA activity should be viewed in parallel with changes in Gln-PRA activity. Changes in NH3-PRA activity that exceed changes in Gln-PRA may reflect perturbation of NH3 entry at the glutamine site. Second, the function of the NH3 channel was difficult to evaluate in Y74A and I335A mutants because glutamine hydrolysis was so severely inhibited. In the absence of glutamine hydrolysis, the values for Gln-PRA are noninformative. It is therefore difficult to distinguish between defects because of NH3 entry and those because of channel function to explain low NH3-PRA activity in the Y74A and I335A mutant enzymes. Analyses of previous replacements of Tyr74 led to the similar conclusion that Tyr74 is a key residue in the coupling between sites for glutamine and PRPP in the two domains (5Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although the molecular interactions were not recognized because the crystal structure for the active state III enzyme ternary complex was not yet available. In addition to the enzymes with Tyr74 and Ile335 replacements, the 2-fold reduction in the ratio of glutaminase to Gln-PRA activity in T76A and D408A enzymes suggests a perturbation in the channeling of NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis to the PRPP site. However, the high NH3-PRA activity in the T76A enzyme indicates normal channel function for delivery of external NH3 to the PRPP site. A further analysis of channel function is in progress and will be reported elsewhere. In another class of mutants (R73A and the C-terminal helix deletion Δ476–505), a functioning NH3channel formed upon PRPP binding, but glutamine binding was abolished. These mutants and others discussed above show that channel formation, signaling, and glutamine binding are separable events, although several residues contribute to more than one event. Signaling from a second domain or subunit to a glutamine site to activate glutamine hydrolysis is typical in glutamine amidotransferases. For example, binding of ATP and bicarbonate to the large subunit of E. coli carbamoyl phosphate synthetase large subunit stimulates thek cat for glutamine hydrolysis at a site about 45 Å removed in the small enzyme subunit (11Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Likewise, binding of chorismate to the anthranilate synthase component I subunit stimulates glutamine hydrolysis by the component II subunit by more than 30-fold (12Goto Y. Zalkin H. Keim P. Heinrickson R.L. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 941-949Google Scholar). In neither of these cases nor in other glutamine amidotransferases has the signaling mechanism been determined. More generally, interdomain or intersubunit signaling may be an essential feature in enzymes with physically separated active sites connected by a tunnel. Intersubunit signaling between tryptophan synthase active sites in α and β subunits has been described in a series of elegant studies recently reviewed by Miles et al. (13Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Tryptophan synthase signaling is accompanied by channelling of indole through a largely hydrophobic intersubunit tunnel, with similarities to the channelling of NH3 through the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase tunnel.

Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Ras proteins act as molecular switches that couple membrane-bound receptors to intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation. Within cells, ras proteins exist in either a GTP-bound (“on” state) or a GDP-bound (“off” state) form. The level of the active, GTP-bound form results from the balance of the competing activity of GTPase activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF)1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Lowy D.R.

Oncogenic versions of p21 ras are found mostly in the GTP-bound form either because of a reduced GTPase activity or because of an increased GDP/GTP exchange.The prototypes of ras-specific GEFs are the product of the yeastCDC25 gene (6Martegani E. Baroni M.D. Frascotti G. Alberghina L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2363-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its close homologue SDC25 (7Damak F. Boy-Marcotte E. Le-Rosquet D. Guilbaud R. Jacquet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the first protein of this class for which ras-specific GEF activity was demonstrated (8Crechet J.B. Poullet P. Mistou M.Y. Parmeggiani A. Camonis J. Boy-Marcotte E. Damak F. Jacquet M. Science. 1990; 248: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two ras-specific GEF classes have been identified in mammalian cells. One class, whose cDNA was originally isolated by functional complementation of a cdc25 mutant ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, has been called CDC25Mm and is mostly brain-specific (9Martegani E. Vanoni M.

Zippel R. Martegani E. Vanoni M. Denis-Donini S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human and rat CDC25Mm homologues have also been isolated (11Shou C.

Jacquet M. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1477-1485PubMed Google Scholar). The other class, Sos-GEF, has been isolated on the basis of homology with the Son of Sevenless gene of Drosophila melanogaster (13Simon M.A. Bowtell D.D.L. Dodson G.S. Laverty T.R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and is expressed ubiquitously. Both GEFs are large, multi-domain proteins; despite their different structural organization, the two catalytic domains are approximately 70% homologous. The differences in structural organization reflect the involvement in different signal transduction pathways. Sos has been shown to work downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors (14Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 15Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) whereas CDC25Mm may interact with trimeric G protein-coupled receptors (16van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). More recently a role for CDC25Mm in synaptic transmission and long-term memory has been proposed (18Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herro C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.-P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). CDC25Mm has been shown to be affected by calcium levels (19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E.

Deregulated expression of either a full-length GEF or its catalytic domain has been shown to induce cell transformation in different experimental systems (21Zippel R. De Maddalena C. Porro G. Modena D. Vanoni M. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar, 22Egan S.E. Giddins B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Mutational analysis of residues involved in GEF·ras interactions gave insights on the role of ras residues involved in interaction with GEF molecules (24Mistou M. Jacquet E. Poullet P. Rensland H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8117-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Camus C. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Jacquet M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 951-959PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Only in the last year, however, have a detailed kinetic analysis of the GEF·ras cycle (31Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and the structure of a ras·GEF complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) been published, setting the basis for a clearer understanding of the complex molecular events responsible for ras activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors.Dominant-negative mutants in small G proteins have become increasingly popular as tools in signal transduction studies. However, very few dominant-negative exchange factors have been described so far. One class comprises GEF molecules deleted in their catalytic domains, and their dominant-negative properties are most likely due to non-productive binding to upstream regulators, which results in interruption of signal transmission and failure to activate ras. This kind of mutant has been described in both Sos (33Sakaue M. Botwell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and CDC25Mm (17Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). A second and potentially more interesting dominant-negative class comprises mutants in the catalytic domain that are still able to bind ras but are unable to induce guanine nucleotide exchange. So far only one mutant of this class has been described in the yeast GEF CDC25, with the only evidence for this mutant acting as a dominant-negative mutant being an approximately 2-fold reduction in growth rate in yeast overexpressing the mutant CDC25 (30Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Here we show that the mutations of either tryptophan 1056 or threonine 1184 in CDC25Mm, two residues which, on the basis of the published structure of the Sos·p21 ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), are located at the interface with ras in proximity of its nucleotide-binding site, yield molecules with dominant-negative properties. Both mutants are catalytically inactive, bind ras with great avidity, and form a stable complex in vitro even in the presence of excess nucleotide, a condition where little, if any, complex is formed by ras with wild-type GEF. Expression in vivo of the GEFs down-regulates the ras pathway both in mouse fibroblasts (as determined by inhibition of the expression of a ras-responsive fos-luciferase promoter) and in vascular smooth muscle cells in which growth rate and DNA synthesis (events known to be ras-dependent) are severely inhibited by expression of one of the two mutants. The two mutants may be useful both as tools for the study of the ras signal transduction pathway and as lead compounds to develop drugs that are able to down-regulate signal transduction.DISCUSSIONThe major role for guanine nucleotide exchange factors in ras activation seems that of facilitating nucleotide release. The preferential binding of GTP over GDP appears to be due to the higher intracellular GTP concentration (45Frascotti G. Coccetti P. Vanoni M. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The interaction between GEF and ras has to be sufficiently strong to displace the bound nucleotide and weak enough to allow entry of the nucleotide and disruption of the binary GEF·ras complex. Mutational events may alter this fine-tuned equilibrium, originating mutants with different properties. In this report we presented some biochemical and physiological properties of two dominant-negative mutants of the ras-specific GEF CDC25Mm. Both mutants also form complexes with p21 ras in the presence of excess guanine nucleotides, i.e. conditions where no p21 ras · GEF complex can be detected with wild-type GEF.A few different mechanisms may originate a dominant-negative GEF mutant. 1) The ternary complex (ras·GDP·GEF) remains stable, thus not allowing nucleotide exit and formation of the binary complex between nucleotide-free ras and GEF. 2) The mutant GEF binds nucleotide-free ras with increased affinity. 3) The binary complex between the mutant GEF and nucleotide-free ras has a diminished affinity for the incoming nucleotide. Both mechanisms 2 and 3 would result in an increased stabilization of the binary complex between nucleotide-free ras and GEF, allowing the formation of a stable complex under conditions where the complex would normally be disrupted by the presence of nucleotides. The experiments reported in Figs. 1 B and 2 indicate that mechanism 1 cannot be responsible for the dominant-negative properties of the W1056E and T1184E mutants, because the bound nucleotide is readily displaced by both mutant GEFs. Experiments reported in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly indicate that both mutations reduce the affinity of the binary complex for the incoming nucleotide, resulting in a similar stabilization of a binary complex. Taken together, these data suggest a rationale for the properties of the mutants.The recent elucidation of the hSos·p21 ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) has started to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying GEF action. Firstly, a helical hairpin of hSos displaces the p21 ras -bound nucleotide by inducing a dramatic conformational change in the so-called “switch 1” region of ras. Because Sos does not directly occlude the nucleotide-binding site, except in the region where the terminal phosphate groups and the magnesium ion are bound, the incoming nucleotide can displace the GEF molecule by competing for the groups that bind the phosphate groups and the magnesium ion. Because of the extensive primary structure homology between the catalytic domains of Sos and CDC25Mm, the general fold is likely to be conserved between the two GEF molecules. So, it is possible to speculate on the properties of the T1184E and W1056E mutants on the basis of the published structure of the hSos/ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To explain the biochemical dominant-negative properties of the W1056E and T1184E mutants we suggest that introduction of a glutamic acid at either position 1056 or 1184 allows formation of a novel salt bridge with a p21 ras residue involved in nucleotide binding. An attractive candidate is Lys16; this residue takes part in binding to the GTP-β and -γ phosphates, and its mutation to glutamine significantly reduces affinity of the mutant p21 ras for nucleotides, thus turning it into a dominant-negative mutant (46Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Temeles G.L. Wolanski B.S. Socher S.H. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the ras/Sos complex, ras Lys16 is in close proximity to ras residues 59 to 62. Trp809 and Thr935, hSos1 residues equivalent to CDC25Mm Trp1056 and Thr1184, respectively, interact with residues 59, 60, and 61 and are at a similar distance from ras Lys16. Thus, even small local structural perturbations induced by the W1056E and T1184E mutations might bring mutant Glu1056 or Glu1184 residues and Lys16 close enough to interact. Local perturbations may easily be expected when amino acids with very different biochemical properties are substituted in critical positions. In particular, removal of the bulky tryptophan 1056 may leave an unflavored “cavity” which needs to be filled in by the substituting glutamate, thus bringing in close proximity residues that are relatively far away in the ras·wild-type GEF complex. In this scenario Glu1056 or Glu1184 in the mutated GEFs would compete exceedingly well with GTP-β and -γ phosphates for binding to ras Lys16. As a result, the affinity of the mutant GEF·ras complex for guanine nucleotides would be lowered, resulting in the observed strong stabilization of the mutant GEF/p21 ras complex also in the presence of high nucleotide concentrations. In vivo this scenario is likely to be affected by other interfering factors. It has in fact recently been reported that both ras regulators and effectors, such as GTPase activating proteins, raf, and phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (47Giglione C. Parrini M.C. Baouz S. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25128-25134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48Giglione C. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34737-34744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) may have an inhibitory effect on GEF-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange.In mammalian cells expressing mutant GEF, the ras pathway is strongly down-regulated, as expected for a dominant-negative mutant. Down-regulation can be detected both under basal conditions (starved cells) and conditions of activation of the ras pathway brought about by either PDGF or serum stimulation. In vivo data (obtained both with the yeast complementation and fibroblastfos-luciferase assays) stress the importance of residue 1124 in modulating the penetrance of W1056E and T1184E mutations. Most notably, when an alanine is present at position 1124, the effect of the W1056E mutation is abolished. This behavior is not peculiar to the CDC25Mm protein, because similar observations were made when the corresponding mutations were introduced in the yeast CDC25 protein (unpublished results).Reduction of cell proliferation observed in CDC25MmW1056Etransfected vascular smooth muscle cells further suggests the functional role of the GEF-negative mutant as an inhibitor of ras-dependent pathways. CDC25MmW1056Eintracellular expression specifically inhibited smooth vascular cell proliferation while having no effect on cellular morphology. The anti-proliferative effect of the CDC25Mm-negative mutant is consistent with previous studies in which the intracellular expression of either a dominant-negative form of ras or microinjection of neutralizing ras antibody exhibited a decrease in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (49Irani K. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Mulcahy L. Smith M. Stacey D. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells constitutes the major pathological event responsible for the development of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (51Virmani R. Farb A. Burke A.P. Am. Heart J. 1994; 127: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several clinical studies have reported coronary restenosis after angioplasty to be as high as 45% within three to six months (52McBride W. Lange R.A. Hillis L.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and no effective treatment for restenosis is presently available. The feasibility of regionally transferring plasmid DNA into vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo has been reported (53Ohno T. Gordon D. San H. Pompili V.J. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G.

Transfection of a dominant-negative ras mutant significantly reduced rat neointima formation after vascular injury (5Indolfi C. Avvedimento E.V. Rapacciuolo A. Di Lorenzo E. Esposito G. Stabile E. Feliciello A. Mele E. Giuliano P. Condorelli G. Chiariello M. Nat.

Ras proteins are highly conserved guanine nucleotide proteins, endowed with intrinsic low GTPase activity (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Ras proteins act as molecular switches that couple membrane-bound receptors to intracellular signaling pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation. Within cells, ras proteins exist in either a GTP-bound (“on” state) or a GDP-bound (“off” state) form. The level of the active, GTP-bound form results from the balance of the competing activity of GTPase activating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF)1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 2Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol.

Oncogenic versions of p21 ras are found mostly in the GTP-bound form either because of a reduced GTPase activity or because of an increased GDP/GTP exchange. The prototypes of ras-specific GEFs are the product of the yeastCDC25 gene (6Martegani E. Baroni M.D. Frascotti G. Alberghina L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2363-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its close homologue SDC25 (7Damak F. Boy-Marcotte E. Le-Rosquet D. Guilbaud R. Jacquet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the first protein of this class for which ras-specific GEF activity was demonstrated (8Crechet J.B. Poullet P. Mistou M.Y. Parmeggiani A. Camonis J. Boy-Marcotte E. Damak F. Jacquet M. Science. 1990; 248: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two ras-specific GEF classes have been identified in mammalian cells. One class, whose cDNA was originally isolated by functional complementation of a cdc25 mutant ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, has been called CDC25Mm and is mostly brain-specific (9Martegani E. Vanoni M.

Zippel R. Martegani E. Vanoni M. Denis-Donini S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human and rat CDC25Mm homologues have also been isolated (11Shou C.

Jacquet M. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1477-1485PubMed Google Scholar). The other class, Sos-GEF, has been isolated on the basis of homology with the Son of Sevenless gene of Drosophila melanogaster (13Simon M.A. Bowtell D.D.L. Dodson G.S. Laverty T.R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and is expressed ubiquitously. Both GEFs are large, multi-domain proteins; despite their different structural organization, the two catalytic domains are approximately 70% homologous. The differences in structural organization reflect the involvement in different signal transduction pathways. Sos has been shown to work downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors (14Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 15Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) whereas CDC25Mm may interact with trimeric G protein-coupled receptors (16van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). More recently a role for CDC25Mm in synaptic transmission and long-term memory has been proposed (18Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herro C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.-P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). CDC25Mm has been shown to be affected by calcium levels (19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E.

Deregulated expression of either a full-length GEF or its catalytic domain has been shown to induce cell transformation in different experimental systems (21Zippel R. De Maddalena C. Porro G. Modena D. Vanoni M. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar, 22Egan S.E. Giddins B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar). The GEF·ras cycle has been studied extensively in recent years. Mutational analysis of residues involved in GEF·ras interactions gave insights on the role of ras residues involved in interaction with GEF molecules (24Mistou M. Jacquet E. Poullet P. Rensland H. Gideon P. Schlichting A. Wittinghofer A. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Crechet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although much less information was available on the involved GEF residues (28Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8117-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Camus C. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Jacquet M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 951-959PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Only in the last year, however, have a detailed kinetic analysis of the GEF·ras cycle (31Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and the structure of a ras·GEF complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) been published, setting the basis for a clearer understanding of the complex molecular events responsible for ras activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Dominant-negative mutants in small G proteins have become increasingly popular as tools in signal transduction studies. However, very few dominant-negative exchange factors have been described so far. One class comprises GEF molecules deleted in their catalytic domains, and their dominant-negative properties are most likely due to non-productive binding to upstream regulators, which results in interruption of signal transmission and failure to activate ras. This kind of mutant has been described in both Sos (33Sakaue M. Botwell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and CDC25Mm (17Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). A second and potentially more interesting dominant-negative class comprises mutants in the catalytic domain that are still able to bind ras but are unable to induce guanine nucleotide exchange. So far only one mutant of this class has been described in the yeast GEF CDC25, with the only evidence for this mutant acting as a dominant-negative mutant being an approximately 2-fold reduction in growth rate in yeast overexpressing the mutant CDC25 (30Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Here we show that the mutations of either tryptophan 1056 or threonine 1184 in CDC25Mm, two residues which, on the basis of the published structure of the Sos·p21 ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), are located at the interface with ras in proximity of its nucleotide-binding site, yield molecules with dominant-negative properties. Both mutants are catalytically inactive, bind ras with great avidity, and form a stable complex in vitro even in the presence of excess nucleotide, a condition where little, if any, complex is formed by ras with wild-type GEF. Expression in vivo of the GEFs down-regulates the ras pathway both in mouse fibroblasts (as determined by inhibition of the expression of a ras-responsive fos-luciferase promoter) and in vascular smooth muscle cells in which growth rate and DNA synthesis (events known to be ras-dependent) are severely inhibited by expression of one of the two mutants. The two mutants may be useful both as tools for the study of the ras signal transduction pathway and as lead compounds to develop drugs that are able to down-regulate signal transduction. DISCUSSIONThe major role for guanine nucleotide exchange factors in ras activation seems that of facilitating nucleotide release. The preferential binding of GTP over GDP appears to be due to the higher intracellular GTP concentration (45Frascotti G. Coccetti P. Vanoni M. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The interaction between GEF and ras has to be sufficiently strong to displace the bound nucleotide and weak enough to allow entry of the nucleotide and disruption of the binary GEF·ras complex. Mutational events may alter this fine-tuned equilibrium, originating mutants with different properties. In this report we presented some biochemical and physiological properties of two dominant-negative mutants of the ras-specific GEF CDC25Mm. Both mutants also form complexes with p21 ras in the presence of excess guanine nucleotides, i.e. conditions where no p21 ras · GEF complex can be detected with wild-type GEF.A few different mechanisms may originate a dominant-negative GEF mutant. 1) The ternary complex (ras·GDP·GEF) remains stable, thus not allowing nucleotide exit and formation of the binary complex between nucleotide-free ras and GEF. 2) The mutant GEF binds nucleotide-free ras with increased affinity. 3) The binary complex between the mutant GEF and nucleotide-free ras has a diminished affinity for the incoming nucleotide. Both mechanisms 2 and 3 would result in an increased stabilization of the binary complex between nucleotide-free ras and GEF, allowing the formation of a stable complex under conditions where the complex would normally be disrupted by the presence of nucleotides. The experiments reported in Figs. 1 B and 2 indicate that mechanism 1 cannot be responsible for the dominant-negative properties of the W1056E and T1184E mutants, because the bound nucleotide is readily displaced by both mutant GEFs. Experiments reported in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly indicate that both mutations reduce the affinity of the binary complex for the incoming nucleotide, resulting in a similar stabilization of a binary complex. Taken together, these data suggest a rationale for the properties of the mutants.The recent elucidation of the hSos·p21 ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) has started to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying GEF action. Firstly, a helical hairpin of hSos displaces the p21 ras -bound nucleotide by inducing a dramatic conformational change in the so-called “switch 1” region of ras. Because Sos does not directly occlude the nucleotide-binding site, except in the region where the terminal phosphate groups and the magnesium ion are bound, the incoming nucleotide can displace the GEF molecule by competing for the groups that bind the phosphate groups and the magnesium ion. Because of the extensive primary structure homology between the catalytic domains of Sos and CDC25Mm, the general fold is likely to be conserved between the two GEF molecules. So, it is possible to speculate on the properties of the T1184E and W1056E mutants on the basis of the published structure of the hSos/ras complex (32Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To explain the biochemical dominant-negative properties of the W1056E and T1184E mutants we suggest that introduction of a glutamic acid at either position 1056 or 1184 allows formation of a novel salt bridge with a p21 ras residue involved in nucleotide binding. An attractive candidate is Lys16; this residue takes part in binding to the GTP-β and -γ phosphates, and its mutation to glutamine significantly reduces affinity of the mutant p21 ras for nucleotides, thus turning it into a dominant-negative mutant (46Sigal I.S. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Temeles G.L. Wolanski B.S. Socher S.H. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the ras/Sos complex, ras Lys16 is in close proximity to ras residues 59 to 62. Trp809 and Thr935, hSos1 residues equivalent to CDC25Mm Trp1056 and Thr1184, respectively, interact with residues 59, 60, and 61 and are at a similar distance from ras Lys16. Thus, even small local structural perturbations induced by the W1056E and T1184E mutations might bring mutant Glu1056 or Glu1184 residues and Lys16 close enough to interact. Local perturbations may easily be expected when amino acids with very different biochemical properties are substituted in critical positions. In particular, removal of the bulky tryptophan 1056 may leave an unflavored “cavity” which needs to be filled in by the substituting glutamate, thus bringing in close proximity residues that are relatively far away in the ras·wild-type GEF complex. In this scenario Glu1056 or Glu1184 in the mutated GEFs would compete exceedingly well with GTP-β and -γ phosphates for binding to ras Lys16. As a result, the affinity of the mutant GEF·ras complex for guanine nucleotides would be lowered, resulting in the observed strong stabilization of the mutant GEF/p21 ras complex also in the presence of high nucleotide concentrations. In vivo this scenario is likely to be affected by other interfering factors. It has in fact recently been reported that both ras regulators and effectors, such as GTPase activating proteins, raf, and phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (47Giglione C. Parrini M.C. Baouz S. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25128-25134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48Giglione C. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34737-34744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) may have an inhibitory effect on GEF-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange.In mammalian cells expressing mutant GEF, the ras pathway is strongly down-regulated, as expected for a dominant-negative mutant. Down-regulation can be detected both under basal conditions (starved cells) and conditions of activation of the ras pathway brought about by either PDGF or serum stimulation. In vivo data (obtained both with the yeast complementation and fibroblastfos-luciferase assays) stress the importance of residue 1124 in modulating the penetrance of W1056E and T1184E mutations. Most notably, when an alanine is present at position 1124, the effect of the W1056E mutation is abolished. This behavior is not peculiar to the CDC25Mm protein, because similar observations were made when the corresponding mutations were introduced in the yeast CDC25 protein (unpublished results).Reduction of cell proliferation observed in CDC25MmW1056Etransfected vascular smooth muscle cells further suggests the functional role of the GEF-negative mutant as an inhibitor of ras-dependent pathways. CDC25MmW1056Eintracellular expression specifically inhibited smooth vascular cell proliferation while having no effect on cellular morphology. The anti-proliferative effect of the CDC25Mm-negative mutant is consistent with previous studies in which the intracellular expression of either a dominant-negative form of ras or microinjection of neutralizing ras antibody exhibited a decrease in DNA synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (49Irani K. Finkel T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Mulcahy L. Smith M. Stacey D.

Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells constitutes the major pathological event responsible for the development of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (51Virmani R. Farb A. Burke A.P. Am. Heart J. 1994; 127: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several clinical studies have reported coronary restenosis after angioplasty to be as high as 45% within three to six months (52McBride W. Lange R.A. Hillis L.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and no effective treatment for restenosis is presently available. The feasibility of regionally transferring plasmid DNA into vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo has been reported (53Ohno T. Gordon D. San H. Pompili V.J. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Science. 1994; 265: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Transfection of a dominant-negative ras mutant significantly reduced rat neointima formation after vascular injury (5Indolfi C. Avvedimento E.V. Rapacciuolo A. Di Lorenzo E. Esposito G. Stabile E.

The LamB signal peptide was chosen by virtue of the extensive biophysical and biological characterization of its activity. In vitro, nascent prolactin chains bearing the LamB signal peptide (LamB) were targeted in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner to rough microsomes but remained protease- and salt-sensitive and translocated at low efficiency. Full translocation activity was obtained in a gain of function mutant (LamB*) in which three hydrophobic residues in the LamB hydrophobic core were converted to leucine residues. Cross-linking studies demonstrated that the LamB* signal sequence displayed markedly enhanced interactions with SRP and integral membrane proteins. In contrast, chemically denatured LamB and LamB*-precursors bound with identical efficiencies and in a salt-resistant manner to rough microsomes, suggesting that during de novo synthesis the signal sequence of LamB-bearing precursors assumes a conformation refractory to translocation. These data indicate that a leucine-rich signal sequence is necessary for optimal interaction with SRP and suggest that SRP, by maintaining the signal sequence in a conformation suitable for membrane binding, performs a chaperone function.

A targeting function for the signal sequence was defined coincident with the identification of the signal recognition particle (SRP) (1Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Walter P. Blobel G. J.

In these pioneering studies, it was observed that targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the ER requires SRP binding to the signal sequence and that biosynthetic substitution of β-hydroxyleucine for leucine blocked SRP activity. In addition to identifying a targeting function for SRP, these studies established the importance of the hydrophobic core region of the signal sequence in SRP/signal sequence interactions. Subsequent studies have provided extensive molecular insights into the signal recognition process, with the identification of the 54-kDa SRP subunit (SRP54) as the site of signal peptide/SRP interactions being of particular interest (5Krieg U.C.

Structural analyses of SRP54 have identified three primary domains, a carboxyl-terminal methionine-rich domain, which serves as the site of signal sequence recognition, an amino-terminal N domain, and a central GTPase domain (9Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 10Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P.

SRP-mediated targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the ER occurs very early in protein synthesis and is necessary for efficient targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the ER membrane. The functional basis for early recognition of the nascent chain by SRP was identified in studies demonstrating that the affinity of SRP for signal sequence-bearing nascent chains decreases dramatically with continued elongation (13Siegel V. Walter P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Okun M.M. Eskridge E.M. Shields D. J. Biol.

On the basis of these studies, it is thought that the inability of SRP to direct ribosome-nascent chain targeting at late stages of protein synthesis reflects a protein folding problem common to mammalian precursor proteins. And it is for this reason that protein translocation is obligatorily co-translational in the mammalian ER. The co-translational nature of protein translocation has, however, made the analysis of signal sequence function occurring subsequent to targeting difficult. In experimental scenarios in which the SRP-dependent targeting phase of protein translocation is bypassed, it is clear that the signal sequence is necessary for efficient vectorial transport across the ER membrane (16Wiedmann B.

Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). At present, however, the molecular basis for signal sequence function in the ER membrane is not understood. By analogy with bacteria, the signal sequence may function to regulate or gate the conductance state of a protein conducting channel (21Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Are the physical characteristics of the signal sequence that define its activity in the targeting phase of translocation identical to those required for binding to components of the ER membrane? It is well established that isolated signal peptides can spontaneously insert into lipid membranes and in so doing assume a predominately α-helical structure (22Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Zlotnick A. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1985; 228: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Jones J.D. Gierasch L. Biophys.

Mutations that block activity in vivodisrupt such structural interconversions, so it is apparent that the capacity for spontaneous membrane insertion and α-helix formation correlates well with signal sequence function (25Gierasch L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, signal sequences physically associate with SRP; thus, it is reasonable to expect that direct interactions with integral membrane protein components of the ER would be necessary for signal sequence function in the ER membrane. In fact, near-neighbor interactions of the signal sequence with TRAPα, TRAM, and Sec61p, all resident integral membrane protein components of the ER, have been identified by cross-linking techniques (26Wiedmann M.

The question remains unresolved, however, as to whether signal sequences function through direct insertion into the membrane bilayer, binding to membrane protein components of the ER, or both. In this study, the role of the signal sequence in precursor targeting and vectorial transport was investigated. As a model system, a protein chimera was prepared consisting of the Escherichia coli LamB signal sequence and the mature domain of preprolactin. The LamB signal sequence was chosen because it has been the subject of extensive studies into the structural requirements for signal sequence function in protein export, membrane insertion, and interaction with SRP (22Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Zlotnick A. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1985; 228: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,25Gierasch L.

Using an in vitro translation/translocation system consisting of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and pancreas rough microsomes, we report that the wild type LamB signal peptide can support SRP-dependent targeting but not translocation of a prolactin carrier domain across microsomal membranes. A gain of function mutant was identified that yielded efficient targeting and translocation. The ability of both forms of the LamB-bearing precursor to efficiently target to RM in a chemically denatured state suggests that SRP performs a chaperone function coincident with its established role as a targeting factor. A chimera containing the LamB signal sequence in frame with the mature domain of preprolactin was prepared as follows. A PCR product containing the LamB signal sequence was obtained by PCR using the primers 5′-GC-TCT-AGA-ATG-ATG-ATT-ACT-CTG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GC-GGA-TCC-AGC-CAT-TGC-CTG-AGC-3′ (antisense primer) and a full-length LamB cDNA as template. A PCR product containing the mature domain of prolactin was obtained with the primers 5′-GC-GGA-TCC-ACC-CCC-GTC-TGT-CCC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GCC-GAA-TTC-TTA-GCA-GTT-GTT-GTT-3′ (antisense primer). PCR products were gel-purified and used in a triple ligation reaction with gel-purified, XbaI- and EcoRI-digested pGEMBP1 (35Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as the vector host. Ligation products were transformed intoE. coli strain DH5α, and positive clones were selected by ampicillin resistance. A single clone was selected, and the sequence was confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing of miniprep DNA. As a consequence of the strategy used to prepare the LamB-prolactin chimera (pLamBP), the mature domain of prolactin contains two additional amino acids (Gly-Ser) at the immediate amino terminus of the mature prolactin. Site-directed mutagenesis of the signal sequence encoding region of pLamBP was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The gain of function mutant, pLamB*P, was obtained in two steps. In the first reaction, mutagenesis was performed with the pLamBP plasmid as template using the primers 5′-GAC-TCT-AGA-ATG-ATG-ATT-ACT-CTG-CGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCG-CAG-AGT-AAT-CAT-CAT-TCT-AGA-GTC-3′ (antisense). A positive clone obtained from transformation of the reaction products was sequenced to confirm the intended mutation (V−14L), and plasmid DNA was prepared. In a second round of mutagenesis, the V−14L mutant was used as a template for mutagenesis with the primers 5′-CTT-CCT-CTG-GCG-CTT-GCC-CTC-CTA-GCG-GGC-GTA-ATG-TCT-GCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGA-CAT-TAC-GCC-CGC-TAG-GAG-GGC-AAG-CGC-CAG-AGG-3′ (antisense). Following transformation of the reaction products, positive clones were selected, and the expected mutations were confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing. The final mutant, termed pLamB*P, contains the following mutations in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence: V−14L, V−12L, and A−11L. pGEMBP1, pLamBP, and pLamB*P were linearized within the coding region by digestion withPvuII and transcribed to yield transcripts encoding precursors of 86 (preprolactin) or 81 (LamB-prolactin chimera) amino acids. The translation products derived from these transcripts are referred to as pPl86 (preprolactin precursor of 86 amino acids); pLamBP81 (wild type LamB-prolactin fusion of 81 amino acids), or pLamB*P81 (gain of function LamB-prolactin fusion of 81 amino acids). All transcription reactions were performed using the MegaScript transcription kit obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Completed transcription reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and mRNA was collected by ethanol precipitation. mRNA was resuspended in TE to a final concentration of 500 ng/μl and stored at −80 °C. Cell-free translations were performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as described by Nicchitta and Blobel (36Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Translations (20 μl) contained 8 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 25 μCi of 35S Pro-Mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.05 units/μl RNasin, 1 mm DTT, 80 μm minus methionine amino acid mix, and the indicated concentrations of canine pancreas rough microsomes, prepared as described by Walter and Blobel (37Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). N-ethylmaleimide-treated membranes were prepared as described by Nicchitta and Blobel (36Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prepared by the method of Jackson and Hunt (38Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) or obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell-free translation reactions (20 μl) were chilled on ice and diluted to 150 μl in physiological salts buffer (110 mm KOAc, 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2, 2.5 mmMg(OAc)2), high salt buffer (0.5 m KOAc, 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2), or physiological salts buffer with the indicated concentrations of EDTA. Following incubation on ice for 20 min, samples were overlaid onto a 70-μl cushion of 0.5 msucrose, 20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2, and centrifuged in the Beckman TLA100 rotor for 5 min at 60,000 rpm (4 °C). The supernatant and cushion fractions were processed as the supernatant fraction. The membrane pellet fraction was recovered by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 m Tris base, 5% SDS, 0.1 m DTT and heating to 55 °C for 15 min. Completed translation reactions were chilled on ice and diluted to 50 μl in 110 mm KOAc, 20 mm K-HEPES, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2. Proteinase K was added from freshly prepared stocks in water to the indicated concentrations. Protease digestion reactions were performed for 30 min on ice and quenched by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mm. Following fractionation with ammonium sulfate, pellet fractions were washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Translation reactions were conducted in the presence or absence of RM and ribosome-membrane complexes or ribosome-nascent chain complexes collected by centrifugation through 0.5 m sucrose in physiological salts buffer. Samples were resuspended in physiological salts buffer and treated withm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) at the indicated concentrations for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 mm DTT, concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and processed for SDS-PAGE as described below. Truncated ribosome-nascent chain complexes (pPl86, pLamBP81, pLamB*P81) were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and collected by centrifugation (80,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C, TLA100 rotor). Ribosome-nascent chain complexes were resuspended in 5 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 25 mm DTT; incubated for 10 min at 25 °C; and diluted 1:2.5 in 8.5 m guanidinium/HCl, 25 mm DTT. For the binding reactions, chemically denatured nascent chains were diluted 100-fold into physiological salts buffer supplemented with 25 mm DTT and, where indicated, RM at a concentration of 5 eq/100 μl. The final reaction volume was 100 μl. Binding reactions were performed for 15 min at 25 °C. Following completion of the binding reaction and where indicated, KOAc was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Membrane-bound and -free nascent chains were separated by centrifugal flotation. 100-μl binding reactions were mixed with 900 μl of 50% Nycodenz (Sigma), prepared in physiological or high salts buffer, and overlaid with a Nycodenz step gradient of 450 μl of 37.5%, 250 μl of 30%, and 250 μl of 20% Nycodenz, prepared in physiological salts buffer, and 150 μl of physiological salts buffer. Gradients were centrifuged for 2 h at 55,000 × g (4 °C) in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor and harvested into five fractions. Proteins present in the fractions were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and resolved on 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels. Following translation/translocation, reactions were placed on ice and diluted to 50 μl in 110 mm KOAc, 20 mm K-HEPES, 2 mmMg(OAc)2. Two volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate solution were added, and following a 20-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. In membrane centrifugation experiments, the supernatant fraction was diluted 2-fold with saturated ammonium sulfate and processed as described above. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were washed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Pellet fractions were resuspended in 35 μl of 0.5 m Tris base, 5% SDS, 0.1 m DTT and heated to 55 °C for 20 min. Samples were resolved on 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels by the protocol of Ref. 39Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar; fixed in 35% methanol, 10% acetic acid; and either dried ([35S]methionine) or prepared for fluorography by the method of Bonner and Laskey (53Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar). Translations performed with [35S]methionine were analyzed and quantitated using a Fuji MacBAS1000 phosphor imager system and version 2.1 software. All phosphor imager files were exported as PICT images, and size and contrast were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop software (version 3.0) (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The LamB signal peptide has been the subject of extensive structural, biochemical, and biological investigation and is known to participate in both protein/lipid and protein/protein interactions (22Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Zlotnick A. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1985; 228: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,25Gierasch L.

Given these precedents and the intent of the present study to investigate the structural requirements for signal sequence function in both the targeting and membrane transport stages of protein translocation, a fusion protein was prepared consisting of the signal sequence of LamB in frame with the mature domain of preprolactin. To investigate the behavior of the chimera in the targeting phase of translocation, a series of experiments were performed to compare the targeting activities of truncated forms of preprolactin and the LamB-prolactin fusion. In these assays, truncated forms of the two proteins (pPl86 and pLamBP81) were synthesized in vitro in the presence or absence of canine pancreas rough microsomes (RM), and the association of ribosome-nascent chain complexes with the RM was assayed by centrifugation. Operationally, the formation of a translocation-competent junction of the ribosome-nascent chain complex with RM can be assayed as resistance to extraction with high salt or EDTA or protection of the bound nascent chain from digestion with exogenous proteases (20Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are depicted in Fig. 1. Following translation in the absence of RM and centrifugation, both precursor proteins were recovered in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1–4). Following translation in the presence of RM, both pPl86 and pLamBP81 were recovered in the pellet (membrane) fraction (Fig. 1,lanes 5–8). The two precursors could, however, be readily distinguished by treatment of the completed binding reactions with either 0.5 m KOAc or 10 mm EDTA prior to centrifugation (Fig. 1, lanes 9–16). Under these conditions, the pPl86 nascent chains were recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas the pLamBP81 precursors were recovered in the supernatant fraction. These data indicate that the LamB signal peptide displayed activity in the targeting phase of translocation but was ineffective in the formation of a tight ribosome-membrane junction. To further investigate the activity of the LamB signal peptide in the targeting stage of translocation, the capacity of ribosome-pLamBP81 nascent chain complexes to form a protease-resistant membrane junction was determined. Depicted in Fig. 2 are the results of an experiment in which the protease accessibility of the truncated chains was determined as a function of the RM concentration present during translation. In Fig. 2 A, the results with the 86-amino acid pPl precursor are shown. When translated in the absence of RM and subjected to proteolysis, a labeled fragment of higher mobility, representing the ribosome-protected fragment of the nascent chain, was recovered (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–3). When translated in the presence of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 eq of RM/20-μl translation, pPl86 was efficiently targeted to the RM and formed a tight junction, with the nascent chain being protected from proteolysis in the presence of either 0.1 or 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–9). In contrast to the pPl86, the pLamBP81 nascent chains, although targeted to the RM, formed a protease-resistant membrane junction only inefficiently (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–9). Importantly, the efficiency with which the pLamBP81 precursors achieved the protease-resistant stage of targeting was essentially independent of the RM concentration present during the translation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–9). These data indicate that the RM concentration is not limiting in these experiments and suggest that the targeting defect seen with the LamB signal sequence is a property of the signal sequence itself. Signal sequences have a well established canonical structure consisting of a positively charged N terminus, a central hydrophobic core of 7–15 amino acids, and a polar C terminus containing a consensus motif for cleavage by signal peptidase (40Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heinje G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). The LamB signal peptide satisfies all available criteria for signal sequence structure and has been demonstrated to bind to SRP54 (32Miller J.D. Wilhelm H. Gierasch L. Gilmore R. Walter P. Nature. 1993; 366: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe M. Hunt J.F. Blobel G. Nature. 1986; 323: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative inability of the LamB signal peptide to elicit formation of a tight ribosome-membrane junction was unexpected. To determine if the activity of the LamB signal sequence in translocation could be enhanced, a number of LamB signal sequence mutants were prepared. Increasing the positive charge at the N terminus by converting methionine (position −24) to lysine was without effect (data not shown). It is well established that the hydrophobic regions of prokaryotic signal sequences have a relatively high prevalence of alanine residues, whereas eukaryotic signal sequence hydrophobic regions are relatively enriched in leucine residues (40Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heinje G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the inability of the LamB signal sequence to efficiently direct translocation across the ER membrane was a consequence of its alanine/valine-rich hydrophobic region, a mutant form of the LamB signal sequence was created in which valine −14, valine −12, and alanine −11 were converted to leucine residues. Interestingly, and as shown in Fig. 3, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis of the wild type (LamB) and mutant (LamB*) forms of the signal peptide indicate that the overall hydrophobicity profiles of the two signal sequences were very similar. Although the hydrophobicity profiles are similar, the functional properties of nascent chains bearing either of the two forms of the LamB signal sequence differ markedly. In Fig. 4, the activities of the pLamBP81 and pLamB*P81 chimeras were investigated in vitro, with the pPl86 serving as a positive control. As shown in lanes 1 and 2, the addition of puromycin to membrane-bound pPl86 nascent chains yields the release of the nascent chain from the ribosome and cleavage by signal peptidase to yield mature truncated prolactin. Whereas puromycin addition to membrane-bound pLamBP81 nascent chains yielded barely detectable levels of signal peptide processing, the pLamB*P81 nascent chains were efficiently processed. Note that for the pLamB*P81 nascent chains, 67% of the radiolabeled amino acids are located in the signal sequence, and thus cleavage of the signal peptide is accompanied by a substantial apparent loss of the mature prolactin. Correction for the distribution of methionine residues in the signal sequence and the mature domain of the pLamB*P81 precursors indicates that processing occurs at 75% efficiency. As would be expected from the gain of function activity of the pLamB*P81 signal sequence in the translocation assay, the data in Fig. 4 also indicate that this form of the LamB signal sequence is fully functional in the targeting assay. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4, the targeting behavior of pLamB*P81 nascent chains following targeting and extraction of the bound nascent chains with physiological (0.15 m) or high (0.5 m) salt mirrors that of pPl86 nascent chains and is distinct from that seen with the pLamBP81 precursors. From these data, it can be concluded that efficient activity of the LamB signal sequence in a mammalian translocation system requires the presence of leucine residues in the signal sequence hydrophobic region. The data presented in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4 indicate that signal sequence function in ribosome-nascent chain targ"

The hallmarks of ENaC are a high selectivity for Na+, block by amiloride, small conductance, and slow kinetics that are voltage-independent. We have investigated the contribution of the second hydrophobic domain of each of the homologous subunits α, β, and γ to the kinetic properties of ENaC. Chimeric subunits were constructed between α and β subunits (α-β) and between γ and β subunits (γ-β). Chimeric and wild-type subunits were expressed in various combinations in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of whole-cell and unitary currents made it possible to correlate functional properties with specific sequences in the subunits. Functional channels were generated without the second transmembrane domain from α subunits, indicating that it is not essential to form functional pores. The open probability and kinetics varied with the different channels and were influenced by the second hydrophobic domains. Amiloride affinity, Li+/Na+selectivity, and single channel conductance were also affected by this segment.

ENaC channels are heteromultimeric proteins formed by the association of homologous subunits: α, β, and γ. The second transmembrane domain (M2) from each subunit participates in forming the ion pathway. α subunits can generate functional channels, but β or γ cannot; nonetheless, they impart specific properties to the heterooligomeric complex. For instance, α in combination with either β or γ forms channels with levels of expression intermediate between α alone and αβγ (1Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). The need to express α subunits in order to induce amiloride-sensitive currents has suggested that they are essential to form the channel pore. The subunits of ENaC are 70–80-kDa glycoproteins. A hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence, gene fusion experiments, identification of glycosylation sites, and partial proteolysis have confirmed a simple structure for the subunits characterized by two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2), a large extracellular domain with multiple N-glycosylation sites, and the amino and carboxyl termini in the cytoplasmic side (2Canessa C.M.

This is the most conserved region among all of the channels that form the ENaC/Deg family of ion channels. Members include the mammalian acid-sensitive ion channels (5Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the peptide-gated Na+ channel from the snailHelix aspersa (6Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P.

According to the predicted secondary structure, M2 includes a typical α-helix, long enough to traverse the plasma membrane, and a less structured segment of hydrophobic residues preceding the α-helix. Mutations of residues located in the initial segment of M2 alter the affinity of channels for the blocker amiloride and the ion selectivity (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen.

A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We previously showed that channels formed by α with β (αβ) and α with γ subunits (αγ) differ in many functional properties such as in affinity for amiloride, ion selectivities, unitary conductances, and single channel kinetics (12McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we constructed chimeric subunits between α and β (α-β) and between β and γ subunits (γ-β) and expressed them in various combinations in Xenopus oocytes in order to examine the properties of whole-cell and unitary currents of the chimeric channels. Taking advantage of the differences in their functional properties, we have correlated specific amino acid sequences in the subunits to functional properties in order to gain insight into the structure-function of these channels. Two types of chimeras were made: γ-β containing the amino terminus of γ and the carboxyl terminus of β, designated (γ-βS481), (γ-βG529), (γ-βL535), and (γ-βE540); and α-β containing the amino terminus of α and the carboxyl terminus of β, designated (α-βS508). The letters and numbers indicate the first residue that belongs to the β subunit in each chimera. Chimeras were made using polymerase chain reaction according to the protocol previously described (12McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and were subcloned in pSPORT vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Point mutations in the β subunit were also generated by polymerase chain reaction: βG529S and βG530C. A stop codon was introduced in the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit at position Arg564. This truncation has been shown before to increase the level of expression of channels at the plasma membrane without altering other properties (14Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Capped cRNAs from linearized cDNAs were synthesizedin vitro using T7 mMESSAGEmMACHINE (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the provider's instructions. Xenopus laevis oocytes were surgically removed from adult females and prepared with standard procedures. Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 1 ng each of the following cRNAs: α and (γ-βS481), α and (γ-βG529), α and (γ-βL535), α and (γ-βE540), (α-βS508) with γ, and (α-βS508) with (γ-βS481). After injection, oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 2–4 days in amphibian Ringer solution supplemented with 10 μmamiloride. Channel activity was recorded using either two-microelectrode voltage clamp or patch clamp techniques. For two-microelectrode recordings, current and voltage electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass, had resistances <1 megaohm, and were filled with 3 m KCl. ENaC activity was calculated from the difference in whole-cell current before and after the addition of 50 μm amiloride to the bathing solution. Currents were recorded with an OC-725B oocyte clamp (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT), digitized at 0.1 kHz (ITC-16; HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), and stored on a hard disc. Membrane potential was held at −60 mV. Current-voltage relations were generated by changing the membrane potential from −180 to 80 mV in 20-mV incremental steps of 200-ms duration. I/V curves were fitted to the constant field equation. The standard bath solution was composed as follows: 100 mm sodium gluconate, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4. In some experiments, 100 mm Na+ was replaced by 100 mm Li+ or K+. TheK i values of amiloride were calculated by measuring the fractional inhibition of whole-cell currents produced by increasing concentrations of amiloride in the bath solution. The data were fitted to the equation, I/Imax=1/(1+A/Ki)(Eq. 1) where A represents the amiloride concentration andK i is the half-inhibition constant. For patch clamp recordings, patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and typically had tip resistances of about 5 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. All recordings were made in the cell-attached configuration. The compositions of pipette solutions were as follows: 150 mm NaCl or 150 mm LiCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4. The bath solution in all experiments was as follows: 150 mm KCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4. An Axopatch 200A amplifier and Digidata 1200A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced to a PC were used to acquire data at 5 kHz. The data were filtered at 200 Hz during acquisition using an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Inc., Haverford, MA) and stored directly on the hard drive of a PC. Axon's pClamp 6 software was used for data analysis. Data were filtered digitally at 50 Hz for analysis and display. I/V relations were constructed by measuring current passing through channels between 0 and −80 mV, and the single channel conductance was subsequently estimated by linear regression between −20 and −80 mV. Fetchan was used to generate events list files (EVL files) from the data files. A 50% threshold was set to determine transitions between the open and closed levels from at least 10 min of data recorded at −40 mV. Channel open probability (P o) was calculated from the EVL files generated by Fetchan using a specialized NPo program written by Jinliang Sui (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) (15Sui J. NPo Analysis Program. Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA1995Google Scholar) and available on the World Wide Web. The NPo program reads Fetchan EVL files of any size and expresses these files as the product of N (number of channels in the membrane patch; maximum N = 5) andP o versus time. The resolution of changes in NPo is determined by a user-selectable bin width ranging from 0.1 to 30 s/bin. To express the NPo of each patch, we used the mean of successive 30-s measurements made over the entire EVL file. Patches containing single and multiple channels were used to calculate P o. Open and closed times were calculated from histograms generated using Fetchan EVL files and the Pstat program within pClamp in logarithmic binning mode (i.e. a plot of number of observationsversus log dwell time in ms). The fitting method was simplex-least squares. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were assessed using Student's ttest. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In order to define the domains responsible for conferring the functional differences between αβ and αγ, we generated several chimeric subunits that contained the amino terminus of γ and the second hydrophobic domain (M2) of the β subunit. We made four γ-β chimeras, (γ-βS481), (γ-βG529), (γ-βL535), and (γ-βE540), each of which contained progressively fewer sequences from β. The letter and number indicate the first residue from the β subunit at the junction of the chimera. An α-β chimera was also made; it contained most of the α sequences and the M2 from β, (α-βS508). A schematic representation of the chimeras is shown in Fig. 1. None of the γ-β chimeras injected alone or coinjected with β or γ subunits induced a significant increase in oocyte whole-cell conductance. However, coinjection with wild-type α subunits induced several μA of amiloride-sensitive current that were in the range of 2–6 μA/oocyte. Injection of α-β chimera with wild-type γ induced currents in the range of 3–8 μA (4.8 ± 1.2 μA/oocyte), but no currents were observed when the α-β chimera was injected alone or when coinjected with wild-type β or γ subunits. Two different chimeras injected together, α-β with γ-β, induced functional channels with cells expressing 2–4 μA of whole-cell current. The magnitude of the amiloride-sensitive currents expressed by these channels appears in the right column of Fig. 1. These experiments showed that sodium channels, sensitive to amiloride block, can be formed by combinations of chimeras and subunits other than α, β, and γ. Most significantly, γ with α-β chimera and two chimeras α-β with γ-β induced sodium currents although these channels do not have the M2 from α subunits. The level of expression of all of the functional constructs was consistently above 1 μA/oocyte, making possible the characterization of the properties of unitary currents of these channels. We examined the kinetics and P o of all of the functional channels generated by injection of various combinations of subunits and chimeras. For kinetic studies, only patches containing single channels were included in the analysis, while for calculation ofP o, patches with single and multiple channels were considered. Fig. 2 shows representative examples of patches containing single channels for the four different α(γ-β) channels. α(γ-βS481) channels exhibited very highP o (0.94 ± 0.03) that was indistinguishable from our previous report of αβ channels (P o ∼ 1). The next three γ-β chimeras, that contain progressively less sequence from the β subunit, had significantly lower P o values that were 0.62 ± 0.04 for α(γ-βG529), 0.21 ± 0.02 for α(γ-βL537), and 0.12 ± 0.04 for α(γ-βE540) (Table I).Table IValues of the mean open probability (P o) and mean open and closed timesChannelP oOpen timeClosed timemsmsα(γ-βS481)0.94 ± 0.03 (4)3360 ± 1240 (3)48 ± 15 (3)α(γ-βG529)0.62 ± 0.04 (6)215 ± 23 (3)aSignificantly different from α(γ-βS481) (p < 0.05).82 ± 48 (3)α(γ-βL535)0.21 ± 0.02 (9)bSignificantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.001).232 ± 30 (3)560 ± 50 (3)cSignificantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.01).α(γ-βE540)0.12 ± 0.04 (6)dSignificantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.001) and α(γ-βL535) (p < 0.02).224eValues pooled from three patches.14,500eValues pooled from three patches.γ(α-βS508)0.84 ± 0.07 (7)4610 ± 916 (3)104 ± 8 (3)(α-βS508)(γ-βS481)0.77 ± 0.07 (5)520 ± 270 (4)84 ± 18 (4)a Significantly different from α(γ-βS481) (p < 0.05).b Significantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.001).c Significantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.01).d Significantly different from α(γ-βG529) (p < 0.001) and α(γ-βL535) (p < 0.02).e Values pooled from three patches. Open table in a new tab The four types of channels containing γ-β chimeras had kinetics described by only one open and one closed state. Fig. 3 shows histograms of the distribution of dwell times of open and closed events. The histograms were constructed with data from several patches containing single channels in order to accumulate a large enough number of events. In some cases, such as for α(γ-βE540) channels, the long duration of the closed state prevented the accumulation of a large number of events. All histograms were well fitted with a single exponential probability density function. The time constants for the open (τo) and closed (τc) states are also shown in Fig. 3. The values of the durations of open and closed events were also calculated from individual patches, and the mean ± S.E. of all of these values appear in Table I. The progressive decrease in lowerP o exhibited by the γ-β chimeric channels was mainly due to longer closed times, from 48 ± 15 ms for α(γ-βS481) channels to 14.5 s for α(γ-βE540) channels. Figs. 4 A and5 A show representative examples of patches containing single γ(α-β) or (α-β)(γ-β) channels. The P o of γ(α-βS508) channels was 0.84 ± 0.07, andP o of (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) channels was 0.77 ± 0.07. The mean open and closed times are shown in Table Iand in the histograms of Fig. 6. The values for τo were 4610 ± 916 and 520 ± 270 ms, and for τc they were 104 ± 8 and 84 ± 18 ms, respectively. The differences in the values for τoand τc reported in Table I and Fig. 6 result from taking the mean ± S.E. from each individual patch (Table I) or from pooling the data from all patches to construct the dwell time histograms (Fig. 6).FIG. 5A, representative example of a cell-attached patch containing a single (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) channel.

The affinity for amiloride was examined by measuring the fractional block of whole-cell currents by increasing concentrations of amiloride in the perfusate. Measurements were done with the two-electrode voltage clamp in the presence of 100 mm Na+ in the bath and at a membrane potential of −60 mV. The K i values for α(γ-βS481) and α(γ-βG529) were 1.75 ± 0.24 and 1.2 ± 0.11 μm, respectively (Table II). For α(γ-βL535) and α(γ-βE540), the K i values were 0.25 ± 0.05 and 0.2 ± 0.02, respectively. For the first two chimeric channels, the K i values were similar to that of αβ, whereas the K i values of the last two channels were equal to that of αγ channels. These results are in agreement with the notion that residues located in the segment preceding M2 determine amiloride affinity. Since the first two channels have the preceding M2 segment from β subunits, they had theK i of αβ channels (1 μm); in contrast, the last two chimeras have the preceding M2 segment from γ, and therefore they exhibit a K i similar to αγ channels (0.1 μm).Table IISummary of single channel conductance, Li + /Na + selectivity, and amiloride K i from chimeric channelsConductanceLi+/Na+selectivityAmiloride K iLi+Na+PatchTEVCaTwo electrode voltage clamp.pSα(γ-βS481)4.8 ± 0.2 (3)4.7 ± 0.3 (3)1:11:11.75 ± 0.15α(γ-βG529)4.9 ± 0.2 (4)4.7 ± 0.4 (6)1:11:11.2 ± 0.04α(γ-βL535)5.0 ± 0.3 (4)bp < 0.02 for α(γ-βL537).4.0 ± 0.1 (4)bp < 0.02 for α(γ-βL537).1.2:11.1:10.25 ± 0.01α(γ-βE540)5.2 ± 0.2 (4)cp < 0.01 for α(γ-βE540).3.7 ± 0.3 (4)cp < 0.01 for α(γ-βE540).1.4:11.3:10.2 ± 0.06γ(α-βS508)NDdND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab The affinities of γ(α-βS508) and (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) channels were lower, with K i of 4.3 ± 0.2 and 5.5 ± 0.4 μm, respectively (Table II). Ion selectivity and single channel conductance were also affected by the M2 subunit composition. The conductance and selectivities for Na+ and Li+ were determined by the ratio of unitary currents in the presence of a 150 mm concentration of each one of the cations in the pipette solution (ILi+/Na+). When the magnitude of the unitary currents was too small to be measured accurately, the ILi+/Na+ratio was calculated from whole-cell currents in the presence of 150 mm Na+ or Li+ in the bath solution. All channels were also examined for permeability to K+using bath solutions containing 150 mm K+. We have previously shown that subunit composition affects the selectivity of ENaC. For instance, channels formed by α, β, and γ subunits are highly selective for Na+ over K+(Na+/K+ ratio of 1:0.001) and slightly more permeable to Li+ than to Na+(Li+/Na+ ratio of 1.5:1). αγ channels also exhibit Li+/Na+ permeabilities of 1.5:1, whereas αβ channels show Li+/Na+permeabilities of 1:1 (13Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All the functional chimeric channels conducted in the presence of Na+ or Li+ but none in the presence of K+. α(γ-βS481) and α(γ-βG529) channels were equally permeable to both cations (ILi+/Na+of 1:1). α(γ-βL535) and α(γ-βE540) channels were more permeable to Li+ with ILi+/Na+of 1.2:1 and 1.4:1, respectively (Fig. 7and Table II). Differences in the ILi+/Na+ were due mainly to a decreases in the Na+ conductance from 4.7 to 3.7 picosiemens with little change in the Li+ conductance, which remained close to 5 picosiemens for all α(γ-β) channels. γ(α-βS508) and (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) channels were more permeable to Na+ than to Li+; the ILi+/Na+ratios were smaller, 0.6:1 and 0.5:1, respectively (Figs. 4 Cand 5 C and Table II). The conductance of γ(α-βS508) and (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) channels with Na+ in the pipette was 3.2 and 7.9 picosiemens, respectively. We could not measure accurately the unitary currents of γ(α-βS508) channels with Li+ because of its small magnitude. Until now, the presence of the α subunit M2 was thought to be critical for expression of functional amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. However, we have shown that the chimeric channels, composed of γ(α-βS508) and (α-βS508)(γ-βS481), both of which lacked the M2 from the α subunit, gave rise to functional channels. When compared with wild-type channels, the properties of γ(α-βS508) and γ(α-βS508)(γ-βS481) were different. Nonetheless, these channels still possessed the general basic properties of ENaC in that they were selective for Na+ and not for K+ (but INa+ > ILi+) and in that channel activity could still be inhibited by amiloride, although at slightly higher doses. Our observations indicate that the pore forming region of the α subunit is not a prerequisite for the expression of functional channels, since we have pores formed by the M2 of γ and β (γ(α-βS508)) and of β alone ((α-βS508)(γ-βS481)). These observations taken with those of the γ-β chimeras expressed with α subunits demonstrate that all three M2 regions can form functional pores, the properties of which depend on the subunit type(s) present. We also tested chimeras and combinations of subunits in which there were no sequences from the α subunit; none of them increased the Na+ permeability when injected in oocytes. Since the chimeras γ(α-βS508) and (α-βS508)(γ-βS481) contain the first 23 of α, this suggests that domains within this region of the α subunit are necessary for channel function. Most likely, they contain elements necessary for expression of channels either by promoting assembly of the subunits and/or of channels to the plasma membrane. There are other lines of evidence that support a potential role for the N-terminal region of the subunits participating in channel function. Residues preceding the first hydrophobic domain of acid-sensitive ion channel 2, a member of the ENaC/degenerin family of ion channels, have been shown to have a role in ion permeation, since mutations within this region dramatically increased the K+ permeability of these channels (16Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We were unable to address the contribution of the N-terminal region to channel function, because reverse chimeras comprising the N-terminal portion of β and the C-terminal of γ were all found to be nonfunctional. There have been numerous studies to demonstrate the putative roles of various residues in ion permeation and amiloride block (10Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen.

A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies attempted to characterize if the various mutations altered channel kinetics or P o. One study performed on bovine α ENaC in lipid bilayers demonstrated that point mutations, in addition to altering amiloride sensitivity and ionic selectivity, increased channel P o (17Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1622-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structural domains that form or control the gating mechanism in these channels. ENaC exhibits characteristic slow and voltage independent kinetics with long openings and closures that can last several seconds. Previously, we had reported that channels formed by αβ or αγ displayed different kinetics (13Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). αβ channels had long open times with brief closures and aP o close to 1, whereas αγ channels had shorter openings with a mean P o of approximately 0.5. These results suggested that domains within the γ subunit were responsible for the long closures. To address this question, we analyzed the kinetics of several γ-β chimeras that contained only part of the M2 from γ and also channels that did not have any sequences from γ M2 (α-βS508)(γ-βS481). The results showed that the M2 region of the subunits markedly influenced theP o and kinetics of channels. However, regardless of the subunit composition, all channels exhibited closures (although the τc was of different duration for each type of channel), indicating that the gating mechanism is not exclusively located in any one subunit but that most likely all three subunits contribute to it. The cytoplasmic region preceding M1 can also alter the kinetics of ENaC channels. Mutations of residues βG37S and αG95S in this region decrease the P o (18Gründer S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Fowler-Jaeger N. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the N-terminal domain constitutes the gate. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain is one of the least conserved among all members of the ENaC/degenerin family. In addition, a large segment from the N termini of α, β, and γ can be deleted without affecting activity. 2G. K. Fyfe, P. Zhang, and C. M. Canessa, unpublished observations. Most likely, β-Gly37 and α-Gly95 are not located in the gate, but their mutations produce an allosteric effect that alters the P o. On the other hand, we can rule out the gate being located at the level of the C terminus, because deletions of the C terminus of β and γ do not alter channel gating (13Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Amiloride blocks all of the channels belonging to the ENaC/degenerin family, although the affinities for amiloride vary widely among each of the individual members. Amiloride blocks the open channel by occluding the pore in a voltage-dependent manner; it senses approximately 15% of the membrane electrical field in wild-type ENaC. Therefore, the site of action of amiloride is most likely at the outer part of the pore, which is formed by the initial segment of M2 (10Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The residues α-Ser583, β-Gly525, and γ-Gly537 all contribute to form a high affinity site (K i = 0.1 μm), maybe by forming a ring to accommodate the amiloride molecule. In agreement with this notion, our analysis of the amiloride affinity of α(γ-β) channels showed that the K i was influenced by the first segment of M2. However, the results also showed that, in addition, other factors contribute to define the amiloride affinity. αβ, αγ, and all four chimeric α(γ-β) channels have rings formed by identical residues, yet their amiloride affinities are different. Among the α(γ-β) channels, we found that the transition from low to high amiloride K i occurred between chimera (γ-βG529) (K i = 1.2 ± 0.04) and chimera (γ-βL537) (K i = 0.25 ± 0.01). The main difference between these chimeras is the presence of residues Gly529and Gly530 in β and of Ser541 and Cys542 in γ. To examine whether these two residues were responsible for conferring the differences in K i, we expressed the mutant channels αβG529S and αβG530C, expecting to obtain channels with low K i . Unfortunately, these mutants were not functional when expressed with α subunits alone but induced large currents when coexpressed with wild-type α and γ. The amiloride K i values of αβG529Sγ and αβG530Cγ were ∼0.1 μm, indicating that these residues, although essential for ion permeation, do not change the amiloride affinity. The observations suggest that, in addition to the composition of the side chains forming the putative binding site for amiloride, other surrounding amino acids influence the structure of the site and thus alter amiloride affinity. As expected from the small differences between αβ and αγ channels, all chimeric channels were permeable to Na+ and Li+ but not to K+. Experiments with γ-β chimeras showed that M2 changes the ILi+/Na+ratio from 1:1 (αβ channels) to 1.5:1 (αγ channels). The change was due to a progressive decrease in Na+ currents without a significant change in the magnitude of Li+ currents as indicated in Table II. These results show that the critical residues that determine selectivity and conductance are located in the initial segment of M2 as has recently been shown by Kellenberger et al. (11Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in the three subunits (α-Gly587, β-Gly529, and γ-Ser541) and a ring of conserved serines (α-Ser589, β-Ser531, and γ-Ser543) form the putative selectivity filter. However, differences in ILi+/Na+ratio and in single channel conductance were observed among channels that had identical residues in the selectivity filter. For instance, pores formed only by α subunits (homomeric α channels) have ILi+/Na+of >1, whereas pores formed only by β subunits ((α-βS508)(γ-βS481)) have ILi+/Na+of <1. The same arguments presented for the amiloride affinity seem to apply for the determinants of selectivity in that other elements besides these residues affect the structure of the selectivity filter."

We have examined the hypothesis that phosphorylation alone contributes to desensitization. In this study we demonstrate that for the Gq-coupled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), phosphorylation by GRK2 to a stoichiometry of ∼1 mol PO4/mol GRP-R is sufficient in the absence of arrestin to reduce the rate of receptor catalyzed G protein activation by approximately 80%. Furthermore, GRP-Rs exposedin vivo to agonist are rapidly phosphorylated to a similar stoichiometry and are desensitized to a similar degree. Finally, the molecular mechanism for both in vitro GRK2-induced andin vivo agonist-induced desensitization is primarily a decrease in the maximum velocity (V max) for the catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange by the GRP-R rather than a change in the affinity of the receptor for the αq or βγ subunits. Based on these results, we suggest that, for some G protein-coupled receptors, phosphorylation has a role in desensitization that is independent of arrestin.

Trepel J. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. Sporn M. Roberts A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 95. Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg1990: 71-124Google Scholar). These effects are transduced through a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 including the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) (2Spindel E.R. Giladi E. Brehm P. Goodman R.H. Segerson T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 3Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). An agonist-activated GPCR catalyzes the exchange of guanine nucleotide on the α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein leading to the formation of Gα-GTP. The subsequent dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein leads to stimulation of signal transduction cascades mediated by the free Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits (4Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In the bombesin receptor family, the activated GRP-R catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαq (5Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to activate effectors including phospholipase C-β (3Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mechanisms to attenuate receptor signaling have evolved that limit the amplitude and/or duration of the signal transduction cascade(s) and are collectively referred to as “desensitization.” At the molecular level, desensitization may result from the degradation of ligand, from changes in receptor availability or activity, or from changes in the availability or activity of downstream effector molecules (6Grady E.F. Bohm S.K. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G586-G601PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodopsin, which signals through transducin (Gt), and the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), which signals through Gs, have been the most extensively studied GPCRs. In both cases, rapid agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation along with subsequent binding of an arrestin to the receptor play critical roles in receptor deactivation (7Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Many other GPCRs are also known to be rapidly phosphorylated after addition of agonist (9Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8217-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two classes of protein kinase have been implicated in agonist-induced GPCR phosphorylation: 1) the second messenger-dependent protein kinases A and C and 2) the second messenger independent kinases, called G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), including rhodopsin kinase (RK or GRK1) and the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1 or GRK2) (12Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Several GPCRs are known to be substrates for phosphorylation by GRKs in vitro (12Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution systems have been used to evaluate the relative contributions of phosphorylation and arrestin for uncoupling. For rhodopsin, RK phosphorylation alone inhibits coupling to Gt, and the intrinsic inhibitory effects of phosphorylation on coupling are augmented by the addition of arrestin (13Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 14Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). But for the β2AR, neither in vitrophosphorylation by βARK (GRK2) (15Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Weyand I.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) nor in vivodesensitization by agonist (17Keenan A.K. Cooney D. Holzhofer A. Dees C. Hekman M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) has a large effect on reconstituted receptor coupling. In contrast, phosphorylation of the β2AR by protein kinase A does deactivate the receptor (16Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), as does addition of β-arrestin to βARK1-phosphorylated β2AR (18Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that for the β2AR, GRK-induced phosphorylation serves primarily as a requisite for the binding of β-arrestin. Hence, receptor phosphorylation alone appears to have a variable effect upon coupling, depending upon assay conditions, receptor substrate, and protein kinase. But the β2AR is often viewed as the best model for GPCR desensitization because it is unclear whether data obtained from the unique environment of the visual system can be extrapolated to any other GPCR. The GRP-R undergoes rapid, agonist-induced desensitization (3Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms governing its desensitization are unknown. The GRP-R is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo by a protein kinase other than protein kinase C after exposure to bombesin (BN) (11Kroog G.S. Sainz E. Worland P.J. Akeson M.A. Benya R.V. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8217-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the role of phosphorylation in desensitization is undefined. Additionally, the molecular events resulting in desensitization of Gq-coupled receptors (such as the GRP-R) have been less well studied than for rhodopsin or the β2AR. It is unclear whether the mechanisms governing desensitization will be the same for receptors that use different cognate G protein(s). For example, for the muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which can couple to Gi/o and Gq, differences were found in the agonist- and GRK-induced phosphorylation and desensitization among and between Gi/o- and Gq-preferring receptor subtypes (9Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19DebBurman S.K. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Mol.

Therefore, to begin examining the molecular mechanisms involved in GRP-R desensitization, this study was undertaken to determine whether the GRP-R is a substrate in vitro for phosphorylation by a GRK, and if so, whether GRK phosphorylation effects GRP-R coupling.

Samples were incubated in a solution with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm AEBSF. Other reagents were added as indicated in the text and figures. Inclusion of 1 mm TMP and 100 mm ATP completely inhibited nucleotidase activity present in the membrane preparation as determined by evaluating adenosine phosphates by thin layer chromatography with polyethyleneimine cellulose as described previously (data not shown) (30Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Incorporation of 32P was assessed by stopping the reaction with an equal volume of 2% SDS then collecting the GRP-R by immunoprecipitation. A modification of previously described procedures (11Kroog G.S. Sainz E. Worland P.J. Akeson M.A. Benya R.V. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4–20% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was fixed and dried and exposed to either x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Radiospecific activity was determined by spotting a small volume of the reaction solution onto the filter paper with the dried gel and exposing both to the PhosphorImager screen at the same time. The relative PhosphorImager counts in the GRP-R band and reaction mix were determined, and then the phosphorylation stoichiometry was calculated using the number of antagonist binding sites present in the membranes at the end of the assay. 5′ET4 cells were phosphorylated using a modification of previous methods (11Kroog G.S.

Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free medium with 50 μCi of32PO4/ml (PF medium) and then exposed to 1 μm bombesin for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by removing PF medium, washing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and adding 2% SDS/50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Phosphorylated GRP-Rs were collected by immunoprecipitation as described above. Total intracellular ATP was determined from a replicate dish using the Bioluminescent Somatic Cell Assay Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell [32P]ATP was determined measuring adenosine phosphates in a replicate dish by thin layer chromatography with polyethyleneimine cellulose as a modification of previous methods (30Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PF medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. 500 μl of solution A was added followed by an equal volume of 10% perchloric acid on ice, and then the solution was neutralized with 1 m KHCO3. 2 μl of the supernatant was then applied to a thin layer plate of polyethyleneimine cellulose, and the chromatogram was developed with 0.5 m LiCl in 2m formic acid. The plate was dried, and adenosine phosphates were visualized with an ultraviolet light source. The location of the 32P was determined by exposing the plate to x-ray film and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Cell number in a replicate dish was determined, and receptor number on whole cells was measured as described (31Kroog G.S. Hellmich M.R. Akeson M.A. Jensen R.T. Northup J.K. Battey J.F. Martinet Y.

The GRP-R catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTPγS on Gαq was determined by modification of published procedures (5Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Solution G for all experiments contained 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mmNaCl. 0.5–2 μm GDP, 8–16 nm (0.01–0.02 μCi/μl) [35S]GTPγS, and 1 mm TMP were added to solution G as indicated. For two-step phosphorylation/coupling assays, the total reaction volume was 100 μl. Ice-cold solution G was supplemented with other reagents as indicated. Reactions were initiated by adding GRP-R-containing membranes (treated with or without GRK2 in the phosphorylation assay) directly to the other components without any processing. Reaction velocities were determined by incubating samples at 30 °C and removing 10-μl aliquots at timed intervals. Aliquots were added to 4 ml of ice-cold solution S (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2) to terminate the reaction, and then samples were processed and radioactivity was quantitated as described (5Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For one-step coupling assays, reactions were usually carried out in 0.2-ml polymerase chain reaction tubes (Molecular BioProducts, San Diego, CA) with a total reaction volume of 20–50 μl. Membranes containing the GRP-R were mixed on ice with Gβγ and solution G-supplemented as described in the figures. The mixture was prewarmed for 30 s at 30 °C, and then the reaction was initiated by addition of Gαq. Samples were incubated for the times indicated. In the presence of TMP, all reaction velocities were constant with time for at least 15 min, and the measurement of GTPγS binding at a single time point provided similar results to those obtained using rates obtained from progress curves (data not shown).V max and K m were determined using KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software) and fitting the data for initial velocities to a single site binding model. Samples were resolved on 10% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose, and Western blotted using the pan-arrestin antibody F4C1 at a dilution of 1:250 using previously published methods (11Kroog G.S.

We first examined whether the GRP-R is a substrate for phosphorylation by a GRKin vitro. As our source of receptor, we chose to use urea-extracted membranes from transfected mammalian cells expressing high levels (∼550,000/cell) of a Myc epitope-tagged GRP-R (5Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Jian X. Sainz E. Clark W.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. J. Biol.

Phospholipids have been shown to be important in regulation of GRK activity (32DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Boetticher E. Lomasney J.W. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5742-5747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and therefore a relevant membrane environment may be crucial for studying receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. Urea-extracted membranes from Sf9 cells infected with a GRP-R-containing baculovirus (22Kusui T. Hellmich M.R. Wang L.H. Evans R.L. Benya R.V. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8061-8075Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were used for some experiments to confirm that there were no membrane-specific or Myc tag-dependent effects. Fig. 1 shows the in vitrophosphorylation of the Myc-tagged GRP-R by GRK2 (βARK1). There is no GRP-R phosphorylation in the absence of added GRK2 (lane 2), the GRP-R is a substrate for phosphorylation by GRK2 only in the presence of agonist (compare lanes 3 and 6 withlanes 4 and 7), and the GRK2-mediated GRP-R phosphorylation is markedly enhanced by the presence of Gβγ (compare lanes 3 and 6 with lane 8). The presence or absence of GTPγS has no effect on the phosphorylation reaction (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that there is no effect of endogenous Gα subunits. These results are consistent with previous data on the requirements for phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRK2 (33Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2222-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 300 nm bovine brain Gβγ, maximum phosphorylation (of 7.2 nm GRP-R) in a 30-min assay occurred with 300 nm GRK2, and the stoichiometry of GRK2-dependent phosphorylation was ∼0.9 mol PO4/mol GRP-R detectable by antagonist binding (data not shown). To study the effect of phosphorylation on coupling to G proteins, a two-step phosphorylation-coupling procedure was performed. In these experiments, 7 m urea-extracted GRP-Rs (expressed in either membrane environment) were first incubated with 150 nm bombesin in the presence or absence of GRK2 for 30 min. Bovine retinal β1γ1 was used to enhance phosphorylation. In the second step, the receptors were incubated in the presence of G protein subunits (Gαq and Gβ1γ1), GDP, and [S35]GTPγS, to assess GRP-R catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαq. Cuttlefish retinal Gαq was utilized as a reporter for coupling because the GRP-R couples to this Gαq efficiently (5Hellmich M.R. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Jian X. Sainz E. Clark W.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11573-11581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and large quantities of cuttlefish Gαq can be prepared. Catalytic activity of the GRP-R without agonist was measured by adding an excess of ME (a pure GRP-R antagonist) to some of the reactions. The +ME condition is equivalent in the coupling assay to no added bombesin (data not shown). In Fig. 2, data are presented as a progress curve showing [S35]GTPγS binding as a function of time. In both mouse fibroblast (Fig. 2) and insect cell membranes (not shown), in vitro GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of the GRP-R uncouples the receptor from Gq. All experiments performed using these conditions showed no detectable increase in the catalysis of [35S]GTPγS binding by bombesin for GRK2-treated receptors above the level catalyzed by either receptor preparation in the presence of antagonist. The rate of [35S]GTPγS binding catalyzed by control membranes in the presence of bombesin was significantly higher (2.9 ± .4 fold,n = 4) than the rate catalyzed by GRK2-treated membranes in the presence of bombesin. The uncoupling is not a result of the selective loss of correctly folded receptor because the number of antagonist binding sites are equivalent in both GRK2-treated and untreated conditions following a 30-min incubation (data not shown). Uncoupling requires the presence of ATP in the phosphorylation step because the replacement of ATP by the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PCP prevented GRK2-dependent uncoupling (data not shown). However, the continued presence of ATP is not required because the addition of AMP-PCP after the phosphorylation step did not prevent uncoupling (Fig. 2). Additionally, bombesin is needed in the phosphorylation step for GRK2 to uncouple the GRP-R because the addition of GRK2 without bombesin did not uncouple the GRP-R (data not shown). This implies that uncoupling requires the phosphorylation of the GRP-R because the receptor is not phosphorylated without the addition of agonist (Fig. 1). Finally, phosphorylation-induced uncoupling is a function of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation because partial uncoupling was seen with lower stoichiometry of phosphorylation (data not shown). To determine the stoichiometry of bombesin-stimulatedin vivo GRP-R phosphorylation, 5′ET4 cells were metabolically labe"

His86 is located adjacent to β subunit Lys87, which forms an internal aldimine with the pyridoxal phosphate and catalyzes the abstraction of the α-proton of l-serine. The replacement of His86 by leucine (H86L) weakened pyridoxal phosphate binding ∼20-fold and abolished the circular dichroism signals of the bound coenzyme and of a reaction intermediate. Correlation of these results with previous crystal structures indicates that β-His86 plays a structural role in binding pyridoxal phosphate and in stabilizing the correct orientation of pyridoxal phosphate in the active site of the β subunit. The H86L mutation also altered the pH profiles of absorbance and fluorescence signals and shifted the pH optimum for the synthesis of l-tryptophan from pH 7.5 to 8.8. We propose that the interaction of His86 with the phosphate of pyridoxal phosphate and with Lys87 lowers the pK a of Lys87 in the wild-type α2β2complex and thereby facilitates catalysis by Lys87 in the physiological pH range.

Multiple alignment of many sequences of several enzymes in this family (Fold type II) showed that the residue on the N-terminal side of the active-site Lys is His in the tryptophan synthase β subunit, Val inO-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, Phe or Tyr in threonine deaminase, Phe in threonine synthase, Val or Ile in cystathionine β-synthase, Phe in l-serine dehydratase, Phe or Ile ind-serine dehydratase, and Asn in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (see Electronic Appendix to Ref. 8Grishin N.V.

This residue is located at the back of the coenzyme ring in the structures of tryptophan synthase (9Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

The authors of the latter work suggested that this residue (Val40) may support the coenzyme ring, similar to the functions performed by Ala224 in aspartate aminotransferase (12Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules & Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 187-288Google Scholar) and Ala245 in dialkylglycine decarboxylase (13Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Keller J.W. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Leu201 is located in a similar position in the structure of d-amino-acid aminotransferase (14Sugio S. Petsko G.A. Manning J.M. Soda K. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9661-9669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is classed in Fold type IV (8Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J.

Ringe D. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) methods support the proposal that Leu201 plays a crucial role in the transamination reaction by keeping the pyridoxyl ring in the proper location without disturbing its oscillating motion. The reaction of l-Ser with the β subunit proceeds through a series of PLP intermediates (Fig. 1 A): thegem-diamine intermediate (E-GD), the external aldimine ofl-Ser (E-Ser), and the external aldimine of aminoacrylate (E-AA). E-AA reacts with indole to form a quinonoid intermediate (E-Q); protonation of E-Q yields the external aldimine of thel-Trp (E-Trp). In the absence of added indole, E-Ser and E-AA accumulate. The equilibrium distribution of E-Ser and E-AA is affected by pH, temperature, monovalent cations, and allosteric ligands (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of enzyme-substrate intermediates formed by the tryptophan α2β2 complex provide further insight into the roles of His86 and of other active-site residues. The structure of E-Ser was obtained by cryocrystallography of a mutant (αD60N) tryptophan synthase α2β2complex in the presence of l-Ser (18Rhee S. Miles E.W. Mozzarelli A. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10653-10659Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The structure of E-AA was obtained with the wild-type α2β2 complex in the presence ofl-Ser and fluoroindole-3-propanol phosphate using a flow cell (19Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Both structures show that one nitrogen of His86 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the phosphate of PLP and the hydroxyl group of Ser235. The phosphate of PLP also interacts with the hydroxyl group of Ser235 and with the carbonyl oxygens of Ser235and of three glycine residues in the glycine-rich loop (residues 232–234). The primary difference between the two structures is that His86 can form a hydrogen bond with the ε-amino group of Lys87 (3.09 Å) in the structure of E-AA, but is too far (3.8 Å) to form a stable hydrogen bond with Lys87 in the structure of E-Ser. However, because the temperature factor of the ε-amino group of Lys87 is high in both structures, this group undergoes fluctuations in its position. The presence of the hydrogen bond between His86 and Lys87 in E-AA (19Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) is consistent with evidence from spectroscopic experiments that the abstracted α-proton of l-Ser is sequestered in a solvent-excluded site and possibly stored in a low barrier hydrogen bond (20Hur O. Leja C. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The interactions of His86 with PLP and with other residues in the active site would be expected to alter the pK a values of His86, Lys87, and the phosphate of PLP. Indeed, the 31P nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift of the phosphate of the PLP, which is bound to the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex and β2 subunit from E. coli, is pH-independent from pH 6.5 to 8.6, whereas the PLP 31P chemical shift of a model PLP derivative exhibits a pK a value of 6.23 (21Schnackerz K.D. Bartholmes P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the phosphate group of PLP is excluded from interaction with water and is fixed in its dianionic form by means of a salt bridge to a positively charged region of the active center, leading to a considerable lowering of the pK a value for the monoanion-dianion (21Schnackerz K.D. Bartholmes P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by the crystallographic results (Fig. 1, B and C) that show that His86 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the phosphate of PLP. Interestingly, the 31P shift of PLP bound to d-serine dehydratase from E. coli is pH-dependent, with pK a ∼ 6.4 (22Schnackerz K.D. Feldmann K. Hull W.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).d-Serine dehydratase is related in sequence to the tryptophan synthase β subunit, but has Ile117 at the position equivalent to His86 in the β subunit (see Electronic Appendix to Ref. 8Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These observations provide additional evidence that His86 in the β subunit stabilizes the phosphate of PLP as the dianion. Early studies of the effects of substitution of β subunit His86 by leucine (H86L) in the α2β2 complex concluded that His86 did not play an important role in catalysis or in substrate binding (23Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report more detailed investigations of the effects of pH on kinetic and spectroscopic properties of the H86L α2β2 complex. The results provide evidence that His86 facilitates catalysis by lowering the pK a of the catalytic residue Lys87 and also plays a structural role by binding and supporting the PLP coenzyme. PLP and l-Ser were purchased from Sigma. MOPS and proline were from Fluka. Bicine was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. MBP buffer (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F.

Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which lacks the trp operon. The plasmid pSTB7 (25Kawasaki H. Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the H86L mutant trpB gene from the S. typhimuriumα2β2 complex was used to express the H86L α2β2 complex in E. coli CB149 (23Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant and wild-type α2β2complexes were purified by a method using crystallization from crude extracts (23Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α subunit was expressed and purified as described previously (26Jhee K.-H. Yang L. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11417-11422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the specific absorbance at 278 nm usingA 1 cm1% = 6.0 for the α2β2 complex andA 1 cm1% = 4.4 for the α subunit (27Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The apo forms of the wild-type and mutant α2β2 complexes were prepared by a method utilizing treatment with hydroxylamine and KSCN (28Miles E.W. Moriguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6594-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of tryptophan synthase in the β-replacement reaction (l-Ser + indole → l-Trp + H2O) was determined by a spectrophotometric assay (27Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm indole, and various concentrations of l-Ser. The activity in the β-elimination reaction (l-Ser → pyruvate + NH3) was determined with various concentrations ofl-Ser in the presence of 100 mm NaCl by a spectrophotometric assay coupled with lactic dehydrogenase (29Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One unit of activity in any reaction is the formation of 0.1 μmol of product in 20 min at 37 °C. Because the α subunit associates more weakly with the H86L β subunit than with the wild-type β subunit (23Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all assays were carried out in the presence of an ∼10-fold excess of α subunit. The maximal velocity (V) was determined by fitting the initial rate data to Equation 1, v=V·S/[Km+S](Eq. 1) where v is the initial rate and S is the concentration of l-serine in the presence of 0.2 mm indole. Absorption spectra were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were made using a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer. The pH dependence of the absorption and fluorescence spectra was measured in the presence of 100 mml-Ser. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in the absence and presence ofl-Ser (100 mm). The final concentration of the protein used for the spectroscopic measurements was 10 μm. All spectra were obtained in the presence of excess α subunit at 25 °C. The apparent dissociation constants of PLP for the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes were determined by measuring the activity of the apoenzymes in the β-replacement reaction (l-Ser + indole → l-Trp + H2O) in a reaction mixture containing 100 mml-Ser, 0.2 mm indole, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MBP buffer, and a 10-fold molar excess of α subunit at pH 7.3, 8.0, or 9.2 and at 37 °C. PLP concentrations were 0–1 μm for the wild-type enzyme and 0–30 μm for the H86L enzyme. The absorption spectrum of the H86L α2β2 complex in the absence ofl-Ser (Fig. 2) was similar to that of the wild-type α2β2 complex (spectrum not shown). However, the absorbance at 420 nm of the H86L α2β2 complex exhibited a small decrease at alkaline pH (Fig. 2, inset), which is not observed with the wild-type enzyme (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectra of the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes (Fig. 3 A) and plots of fluorescence at 510 nm versus pH (Fig. 3 B) also revealed differences between the two enzymes. The fluorescence intensity of the wild-type enzyme was essentially pH-independent in the absence ofl-Ser, whereas that of the H86L enzyme decreased at alkaline pH.FIG. 3Effect of pH on the fluorescence emission properties of the wild-type and H86L α2β2complexes.

The equilibrium distribution of these intermediates under steady-state conditions is strongly pH-dependent (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E-Ser (λmax = 420 nm) predominated at high pH, whereas E-AA (λmax = 350 nm) predominated at low pH. E-Ser can also be monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission at 510 nm (excitation at 420 nm) (30Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 420 nm and the fluorescence intensity of the intermediates formed in the reaction of the wild-type α2β2 complex with l-Ser exhibit very similar pH dependences (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effects of pH on the absorption spectra (Fig. 2) and fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3 C) of the H86L α2β2 complex in the presence ofl-Ser were significantly different from the effects of pH on the spectra of the wild-type enzyme reported previously (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 420 nm and the fluorescence emission at 510 nm (excitation at 420 nm), which are attributed to E-Ser, of the H86L α2β2 complex increased significantly only above pH 8 (Figs. 2 and 3, C and D), whereas the analogous signals of the wild-type enzyme increased significantly between pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 3, C and D) (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The major absorbance peak of the H86L enzyme in the presence ofl-Ser (λmax = 320–340 nm) (Fig. 2) differed from that of the wild-type enzyme (λmax = 350 nm) (17Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The low wavelength peak of the H86L enzyme shifted from 340 to 320 nm with increasing pH. To further characterize the low wavelength peak of the H86L enzyme, fluorescence emission spectra (excitation at 335 nm) were recorded for the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes in the presence of l-Ser at three pH values (Fig. 4). The H86L enzyme, unlike the wild-type enzyme, exhibited a strong fluorescence emission at 400 nm at pH 7.6 in the presence of l-Ser. The intensity of this peak decreased with increasing pH. These results provide evidence for the presence of a PLP derivative with saturated C-4′ in the reaction of H86L withl-Ser (31Johnson G.F. Tu J.I. Bartlett M.L. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5560-5568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shaltiel S. Cortijo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), most likely the gem-diamine (E-GD in Fig. 1 A). PLP bound to the wild-type tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex exhibited a positive circular dichroism band at 412 nm (Fig. 5 A), as reported previously (28Miles E.W. Moriguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6594-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Balk H. Merkl I. Bartholmes P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6391-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Lane A.N.

Biophys. 1991; 28: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of l-Ser to the enzyme produced a strong negative circular dichroism band at 330 nm with the disappearance of the positive circular dichroism band at 412 nm, as reported previously (34Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Kanzaki H. Miles E.W. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 28: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the H86L mutant enzyme showed no circular dichroism bands either in the absence or presence ofl-Ser between pH 7 and 9 (Fig. 5 B). The apparent dissociation constants for PLP (K d (PLP)) were determined from the effect of PLP concentration on the activity of the apoenzyme forms of the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results (Table I) show that the H86L mutation increasedK d (PLP) ∼18-fold at pH 7.3, 8.0, and 9.2 and did not affect the slight pH dependence ofK d (PLP).Table IApparent dissociation constants of PLP for the wild-type and H86L α 2 β 2 complexespHK d(PLP)Wild-type α2β2H86L α2β2μm7.30.199 ± 0.0153.772 ± 0.2688.00.181 ± 0.0203.054 ± 0.3989.20.161 ± 0.0292.766 ± 0.399 Open table in a new tab The stability of enzyme-bound PLP to dialysis was determined for the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes as reported previously for the wild-type and K87T α2β2 complexes (36Banik U. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The PLP content was determined by a fluorometric method (37Adams E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After dialysis for 8 h, the PLP content of the wild-type α2β2complex was unchanged, whereas the PLP content of the H86L α2β2 complex was reduced by 30%. Under the same conditions, the PLP content of the K87T α2β2 complex was reduced by 40% (36Banik U. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The pH dependences of activity (V max) for the wild-type and H86L α2β2 complexes were determined for the β-elimination reaction (Fig. 6 A) and for the β-replacement reaction (Fig. 6 B). The pH profiles of the wild-type enzyme in the two reactions were very different. Although the activity was maximal at pH ∼7.5 in the β-replacement reaction as reported recently (38Ro H.-S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31189-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the activity in the β-elimination reaction increased between pH 6.6 and 9.2. In contrast, the activity of the H86L enzyme was very low at pH 7 and increased markedly above pH 7.5 in both reactions. The H86L mutation shifted the maximum of the bell-shaped curve of V max versus pH in the β-replacement reaction from pH 7.5 to 8.8. Our studies of the effects of a mutation (H86L) in the active site of the β subunit of tryptophan synthase demonstrate that His86 stabilizes the PLP coenzyme and alters the pH dependence of the spectroscopic properties and of activity. Our findings that the H86L mutation increased the apparent dissociation constant for PLP (K d (PLP)) ∼18-fold (Table I) and increased the rate of removal of PLP by dialysis provide evidence that His86 plays a role in cofactor binding. This functional role is consistent with the crystallographic evidence that His86 interacts with the phosphate of PLP and with Ser235 in the Gly-rich loop and is located behind the PLP ring (Fig. 1, B and C). Dialysis has been used previously to compare the rate of PLP dissociation from the wild-type and K87T α2β2 complexes and to demonstrate that PLP is bound more weakly to the mutant enzyme (36Banik U. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The results established the importance of the internal aldimine (E in Fig. 1 A) for tight binding of PLP. The interaction of the phosphate of PLP with a Gly-rich loop is a common feature of PLP enzymes in Fold types I, II, and IV (8Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Mutations (Gly to Asp) at either of two positions in the Gly-rich loop of d-serine dehydratase, an enzyme related to tryptophan synthase and in Fold type II, led to loss of activity and to a great increase in K d (PLP) (39Marceau M. McFall E. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16926-16933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Marceau M. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16934-16941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicated that the mutant d-serine dehydratases bind PLP weakly, but do not hold the cofactor in a catalytically competent orientation. The tryptophan synthase β subunit is the only member of Fold type II that has His adjacent to the active-site Lys. Consequently, the interactions of His86 with the phosphate of PLP and Ser235, as shown in Fig. 1 (B andC), are likely to be features specific to tryptophan synthase that are important for binding PLP and for holding PLP in the catalytically competent orientation. Thus, mutation of His86 in tryptophan synthase has effects similar to those of mutation of Gly in the Gly-rich loop of d-serine dehydratase. The measured K d (PLP) is an apparent dissociation constant because it is determined from activity in the presence of l-Ser and indole. l-Ser may alter PLP binding in two ways: first by converting the internal aldimine to one or more external aldimines (Fig. 1 A) and second by inducing a conformational change that alters catalysis and increases subunit association (41Lane A.N. Paul C.H. Kirschner K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The occurrence of a conformational change triggered by reaction with l-Ser is supported by kinetic results (42Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brzović P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and by crystallographic results (19Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A trueK d = 1 μm for PLP binding to the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex fromE. coli has been determined by equilibrium dialysis (45Bartholmes P. Kirschner K. Gschwind H.P. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4712-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our finding that the apparent K d (∼0.2 μm in Table I) for the wild-type α2β2 complex obtained from activity in the presence of l-Ser and indole is lower than the trueK d = 1 μm demonstrates thatl-Ser does increase the affinity for PLP. The induced circular dichroism signal from enzyme-bound PLP has been proposed to largely originate from out-of-plane twisting of the internal aldimine double bond with respect to the pyridine ring of PLP (46Judd C.T. Ingraham L.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1978; 75: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The loss in the H86L α2β2 complex of the circular dichroism signals that are observed in the wild-type α2β2 complex and in its reaction intermediate with l-Ser (Fig. 5) suggests that the double bond and the PLP ring have relaxed in the mutant enzyme. Several other mutant forms of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex exhibit optically active PLP coenzymes (35Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Kanzaki H. Miles E.W. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 28: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). The only exception observed previously is the K87T α2β2 complex, which has very weak circular dichroism at 400 nm (35Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Kanzaki H. Miles E.W. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 28: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrated the importance of the internal aldimine linkage (E in Fig. 1 A) for rigid or asymmetric binding of PLP (35Kayastha A.M. Sawa Y. Nagata S. Kanzaki H. Miles E.W. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 28: 352-357PubMed Google Scholar). Our new finding that His86is also needed for the rigid or asymmetric binding of PLP leads to the conclusion that multiple interactions are required for the proper orientation of PLP in the active site of the β subunit: the formation of an aldimine, interactions of the phosphate of PLP with residues 232–235 in the glycine-rich loop and with His86, and the location of His86 behind the PLP ring (Fig. 1). Our results show that mutation of β subunit His86 (H86L) altered the pH dependence of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex in the absence ofl-Ser (Figs. 2 (inset) and 3 (A andB)) and in the presence of l-Ser (Figs. 2, 3 (C and D), and 4) and altered the pH dependence of V max in the β-elimination and β-replacement reactions (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively). The H86L α2β2 complex formed very little E-Ser between pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 3 D) and had very low activity in either the β-elimination reaction (Fig. 6 A) or the β-replacement reaction (Fig. 6 B) between pH 7 and 8. Under the same conditions, the wild-type enzyme formed significant E-Ser (Fig. 3 D) and had significant activity (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, the H86L α2β2 complex exhibited an intense fluorescence emission peak at 405 nm (excitation at 335 nm) at pH 7.6 and 8.0 that decreased in intensity at pH 9.3 (Fig. 4) and that was not seen with the wild-type enzyme. This emission peak is characteristic of PLP gem-diamines (47Schirch L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1939-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (E-GD in Fig. 1 A) and other PLP derivatives that have saturated C-4′ and sp 3character at C-4′ (31Johnson G.F. Tu J.I. Bartlett M.L. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5560-5568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shaltiel S. Cortijo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A gem-diamine intermediate has been detected previously in the reaction of the wild-type α2β2 tryptophan synthase complex with the intermediate analogues oxindolyl-l-alanine and 2,3-dihydro-l-tryptophan (48Roy M. Miles E.W. Phillips R.S. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8661-8669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A novel derivative that has an emission maximum at 384 nm upon excitation at 340 nm is formed during the inactivation of a mutant (S377D) tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex (49Jhee K.-H. McPhie P. Ro H.-S. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14591-14604Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, enolimine tautomers of Schiff bases exhibit maximal fluorescence near 500 nm upon excitation at the wavelength of maximal absorbance (320–350 nm) as reported for native phosphorylase (32Shaltiel S. Cortijo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The combined spectroscopic results (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4) provide evidence that the H86L α2β2 complex reacts withl-Ser between pH 7 and 8 to form the gem-diamine intermediate (E-GD in Fig. 1 A) and that the conversion of E-GD to E-Ser is low under these conditions. The formation of a low level of E-Ser between pH 7 and 8 probably results from the low catalytic activity of the H86L α2β2 complex in β-elimination and β-replacement reactions in this pH range (Fig. 6). We now ask how the H86L mutation alters the catalytic properties. The presence of His86 behind the PLP ring in the wild-type enzyme may facilitate expulsion of Lys87 from thegem-diamine. In addition, His86 in the wild-type enzyme very likely alters the pK a of Lys87. His86, Lys87, and the phosphate of PLP are involved in a complex system of interactions with each other and with other residues in the β site (positions 232–235) in E-Ser (Fig. 1 B) and E-AA (Fig. 1 C). X-ray crystallography cannot assign the location of protons shared between these groups. However, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance studies of tryptophan synthase demonstrate that the PLP phosphate is a dianion and suggest that the dianion is stabilized by means of a salt bridge to a positively charged region of the active center, leading to a considerable lowering of the pK a value for the monoanion-dianion (21Schnackerz K.D. Bartholmes P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The crystallographic results (Fig. 1) suggest that His86 is the positively charged residue that forms an ion pair with the phosphate of PLP. This ion pair may stabilize the protonated His86, raise the pK a of His86, and reduce the pK a of the phosphate of PLP. The proximity of the protonated His86 to Lys87 may decrease the pK a of Lys87 and increase the ability of Lys87 to accept the α-proton of l-serine at neutral pH. This suggestion is supported by the observation that replacement of His86 by a neutral leucine residue (H86L) increased the pK a of Lys87 and shifted the pH activity profile (Fig. 6). Our recent investigations of the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters of the wild-type α2β2 complex in the β-replacement reaction provided evidence that Lys87has a pK a value of ∼7.2, which is much lower than the pK a of the ε-amino group of lysine in solution (∼10.5) (38Ro H.-S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31189-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our new results and interpretation of the crystallographic data provide a plausible explanation for the low pK a of Lys87 in the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic studies of the wild-type enzyme (38Ro H.-S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31189-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also provided evidence that the decrease in activity in the β-replacement reaction at high pH (pK a = 8.3) (Fig. 6 B) is associated with a conformational change that yields an open form of the α2β2 complex. Interestingly, the pH profile of V max for the β-elimination reaction by the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6 A), which has not been reported previously, was very different from that for the β-replacement reaction (Fig. 6 B). The β-elimination activity increased nearly linearly between pH 6.7 and 9.3. A plausible explanation is that the open form of the α2β2 complex formed at high pH has increased activity in the β-elimination reaction. We have proposed previously that the open form of the α2β2 complex, which is induced by mutation (50Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

Our finding of increasing β-elimination activity with increasing pH is consistent with the previous conclusion that the open conformation is formed at high pH (38Ro H.-S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31189-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The H86L α2β2 complex also showed an almost linear increase in β-elimination activity between pH 7.5 and 9.3, but showed much lower activity at low pH than the wild-type enzyme. The decreased activity at low pH likely results from the increase in the pK a of the catalytic Lys87 caused by the mutation. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that His86 facilitates catalysis by altering the pK a of Lys87 and plays a structural role in binding and orienting the PLP coenzyme. We are grateful to Drs. Peter McPhie and Sangkee Rhee for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript."
