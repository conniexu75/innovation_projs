https://openalex.org/W2126496132,"In the last decade, optimized treatment for non-small cell lung cancer had lead to improved prognosis, but the overall survival is still very short. To further understand the molecular basis of the disease we have to identify biomarkers related to survival. Here we present the development of an online tool suitable for the real-time meta-analysis of published lung cancer microarray datasets to identify biomarkers related to survival. We searched the caBIG, GEO and TCGA repositories to identify samples with published gene expression data and survival information. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival plot with hazard ratio and logrank P value are calculated and plotted in R. The complete analysis tool can be accessed online at: www.kmplot.com/lung. All together 1,715 samples of ten independent datasets were integrated into the system. As a demonstration, we used the tool to validate 21 previously published survival associated biomarkers. Of these, survival was best predicted by CDK1 (p<1E-16), CD24 (p<1E-16) and CADM1 (p = 7E-12) in adenocarcinomas and by CCNE1 (p = 2.3E-09) and VEGF (p = 3.3E-10) in all NSCLC patients. Additional genes significantly correlated to survival include RAD51, CDKN2A, OPN, EZH2, ANXA3, ADAM28 and ERCC1. In summary, we established an integrated database and an online tool capable of uni- and multivariate analysis for in silico validation of new biomarker candidates in non-small cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2115719856,"Background Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased survival among HIV-positive adults in the United States (U.S.) and Canada, but gains in life expectancy for this region have not been well characterized. We aim to estimate temporal changes in life expectancy among HIV-positive adults on ART from 2000–2007 in the U.S. and Canada. Methods Participants were from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), aged ≥20 years and on ART. Mortality rates were calculated using participants' person-time from January 1, 2000 or ART initiation until death, loss to follow-up, or administrative censoring December 31, 2007. Life expectancy at age 20, defined as the average number of additional years that a person of a specific age will live, provided the current age-specific mortality rates remain constant, was estimated using abridged life tables. Results The crude mortality rate was 19.8/1,000 person-years, among 22,937 individuals contributing 82,022 person-years and 1,622 deaths. Life expectancy increased from 36.1 [standard error (SE) 0.5] to 51.4 [SE 0.5] years from 2000–2002 to 2006–2007. Men and women had comparable life expectancies in all periods except the last (2006–2007). Life expectancy was lower for individuals with a history of injection drug use, non-whites, and in patients with baseline CD4 counts <350 cells/mm3. Conclusions A 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on ART in the U.S. or Canada is expected to live into their early 70 s, a life expectancy approaching that of the general population. Differences by sex, race, HIV transmission risk group, and CD4 count remain."
https://openalex.org/W2044335668,"Purpose Nonequilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (NEAPP) therapy has recently been focused on as a novel medical practice. Using cells with acquired paclitaxel/cisplatin resistance, we elucidated effects of indirect NEAPP-activated medium (NEAPP-AM) exposure on cell viability and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Methods Using chronic paclitaxel/cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, we applied indirect NEAPP-exposed medium to cells and xenografted tumors in a mouse model. Furthermore, we examined the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or their scavengers in the above-mentioned EOC cells. Results We assessed the viability of NOS2 and NOS3 cells exposed to NEAPP-AM, which was prepared beforehand by irradiation with NEAPP for the indicated time. In NOS2 cells, viability decreased by approximately 30% after NEAPP-AM 120-sec treatment (P<0.01). The growth-inhibitory effects of NEAPP-AM were completely inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine treatment, while L-buthionine-[S, R]-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of the ROS scavenger used with NEAPP-AM, decreased cell viability by 85% after NEAPP-AM 60-sec treatment(P<0.05) and by 52% after 120 sec, compared to the control (P<0.01). In the murine subcutaneous tumor-formation model, NEAPP-AM injection resulted in an average inhibition of the NOS2 cell-inoculated tumor by 66% (P<0.05) and NOS2TR cell-inoculated tumor by 52% (P<0.05), as compared with the control. Conclusion We demonstrated that plasma-activated medium also had an anti-tumor effect on chemo-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Indirect plasma therapy is a promising treatment option for EOC and may contribute to a better patient prognosis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2068674733,"Objective Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) reduced HIV acquisition in the iPrEx trial among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Self-reported sexual risk behavior decreased overall, but may be affected by reporting bias. We evaluated potential risk compensation using biomarkers of sexual risk behavior. Design and methods Sexual practices were assessed at baseline and quarterly thereafter; perceived treatment assignment and PrEP efficacy beliefs were assessed at 12 weeks. Among participants with ≥1 follow-up behavioral assessment, sexual behavior, syphilis, and HIV infection were compared by perceived treatment assignment, actual treatment assignment, and perceived PrEP efficacy. Results Overall, acute HIV infection and syphilis decreased during follow-up. Compared with participants believing they were receiving placebo, participants believing they were receiving FTC/TDF reported more receptive anal intercourse partners prior to initiating drug (12.8 vs. 7.7, P = 0.04). Belief in receiving FTC/TDF was not associated with an increase in receptive anal intercourse with no condom (ncRAI) from baseline through follow-up (risk ratio [RR] 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6–1.4; P = 0.75), nor with a decrease after stopping study drug (RR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.5–1.3; P = 0.46). In the placebo arm, there were trends toward lower HIV incidence among participants believing they were receiving FTC/TDF (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4–1.8; P = 0.26) and also believing it was highly effective (IRR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.1–1.7; P = 0.12). Conclusions There was no evidence of sexual risk compensation in iPrEx. Participants believing they were receiving FTC/TDF had more partners prior to initiating drug, suggesting that risk behavior was not a consequence of PrEP use."

The geographic projections of the emerging areas in a few recent studies on single regions have been suggested to share two distinct properties: first, they are cohesive, and second, they tend to closely follow socio-economic boundaries and are similar to existing political regions in size and number. Here we use an extended set of countries and clustering indices to quantify overlaps, providing ample additional evidence for these observations using phone data from countries of various scales across Europe, Asia, and Africa: France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Ivory Coast. In our analysis we use the known approach of partitioning country-wide networks, and an additional iterative partitioning of each of the first level communities into sub-communities, revealing that cohesiveness and matching of official regions can also be observed on a second level if spatial resolution of the data is high enough. The method has possible policy implications on the definition of the borderlines and sizes of administrative regions."
https://openalex.org/W2088152324,"Hyaluronan (HA) is the major glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix. During inflammation, there is an increased breakdown of HA, resulting in the accumulation of low molecular weight (LMW) HA and activation of monocytes and macrophages. Eicosanoids, derived from the cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IVA (cPLA2α) activation, are potent lipid mediators also attributed to acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of LMW HA on cPLA2α activation, arachidonic acid (AA) release, and subsequent eicosanoid production and to examine the receptors and downstream mechanisms involved in these processes in monocytes and differently polarized macrophages. LMW HA was a potent stimulant of AA release in a time- and dose-dependent manner, induced cPLA2α, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK phosphorylation, as well as activated COX2 expression and prostaglandin (PG) E2 production in primary human monocytes, murine RAW 264.7, and wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages. Specific cPLA2α inhibitor blocked HA-induced AA release and PGE2 production in all of these cells. Using CD44, TLR4, TLR2, MYD88, RHAMM or STAB2 siRNA-transfected macrophages and monocytes, we found that AA release, cPLA2α, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK phosphorylation, COX2 expression, and PGE2 production were activated by LMW HA through a TLR4/MYD88 pathway. Likewise, PGE2 production and COX2 expression were blocked in Tlr4(-/-) and Myd88(-/-) mice, but not in Cd44(-/-) mice, after LMW HA stimulation. Moreover, we demonstrated that LMW HA activated the M1 macrophage phenotype with the unique cPLA2α/COX2(high) and COX1/ALOX15/ALOX5/LTA4H(low) gene and PGE2/PGD2/15-HETE(high) and LXA4(low) eicosanoid profile. These findings reveal a novel link between HA-mediated inflammation and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2072992426,"Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) up-regulates CD36, a scavenger receptor responsible for macrophage uptake of ox-LDL without limitation. However, the precise underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Our previous study has demonstrated that ox-LDL induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in macrophages. The goal of this study was to explore the exact relationship between ER stress and macrophage-derived foam cell formation and whether ER stress would be involved in ox-LDL-induced CD36 up-regulation. Our results showed that ox-LDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages was promoted synergistically by ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM), while attenuated by ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). Ox-LDL caused CD36 up-regulation with concomitant activation of ER stress as assessed by phosphorylation of inositol-requiring kinase/endonuclease-1 (IRE-1) and protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), up-regulation of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78), and nuclear translocation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). TM not only up-regulated CD36 alone but also synergized with ox-LDL to increase CD36 expression. Alleviation of ER stress with PBA and siRNA against ATF6, IRE1, and GRP78 mitigated ox-LDL-induced CD36 protein up-regulation. Moreover, administration of apoE−/− mice with PBA suppressed the up-regulation of CD36, phospho-IRE1, and GRP78 in macrophage-dense atherosclerotic lesions and in peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, CD36 silencing attenuated ox-LDL-induced nuclear translocation of ATF6, phosphorylation of IRE1 and up-regulation of XBP1 and GRP78. These data indicate that CD36-mediated ox-LDL uptake in macrophages triggers ER stress response, which, in turn, plays a critical role in CD36 up-regulation, enhancing the foam cell formation by uptaking more ox-LDL.

https://openalex.org/W2138599020,"Bacteria can be refractory to antibiotics due to a sub-population of dormant cells, called persisters that are highly tolerant to antibiotic exposure. The low frequency and transience of the antibiotic tolerant “persister” trait has complicated elucidation of the mechanism that controls antibiotic tolerance. In this study, we show that 2’ Amino-acetophenone (2-AA), a poorly studied but diagnostically important small, volatile molecule produced by the recalcitrant gram-negative human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, promotes antibiotic tolerance in response to quorum-sensing (QS) signaling. Our results show that 2-AA mediated persister cell accumulation occurs via alteration of the expression of genes involved in the translational capacity of the cell, including almost all ribosomal protein genes and other translation-related factors. That 2-AA promotes persisters formation also in other emerging multi-drug resistant pathogens, including the non 2-AA producer Acinetobacter baumannii implies that 2-AA may play an important role in the ability of gram-negative bacteria to tolerate antibiotic treatments in polymicrobial infections. Given that the synthesis, excretion and uptake of QS small molecules is a common hallmark of prokaryotes, together with the fact that the translational machinery is highly conserved, we posit that modulation of the translational capacity of the cell via QS molecules, may be a general, widely distributed mechanism that promotes antibiotic tolerance among prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2071337667,"One way to manage disturbance to waterbirds in natural areas where humans require access is to promote the occurrence of stimuli for which birds tolerate closer approaches, and so cause fewer responses. We conducted 730 experimental approaches to 39 species of waterbird, using five stimulus types (single walker, three walkers, bicycle, car and bus) selected to mimic different human management options available for a controlled access, Ramsar-listed wetland. Across species, where differences existed (56% of 25 cases), motor vehicles always evoked shorter flight-initiation distances (FID) than humans on foot. The influence of stimulus type on FID varied across four species for which enough data were available for complete cross-stimulus analysis. All four varied FID in relation to stimuli, differing in 4 to 7 of 10 possible comparisons. Where differences occurred, the effect size was generally modest, suggesting that managing stimulus type (e.g. by requiring people to use vehicles) may have species-specific, modest benefits, at least for the waterbirds we studied. However, different stimulus types have different capacities to reduce the frequency of disturbance (i.e. by carrying more people) and vary in their capacity to travel around important habitat."
https://openalex.org/W3122184715,"Tens of millions of people are currently choosing health coverage on a state or federal health insurance exchange as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We examine how well people make these choices, how well they think they do, and what can be done to improve these choices. We conducted 6 experiments asking people to choose the most cost-effective policy using websites modeled on current exchanges. Our results suggest there is significant room for improvement. Without interventions, respondents perform at near chance levels and show a significant bias, overweighting out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles. Financial incentives do not improve performance, and decision-makers do not realize that they are performing poorly. However, performance can be improved quite markedly by providing calculation aids, and by choosing a ""smart"" default. Implementing these psychologically based principles could save purchasers of policies and taxpayers approximately 10 billion dollars every year."
https://openalex.org/W2083595345,"The impact of landscape changes on the quality and connectivity of habitats for multiple wildlife species is of global conservation concern. In the southwestern United States, pumas (Puma concolor) are a well distributed and wide-ranging large carnivore that are sensitive to loss of habitat and to the disruption of pathways that connect their populations. We used an expert-based approach to define and derive variables hypothesized to influence the quality, location, and permeability of habitat for pumas within an area encompassing the entire states of Arizona and New Mexico. Survey results indicated that the presence of woodland and forest cover types, rugged terrain, and canyon bottom and ridgeline topography were expected to be important predictors of both high quality habitat and heightened permeability. As road density, distance to water, or human population density increased, the quality and permeability of habitats were predicted to decline. Using these results, we identified 67 high quality patches across the study area, and applied concepts from electronic circuit theory to estimate regional patterns of connectivity among these patches. Maps of current flow among individual pairs of patches highlighted possible pinch points along two major interstate highways. Current flow summed across all pairs of patches highlighted areas important for keeping the entire network connected, regardless of patch size. Cumulative current flow was highest in Arizona north of the Colorado River and around Grand Canyon National Park, and in the Sky Islands region owing to the many small habitat patches present. Our outputs present a first approximation of habitat quality and connectivity for dispersing pumas in the southwestern United States. Map results can be used to help target finer-scaled analyses in support of planning efforts concerned with the maintenance of puma metapopulation structure, as well as the protection of landscape features that facilitate the dispersal process."
https://openalex.org/W2160169976,"This study explores the effects that the weather has on people's everyday activity patterns. Temperature, rainfall, and wind speed were used as weather parameters. People's daily activity patterns were inferred, such as place visited, the time this took place, the duration of the visit, based on the GPS location traces of their mobile phones overlaid upon Yellow Pages information. Our analysis of 31,855 mobile phone users allowed us to infer that people were more likely to stay longer at eateries or food outlets, and (to a lesser degree) at retail or shopping areas when the weather is very cold or when conditions are calm (non-windy). When compared to people's regular activity patterns, certain weather conditions affected people's movements and activities noticeably at different times of the day. On cold days, people's activities were found to be more diverse especially after 10AM, showing greatest variations between 2PM and 6PM. A similar trend is observed between 10AM and midnight on rainy days, with people's activities found to be most diverse on days with heaviest rainfalls or on days when the wind speed was stronger than 4 km/h, especially between 10AM-1AM. Finally, we observed that different geographical areas of a large metropolis were impacted differently by the weather. Using data of urban infrastructure to characterize areas, we found strong correlations between weather conditions upon people's accessibility to trains. This study sheds new light on the influence of weather conditions on human behavior, in particular the choice of daily activities and how mobile phone data can be used to investigate the influence of environmental factors on urban dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1980448003,"The description of a Neanderthal hyoid from Kebara Cave (Israel) in 1989 fuelled scientific debate on the evolution of speech and complex language. Gross anatomy of the Kebara 2 hyoid differs little from that of modern humans. However, whether Homo neanderthalensis could use speech or complex language remains controversial. Similarity in overall shape does not necessarily demonstrate that the Kebara 2 hyoid was used in the same way as that of Homo sapiens. The mechanical performance of whole bones is partly controlled by internal trabecular geometries, regulated by bone-remodelling in response to the forces applied. Here we show that the Neanderthal and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours. Our study incorporates detailed analysis of histology, meticulous reconstruction of musculature, and computational biomechanical analysis with models incorporating internal micro-geometry. Because internal architecture reflects the loadings to which a bone is routinely subjected, our findings are consistent with a capacity for speech in the Neanderthals."

In contrast, suppression of S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation by DNA damage is Akt-dependent. We find that loss of either p53, required for the induction of Sestrin 1/2, or p63, required for the induction of REDD1 and activation of the tuberous sclerosis complex, prevents the DNA damage-induced suppression of mTORC1 signaling.

In this study, six targeted urinary nucleosides, namely adenosine, cytidine, 3-methylcytidine, 1-methyladenosine, inosine, and 2-deoxyguanosine, were chosen to evaluate their role as biomarkers of four different types of cancer: lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Urine samples were purified using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and then analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The Mann-Whitney U test and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to compare differences in urinary nucleosides between patients with one of four types of cancer and healthy controls. The diagnostic sensitivity of single nucleosides for different types of cancer ranged from 14% to 69%. In contrast, the diagnostic sensitivity of a set of six nucleosides ranged from 37% to 69%. The false-positive identification rate associated with the set of six nucleosides in urine was less than 2% compared with that of less than 5% for a single nucleoside. Furthermore, combining the set of six urinary nucleosides with carcinoembryonic antigen improved the diagnostic sensitivity for colon cancer. In summary, the study show that a set of six targeted nucleosides is a good diagnostic marker for breast and colon cancers but not for lung and gastric cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2058099036,"CTRP4 is a unique member of the C1q family, possessing two tandem globular C1q domains. Its physiological function is poorly defined. Here, we show that CTRP4 is an evolutionarily conserved, ∼34-kDa secretory protein expressed in the brain. In human, mouse, and zebrafish brain, CTRP4 expression begins early in development and is widespread in the central nervous system. Neurons, but not astrocytes, express and secrete CTRP4, and secreted proteins form higher-order oligomeric complexes. CTRP4 is also produced by peripheral tissues and circulates in blood. Its serum levels are increased in leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob) mice. Functional studies suggest that CTRP4 acts centrally to modulate energy metabolism. Refeeding following an overnight fast induced the expression of CTRP4 in the hypothalamus. Central administration of recombinant protein suppressed food intake and altered the whole-body energy balance in both chow-fed and high-fat diet-fed mice. Suppression of food intake by CTRP4 is correlated with a decreased expression of orexigenic neuropeptide (Npy and Agrp) genes in the hypothalamus. These results establish CTRP4 as a novel nutrient-responsive central regulator of food intake and energy balance."

Identifying risk indicators for postpartum haemorrhage is crucial to predict this life threatening condition. Another major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality is pre-eclampsia. Previous studies show conflicting results in the association between pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the association between pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage. Our secondary objective was to identify other risk indicators for postpartum haemorrhage in the Netherlands.A nationwide cohort was used, containing prospectively collected data of women giving birth after 19 completed weeks of gestation from January 2000 until January 2008 (n = 1,457,576). Data were extracted from the Netherlands Perinatal Registry, covering 96% of all deliveries in the Netherlands. The main outcome measure, postpartum haemorrhage, was defined as blood loss of ≥1000 ml in the 24 hours following delivery. The association between pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage was investigated with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses.Overall prevalence of postpartum haemorrhage was 4.3% and of pre-eclampsia 2.2%. From the 31 560 women with pre-eclampsia 2 347 (7.4%) developed postpartum haemorrhage, compared to 60 517 (4.2%) from the 1 426 016 women without pre-eclampsia (odds ratio 1.81; 95% CI 1.74 to 1.89). Risk of postpartum haemorrhage in women with pre-eclampsia remained increased after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ratio 1.53; 95% CI 1.46 to 1.60).Women with pre-eclampsia have a 1.53 fold increased risk for postpartum haemorrhage. Clinicians should be aware of this and use this knowledge in the management of pre-eclampsia and the third stage of labour in order to reach the fifth Millenium Developmental Goal of reducing maternal mortality ratios with 75% by 2015."
https://openalex.org/W1997358936,"An amplifying role for oral epithelial cells (ECs) in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been postulated to explain oral viral shedding. However, while lytic or latent EBV infections of oro/nasopharyngeal ECs are commonly detected under pathological conditions, detection of EBV-infected ECs in healthy conditions is very rare. In this study, a simple non-surgical tissue sampling procedure was used to investigate EBV infection in the periodontal epithelium that surrounds and attaches teeth to the gingiva. Surprisingly, we observed that the gingival ECs of the periodontium (pECs) are commonly infected with EBV and may serve as an important oral reservoir of latently EBV-infected cells. We also found that the basal level of epithelial EBV-infection is significantly increased in chronic periodontitis, a common inflammatory disease that undermines the integrity of tooth-supporting tissues. Moreover, the level of EBV infection was found to correlate with disease severity. In inflamed tissues, EBV-infected pECs appear to be prone to apoptosis and to produce larger amounts of CCL20, a pivotal inflammatory chemokine that controls tissue infiltration by immune cells. Our discovery that the periodontal epithelium is a major site of latent EBV infection sheds a new light on EBV persistence in healthy carriers and on the role of this ubiquitous virus in periodontitis. Moreover, the identification of this easily accessible site of latent infection may encourage new approaches to investigate and monitor other EBV-associated disorders."

Our aim was to assess multi-analyte protein-based assays of cytokines/chemokines using Luminex technology. We have reported that Luminex-based profiling was useful in assessing response to L-arginine therapy in the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium colitis. Therefore, we studied prospectively collected samples from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and control subjects. Serum, colon biopsies, and clinical information were obtained from subjects undergoing colonoscopy for evaluation of UC or for non-UC indications. In total, 38 normal controls and 137 UC cases completed the study. Histologic disease severity and the Mayo Disease Activity Index (DAI) were assessed. Serum and colonic tissue cytokine/chemokine profiles were measured by Luminex-based multiplex testing of 42 analytes. Only eotaxin-1 and G-CSF were increased in serum of patients with histologically active UC vs. controls. While 13 cytokines/chemokines were increased in active UC vs. controls in tissues, only eotaxin-1 was increased in all levels of active disease in both serum and tissue. In tissues, eotaxin-1 correlated with the DAI and with eosinophil counts. Increased eotaxin-1 levels were confirmed by real-time PCR. Tissue eotaxin-1 levels were also increased in experimental murine colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium, oxazolone, or Citrobacter rodentium, but not in murine Helicobacter pylori infection. Our data implicate eotaxin-1 as an etiologic factor and therapeutic target in UC, and indicate that Luminex-based assays may be useful to assess IBD pathogenesis and to select patients for anti-cytokine/chemokine therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1976869651,"Clinical relevance of multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is unknown. A multi-center, prospective study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2012. Nine hundred and fifty-four CAP patients were consecutively enrolled. M. pneumoniae clinical isolates were obtained from throat swabs. MLVA typing was applied to all isolates. Comparison of pneumonia severity index (PSI) and clinical features among patients infected with different MLVA types of M. pneumoniae were conducted. One hundred and thirty-six patients were positive with M. pneumoniae culture. The clinical isolates were clustered into 18 MLVA types. One hundred and fourteen (88.3%) isolates were resistant to macrolide, covering major MLVA types. The macrolide non-resistant rate of M. pneumoniae isolates with Mpn13-14-15-16 profile of 3-5-6-2 was significantly higher than that of other types (p≤0.001). Patients infected with types U (5-4-5-7-2) and J (3-4-5-7-2) had significantly higher PSI scores (p<0.001) and longer total duration of cough (p = 0.011). Therefore it seems that there is a correlation between certain MLVA types and clinical severity of disease and the presence of macrolide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2076075804,"Understanding the characteristics and drivers of dispersal is crucial for predicting population dynamics, particularly in range-shifting species. Studying long-distance dispersal in insects is challenging, but recent advances in entomological radar offer unique insights. We analysed 10 years of radar data collected at Rothamsted Research, U.K., to investigate characteristics (altitude, speed, seasonal and annual trends) and drivers (aphid abundance, air temperature, wind speed and rainfall) of high-altitude flight of the two most abundant U.K. ladybird species (native Coccinella septempunctata and invasive Harmonia axyridis). These species cannot be distinguished in the radar data since their reflectivity signals overlap, and they were therefore analysed together. However, their signals do not overlap with other, abundant insects so we are confident they constitute the overwhelming majority of the analysed data. The target species were detected up to ∼1100 m above ground level, where displacement speeds of up to ∼60 km/h were recorded, however most ladybirds were found between ∼150 and 500 m, and had a mean displacement of 30 km/h. Average flight time was estimated, using tethered flight experiments, to be 36.5 minutes, but flights of up to two hours were observed. Ladybirds are therefore potentially able to travel 18 km in a “typical” high-altitude flight, but up to 120 km if flying at higher altitudes, indicating a high capacity for long-distance dispersal. There were strong seasonal trends in ladybird abundance, with peaks corresponding to the highest temperatures of mid-summer, and warm air temperature was the key driver of ladybird flight. Climatic warming may therefore increase the potential for long-distance dispersal in these species. Low aphid abundance was a second significant factor, highlighting the important role of aphid population dynamics in ladybird dispersal. This research illustrates the utility of radar for studying high-altitude insect flight and has important implications for predicting long-distance dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2054015325,"Misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome via a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The precise mechanism of retrotranslocation is unclear. Here, we use several lumenal ERAD substrates targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin ligase HRD1 including SHH (sonic hedgehog) and NHK (null Hong Kong α1-antitrypsin) to study the geometry, organization, and regulation of the HRD1-containing ERAD machinery. We report a new HRD1-associated membrane protein named HERP2, which is homologous to the previously identified HRD1 partner HERP1. Despite sequence homology, HERP2 is constitutively expressed in cells, whereas HERP1 is highly induced by ER stress. We find that these proteins are required for efficient degradation of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated SHH proteins as well as NHK. In cells depleted of HERPs, SHH proteins are largely trapped inside the ER with a fraction of the stabilized SHH protein bound to the HRD1-SEL1L ligase complex. Ubiquitination of SHH is significantly attenuated in the absence of HERPs, suggesting a defect in retrotranslocation. Both HERP proteins interact with HRD1 through a region located in the cytosol. However, unlike its homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HERPs do not regulate HRD1 stability or oligomerization status. Instead, they help recruit DERL2 to the HRD1-SEL1L complex. Additionally, the UBL domain of HERP1 also seems to have a function independent of DERL2 recruitment in ERAD. Our studies have revealed a critical scaffolding function for mammalian HERP proteins that is required for forming an active retrotranslocation complex containing HRD1, SEL1L, and DERL2."
https://openalex.org/W2003588623,"Liver failure is an increasing problem. Donor-organ shortage results in patients dying before receiving a transplant. Since the liver can regenerate, alternative therapies providing temporary liver-support are sought. A bioartificial-liver would temporarily substitute function in liver failure buying time for liver regeneration/organ-procurement. Our aim: to develop a prototype bioartificial-liver-machine (BAL) comprising a human liver-derived cell-line, cultured to phenotypic competence and deliverable in a clinical setting to sites distant from its preparation. The objective of this study was to determine whether its use would improve functional parameters of liver failure in pigs with acute liver failure, to provide proof-of-principle. HepG2cells encapsulated in alginate-beads, proliferated in a fluidised-bed-bioreactor providing a biomass of 4–6×1010cells, were transported from preparation-laboratory to point-of-use operating theatre (6000miles) under perfluorodecalin at ambient temperature. Irreversible ischaemic liver failure was induced in anaesthetised pigs, after portal-systemic-shunt, by hepatic-artery-ligation. Biochemical parameters, intracranial pressure, and functional-clotting were measured in animals connected in an extracorporeal bioartificial-liver circuit. Efficacy was demonstrated comparing outcomes between animals connected to a circuit containing alginate-encapsulated cells (Cell-bead BAL), and those connected to circuit containing alginate capsules without cells (Empty-bead BAL). Cells of the biomass met regulatory standards for sterility and provenance. All animals developed progressive liver-failure after ischaemia induction. Efficacy of BAL was demonstrated since animals connected to a functional biomass (+ cells) had significantly smaller rises in intracranial pressure, lower ammonia levels, more bilirubin conjugation, improved acidosis and clotting restoration compared to animals connected to the circuit without cells. In the +cell group, human proteins accumulated in pigs' plasma. Delivery of biomass using a short-term cold-chain enabled transport and use without loss of function over 3days. Thus, a fluidised-bed bioreactor containing alginate-encapsulated HepG2cell-spheroids improved important parameters of acute liver failure in pigs. The system can readily be up-scaled and transported to point-of-use justifying development at clinical scale."
https://openalex.org/W2021512997,"Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths among women, and chronic alcoholism may exert co-carcinogenic effects. Because melatonin (mel) has oncostatic properties, we aimed to investigate and characterize the chemical induction of ovarian tumors in a model of ethanol-preferring rats and to verify the influence of mel treatment on the overall features of these tumors. After rats were selected to receive ethanol (EtOH), they were surgically injected with 100 µg of 7,12-dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) plus sesame oil directly under the left ovarian bursa. At 260 days old, half of the animals received i.p. injections of 200 µg mel/100 g b.w. for 60 days. Four experimental groups were established: Group C, rats bearing ovarian carcinomas (OC); Group C+EtOH, rats voluntarily consuming 10% (v/v) EtOH and bearing OC; Group C+M, rats bearing OC and receiving mel; and Group C+EtOH+M, rats with OC consuming EtOH and receiving mel. Estrous cycle and nutritional parameters were evaluated, and anatomopathological analyses of the ovarian tumors were conducted. The incidence of ovarian tumors was higher in EtOH drinking animals 120 days post-DMBA administration, and mel efficiently reduced the prevalence of some aggressive tumors. Although mel promoted high EtOH consumption, it was effective in synchronizing the estrous cycle and reducing ovarian tumor mass by 20%. While rats in the C group displayed cysts containing serous fluid, C+EtOH rats showed solid tumor masses. After mel treatment, the ovaries of these rats presented as soft and mobile tissues. EtOH consumption increased the incidence of serous papillary carcinomas and sarcomas but not clear cell carcinomas. In contrast, mel reduced the incidence of sarcomas, endometrioid carcinomas and cystic teratomas. Combination of DMBA with EtOH intake potentiated the incidence of OC with malignant histologic subtypes. We concluded that mel reduces ovarian masses and the incidence of adenocarcinomas in ethanol-deprived rats."
https://openalex.org/W2028100866,"Studies indicate that perinatal opioid exposure produces a variety of short- and long-term neurobehavioral consequences. However, the precise modes of action are incompletely understood. Buprenorphine, a mixed agonist/antagonist at the opioid receptors, is currently being used in clinical trials for managing pregnant opioid addicts. This study provides evidence of depression-like consequence following prenatal exposure to supra-therapeutic dose of buprenorphine and sheds light on potential mechanisms of action in a rat model involving administration of intraperitoneal injection to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats starting from gestation day 7 and lasting for 14 days. Results showed that pups at postnatal day 21 but not the dams had worse parameters of depression-like neurobehaviors using a forced swimming test and tail suspension test, independent of gender. Neurobehavioral changes were accompanied by elevation of oxidative stress, reduction of plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin, and attenuation of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (TrkB) phosphorylation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, protein kinase A activity, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, and CREB DNA-binding activity. Since BDNF/serotonin and CREB signaling could orchestrate a positive feedback loop, our findings suggest that the induction of oxidative stress, reduction of BDNF and serotonin expression, and attenuation of CREB signaling induced by prenatal exposure to supra-therapeutic dose of buprenorphine provide evidence of potential mechanism for the development of depression-like neurobehavior."
https://openalex.org/W2032263142,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae uses multiple biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. One route involves the synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the transport of this lipid to endosomes, and decarboxylation by PtdSer decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) to produce phosphatidylethanolamine. Several proteins and protein motifs are known to be required for PtdSer transport to occur, namely the Sec14p homolog PstB2p/Pdr17p; a PtdIns 4-kinase, Stt4p; and a C2 domain of Psd2p. The focus of this work is on defining the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions of these components. PstB2p interacts with a protein encoded by the uncharacterized gene YPL272C, which we name Pbi1p (PstB2p-interacting 1). PstB2p, Psd2, and Pbi1p were shown to be lipid-binding proteins specific for phosphatidic acid. Pbi1p also interacts with the ER-localized Scs2p, a binding determinant for several peripheral ER proteins. A complex between Psd2p and PstB2p was also detected, and this interaction was facilitated by a cryptic C2 domain at the extreme N terminus of Psd2p (C2-1) as well the previously characterized C2 domain of Psd2p (C2-2). The predicted N-terminal helical region of PstB2p was necessary and sufficient for promoting the interaction with both Psd2p and Pbi1p. Taken together, these results support a model for PtdSer transport involving the docking of a PtdSer donor membrane with an acceptor via specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. Specifically, our model predicts that this process involves an acceptor membrane complex containing the C2 domains of Psd2p, PstB2p, and Pbi1p that ligate to Scs2p and phosphatidic acid present in the donor membrane, forming a zone of apposition that facilitates PtdSer transfer.

Membrane biogenesis involves two distinct but intimately connected and coordinated processes: polar lipid biosynthesis and lipid trafficking from the site of synthesis to the site of organelle membrane assembly.

The present work expands on the previous genetic and biochemical studies and provides new information regarding 1) the identification of a previously unrecognized C2 domain at the N terminus of Psd2p, 2) the identification and genetic dissection of protein-protein interactions between known components of the PstB pathway, 3) identification of novel interaction partners of these proteins, 4) investigation of the protein-lipid interactions of these proteins, and 5) the functional implications of these protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions for the transport of PtdSer. We use a combination of standard (split-transcription factor) and membrane based (split-ubiquitin) two-hybrid methods as well as co-purification assays with recombinant proteins to demonstrate a number of novel interactions between proteins involved in PtdSer trafficking to the site of Psd2p. We also make use of liposome binding assays to determine the lipid-binding specificity of these proteins and permeabilized cell-based transport assays to demonstrate the functional implications of these protein-protein interactions. The emerging picture of this lipid trafficking event is one in which a complex of proteins on the acceptor membrane interacts with a complex of proteins and lipid motifs on the donor membrane. This set of interactions leads to the close apposition of the two membranes, which facilitates lipid transfer.

The resulting DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes and then inserted between the EcoRI and PstI sites of the bait vector, pOBD-2, to generate an in-frame fusion at the 3′-end of the GAL4-DNA binding domain coding sequence. The resulting construct (“bait”) was expressed in the PJ69–4a yeast strain. The transformed PJ69–4a strain was sent to the Yeast Resource Center at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) for screening against an array of the entire set of yeast open reading frames fused to the GAL4 transcription activation domain (“preys”). The bait strain was mated to the prey library in strain PJ49-4α, and the bait and prey proteins were co-expressed in the diploid. Strains bearing potential interacting partners were identified as histidine prototrophs due to the expression of the reporter gene, HIS3, under GAL1 promoter control. Prey plasmids containing the interacting clones were retrieved from histidine prototrophic diploids and sequenced to identify the open reading frame in the positive prey plasmids. Genes to be assayed in the mating-based split-ubiquitin two-hybrid system (mbSUS) were amplified from either SEY6210 wild-type genomic DNA or plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant versions of these genes as described in the corresponding experiment, using strategies outlined in the publication describing the initial use of the mbSUS (20.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These products were cloned into the appropriate mbSUS vectors by in vivo recombination after transformation into the strains THY.AP4 and THY.AP5. 4–5 primary transformant colonies of the appropriate bait and prey strains were pooled and grown in liquid medium. Matings were carried out using these cultures by mixing appropriate a and α strains in microtiter dishes and spotting the mating reactions onto SC medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (SC −ura −trp −leu) with a 48-prong pinning tool. These plates were incubated overnight to select for the diploid strains containing both bait and prey constructs. The diploids were then replica-printed to Y-min medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 20 g/liter glucose, 2% (w/v) agar) to select for fully prototrophic strains (i.e. exhibiting expression of marker genes (ADE2 and HIS3) that would indicate a putative interacting pair of genes). These strains were also replica-printed to fresh SC −ura −trp −leu plates and incubated 2–3 days and then treated to detect LacZ reporter activity, as described previously, using X-Gal as the colorigenic reagent (20.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In some cases, X-gal was replaced with S-Gal (Sigma), which we found to be more sensitive and reproducible than the previously described protocol. In this case, the diploid strains growing on plates as described above were overlaid with an S-Gal/agarose mixture consisting of 0.3 mg/ml S-Gal, 0.5 mg/ml iron(III)ammonium citrate, 0.5% (w/v) low melting point agarose, 60 mm KPO4, pH 7.0, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 0.75 mg/ml KCl, and 0.25 mg/ml MgSO4·7H2O. The solution was heated to near boiling on a hot plate to dissolve the agarose and cooled to 42 °C before pouring over the plates containing patches of yeast. LacZ activity is indicated by a black precipitate, and plates were incubated for 15 min to 2 h, depending on the signal strength, and imaged on a flat bed scanner. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from either Sf-9 insect cells or Escherichia coli. PstB2p was expressed from vector pVL1392 in Sf-9 cells as a C-terminal fusion to a V5-His6 tag. Recombinant PstB2-V5-His6 was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For permeabilized cell assays in which PstB2p was added, imidazole was removed by dialysis against a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Proteins were also produced by cloning ORFs as C-terminal His-tagged or S-tagged fusion proteins in pET series vectors and expression in E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). PstB2p was expressed as a C-terminal S-tag (S-RNase peptide) fusion protein from vector pET-28a+. Pbi1p and residues 1–620 of Psd2p were expressed as C-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins from vector pET45b+. Cultures were grown in LB medium with 33 mg/liter chloramphenicol and either 100 mg/liter ampicillin (pET-45b+) or 50 mg/liter kanamycin (pET-28a+). Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.5–0.7 and induced overnight with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 22 °C. Pbi1p was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. These proteins were used in the protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction assays described below, and detection was by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies, as indicated in individual experiments. The PstB2-S-tag fusion was detected with S-protein-HRP conjugate (Novagen), the His-tagged proteins were identified with α-His6 antibody (Clontech), and V5 epitope was identified with α-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Interactions of PstB2-S-tag protein with Pbi1-His6 or the N-terminal 620 residues constituting the regulatory domain of Psd2 (Psd2-N-terminal regulatory domain (NTRD)-His6) were assessed using in vitro interaction (pull-down) assays with S-protein-agarose beads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A modification of the QuikChange approach (Stratagene) was used to introduce deletions in the PSD2 gene, giving rise to proteins lacking the first (C2-1Δ, residues 19–86), second (C2-2Δ, residues 496–583), or both (C2-1,2ΔΔ) C2 domains. A portion (residues 95–166) of the Ser-Thr-rich acidic region that separates the C2 domains (Fig. 2B) was also deleted (S-TrΔ) for use as a control construct. Given that this region is not highly conserved in the Psd2 proteins of closely related yeast and other fungi, we reasoned that this deletion would have no effect on the lipid transport or catalytic functions of Psd2p. The plasmids YEp-352-Psd2 and YEp-352-Psd2-C2Δ (17.Kitamura H. Wu W.-I. Voelker D.R. The C2 domain of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 is not required for catalysis but is essential for in vivo function.J. Biol.

Plasmids bearing wild-type and mutant Psd2 constructs in the 2μ yeast vector YEp352, as described above, were transformed into the psd1Δ psd2Δ yeast mutant PTY44 (8.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cloning and mapping of the gene, heterologous expression, and creation of the null allele.J. Biol.

Transformation of yeast by lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on SC −ura plates containing 5 mm Etn. Etn auxotrophy was determined by inoculating SC −ura liquid medium to A600 = 0.1, and these cultures were pregrown for 5 h. These cultures were then diluted 100-fold into SC −ura either lacking or containing 5 mm Etn and grown for 16 h. Growth of the cultures was determined by measuring A600. Transport-independent Psd2p catalytic activity was measured in crude membrane fractions prepared by bead beating, as described previously (22.Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Jones J.L. Voelker D.R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 28344-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This assay used NBD-Ptd-[1′-14C]Ser, which spontaneously partitions into all membranes independent of facilitated transport, as described previously (7.Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Isolation of mutants, cloning of the gene, and creation of a null allele.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay serves as a measure of total enzymatic activity without the need for facilitated transport of PtdSer transport to the Psd2p enzyme active site. Large multilamellar liposomes of defined lipid composition were used for lipid-protein interaction assays as detailed in individual experiments. Lipids (Avanti) in chloroform were mixed in the appropriate ratio and dried under a stream of N2 gas. A small amount of methanol was added and again taken to dryness under N2 in order to remove traces of chloroform. The resulting lipid film was hydrated on ice for 1 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 200 mm NaCl at a total lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml. Following hydration, the preparation was vortexed vigorously, and the reconstituted liposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet of liposomes was suspended in an equal volume of the same buffer. Recombinant proteins (as described above) were incubated with the liposomes for 30 min at 30 °C. For PstB2p binding, 50 ng of V5-His6-tagged purified protein from Sf-9 cells was used. The Pbi1p binding contained 50 ng of purified His6-tagged protein from E. coli. Psd2-NTRD binding was assayed with crude E. coli protein extract from an expressing strain, containing 10 μg of E. coli 100,000 × g supernatant protein, which gave a Western immunoblot signal equivalent to ∼50 ng of Pbi1p. After incubation, the liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The liposomes were washed twice in 100 μl of the same buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with an appropriate antibody. In the reconstituted permeabilized cell system described previously (18.Wu W.-I. Voelker D.R. Characterization of phosphatidylserine transport to the locus of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 in permeabilized yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the competence of PtdSer acceptor membranes, but not donor membranes, was dependent on the presence of PstB2p. We asked whether recombinant epitope-tagged PstB2p produced by baculovirus-mediated expression in Sf-9 insect cells could support the transport of nascent PtdSer from donor to acceptor membranes in permeabilized pstb2Δ cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, PSTB2 wild-type permeabilized cells (gray bars) convert ∼7–8% of this newly synthesized PtdSer into PtdEtn, regardless of whether recombinant PstB2p is added to the reaction mixture. In comparison, pstb2Δ cells (black bars) convert only ∼1.5% of newly synthesized PtdSer into PtdEtn in the absence of recombinant PstB2p. However, the addition of increasing amounts of recombinant purified PstB2p resulted in a dose-dependent recovery of transport activity. Recovery of transport activity was saturated at a PstB2 concentration of ∼125 ng/μl and resulted in a doubling of the PtdSer transport rate of the mutant cells. This amounts to a partial recovery of activity, perhaps indicating that additional components or a specific energy-dependent assembly step are necessary for the full function of the lipid transport complex in this permeabilized cell system. A newly identified PstB2-interacting protein (Pbi1p, described below) was added in purified recombinant form to the permeabilized cell transport assay to test its function as a potential regulator of transport complex assembly; however, its inclusion at up to 250 ng/μl neither enhanced nor inhibited the transport rate in this assay system. In permeabilized cell assays of ER to endosome transport of PtdSer, PstB2p is required at the acceptor membrane, and as shown above, exogenous recombinant PstB2p partially rescues PtdSer transport in permeabilized pstb2Δ cells in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. One hypothesis to explain these findings is that PstB2p binds a specific protein or lipid on the acceptor membrane, thus rendering it competent to facilitate the transport reaction. One potential binding partner is the Psd2p enzyme itself, and we tested the hypothesis that PstB2p interacts with Psd2p using mbSUS, which was designed specifically for testing interactions between membrane proteins (20.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this system, the bait protein, which must be cytoplasmically oriented and membrane-bound or otherwise physically excluded from the nucleus, is expressed as a C-terminal fusion to a construct consisting of the C-terminal half of ubiquitin, in frame with a synthetic Protein A-LexA-vp16 transcription factor (referred to as Cub-PLV). The prey protein is expressed as either an N- or C-terminal fusion to a mutant version of the N-terminal half of ubiquitin (referred to as NubG). If the bait and prey interact, the Cub and NubG fragments reconstitute a pseudomonomer of ubiquitin, which is then recognized by the deubiquitinating enzymes of the yeast cell. The PLV transcription factor is then released from the membrane and imported to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of the LexA::ADE2, LexA::HIS3, and LexA::LacZ reporter genes. Constitutive expression of the NubG or Nub wild type (NubWT) fragments acts as negative or positive control, respectively, and ensures that the bait construct is both stable in the absence of an interacting NubG-fused partner and expressed at a level that would make an interaction detectable. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2A, Psd2 is the bait, whereas a potassium channel subunit from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Kat1) serves as an irrelevant bait protein negative control. These were tested for interaction with NubG (negative control), Nub wild type (positive control), NubG-Kat1 (irrelevant prey protein negative control), and the experimental NubG-Psd2 and NubG-PstB2 constructs. Yeast strains bearing the appropriate plasmids were mated and replica-printed"
https://openalex.org/W2086464243,"Asparagine deamidation occurs spontaneously in proteins during aging; deamidation of Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) sites can lead to the formation of isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR), a motif that can recognize the RGD-binding site of integrins. Ceruloplasmin (Cp), a ferroxidase present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), contains two NGR sites in its sequence: one exposed on the protein surface ((568)NGR) and the other buried in the tertiary structure ((962)NGR). Considering that Cp can undergo oxidative modifications in the CSF of neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated the effect of oxidation on the deamidation of both NGR motifs and, consequently, on the acquisition of integrin binding properties. We observed that the exposed (568)NGR site can deamidate under conditions mimicking accelerated Asn aging. In contrast, the hidden (962)NGR site can deamidate exclusively when aging occurs under oxidative conditions, suggesting that oxidation-induced structural changes foster deamidation at this site. NGR deamidation in Cp was associated with gain of integrin-binding function, intracellular signaling, and cell pro-adhesive activity. Finally, Cp aging in the CSF from Alzheimer disease patients, but not in control CSF, causes Cp deamidation with gain of integrin-binding function, suggesting that this transition might also occur in pathological conditions. In conclusion, both Cp NGR sites can deamidate during aging under oxidative conditions, likely as a consequence of oxidative-induced structural changes, thereby promoting a gain of function in integrin binding, signaling, and cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2066211678,"The increased proliferation of cancer cells is directly dependent on the increased activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) machinery which is responsible for protein folding, assembly, and transport. In fact, it is so critical that perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum can lead to apoptosis. This carefully regulated organelle represents a unique target of cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. In this study, a standardized mangosteen fruit extract (MFE) was evaluated for modulating ER stress proteins in prostate cancer. Two human prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and LNCaP, and prostate epithelial cells (PrECs) procured from two patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were treated with MFE. Flow cytometry, MTT, BrdU and Western blot were used to evaluate cell apoptosis, viability, proliferation and ER stress. Next, we evaluated MFE for microsomal stability and anti-cancer activity in nude mice. MFE induced apoptosis, decreased viability and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. MFE increased the expression of ER stress proteins. Interestingly, MFE selectively promotes ER stress in prostate cancer cells while sparing PrECs. MFE suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model without obvious toxicity. Mangosteen fruit extract selectively promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress in cancer cells while sparing non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, in an in vivo setting mangosteen fruit extract significantly reduces xenograft tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2026643122,"Purpose Aromatase inhibitor therapy (AI) significantly improves survival in breast cancer patients. Little is known about adherence and persistence to aromatase inhibitors and about the causes of treatment discontinuation among older women. Methods We constituted a cohort of women over 65 receiving a first AI therapy for breast cancer between 2006 and 2008, and followed them until June 2011. Women were selected in the population-based French National Health Insurance databases, and data was collected on the basis of pharmacy refills, medical records and face-to-face interviews. Non-persistence to treatment was defined as the first treatment discontinuation lasting more than 3 consecutive months. Time to treatment discontinuation was studied using survival analysis techniques. Results Overall among the 382 selected women, non-persistence to treatment went from 8.7% (95%CI: 6.2–12.1) at 1 year, to 15.6% (95%CI: 12.2–19.8) at 2 years, 20.8% (95%CI: 16.7–25.6) at 3 years, and 24.7% (95%CI: 19.5–31.0) at 4 years. In the multivariate analysis on a sub-sample of 233 women with available data, women using complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) (HR = 3.2; 95%CI: 1.5–6.9) or suffering from comorbidities (HR = 2.2; 95%CI: 1.0–4.8) were more likely to discontinue their treatment, whereas women with polypharmacy (HR = 0.4; 95%CI: 0.2–0.91) were less likely to discontinue. In addition, 13% of the women with positive hormonal receptor status did not fill any prescription for anti-hormonal therapy. Conclusion AI therapy is discontinued prematurely in a substantial portion of older patients. Some patients may use CAM not as a complementary treatment, but as an alternative to conventional medicine. Improving patient-physician communication on the use of CAM may improve hormonal therapy adherence."

https://openalex.org/W1976233380,"Particulate matter export fuels benthic ecosystems in continental margins and the deep sea, removing carbon from the upper ocean. Gelatinous zooplankton biomass provides a fast carbon vector that has been poorly studied. Observational data of a large-scale benthic trawling survey from 1994 to 2005 provided a unique opportunity to quantify jelly-carbon along an entire continental margin in the Mediterranean Sea and to assess potential links with biological and physical variables. Biomass depositions were sampled in shelves, slopes and canyons with peaks above 1000 carcasses per trawl, translating to standing stock values between 0.3 and 1.4 mg C m(2) after trawling and integrating between 30,000 and 175,000 m(2) of seabed. The benthopelagic jelly-carbon spatial distribution from the shelf to the canyons may be explained by atmospheric forcing related with NAO events and dense shelf water cascading, which are both known from the open Mediterranean. Over the decadal scale, we show that the jelly-carbon depositions temporal variability paralleled hydroclimate modifications, and that the enhanced jelly-carbon deposits are connected to a temperature-driven system where chlorophyll plays a minor role. Our results highlight the importance of gelatinous groups as indicators of large-scale ecosystem change, where jelly-carbon depositions play an important role in carbon and energy transport to benthic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2001668044,"The number and area of wildlife ranches in Zambia increased from 30 and 1,420 km(2) in 1997 to 177 and ∼6,000 km(2) by 2012. Wild ungulate populations on wildlife ranches increased from 21,000 individuals in 1997 to ∼91,000 in 2012, while those in state protected areas declined steeply. Wildlife ranching and crocodile farming have a turnover of ∼USD15.7 million per annum, compared to USD16 million from the public game management areas which encompass an area 29 times larger. The wildlife ranching industry employs 1,200 people (excluding jobs created in support industries), with a further ∼1,000 individuals employed through crocodile farming. Wildlife ranches generate significant quantities of meat (295,000 kg/annum), of which 30,000 kg of meat accrues to local communities and 36,000 kg to staff. Projected economic returns from wildlife ranching ventures are high, with an estimated 20-year economic rate of return of 28%, indicating a strong case for government support for the sector. There is enormous scope for wildlife ranching in Zambia due to the availability of land, high diversity of wildlife and low potential for commercial livestock production. However, the Zambian wildlife ranching industry is small and following completion of field work for this study, there was evidence of a significant proportion of ranchers dropping out. The industry is performing poorly, due to inter alia: rampant commercial bushmeat poaching; failure of government to allocate outright ownership of wildlife to landowners; bureaucratic hurdles; perceived historical lack of support from the Zambia Wildlife Authority and government; a lack of a clear policy on wildlife ranching; and a ban on hunting on unfenced lands including game ranches. For the wildlife ranching industry to develop, these limitations need to be addressed decisively. These findings are likely to apply to other savanna countries with large areas of marginal land potentially suited to wildlife ranching."
https://openalex.org/W2034671481,"In humans and other species, long-term hypoxia (LTH) during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine growth restriction with reduced body/brain weight, dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and other problems. To identify the signal transduction pathways and critical molecules, which may be involved in acclimatization to high altitude LTH, we conducted microarray with advanced bioinformatic analysis on carotid arteries (CA) from the normoxic near-term ovine fetus at sea-level and those acclimatized to high altitude for 110+ days during gestation. In response to LTH acclimatization, in fetal CA we identified mRNA from 38 genes upregulated >2 fold (P<0.05) and 9 genes downregulated >2-fold (P<0.05). The major genes with upregulated mRNA were SLC1A3, Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 3, IGF type 2 receptor, transforming growth factor (TGF) Beta-3, and genes involved in the AKT and BCL2 signal transduction networks. Most genes with upregulated mRNA have a common motif for Pbx/Knotted homeobox in the promoter region, and Sox family binding sites in the 3' un translated region (UTR). Genes with downregulated mRNA included those involved in the P53 pathway and 5-lipoxygenase activating proteins. The promoter region of all genes with downregulated mRNA, had a common 49 bp region with a binding site for DOT6 and TOD6, components of the RPD3 histone deacetylase complex RPD3C(L). We also identified miRNA complementary to a number of the altered genes. Thus, the present study identified molecules in the ovine fetus, which may play a role in the acclimatization response to high-altitude associated LTH."
https://openalex.org/W2042437146,"Myocilin is a broadly expressed protein that when mutated uniquely causes glaucoma. While no function has been ascribed to explain focal disease, some properties of myocilin are known. Myocilin is a cytoplasmic protein that also localizes to vesicles specifically as part of a large membrane-associated complex with properties similar to the SNARE machinery that function in vesicle fusion. Its role in vesicle dynamics has not been detailed, however myocilin intersects with the endocytic compartment at the level of the multivesicular body. Since internalized GPCRs are sorted in the multivesicular body, we investigated whether myocilin functions in ligand-dependent GPR143 endocytosis. Using recombinant systems we found that the kinetics of myocilin recruitment to biotinylated membrane proteins was similar to that of arrestin-3. We also co-localized myocilin with GPR143 and Arrestin-2 by confocal microscopy. However, wild-type myocilin differed significantly in its association kinetics and co-localization with internalized proteins from mutant myocilin (P370L or T377M). Moreover, we found that myocilin bound to the cytoplasmic tail of GPR143, an interaction mediated by its amino terminal helix-turn-helix domain. Hydrodynamic analyses show that the myocilin-GPR143 protein complex is >158 kD and stable in 500 mM KCl, but not 0.1% SDS. Collectively, data indicate that myocilin is recruited to the membrane compartment, interacting with GPCR proteins during ligand-mediated endocytosis and that GPCR signaling underlies pathology in myocilin glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2090684684,"The adult human olfactory bulb neural stem/progenitor cells (OBNC/PC) are promising candidate for cell-based therapy for traumatic and neurodegenerative insults. Exogenous application of NGF was suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for traumatic and neurodegenerative diseases, however effective delivery of NGF into the CNS parenchyma is still challenging due mainly to its limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and intolerable side effects if administered into the brain ventricular system. An effective method to ensure delivery of NGF into the parenchyma of CNS is the genetic modification of NSC to overexpress NGF gene. Overexpression of NGF in adult human OBNSC is expected to alter their proliferation and differentiation nature, and thus might enhance their therapeutic potential. In this study, we genetically modified adult human OBNS/PC to overexpress human NGF (hNGF) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes to provide insight about the effects of hNGF and GFP genes overexpression in adult human OBNS/PC on their in vitro multipotentiality using DNA microarray, immunophenotyping, and Western blot (WB) protocols. Our analysis revealed that OBNS/PC-GFP and OBNS/PC-GFP-hNGF differentiation is a multifaceted process involving changes in major biological processes as reflected in alteration of the gene expression levels of crucial markers such as cell cycle and survival markers, stemness markers, and differentiation markers. The differentiation of both cell classes was also associated with modulations of key signaling pathways such MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway for OBNS/PC-GFP, and axon guidance, calcium channel, voltage-dependent, gamma subunit 7 for OBNS/PC-GFP-hNGF as revealed by GO and KEGG. Differentiated OBNS/PC-GFP-hNGF displayed extensively branched cytoplasmic processes, a significant faster growth rate and up modulated the expression of oligodendroglia precursor cells markers (PDGFRα, NG2 and CNPase) respect to OBNS/PC-GFP counterparts. These findings suggest an enhanced proliferation and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential for OBNS/PC-GFP-hNGF as compared to OBNS/PC-GFP."
https://openalex.org/W2025814252,"Reduced intracranial pressure is considered a risk factor for glaucomatous optic neuropathies. All current data supporting intracranial pressure as a glaucoma risk factor comes from retrospective and prospective studies. Unfortunately, there are no relevant animal models for investigating this link experimentally. Here we report a novel rat model that can be used to study the role of intracranial pressure modulation on optic neuropathies. Stainless steel cannulae were inserted into the cisterna magna or the lateral ventricle of Sprague-Dawley and Brown Norway rats. The cannula was attached to a pressure transducer connected to a computer that recorded intracranial pressure in real-time. Intracranial pressure was modulated manually by adjusting the height of a column filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid in relation to the animal's head. After data collection the morphological appearance of the brain tissue was analyzed. Based on ease of surgery and ability to retain the cannula, Brown Norway rats with the cannula implanted in the lateral ventricle were selected for further studies. Baseline intracranial pressure for rats was 5.5 ± 1.5 cm water (n=5). Lowering of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid column by 2 cm and 4 cm below head level reduced ICP to 3.7 ± 1.0 cm water (n=5) and 1.5 ± 0.6 cm water (n=4), a reduction of 33.0% and 72.7% below baseline. Raising the cerebrospinal fluid column by 4 cm increased ICP to 7.5 ± 1.4 cm water (n=2) corresponding to a 38.3% increase in intracranial pressure. Histological studies confirmed correct cannula placement and indicated minimal invasive damage to brain tissues. Our data suggests that the intraventricular cannula model is a unique and viable model that can be used to study the effect of altered intracranial pressure on glaucomatous optic neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W2047106815,"Multicellular organisms depend on developmental programs to coordinate growth and differentiation from single cells, but the origins of development are unclear. A possible starting point is stochastic phenotypic variation generated by molecular noise. Given appropriate environmental conditions, noise-driven differentiation could conceivably evolve so as to come under regulatory control; however, abiotic conditions are likely to be restrictive. Drawing from an experimental system, we present a model in which environmental fluctuations are coupled to population growth. We show that this coupling generates stable selection for a single optimal strategy that is largely insensitive to environmental conditions, including the number of competitors, carrying capacity of the environment, difference in growth rates among phenotypic variants, and population density. We argue that this optimal strategy establishes stabilizing conditions likely to improve the quality and reliability of information experienced by evolving organisms, thus increasing opportunity for the evolutionary emergence of developmental programs."
https://openalex.org/W2054827346,"The grasshopper genus Caledonula, endemic to New Caledonia, was studied to understand the evolution of species distributions in relation to climate and soil types. Based on a comprehensive sampling of 80 locations throughout the island, the genus was represented by five species, four of which are new to science, of which three are described here. All the species have limited distributions in New Caledonia. Bioclimatic niche modelling shows that all the species were found in association with a wet climate and reduced seasonality, explaining their restriction to the southern half of the island. The results suggest that the genus was ancestrally constrained by seasonality. A molecular phylogeny was reconstructed using two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers. The partially resolved tree showed monophyly of the species found on metalliferous soils, and molecular dating indicated a rather recent origin for the genus. Adaptation to metalliferous soils is suggested by both morphological changes and radiation on these soils. The genus Caledonula is therefore a good model to understand the origin of microendemism in the context of recent and mixed influences of climate and soil type."
https://openalex.org/W2050197467,"The current prognostic model to estimate the survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transarterial hepatic selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) is not fully characterized. The aim of this study was to establish a new scoring model including assessment of both tumor responses and therapy-induced systemic changes in HCC patients to predict survival at an early time point post-SIRT.Between 2008 and 2012, 149 HCC patients treated with SIRT were included into this study. CT images and biomarkers in blood tested at one month post-SIRT were analyzed and correlated with clinical outcome. Tumor responses were assessed by RECIST 1.1, mRECIST, and Choi criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival curves. Cox regression was used in uni- and multivariable survival analyses and in the establishment of a prognostic model.A multivariate proportional hazards model was created based on the tumor response, the number of tumor nodules, the score of the model for end stage liver disease (MELD), and the serum C-reactive protein levels which were independent predictors of survival in HCC patients at one month post-SIRT. This prognostic model accurately differentiated the outcome of patients with different risk scores in this cohort (P<0.001). The model also had the ability to assign a predicted survival probability for individual patients.A new model to predict survival of HCC patients mainly based on tumor responses and therapy-induced systemic changes provides reliable prognosis and accurately discriminates the survival at an early time point after SIRT in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2070289432,"Although the functional brain network involved in reading for adults and children is now well documented, a critical lack of knowledge still exists about the structural development of these brain areas. To provide a better overview of the structural dynamics of the brain that sustain reading acquisition, we acquired anatomical MRI brain images from 55 children that were divided into two groups: one prior to the formal learning of reading (n = 33, 5–6 years old) and the second a few years after formal learning (n = 22, 9–10 years old). Reading performances were collected based on the “Alouette-R” test, a standardized test for reading text in French. Voxel-based morphometry analysis of gray matter showed that only the right insula volume was different between the two groups. Moreover, the reading group showed that the volumes of the left fusiform gyrus (corresponding to the well-known visual word form area, VWFA), the anterior part of the left inferior occipital gyrus and the left thalamus were significantly modulated by reading performance. This study reinforces the crucial role of the Visual Word Form Area in reading and correlation analyses performed between ROIs volumes suggesting that the VWFA is fully connected with the traditional left-hemispheric language brain network."
https://openalex.org/W2057481174,"Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic, is associated with ototoxicity, renal toxicity and neurotoxicity, thus identifying means to increase the therapeutic index of cisplatin may allow for improved outcomes. A SNP (rs4343077) within EPS8, discovered through a genome wide association study of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), provided impetus to further study this gene. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the role of EPS8 in cellular susceptibility to cisplatin in cancerous and non-cancerous cells. We used EPS8 RNA interference to determine the effect of decreased EPS8 expression on LCL and A549 lung cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin. EPS8 knockdown in LCLs resulted in a 7.9% increase in cisplatin-induced survival (P = 1.98×10−7) and an 8.7% decrease in apoptosis (P = 0.004) compared to control. In contrast, reduced EPS8 expression in lung cancer cells resulted in a 20.6% decrease in cisplatin-induced survival (P = 5.08×10−5). We then investigated an EPS8 inhibitor, mithramycin A, as a potential agent to increase the therapeutic index of cisplatin. Mithramycin A decreased EPS8 expression in LCLs resulting in decreased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin as evidenced by lower caspase 3/7 activation following cisplatin treatment (42.7%±6.8% relative to control P = 0.0002). In 5 non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines, mithramycin A also resulted in decreased EPS8 expression. Adding mithramycin to 4 NSCLC cell lines and a bladder cancer cell line, resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin that was significantly more pronounced in tumor cell lines than in LCL lines (p<0.0001). An EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line (H1975) showed no significant change in sensitivity to cisplatin with the addition of mithramycin treatment. Therefore, an inhibitor of EPS8, such as mithramycin A, could improve cisplatin treatment by increasing sensitivity of tumor relative to normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040666789,"Hypoxia is considered to be a contributor to the pathology associated with administration of anthrax lethal toxin (LT). However, we report here that serum lactate levels in LT-treated mice are reduced, a finding inconsistent with the anaerobic metabolism expected to occur during hypoxia. Reduced lactate levels are also observed in the culture supernatants of LT-treated cells. LT inhibits the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, a subunit of HIF-1, the master regulator directing cellular responses to hypoxia. The toxin has no effect on the transcription or protein turnover of HIF-1α, but instead it acts to inhibit HIF-1α translation. LT treatment diminishes phosphorylation of eIF4B, eIF4E, and rpS6, critical components of the intracellular machinery required for HIF-1α translation. Moreover, blockade of MKK1/2-ERK1/2, but not p38 or JNK signaling, lowers HIF-1α protein levels in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, consistent with a role for MKK1 and MKK2 as the major targets of LT responsible for the inhibition of HIF-1α translation. The physiological importance of the LT-induced translation blockade is demonstrated by the finding that LT treatment decreases the survival of hepatocyte cell lines grown in hypoxic conditions, an effect that is overcome by preinduction of HIF-1α. Taken together, these data support a role for LT in dysregulating HIF-1α and thereby disrupting homeostatic responses to hypoxia, an environmental characteristic of certain tissues at baseline and/or during disseminated infection with Bacillus anthracis.

Although the proximal targets of LT are well described, identification of the downstream mediators of toxicity remains an area of active investigation. Current models support the conclusion that the etiology of LT-induced cardiovascular collapse is multifactorial; LT has direct toxic effects on cardiac and smooth muscle (12.Liu S. Zhang Y.

Other pathological features of LT-treated animals appear to support this scenario. For example, LT administration to mice results in a pattern of pathology that is characterized by cytotoxicity in tissues that are relatively hypoxic, including the metaphyseal bone marrow and centrilobar regions of the liver (14.Moayeri M. Haines D. Young H.A. Leppla S.H. Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin induces TNF-α-independent hypoxia-mediated toxicity in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These findings have been interpreted to suggest that LT induces tissue hypoxia via cardiovascular compromise, which then leads to cell death in susceptible tissues that are characterized by relatively low baseline oxygen concentrations (14.Moayeri M. Haines D. Young H.A. Leppla S.H. Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin induces TNF-α-independent hypoxia-mediated toxicity in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although hypoxia has been considered as a contributor to LT-induced pathology, it is possible that LT could affect homeostatic responses to hypoxia. In this regard, LT has been shown to block hypoxia-driven retinal neovascularization in a neonatal mouse model (15.Bromberg-White J.L. Boguslawski E. Hekman D. Kort E. Duesbery N.S. Persistent inhibition of oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization by anthrax lethal toxin.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52: 8979-8992Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The master transcription factor that regulates these protective responses is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. HIF-1 is composed of two subunits, the O2-labile α subunit (HIF-1α) and the stable β subunit (HIF-1β) (16.Adams J.M. Difazio L.T. Rolandelli R.H. Luján J.J. Haskó G. Csóka B. Selmeczy Z. Németh Z.H.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway.Sci STKE 2007. 2007; (cm8)Google Scholar). The heterodimeric HIF-1 complex binds hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) containing a conserved RCGTG core sequence. HIF-1 directly controls expression of genes crucial for adaptation to hypoxia, encoding proteins regulating angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell growth and survival, tumor metastasis, and immune responses (18.Yeo E.J.

Recent advances in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 inhibitors.Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2012; 49: 24-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). HIF-1 activity is controlled primarily through post-translational modification and stabilization of the HIF-1α subunit (16.Adams J.M. Difazio L.T. Rolandelli R.H. Luján J.J. Haskó G. Csóka B.

The pVHL-hIF-1 system. A key mediator of oxygen homeostasis.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 502: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α undergoes post-translational hydroxylation of two proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564) within its oxygen-dependent degradation domain, mediated by prolyl hydroxylases (22.Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

C. elegans EGL-9 and mammalian homologs define a family of dioxygenases that regulate HIF by prolyl hydroxylation.Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). Hydroxylated HIF-1α is subsequently bound by the von Hippel-Lindau protein, which recruits the elongin-C/elongin-B/cullin-2/E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex, thus targeting HIF-1α for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (23.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. The tumour suppressor protein VHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors for oxygen-dependent proteolysis.Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). During hypoxia, the oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases are inactive. Therefore, HIF-1α escapes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and can be transported to the nucleus where it forms a heterodimeric complex with HIF-1β and recruits other co-activators to induce expression of its target genes. HIF-1α has also been reported to be degraded by calpain and the 20 S proteasome (24.Kong X. Alvarez-Castelao B. Lin Z. Castaño J.G. Caro J. Constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-α proteins by the proteasome is independent of von Hippel Lindau protein ubiquitylation and the transactivation activity of the protein.J. Biol.

In addition to the regulation of protein stability, HIF-1α is regulated at the levels of transcription and translation (26.Pagé E.L. Robitaille G.A. Pouysségur J. Richard D.E.

Whether anthrax LT modulates HIF-1α protein levels during transcription, translation, and/or following translation was previously unknown. Here, we provide data that LT directly blocks the translation of the master regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia, HIF-1α. This activity renders tissues more vulnerable to hypoxia-induced cell death. The effects of anthrax LT both to promote hypoxia and to inhibit homeostatic responses to hypoxia implicate a synergistic effect underlying host pathology. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with animal protocol WO2011-16, which was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Assurance A4295-01). Eight-to-10-week-old C57BL/6J mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory were allowed at least 1 week to acclimatize to the animal facility prior to the initiation of experiments. For in vivo intoxication experiments, mice were injected intravenously with 200 μg of PA and 80 μg of LF. Mice were sacrificed either 24 or 48 h following LT administration. Blood samples were collected for serum lactate measurements. Lyophilized recombinant PA and LF were purchased from the List Biological Laboratories, Inc.

MG132 (inhibitor of 26 S proteasome), U0126 (inhibitor of MKK1/2), SB203580 (inhibitor of p38), and SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK) were purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). ALLN (inhibitor of calpain) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Lactacystin (inhibitor of 20 S proteasome), rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR), PP242 (inhibitor of mTOR), and cycloheximide (CHX, inhibitor of mRNA translation) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against MKK1, MKK2, MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Antibodies against p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38, p38, p-MNK1, MNK1, p-RSK (Ser-380, Ther-359/Ser-363, and Thr-573), RSK1/2/3, p-eIF4E, eIF4E, p-eIF4B, eIF4B, p-p70S6K, p70S6K, p-rpS6, and rpS6 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). In addition, the following antibodies were used: anti-human HIF-1α (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals; Littleton, CO), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). The levels of lactate in serum or cell culture supernatants were assessed using the lactate colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit purchased from BioVision (Milpitas, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 46 μl of lactate assay buffer, 2 μl of lactate probe, and 2 μl of lactate enzyme mixture were added into each well of a 96-well plate containing 50 μl of testing samples or lactate standard. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured after incubation of the reaction at room temperature for 20 min. The concentration of lactate in the test samples was calculated based on comparison with a standard curve.

The concentration of glucose in the test samples was calculated based on comparison with a standard curve. Glucose uptake was calculated by subtracting the glucose concentrations in test samples of cell culture supernatants from the glucose concentration in fresh medium. RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions with or without LT using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and sent to the Phalanx Biotech Group (San Diego) for expression microarray analysis. Triplicate hybridizations for each sample were performed using the Human Whole-Genome OneArray. Microarray data were normalized using the median scaling approach. Data analysis was focused on HIF-1 direct targets. Heat maps were created using Excel software. Cells were lysed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Cell extracts were then separated on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with antibodies of interest using standard Western blotting techniques as described previously (36.Xu L. Fang H. Frucht D.M.

Western blotting films were scanned, and the intensity of protein bands was quantified using FluorChemTM Q software (Protein Simple Inc., San Jose, CA). Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit manufactured by Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The levels of HIF-1α mRNA were measured by quantitative PCR performed using standard techniques with a TaqMan probe (Hs00153153_m1) purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and normalized to the levels of β-actin (Hs99999903_m1). Polysome analysis was performed as described previously (37.Liu L. Rao J.N. Zou T. Xiao L. Wang P.Y. Turner D.J. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y.

In brief, HepG2 cells were pretreated with or without LT for 3 h and then cultured under hypoxic conditions for 4 h. The treated cells were then incubated with 0.1 mg/ml CHX for 5 min, detached by scraping into 1 ml of polysome extraction buffer (PEB, 0.3 m NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 0.1 mg/ml CHX), and lysed on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted (10,000 × g for 10 min), and the resulting supernatant was fractionated through a 10–50% linear sucrose gradient to fractionate cytoplasmic components according to their molecular weights. The eluted fractions were prepared using a fraction collector (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), and their quality was monitored at 254 nm by using a UV-6 detector (ISCO, Lincoln, NE). RNA in each fraction was isolated using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. The levels of HIF-1α and β-actin mRNA in each of the fractions were measured by quantitative PCR, and their abundance was represented as a percent of the total mRNA in the gradient. HepG2 and Hepa1c1c7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates with or without LT either 3 h prior to or at the initiation of a 24-h incubation under hypoxic conditions. The culture supernatants were assessed for lactate dehydrogenase release using the lactate dehydrogenase-cytotoxicity assay kit II (BioVision; Milpitas, CA). In brief, 2 μl of WST substrate and 100 μl of lactate dehydrogenase assay buffer were added to 10-μl test samples in 96-well plates. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured after a 30-min incubation of the reaction. Medium and supernatants collected from cells extracted with the kit-provided lysis solution were used as minimum (Mini) and maximum (Maxi) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release controls, respectively. Cytotoxicity was calculated using Equation 1. cytotoxicity(%)=(LDH of samples−Mini)(Maxi−Mini)×100(Eq. 1) Anthrax LT has been proposed to induce tissue damage by causing hypoxia (14.Moayeri M. Haines D. Young H.A. Leppla S.H. Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin induces TNF-α-independent hypoxia-mediated toxicity in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To investigate how LT affects the host's ability to respond to hypoxic stress, we first determined lactate levels in the serum of LT-injected mice, which would be expected to increase due to heightened anaerobic metabolism during hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1A, the levels of lactate in the serum of mice treated with LT for 24 h were paradoxically lower than in control mice. Serum lactate levels were even further reduced following LT treatment for 48 h (Fig. 1A). We next investigated whether LT treatment would similarly reduce lactate production in cultured cells. To address this, we treated HepG2 cells with LT under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, HepG2 cells release lactate in normoxic conditions, indicating the propensity of this transformed line to conduct glycolysis in normoxic conditions. Supernatants from LT-treated HepG2 cells had significantly lower concentrations of lactate compared with untreated cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, LT treatment reduced glucose uptake by HepG2 cells in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these findings support the conclusion that LT decreases anaerobic metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. To gain further insight into the effects of LT on cellular responses to hypoxia, we determined the gene expression profile of HepG2 cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions, in the presence or absence of LT. We focused our gene profiling analysis on the direct targets of HIF-1, the master regulatory transcription factor of host responses to hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of 17 direct HIF-1 target genes (19.Xia Y. Choi H.K. Lee K. Recent advances in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 inhibitors.Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2012; 49: 24-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was down-regulated in LT-treated HepG2 cells in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These genes encode proteins regulating glucose metabolism, cell growth and survival, and tumor metastasis. For example, Slc2a1 and Slc2a3 encode the glucose transporters (GLUT) 1 and GLUT3, respectively. These findings were also paradoxical when considering the increased glucose requirements during anaerobic metabolism. HIF-1 activity is primarily controlled through regulation of its α subunit, HIF-1α (16.Adams J.M. Difazio L.T. Rolandelli R.H. Luján J.J. Haskó G. Csóka B. Selmeczy Z. Németh Z.H. HIF-1: a key mediator in hypoxia.Acta Physiol. Hung. 2009; 96: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether LT affects HIF-1α protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of HIF-1α protein were markedly reduced in LT-treated HepG2 cells, in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. LT treatment also caused a reduction of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein in murine hepatocyte Hepa1c1c7 and in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, indicating that this activity was not species- or cell line-specific (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect of LT on HIF-1α was dependent on the toxin's protease function, as a mutant of LT lacking proteolytic activity failed to reduce HIF-1α protein in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C). Cellular levels of HIF-1α protein are regulated via transcription, translation, and protein degradation, which were each considered as possible targets for the activity of LT. We first determined whether LT inhibits HIF-1α gene transcription in HepG2 cells treated with or without LT under conditions of normoxia or hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 3A, LT treatment had negligible effects on HIF-1α gene transcription, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Next, we assessed post-translational modes of regulation. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α undergoes oxygen-dependent hydroxylation and ubiquitination, which promotes its degradation by the 26 S proteasome (23.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. The tumour suppressor protein VHL targets hypoxia-inducible factors for oxygen-dependent proteolysis.Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). In addition, HIF-1α has been reported to be degraded by calpain and the 20 S proteasome (24.Kong X. Alvarez-Castelao B. Lin Z. Castaño J.G. Caro J. Constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-α proteins by the proteasome is independent of von Hippel Lindau protein ubiquitylation and the transactivation activity of the protein.J. Biol.

Calpain mediates a von Hippel-Lindau protein-independent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate whether LT reduces HIF-1α through promoting its degradation, we added MG132 (a 26 S proteasome inhibitor), lactacystin (a 20 S proteasome inhibitor), or ALLN (a calpain inhibitor) individually or in combination to the cell cultures 30 min prior to LT treatment to block protein degradation. Western blotting showed that inhibition of protein degradation failed to correct fully the LT-induced HIF-1α reduction (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that LT does not reduce HIF-1α levels by promoting its degradation. Chemical inhibition of calpain or the 20 S proteasome had no restorative effect on HIF-1α levels in LT-tr"

Besides the estrogen receptor, there are no predictive biomarkers to help select breast cancer patients for tamoxifen treatment. CCND1 (cyclin D1) gene amplification is a putative candidate tamoxifen predictive biomarker. The RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1) gene is frequently co-amplified with CCND1 on chromosome 11q. We validated the predictive value of these biomarkers in the MA.12 randomized study of adjuvant tamoxifen vs. placebo in high-risk premenopausal early breast cancer. Premenopausal women with node-positive/high-risk node-negative early breast cancer received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and then were randomized to tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or placebo for 5 yrs. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were evaluated. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization was performed on a tissue microarray of 495 breast tumors (74% of patients) to measure CCND1 and RSF1 copy number. A multivariate Cox model to obtain hazard ratios (HR) adjusting for clinico-pathologic factors was used to assess the effect of these biomarkers on Os and RFS. 672 women were followed for a median of 8.4 years. We were able to measure the DNA copy number of CCND1 in 442 patients and RSF1 in 413 patients. CCND1 gene amplification was observed in 8.7% and RSF1 in 6.8% of these patients, preferentially in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. No statistically significant interaction with treatment was observed for either CCND1 or RSF1 amplification, although patients with high RSF1 copy number did not show benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen (HR = 1.11, interaction p = 0.09). Unlike CCND1 amplification, RSF1 amplification may predict for outcome in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen."
https://openalex.org/W1991550449,"We developed an automated diagnostic system for the detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) that was based on a microarray platform. We compared efficacies of our automated system with conventional enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Viruses were immobilized to microarrays using a radical cross-linking reaction that was induced by photo-irradiation. A new photoreactive polymer containing perfluorophenyl azide (PFPA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate was prepared and coated on plates. Inactivated measles, rubella, mumps, Varicella-Zoster and recombinant Epstein-Barr viruse antigen were added to coated plates, and irradiated with ultraviolet light to facilitate immobilization. Virus-specific IgGs in healthy human sera were assayed using these prepared microarrays and the results obtained compared with those from conventional EIAs. We observed high correlation (0.79–0.96) in the results between the automated microarray technique and EIAs. The microarray-based assay was more rapid, involved less reagents and sample, and was easier to conduct compared with conventional EIA techniques. The automated microarray system was further improved by introducing reagent storage reservoirs inside the chamber, thereby conserving the use of expensive reagents and antibodies. We considered the microarray format to be suitable for rapid and multiple serological diagnoses of viral diseases that could be developed further for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2027204532,"Background Since HIV-1 Tat and Vpr genes are involved in promoter transactivation, apoptosis, etc, we carried out studies to find out nature and extent of natural variation in the two genes from seropositive patients from Northern India and determined their functional implications. Methods HIV-1 tat exon 1 and vpr were amplified from the genomic DNA isolated from the blood of HIV-1 infected individuals using specific primers by Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to extensive genetic analysis (CLUSTAL W, Simplot etc). Their expression was monitored by generating myc fusion clones. Tat exon 1 and Vpr variants were co-transfected with the reporter gene construct (LTR-luc) and their transactivation potential was monitored by measuring luciferase activity. Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis was done by Propidium Iodide (PI) staining followed by FACS. Results Exon 1 of tat was amplified from 21 samples and vpr was amplified from 16 samples. One of the Tat exon 1 variants showed phylogenetic relatedness to subtype B & C and turned out to be a unique recombinant. Two of the Vpr variants were B/C/D recombinants. These natural variations were found to have no impact on the stability of Tat and Vpr. These variants differed in their ability to transactivate B LTR and C LTR promoters. B/C recombinant Tat showed better co-operative interaction with Vpr. B/C/D recombination in Vpr was found to have no effect on its co-operativity with Tat. Recombinant Tat (B/C) induced more apoptosis than wild type B and C Tat. The B/C/D recombination in Vpr did not affect its G2 arrest induction potential but reduced its apoptosis induction ability. Conclusions Extensive sequence and region-specific variations were observed in Tat and Vpr genes from HIV-1 infected individuals from Northern India. These variations have functional implications & therefore important for the pathogenicity of virus."
https://openalex.org/W2149052886,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly with progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. According to the amyloid-hypothesis, AD is caused by generation and subsequent cerebral deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ). Aβ is generated through sequential cleavage of the transmembrane Amyloid-Precursor-Protein (APP) by two endoproteinases termed beta- and gamma-secretase. Increased APP-expression caused by APP gene dosage effects is a risk factor for the development of AD. Here we carried out a large scale screen for novel compounds aimed at decreasing APP-expression. For this we developed a screening system employing a cell culture model of AD. A total of 10,000 substances selected for their ability of drug-likeness and chemical diversity were tested for their potential to decrease APP-expression resulting in reduced Aβ-levels. Positive compounds were further evaluated for their effect at lower concentrations, absence of cytotoxicity and specificity. The six most promising compounds were characterized and structure function relationships were established. The novel compounds presented here provide valuable information for the development of causal therapies for AD."
https://openalex.org/W1995360570,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) represents a pattern of non-malignant growth of prostatic fibromuscular stroma. Metabolic disturbances such us pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome may have a role in BPH pathophysiology. A potential explanation for the above relationship involves the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis as well as IGF binding proteins, (IGFBPs) of which the most abundant form is IGFBP-3. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between intra-prostatic levels of IGF-1, IGF-2 as well as to evaluate the role of locally expressed IGFBP-3 in BPH development in pre-diabetes. A total of 49 patients admitted to the Urology department of a tertiary urban Greek hospital, for transurethral prostate resection, or prostatectomy and with pre-diabetes [impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or both] were finally included. The majority of the sample consisted of subjects with IGT (51.0%), followed by IFG and IGT (32.7%) and isolated IFG (16.3%). For all participants a clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected. In addition, total prostate (TP) volume or transitional zone (TZ) volume were estimated by transrectal ultrasonography. The results of the multivariate analysis regarding TP volume showed that higher PSA (p<0.001), larger waist circumference (p=0.007) and higher IGFBP-3 expression levels (p<0.001) independently predicted higher TP volume. The results regarding the volume of the TZ showed that higher PSA (p<0.001), larger waist circumference (p<0.001) and higher IGFBP-3 expression levels (p=0.024) were independently associated with higher TZ volume. Our findings show that intra-prostatic levels of IGFBP-3, PSA and waist circumference, but not overall obesity, are positively associated with prostate volume. IGFBP-3 seems to be a multifunctional protein, which can potentiate or inhibit IGF activity."
