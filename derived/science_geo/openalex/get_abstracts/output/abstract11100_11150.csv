https://openalex.org/W1984986786,"When small, unilamellar lipid vesicles containing a high concentration of the fluorescent dye 6-carboxyfluorescein are incubated with either frog retinas or human lymphocytes, fluroescence distributes widely throughout each cell. Since ""self-quenching"" largely prevents the dye from fluorescing as long as it remains sequestered in vesicles, it is clear that a considerable amount of dye is released from the vesicles and diluted into the much larger volume of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1970266617,"A method is described by which HeLa cells can be fractionated to reveal a skeletal-like structure in the cytoplasm. This cytoskeleton has many of the cell's ultrastructural features, such as 100Å filaments, microfilaments, centrioles, and microspikes, although most of the cellular protein, membranes, and microtubules have been extracted. Associated with the cytoskeleton are most of the polysomal, but not the monomeric, ribosomes. These polysomes are distributed throughout the cytoskeleton except in the region of the 100Å filaments, which resembles the distribution in intact cells. Degradation of mRNA with low levels of ribonuclease releases most ribosomes from the cytoskeleton. Prior disaggregation of polyribosomes in vivo releases ribosomes but not mRNA. Cytochalasin B administered in vivo releases the mRNA from the cytoskeleton. These results suggest an attachment of polyribosomes to the cytoskeleton via mRNA."

Specific myosin polypeptides have been identified by immunoprecipitation with an antibody made to purified adult chicken skeletal muscle myosin. This mRNA binds to oligo(dT)-cellulose, and an active fraction from sucrose gradients migrates as 26S on formamide-polyacrylamide gels. The relative amount of this RNA increases dramatically at the time of terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1597917005,"To obtain information on the mechanism of glycosylation of ovalbumin, three types of experiments were performed with either hen oviduct membrane preparations or tissue slices and the antibiotic tunicamycin. First, experiments involving the addition of tunicamycin to oviduct membranes demonstrated that this antibiotic inhibited the synthesis of a N-acetylglucosaminyl-lipid with the properties of N-acetyl-glucosaminylpyrophosphorylpolyisoprenol. No inhibitory effects on the other steps in the synthesis of oligosaccharide-lipid were observed. Thus, tunicamycin inhibits the lipid-linked pathway for membrane protein glycosylation by blocking the first step in the synthesis of oligosaccharide-lipid, namely, the synthesis of N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphorylpolyisoprenol. Second, in experiments using membranes prepared from oviduct tissue slices preincubated with tunicamycin, it was found that mannosylphosphoryldolichol was the only saccharide-lipid synthesized. This result indicates that tunicamycin administered in vivo depletes endogenous pools of N-acetylglucosamine-lipid precursors to oligosaccharide-lipid in a manner consistent with its activity in vitro. Finally, it was found that tissue slices incubated in the presence of tunicamycin synthesized the polypeptide chain of ovalbumin at almost normal rates. However, the protein newly synthesized in vivo did not contain labeled N-acetylglucosamine or mannose and had the properties of unglycosylated ovalbumin. These results indicate that saccharide-lipids participate in the assembly of the core oligosaccharide of the secretory glycoprotein, ovalbumin."
https://openalex.org/W2006025628,"In 1931 influenza viruses were first isolated from pigs (Shope, 1931), and subsequently the first human influenza virus isolates were obtained (Smith, Andrewes, and Laidlaw, 1933). This marked the beginning of modern influenza virus research, and from then on many scientists have been fascinated by this virus and the disease it causes. Unlike any other known virus, influenza A virus undergoes dramatic changes with respect to its surface antigens, and whenever these changes take place (recently every lo-15 years new subtypes emerged), the virus causes severe pandemics in the human population (Table 1). The most dramatic example of such a pandemic was the 1918 influenza virus outbreak, which was estimated to be directly or indirectly responsible for the death of 20 million people worldwide. But even between pandemic periods, the virus changes constantly and thereby successfully overcomes attempts to protect people fully by vaccination. By the time vaccines are ready for distribution, the virus has changed significantly with respect to its surface antigens, and vaccines, prepared with slightly different strains, become less effective against the new variant. This phenomenon of constant antigenic change and the fact that different influenza viruses undergo extensive genetic interactions (recombination) have generated a deep interest in the peculiar genetic makeup of influenza viruses. The purpose of this paper is to review briefly the current state of knowledge of influenza virus genetics, with particular emphasis on recent findings regarding the characterization and function of individual genes and their gene products."

Feeding of the synthetic retinoid, 13-cis-retinoid acid, inhibited the incidence and extent of bladder cancer in these rats, even when 13-cis-retinoic acid administration was begun after completion of the carcinogen treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1527880353,"The intrinsic fluorescence of human and bovine prothrombin fragment 1 is quenched (approximately -35%) when calcium ions are bound. The intrinsic fluorescence of prothrombin is also quenched by the binding of Ca2+ but to a lesser extent (total change is approximately -6%). The prothrombin fragment 1 fluorescence transition is also effected by the binding of Mg2+, Mn2+, Gd3+, and Tb3+. With all ions the fluorescence quenching is readily reversed by titration with EDTA. Titration with any of the above ions results in a sigmoidal titration curve. The fluorescence transition midpoints (expressed as Tm) occur at the following concentrations of ions: Ca2+, 0.22 (0.35) mM; Mg2+, 0.22 (0.45) mM; Mn2+, 12.6 (12.6) muM; and Gd3+, 3.6 (5.3) muM (the values in parentheses indicate the concentration of the respective ions bound to bovine prothrombin fragment 1). The presence of phospholipid steepens the Ca2+ titration curve, significantly more so for the bovine system than for the human. Tm values for Ca2+ binding in the presence of phospholipid are 0.21 mM and 0.22 mM for binding to human and bovine prothrombin fragment 1, respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies indicate that prothrombin fragment 1 which is monomeric in the presence of EDTA undergoes concentration-dependent association in the presence of Ca2+. A plot of fraction monomer versus Ca2+ concentration is sigmoidal, with a Tm of approximately 1 mM Ca2+. Mg2+ is only marginally effective in promoting the dimerization, and Mn2+ and Gd3+ are even less effective. However, sedimentation studies performed in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ at varying Ca2+ concentrations shifted the apparent dimerization transition markedly to the left, the midpoint of the transition occurring at 0.25 mM. Kinetic studies reveal that while Mg2+ by itself does not promote prothrombin activation to thrombin, Mg2+ will partially substitute for Ca2+ in prothrombin activation. In the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ maximal activation rates are attained with 0.3 mM Ca2+; higher Mg2+ concentrations (at this Ca2+ concentration) are inhibitory. Only Ca2+ and Gd3+ permit significant prothrombin-phospholipid binding. Scatchard plots derived from equilibrium dialysis experiments performed with bovine prothrombin fragment 1 suggest marked cooperativity in calcium binding and the existence of approximately six Ca2+ binding sites. Similar studies, but with 1 mM Mg2+ also present in the dialysate, suggested that Mg2+ promotes a greater degree of cooperativity in Ca2+ binding to prothrombin fragment 1 with an apparent decrease in the number of Ca2+ sites occupied. It therefore appears that prothrombin fragment 1 has two classes of metal ion binding sites. One class, probably comprising two of six sites, is apparently fairly nonselective with respect to which metal ion is bound; binding of metal ion to these sites is responsible for the fluorescence change and apparently triggers a conformational transition..."

https://openalex.org/W2134397585,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide E isomerase catalyzes the isomerization of the endoperoxy group of prostaglandin H and produces prostaglandin E. The enzyme was solubilized with Tween 20 from bovine vesicular gland microsomes and purified 26-fold by successive column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and omega-aminobutyl Sepharose 4B. The previously known requirement for glutathione was further investigated. The activity of freshly prepared enzyme was destroyed rapidly with a half-life of about 30 min at 24 degrees, pH 8.0. Various thiol compounds including glutathione protected the enzyme from such an inactivation. However, several findings indicated that glutathione was possibly specifically involved as a coenzyme in the isomerase reaction, but was not oxidized in a stoichiometric quantity. The enzyme also isomerized prostaglandin G at a rate approximately half of that of prostaglandin H."
https://openalex.org/W1648237278,"Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of lipid carrier-dependent protein glycosylation, was used in studies of procollagen synthesis, secretion, and proteolytic modification by chick cranial bones in organ culture and by chick tendon fibroblasts in tissue culture. Tunicamycin inhibited the incorporation of D-[2-3H]mannose into procollagen by greater than 90% whereas general protein synthesis and collagen synthesis were decreased by only 10 to 20%. The procollagen synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin was secreted normally and its immunological characteristics, as detected by an antiserum to the intact protein, were unchanged. However, tunicamycin caused an accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates containing disulfide-bonded COOH-terminal extensions in both cell and bone culture. Cleavage of NH2-terminal extensions was not detectably impaired. These findings provide additional support for the involvement of more than one enzyme in the limited proteolytic conversion of procollagen to collagen."

The concentration of adenosine triphosphate in the red cells was about half that of comparably reticulocyte-rich blood. Since adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase compete for a common substrate, the greatly increased activity of the former may interfere with nucleotide salvage via the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1549951942,"Ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (EC 1.7.7.1.) from spinach has been purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 110 units/mg of protein. The enzyme, Mr = 61,000 has 3 iron atoms (of which one is in siroheme) and 2 labile sulfides, i.e. 1 (Fe2-S2) per molecule, with absorption maxima at 276, 386 (Soret), 573 (alpha), and 690 nm, with an E386 of 3.97 X 10(4) M-1-cm-1, and A276/A386 absorptivity ratio of 1.8. Anaerobic addition of dithionite results in the loss of the 690 nm peak and the splitting of the 573 nm absorption band into two broad peaks at 545 and 585 nm. Reduction by dithionite is enhanced by cyanide (Fig. 7) and requires about 3 electron eq per mol of enzyme. With nitrite or hydroxylamine (substrates of the enzyme), cyanide (a competitive inhibitor with respect to nitrite), or sulfite, the 690 nm absorption band of substrate-free enzyme disappears and the absorbance in the Soret and alpha region are altered. The high spin EPR signals disappear (J. M. Vega, H. Kamin, N. R. Orme-Johnson, and W. H. Orme-Johnson, unpublished observations). Titration permits calculation of 1 mol of nitrite bound/mol of enzyme with a Kdiss of 3.2 X 10(-6) M. Dithionite-reduced enzyme also forms complexes with added nitrite, hydroxylamine, or cyanide, characterized by marked alterations in the 573 (alpha) absorption band. THus, substrates or competitive inhibitors can be bound to the oxidized or reduced enzyme forms. CO inhibits nitrite reductase and forms a complex with reduced enzyme (epsilonmax at 395, 543, and 585 nm). Formation or dissociation of the spectrophotometrically detectable CO complex correlates with inhibition or inhibition-reversal of nitrite reduction catalysis. During steady state turnover with dithionite and nitrite, the enzyme forms a complex with added nitrite with absorption difference maxima at 445, 538, and 580 nm with respect to reduced enzyme. When nearly all substrate is depleted the spectrum of a new species appears, indicating that nitrite reductase may form complexes with nitrogen compounds of more than one oxidation state. Nitrite is stoichiometrically reduced to ammonia without detectable free nitrogen compounds of intermediate reduction state. p-Chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB) inhibits nitrite reductase activity and nitrite partially protects against this inhibition. Titration of native enzyme with the mercurial shows that 6 mol of pCMB can be bound/mol or nitrite reductase. The Soret absorption band of the native nitrite reductase is altered and partially bleached in the pCMB-treated enzyme, and the 573 (alpha) band disappears."
https://openalex.org/W1980492248,"Rats with transplantable spontaneously metastasizing mammary tumors have elevated levels of both serum sialoglycoconjugate and serum sialytransferase activity compared with normal female rats or rats with various nonmetastasizing mammary tumors. A direct relationship was observed between the amount of serum protein-bound sialic acid and serum sialyltransferase activity in all rats studied. Serum sialyltransferase activity in rats with a representative metastasizing mammary tumor, SMT-2A, was also correlated with tumor age. Microsomes prepared from the SMT-2A tumor have a sixfold higher sialyltransferase activity than do microsomes prepared from the nonmetastasizing mammary tumor MT-W9B. Normal rat liver microsomes have the same level of activity as microsomes prepared from livers of animals with either SMT-2A or MT-W9B tumors. The data indicate that spontaneously metastasizing mammary tumor cells have an increased production and release, perhaps through cell surface shedding, of a sialyltransferase. It is suggested that this sialyltransferase may increase the serum half-life of certain tumor-specific circulating glycoconjugates by increasing the content of protein-bound sialic acid and may thereby play a role in the immune escape mechanism of metastasizing tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2011858429,"Previous work has shown that the 26S RNA found in Sindbis-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts encodes the three viral structural proteins, one internal protein, core, and two membrane glycoproteins, E1 and E2. This mRNA has one initiation site; core, E1, and E2 are derived by proteolytic cleavage. Here we show that during infection, the 26S RNA is found mainly in membrane-bound polysomes which synthesize all three virion structural proteins. These polysomes are released from the membrane upon treatment with puromycin and high salt. Newly synthesized core protein is localized on the cytoplasmic side of endoplasmic reticulum membranes, while newly synthesized envelope proteins are sequestered by the lipid bilayer. These results suggest that the nascent glycoproteins, presumably their amino termini, are of major importance in directing the binding of polysomes containing 26S mRNA to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the subsequent transfer of glycoproteins into the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W2033200880,"The molecular basis of resistance to the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine has been examined in cell-free, protein-synthesizing extracts derived from normal and emetine-resistant (EmtR) mutants. We had earlier shown that protein synthesis in extracts of the mutant cells was resistant to the inhibitory action of emetin. When extracts from a wild-type and mutant cell line were fractionated into supernatant (S-100) and polyribosome fractions and mixed in different combinations, resistance to emetine was found to be associated with the mutant polyribosome fraction. Further fractionation of wild-type and mutant polyribosomes into 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and mixing them in various combinations with an S-100 fraction from the wild-type cell indicates that resistance of mutant cells to emetine involves an alteration in the 40S ribosomal subunit. The behavior of EmtR has also been examined in somatic cell hybrids. Studies of EmtR X EmtS hybrid cell lines in vivo and in vitro show that EmtR is pheontypically recessive to EmtS, which is consistent with the ribosomal location of the genetic change."
https://openalex.org/W2095472548,"Androgen-dependent and androgen-independent (autonomous), cloned, cultured cell lines of the androgen-dependent mouse mammary adenocarcinoma, Shionogi carcinoma 115, have been established. Growth of the dependent cells requires the presence of androgen, provided they are grown in suspension culture in medium containing dextran-charcoal-treated fetal calf serum. The growth rate of autonomous cells in the presence or absence of DHT is similar to that of dependent cells grown in its presence. An agar culture method has been developed that enables the proportion of dependent and autonomous cells in mixed populations to be determined. Autonomous cells appear in dependent clones, and their frequency increases with increasing time of subculture. Dependent cells from tumors preferentially in male animals, and dependent cell cytosols contain significant amounts (approximately 300 femtomoles per mg protein) of a specific androgen-binding macromolecule. Autonomous cells formed tumors equally well in both male and female mice, and autonomous cell cytosols contain very low levels (≤ 7 femtomoles per mg protein) of the specific androgen-binding macromolecule(s). These studies delineate a system which can be used to investigate the mechanism of steroid hormone-dependent and autonomous tumor growth, and the transitions between the hormone-dependent and autonomous states."
https://openalex.org/W1606150316,"Bovine coronary artery strips were incubated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid and the chemical properties of the various prostaglandins (PG) formed were studied. Arachidonate was converted to two major prostaglandin products, PGE2 and a novel prostaglandin having chemical (i.e. base hydrolysis and borohydride reduction) and chromatographic properties identical with 6-keto-PGF1alpha. This final compound was inactive on coronary artery strips. The endoperoxide intermediates, PGG2 or PGH2, previously shown to induce coronary relaxation, were not released into the medium from isolated bovine coronaries. The arachidonic acid-induced dilation may have been due to an intracellular action of PGH2 (or PGG2) or to the action of another, yet unidentified, labile intermediate formed in the enzymatic conversion of endoperoxides to 6-keto PGF1alpha. When PGH2 was incubated with bovine coronary microsomes, the PGH2 was completely metabolized (i.e. loss of rabbit aorta contraction) but a compound was generated which was a much more potent coronary relaxant. We suggest that this major novel metabolic pathway of arachidonate generates a substance, intermediate between PGH2 and the final 6-keto PGF1alpha-like product, which is a potent coronary vasodilator."
https://openalex.org/W2071932466,"Reparts suggest that the activity of RNA polymerase I is modulated by a labile protein with a hlaf-life of 10 to 20 minutes. Ornithine decarboxylase is the only labile protein (half-life, 10 to 20 minutes) that increases in activity prior to increased RNA polymerase I activity. The addition of a small amount of a highly purified ornithine decarboxylase preparation to an RNA polymerase I assay increases the initial rate of the reaction as well as the time for which the assay is linear. The incorporation patterns of 14C-labeled adenosine triphosphate and 32P-labeled adenosine triphosphate into RNA indicate that the addition of ornithine decarboxylase to the RNA polymerase assay increases the rate of initiation. This report demonstrates a novel way to purify ornithine decarboxylase by RNA polymerase I affinity chromatography and presents data in support of the hypothesis that the labile protein which modulates RNA polymerase I activity is ornithine decarboxylase."

The reported inability of olfaction to register fine differences in intensity seems to be largely a result of fluctuations in the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1976243118,"In alert, resting dogs, the brain is warmer than arterial blood in the common carotid artery. When dogs run, brain temperature drops, despite a sharp rise in carotid blood temperature, and is maintained 1.3 degrees C below carotid temperature during exercise. This brain cooling apparently results from countercurrent heat exchange between warm arterial blood supplying the brain and cool venous blood draining the nose and mouth. The heat exchange occurs in the arteries at the base of the brain, which form a rudimentary carotid rete in the dog, and is greatest during exercise, when respiratory evaporation is at a peak. In animals with a carotid rete, the brain is protected against overheating during the severe thermal stress of exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1607907842,"Intraperitoneal injection of tritiated folic acid (PteGlu) into rats has revealed the presence of three separate protein fractions in the cytosol fraction of the liver and one in the mitochondria which bind folate derivatives. The proteins in the cytosol (cytosol I, II and III) have approximate molecular weights of 350,000, 150,000, and 25,000 and the protein in the mitochondria has an approximate molecular weight of 90,000 as estimated by gel filtration. The bound folate derivatives are primarily polyglutamate forms while cytosol II contains primarily bound 5-methyltetrahydrofolate polyglutamate derivatives. Little binding of radioactively labeled folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to these fractions was observed when binding was carried out in vitro. Significant binding in vitro was observed, however, when a mixture of biosynthetically labeled natural folate derivatives was used. These proteins have not been purified, but cytosol III partially consists of the enzyme, tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.3). Studies on the time course of folic acid incorporation into the liver showed that soon after injection nonmetabolized folic acid was bound to the plasma membrane fraction of the liver cell. It is suggested that at least one of the binding proteins in the cytosol may be involved in storage of the vitamin while the binding of nonmetabolized folic acid to the plasma membrane may reflect the existence of a carrier for folic acid transport into the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1972353378,"Procollagen and collagen were isolated from the culture medium and cell layer of line TSD4 (obtained from mouse teratocarcinoma OTT6050). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the highly purified procollagen fraction demonstrated that the fraction is composed of theta chains (150,000 daltons), pro alpha chains (130,000 daltons), and alpha chains (100,000 daltons). Limited pepsin digestion of this fraction yielded a single species of collagen molecules having a chain composition (alpha1)3, as did collagen isolated from the cell layer. Each alpha1 chain appears to be slightly larger than alpha1 chains from calf or human type I and type III collagen. Amino acid analysis and cyanogen bromide peptide profiles of pepsin-treated TSD4 collagen demonstrated significant differences from those of other collagens (II, III, IV) of the type alpha1(X)3, although similar to that of the alpha1 chain of type I collagen, [alpha1(1)]2alpha2. Taken together, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, electron microscopy, and cyanogen bromide peptide analysis indicate that this material represents a new molecular species of collagen not previously characterized, probably related to [alpha1(I)]3."

https://openalex.org/W2051350749,"CHO hybrid cell lines obtained by fusing cells of wild-type sensitivity to alpha-amanitin with mutant cells containing RNA polymerase II activity resistant to alpha-amanitin have both sensitive (wild-type) and resistant forms of RNA polymerase II. When these hybrids were grown in medium containing alpha-amanitin, the sensitive form of polymerase II was inactivated, and the activity resistant to alpha-amanitin increased proportionally. The total polymerase II activity level therefore remained constant. This regulation of RNA polymerase II activity occurred independently of that of RNA polymerase I and was similar to that observed previously in the alpha-amanitin-resistant rat myoblast mutant clone Ama102 (Somers, Pearson, and Ingles, 1975a). A sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed to quantitate the total mass of RNA polymerase II enzyme. Under conditions of regulation of the enzymatic activity when hybrids grown in alpha-amanitin exhibited a 2-3 fold increase in the activity of the alpha-amanitin-resistant enzyme, no major change in the enzyme mass was detected immunologically. However, quantitation of the alpha-amanitin-inactivated polymerase II of wild-type sensitivity by 3H-amanitin binding indicated that the loss of its enzymic activity was accompanied by a loss of 3H-amanitin binding capacity in the cell lysates. All these results taken together indicate that a mechanism for regulating the intracellular level of RNA polymerase II exists and that it involves changes in the concentration of enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1490591796,"This chapter discusses the multifunctional protein methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. These enzyme activities have been shown to copurify 100-fold from porcine liver and are now known to comprise the multifunctional proteins in sheep and pig liver, as well as in yeast. The three enzyme assays involve the spectrophotometric measurement of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate produced or hydrolyzed during the incubations. The dehydrogenase activity is determined by acidification of the assay mix after incubation, thereby destroying the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)H and converting any formyltetrahydrofolate produced by hydrolysis back to the immediate product, methenyltetrahydrofolate. The synthetase is assayed in a similar fashion, where the formyltetrahydrofolate produced, upon incubating enzyme with tetrahydrofolate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and formate is converted to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate by acidification. Cyclohydrolase activity is obtained from the rate of hydrolysis of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 355 nm on a recording spectrophotometer. The dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities are found in a 33,000 mol wt portion of the polypeptide, indicating a close physical association. This is further supported by the observation that the product of the dehydrogenase is preferentially channeled through the cyclohydrolase, rather than being released into the medium."

The NH2-terminal fragment CB1, composed of CB3 plus CB2, had an internal homoserine which was not completely cleaved. The amino acid sequence of CB2 was determined by a combination of automated and manual Edman degradation techniques. Peptides suitable for the latter method were derived from tryptic, alpha-chymotryptic, alpha-lytic protease, and thermolytic digestions. Fragment CB2 contains 81 of the 259 residues of troponin-T."
https://openalex.org/W2088586992,"The physical state of the viral genome in four lines of hamster cells transformed by adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) has been investigated. The four lines of transformed cells originated from hamster cells after infection with Ad12 at multiplicities ranging from 5-350 plaque-forming units per cell. The DNA from transformed cells has been restricted with the Sal I endonuclease from Streptomyces albus which cleaves adenovirus DNA more frequently than DNA from adenovirus-transformed hamster cells. Thus after cleavage by the Sal I enzyme, it is possible to separate free adenovirus DNA sequences from these which are covalently linked to cellular DNA in transformed hamster cells. The results of sequential hybridization experiments in which the Sal I-treated DNA from transformed cells is first annealed to Ad12 DNA on filters, then eluted, and finally hybridized to hamster cell DNA, support the model of Ad12 DNA integrated in multiple fragments into the host genome. Further experiments will be required to characterize the host sequences adjacent to adenovirus DNA and to compare these sequences in different lines of Ad12 transformed cells."

We identified two types of 5' terminals, m7G(5')pppNmpN and m7G(5')pppNm-pNmpN, in which the first methylated nucleoside is 7-methylguanosine, the second is either N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine, 2'-O-methyladenosine, or 2'-O-methylguanosine, and the third is 2'-O-methyluridine, 2'-O-methylcytidine, or 2'-O-methyladenosine. Approximately 1.7% of the 32P label was present in the 5' terminal structures. Assuming a similar specific radioactivity for all phosphates, this percentage corresponds to an average of one terminal per 335 nucleotides. Histone mRNA differed from bulk polyadenylylated mRNA of HeLa cells in lacking significant amounts of 2'-O-methyluridine or 2'-O-methylcytidine in the second position of the 5' terminal oligonucleotide and in lacking N6-methyladenosine residues at internal positions."

RNA polymerases I, II, IIIA, and IIIB eluted at the characteristic ammonium sulfate concentrations of 0.15, 0.28, 0.34, and 0.42 M, respectively. The sensitivity of each peak of polymerase to alpha-amanitin was examined and was shown to be essentially identical to the three classes of RNA polymerases in other mammalian systems. RNA polymerase I was insensitive to high levels of alpha-amanitin, RNA polymerase II was sensitive to low concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 0.006 mug/ml) and RNA polymerases IIIA and IIIB were sensitive to high concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 18 mug/ml). The alpha-amanitin sensitivity curve of total RNA synthesis measured in isolated nucleo demonstrated that the activity of each class of RNA polymerase could be quantitated in uterine nuclei. Thus the initial decrease in activity at low concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 0.005 mug/ml) was attributed to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity, the second decrease in activity at higher concentrations of alpha-amanitin (50% inhibition at 15 mug/ml) was attributed to the inhibition of RNA polymerase III activity, and the activity which was resistant to the highest alpha-amanitin concentration tested was attributed to RNA polymerase I activity. When estradiol was given to immature rats 6 h before killing both RNA polymerases I and III levels in nuclei were increased significantly over the control values. The time course of these changes demonstrated that the increases in RNA polymerases I and III were first evident between 1.5 and 3 h following hormone treatment. Significantly, these increases in polymerase I and III in nuclei parallel the published increases for rRNA and tRNA synthesis following hormone treatment. However, the amount of RNA polymerase I and III was not altered upon extraction, suggesting that these changes are due to the alteration in chromatin template activity. Both estradiol and estriol produced identical increases in uterine RNA polymerase I and III 6 h after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2027716659,"Single Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells plated on agar form macroscopic colonies with high efficiency. Colonies produced by cells from the uncloned cell line increase in diameter continuously for 10–12 days after plating to form mounds of cells about 1 mm in diameter. With further incubation, some of these colonies do not increase in diameter (arrested dome), some form an expanding annular monolayer of cells around the central mound (fried egg), and some grow by enlarging the central mound into a low multilayered disc (saucer). These colony types on agar appear to be clonal characteristics of the CHO cell line. Cloning the line gives two kinds of isolates: one forms a mixture of arrested dome and fried egg colonies in an inheritable ratio, and the other forms saucer colonies. Cells from saucer colonies form saucer colonies when replated on agar. Cells from all colony types replate with similar efficiency on plastic or agar, and exhibit the same growth rate and cell size in liquid suspension culture. On plastic substrate, all these CHO cells form colonies which increase continuously in diameter for as long as 21 days, and little clonal difference in the morphology of colonies or of single cells is observed. These observations reveal a previously unsuspected heterogenieity in an established line of cultured mammalian cells and provide a method for studying new classes of In vitro growth control phenomena. These control phenomena may help in the building an in vitro model for tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1537855106,"Although the bulk of RNA synthesized in vitro by vaccinia virus is 8 to 12 S, a small amount of high molecular weight RNA can be detected. This RNA is virion-associated and is not extruded from the virus as high molecular weight RNA. It is sensitive to pancreatic RNase digestion in high salt, has a density in neutral CS2SO4 of 1.68 g ml-1 and remains large after digestion with DNase or denaturation in dimethyl sulfoxide. In the presence of high concentrations of virus in the in vitro RNA polymerase reaction, pulse-labeling experiments indicate an RNA sedimenting heterogeneously between 20 and 30 S. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that a fraction of this high molecular weight RNA can be chased into RNA sedimenting at 8 to 12 S. Cleavage into smaller fragments is not dependent on continued RNA synthesis but does require ribonucleoside triphosphates. In the presence of ethidium bromide, the RNA is not cleaved."

Potentiometric titrations of rabbit antibody to the hapten trimethylphenylammonium ion demonstrate the speed and convenience of the new method for the determination of binding equilibria. Average intrinsic binding constants obtained agree well with those measured by equilibrium dialysis techniques.
https://openalex.org/W2049419197,"Rats learned to press a lever for intravenous self-injection of liquid diet during periods of several weeks when oral food was not available. The intakes were low but regulated, and were sufficient to balance energy expenditures at low body weight. Systemic receptors alone are thus adequate to motivate feeding behavior and meter the caloric yield of the intravenous injections."
https://openalex.org/W1510461435,"The high molecular weight virion-associated RNA synthesized by vaccinia in vitro can be cleaved into smaller components, some of which are extruded from the virus as 8 to 12 S RNA. The high molecular weight virion-associated RNA fails to bind appreciably (5%) to poly(U) filters indicating that it is not polyadenylated. Its cleavage products will, however, bind to poly(U) (40 to 50%) after processing in the presence of ATP. The high molecular weight virion-associated RNA is methylated by the virus, and purified unmethylated RNA can be methylated by detergent-solubilized extracts of vaccinia virus cores. In the presence of GTP, methylation is stimulated 3-fold. The level of methylation of purified unmethylated high molecular weight RNA achieved by soluble core extracts is approximately 80% of the level of methylation achieved with purified unmethylated 8 to 12 S viral RNA, suggesting that more residues than the primary 5' termini became methylated. Approximately 85% of the methylated RNA binds to poly(U) when purified high molecular weight RNA is processed with soluble core extracts in the presence of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine, GTP, and ATP, conditions which also cleave the RNA. Nucleic acid hybridization-competition studies indicate that virion-extruded 8 to 12 S mRNA contains sequences found in the high molecular weight virion-associated RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2059311123,"Several antigens and receptors are mobile in the plane of the membrane of the intact neonatal human erythrocyte but not in the membrane of the normal adult cell. In this report, measurements of the fluorescence polarization of perylene dissolved in isolated erythrocyte membranes are reported, which are indistinguishable for the two kinds of cells. This result indicates that the viscosities of the membrane interiors of the two cells are the same. The observed mobility differences, therefore, cannot be attributed to different lipid viscosities in the two membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2148722484,"Nuclei of KB cells harvested at late stages of productive infection with adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) harbor RNA molecules which measure up to 13 mum in length, as determined by electron microscopy of denatured RNA. While some of the molecules display features of secondary structure that are characteristic for precursor rRNA, our interest was in those showing almost no intramolecular folding. When hybridized to double stranded viral DNA under conditions which favor RNA:DNA duplex formation, nuclear AD2 RNA displaces the homologous DNA region and generates R loop structures whose size is proportional to the length of the hybridizing RNA. Slowly sedimenting RNA forms small R loops, whereas RNA of high sedimentation velocity generates loops that span a large proportion of the DNA length. Using SV40 sequences within Ad2+ND4 hybrid DNA as a position marker, we oriented many of the R loops on the conventional Ad2 map. Our analysis was restricted to the most abundant sequences of late Ad2 nuclear RNA participating in R loop formation. A small but significant proportion of large RNA generates loops between map positions 0.3 and 0.9. The much more frequent RNA of intermediate size (although larger than mRNA) hybridizes with midpoints near map positions 0.55 and 0.88--that is, near the gene locations for hexon and fiber. Our findings are compatible with the idea that the nuclear RNAs visualized in this study are intermediates in a processing pathway leading to mature forms of late Ad2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1990427501,"When a new electricity-producing plant is to be built in a given locality it is natural to take into account the public health consequences of the normal operation of each type of plant contemplated. Here, the fossil-burning plants and nuclear facilities come under consideration. I have attempted to show that, in spite of the many important studies performed, there is currently no reliable methodology to estimate how many more cancer cases, and how many more heart attacks and other diseases have to be anticipated as a consequence of the normal operation of this or that type of electric generator. In part, this is because the currently available estimates of radiation effects on humans are based on extrapolations from studies of two kinds. Those of one kind may be exemplified by studies of atomic bomb casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The other kind are laboratory experiments with lower animals, frequently mice. The unreliability of both kinds of extrapolations is connected with the following circumstances: (i) The omnipresent troublesome phenomenon of competing risks. (ii) The dependence of health effects of a given noxious agent on the preexisting local pollution. (iii) The dependence of health effects not only on the ""dose"" of an agent, but also on the rate at which the agent is administered. (iv) The noted difficulties of making extrapolations from one mammal to another. Our obtaining reliable estimates of the public health effects of extra pollution from new industrial plants would seem to depend on a large multipollutant and multilocality epidemiological study being conducted--one requiring the cooperative effort of several governmental agencies. However, a much easier study of certain developments in the vicinity of Rocky Flats, Colorado, might provide important direct information on health phenomena as they occur in real life."

(1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5003-5024) and the cognate nucleotide sequence recently determined in our laboratory (C. Escarmis and M. A. Billeter, unpublished results). The 22nd amino acid was asparagine rather than aspartic acid, and an additional amino acid, serine, was present between proline in position 55 and arginine in position 56. The revised structure agrees with the nucleotide sequence determined so far."
