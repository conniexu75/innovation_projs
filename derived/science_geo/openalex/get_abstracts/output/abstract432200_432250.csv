https://openalex.org/W2020331089,"Mutations generate sequence diversity and provide a substrate for selection. The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent–offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father’s age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 × 10−8 per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father’s age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father’s age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism. Whole-genome sequencing of 78 Icelandic parent–offspring trios is used to study the de novo mutation rate at the genome-wide level; the rate is shown to increase by about two mutations a year as a function of the increasing age of the father at conception, highlighting the importance of father’s age on the risk of diseases such as autism and schizophrenia. De novo mutations are important both as sources of diversity in evolution and for their immediate impact on diseases. Scientists at deCODE genetics and their colleagues have used whole-genome sequencing data from 78 Icelandic parent–offspring trios to study mutation rates in humans at the genome-wide level. They find that diversity in the mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at the time a child is conceived. For each year increase in the father's age at conception, the number of mutations increases by about two, and once the effects of random variation are accounted for the father's age is estimated to explain almost all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. Furthermore, the results show that demographic transitions that affect the age at which males reproduce can have a considerable effect on the rate of mutations, and consequently on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism."
https://openalex.org/W2003836872,"Antibiotics administered in low doses have been widely used as growth promoters in the agricultural industry since the 1950s, yet the mechanisms for this effect are unclear. Because antimicrobial agents of different classes and varying activity are effective across several vertebrate species, we proposed that such subtherapeutic administration alters the population structure of the gut microbiome as well as its metabolic capabilities. We generated a model of adiposity by giving subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy to young mice and evaluated changes in the composition and capabilities of the gut microbiome. Administration of subtherapeutic antibiotic therapy increased adiposity in young mice and increased hormone levels related to metabolism. We observed substantial taxonomic changes in the microbiome, changes in copies of key genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, increases in colonic short-chain fatty acid levels, and alterations in the regulation of hepatic metabolism of lipids and cholesterol. In this model, we demonstrate the alteration of early-life murine metabolic homeostasis through antibiotic manipulation. Treatment of young mice with low levels of antibiotics results in increases in adiposity and causes both a change in the composition of the intestinal microbial community and an alteration in the activity of microbial metabolic pathways, leading to increased short-chain fatty acid production. Continuous treatment with low levels of antibiotics has for decades been used to enhance body weight in livestock, yet the mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear. Using a similar approach in young mice, these authors show that subtherapeutic doses of antibiotic increase the body's fat mass, cause changes in the composition of the intestinal microbial community and alter the activity of microbial metabolic pathways that lead to short-chain fatty-acid production. These findings highlight the importance of certain microbes in maintaining normal metabolic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2166269696,"A Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is used to show that on their way to the CNS, encephalitogenic T-cell blasts are temporarily resident in the lung, where they reprogram their gene-expression profile and functional properties to enable them to transgress the blood–brain barrier into the CNS. The question of how immune cells enter the brain is of central importance to understanding the physiological and pathological processes of the central nervous system (CNS). This paper describes a mechanism that allows disease-inducing effector T cells to enter the brain. In a rat adoptive-transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), encephalitogenic T cells accumulate in the CNS after transient residence in the lung. On their way to the CNS, they reprogram their gene-expression profile and functional properties, ultimately enabling them to cross the blood–brain barrier. The lungs are in direct contact with the outer environment, so are a logical homing place for immune cells relevant to host defence — perhaps also providing a niche for the development of autoimmune cells. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the environment of the central nervous system (CNS) guard the nervous tissue from peripheral immune cells. In the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, myelin-reactive T-cell blasts are thought to transgress the BBB1,2 and create a pro-inflammatory environment in the CNS, thereby making possible a second autoimmune attack that starts from the leptomeningeal vessels and progresses into the parenchyma3,4,5,6. Using a Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show here that contrary to the expectations of this concept, T-cell blasts do not efficiently enter the CNS and are not required to prepare the BBB for immune-cell recruitment. Instead, intravenously transferred T-cell blasts gain the capacity to enter the CNS after residing transiently within the lung tissues. Inside the lung tissues, they move along and within the airways to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes before they enter the blood circulation from where they reach the CNS. Effector T cells transferred directly into the airways showed a similar migratory pattern and retained their full pathogenicity. On their way the T cells fundamentally reprogrammed their gene-expression profile, characterized by downregulation of their activation program and upregulation of cellular locomotion molecules together with chemokine and adhesion receptors. The adhesion receptors include ninjurin 1, which participates in T-cell intravascular crawling on cerebral blood vessels. We detected that the lung constitutes a niche not only for activated T cells but also for resting myelin-reactive memory T cells. After local stimulation in the lung, these cells strongly proliferate and, after assuming migratory properties, enter the CNS and induce paralytic disease. The lung could therefore contribute to the activation of potentially autoaggressive T cells and their transition to a migratory mode as a prerequisite to entering their target tissues and inducing autoimmune disease."

https://openalex.org/W2061752069,"Major depression is a prevalent disorder that imposes a significant burden on society, yet objective laboratory-style tests to assist in diagnosis are lacking. We employed network-based analyses of “resting state” functional neuroimaging data to ascertain group differences in the endogenous cortical activity between healthy and depressed subjects. We additionally sought to use machine learning techniques to explore the ability of these network-based measures of resting state activity to provide diagnostic information for depression. Resting state fMRI data were acquired from twenty two depressed outpatients and twenty two healthy subjects matched for age and gender. These data were anatomically parcellated and functional connectivity matrices were then derived using the linear correlations between the BOLD signal fluctuations of all pairs of cortical and subcortical regions. We characterised the hierarchical organization of these matrices using network-based matrics, with an emphasis on their mid-scale “modularity” arrangement. Whilst whole brain measures of organization did not differ between groups, a significant rearrangement of their community structure was observed. Furthermore we were able to classify individuals with a high level of accuracy using a support vector machine, primarily through the use of a modularity-based metric known as the participation index. In conclusion, the application of machine learning techniques to features of resting state fMRI network activity shows promising potential to assist in the diagnosis of major depression, now suggesting the need for validation in independent data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2113304693,"An electronic current flowing in one conductor can induce a drag current in another spatially separated conductor by means of Coulomb interactions; when these interactions are sufficiently strong the currents become equal and the drag therefore ‘perfect’, as shown here for a bilayer two-dimensional electron system. An electronic current flowing in one conductor can induce a current in another spatially separated from the first through repulsive electron–electron forces known as Coulomb interactions. The resulting 'drag current' is usually small, but it has been thought possible that in certain cases this can be of equal magnitude to the drive current. This prediction is now fulfilled with the demonstration of 'perfect' drag in a bilayer two-dimensional electron system in which a layer of electrons is coupled to another layer with an equal number of holes, together capable of forming an exciton condensate. The authors show conclusively that a current of electrons in the first layer can drive an equal current of the opposite sign in the second layer. Coulomb drag is a process whereby the repulsive interactions between electrons in spatially separated conductors enable a current flowing in one of the conductors to induce a voltage drop in the other1,2,3. If the second conductor is part of a closed circuit, a net current will flow in that circuit. The drag current is typically much smaller than the drive current owing to the heavy screening of the Coulomb interaction. There are, however, rare situations in which strong electronic correlations exist between the two conductors. For example, double quantum well systems can support exciton condensates, which consist of electrons in one well tightly bound to holes in the other4,5,6. ‘Perfect’ drag is therefore expected; a steady transport current of electrons driven through one quantum well should be accompanied by an equal current of holes in the other7. Here we demonstrate this effect, taking care to ensure that the electron–hole pairs dominate the transport and that tunnelling of charge between the quantum wells, which can readily compromise drag measurements, is negligible. We note that, from an electrical engineering perspective, perfect Coulomb drag is analogous to an electrical transformer that functions at zero frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2075667307,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a widely conserved mechanism for controlling diverse biological processes. Considering that proteolysis is irreversible, it must be precisely regulated in a context-dependent manner. Here, we show that phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5), a mitochondrial Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, is cleaved in its N-terminal transmembrane domain in response to mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) loss. This ΔΨ(m) loss-dependent cleavage of PGAM5 was mediated by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like (PARL). PARL is a mitochondrial resident rhomboid serine protease and has recently been reported to mediate the cleavage of PINK1, a mitochondrial Ser/Thr protein kinase, in healthy mitochondria with intact ΔΨ(m). Intriguingly, we found that PARL dissociated from PINK1 and reciprocally associated with PGAM5 in response to ΔΨ(m) loss. These results suggest that PARL mediates differential cleavage of PINK1 and PGAM5 depending on the health status of mitochondria. Our data provide a prototypical example of stress-dependent regulation of PARL-mediated regulated intramembrane proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2075723742,"Structurally modified superhydrophobic surfaces have become particularly desirable as stable antibacterial surfaces. Because their self-cleaning and water resistant properties prohibit bacteria growth, structurally modified superhydrophobic surfaces obviate bacterial resistance common with chemical agents, and therefore a robust and stable means to prevent bacteria growth is possible. In this study, we present a rapid fabrication method for creating such superhydrophobic surfaces in consumer hard plastic materials with resulting antibacterial effects. To replace complex fabrication materials and techniques, the initial mold is made with commodity shrink-wrap film and is compatible with large plastic roll-to-roll manufacturing and scale-up techniques. This method involves a purely structural modification free of chemical additives leading to its inherent consistency over time and successive recasting from the same molds. Finally, antibacterial properties are demonstrated in polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and polyethylene (PE) by demonstrating the prevention of gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria growth on our structured plastic surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2022142400,"Background Transcriptome sequencing can be used to determine gene sequences and transcript abundance in non-model species, and the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has greatly decreased the cost and time required for this process. Transcriptome data are especially desirable in bamboo species, as certain members constitute an economically and culturally important group of mostly semelparous plants with remarkable flowering features, yet little bamboo genomic research has been performed. Here we present, for the first time, extensive sequence and transcript abundance data for the floral transcriptome of a key bamboo species, Dendrocalamus latiflorus, obtained using the Illumina GAII sequencing platform. Our further goal was to identify patterns of gene expression during bamboo flower development. Results Approximately 96 million sequencing reads were generated and assembled de novo, yielding 146,395 high quality unigenes with an average length of 461 bp. Of these, 80,418 were identified as putative homologs of annotated sequences in the public protein databases, of which 290 were associated with the floral transition and 47 were related to flower development. Digital abundance analysis identified 26,529 transcripts differentially enriched between two developmental stages, young flower buds and older developing flowers. Unigenes found at each stage were categorized according to their putative functional categories. These sequence and putative function data comprise a resource for future investigation of the floral transition and flower development in bamboo species. Conclusions Our results present the first broad survey of a bamboo floral transcriptome. Although it will be necessary to validate the functions carried out by these genes, these results represent a starting point for future functional research on D. latiflorus and related species."
https://openalex.org/W2005611806,"During tumor progression, EphA2 receptor can gain ligand-independent pro-oncogenic functions due to Akt activation and reduced ephrin-A ligand engagement. The effects can be reversed by ligand stimulation, which triggers the intrinsic tumor suppressive signaling pathways of EphA2 including inhibition of PI3/Akt and Ras/ERK pathways. These observations argue for development of small molecule agonists for EphA2 as potential tumor intervention agents. Through virtual screening and cell-based assays, we report here the identification and characterization of doxazosin as a novel small molecule agonist for EphA2 and EphA4, but not for other Eph receptors tested. NMR studies revealed extensive contacts of doxazosin with EphA2/A4, recapitulating both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions recently found in the EphA2/ephrin-A1 complex. Clinically used as an α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Cardura®) for treating hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia, doxazosin activated EphA2 independent of α1-adrenoreceptor. Similar to ephrin-A1, doxazosin inhibited Akt and ERK kinase activities in an EphA2-dependent manner. Treatment with doxazosin triggered EphA2 receptor internalization, and suppressed haptotactic and chemotactic migration of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma cells. Moreover, in an orthotopic xenograft model, doxazosin reduced distal metastasis of human prostate cancer cells and prolonged survival in recipient mice. To our knowledge, doxazosin is the first small molecule agonist of a receptor tyrosine kinase that is capable of inhibiting malignant behaviors in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036114983,"Proteins that contain long disordered regions are prevalent in the proteome and frequently associated with diseases. However, the mechanisms by which such intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) recognize their targets are not well understood. Here, we report the first experimental investigation of the interaction kinetics of the nuclear co-activator binding domain of CREB-binding protein and the activation domain from the p160 transcriptional co-activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors. Both protein domains are intrinsically disordered in the free state and synergistically fold upon binding each other. Using the stopped-flow technique, we found that the binding reaction is fast, with an association rate constant of 3 × 107 m−1 s−1 at 277 K. Mutation of a conserved buried intermolecular salt bridge showed that electrostatics govern the rapid association. Furthermore, upon mutation of the salt bridge or at high salt concentration, an additional kinetic phase was detected (∼20 and ∼40 s−1, respectively, at 277 K), suggesting that the salt bridge may steer formation of the productive bimolecular complex in an intramolecular step. Finally, we directly measured slow kinetics for the IDP domains (∼1 s−1 at 277 K) related to conformational transitions upon binding. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the interaction involves several steps and accumulation of intermediate states. Our data are consistent with an induced fit mechanism, in agreement with previous simulations. We propose that the slow transitions may be a consequence of the multipartner interactions of IDPs.

One of the most comprehensive studies on the kinetics of IDP-target interactions was conducted by Wright and colleagues (12Sugase K. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Mechanism of coupled folding and binding of an intrinsically disordered protein.Nature. 2007; 447: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) a few years ago, where they used NMR relaxation dispersion experiments to investigate the coupled folding and binding of the intrinsically disordered pKID from the cAMP-regulated transcription factor (CREB) to the three-helix bundle KIX domain from the co-activator CREB-binding protein. They showed that pKID binds KIX through an induced fit mechanism and were able to identify and characterize intermediate states along the binding reaction pathway, providing key insights into the mechanisms of molecular recognition. However, despite the growing identification of proteins that are intrinsically disordered (13Sickmeier M. Hamilton J.A. LeGall T. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Tantos A. Szabo B. Tompa P. Chen J.

In this work, we have investigated the kinetics of the specific interaction between the nuclear co-activator binding domain (NCBD) of CREB-binding protein and the activation domain from the p160 transcriptional co-activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (ACTR) (see Fig. 1). Both are intrinsically disordered in the free state and synergistically fold upon complex formation to form a well folded structure (8Demarest S.J. Martinez-Yamout M. Chung J. Chen H. Xu W.

This results in a significant unfavorable conformational entropy change for binding, which is also reflected in the total entropy change upon complex formation, obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry (15Ebert M.O.

Clearly, disorder is important in modulating the binding free energy. However, characterization of the binding kinetics is an essential part in the elucidation of the binding mechanism of the interaction between NCBD and ACTR. Therefore, to shed light on the binding mechanism, we have performed fluorescence-based binding kinetic experiments. We show that the initial association between NCBD and ACTR is fast but that subsequent slow conformational changes are necessary to reach the most stable bound ground state. The DNA sequence of human ACTR (residues 1018–1088) was purchased from GENEART (Germany), whereas human NCBD (2058–2116) (8Demarest S.J. Martinez-Yamout M. Chung J. Chen H. Xu W. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E.

The final construct was made up of an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged lipoyl fusion protein followed by a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) and finally the ACTR or NCBD sequence. Mutants were generated by inverted PCR. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen) were grown in 2× TY medium at 37 °C and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when A600 reached 0.7–0.8 to overexpress the fusion protein at 18 °C overnight. Cells were lysed by sonication followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter (Sarstedt), and then loaded onto a nickel-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) column. After washing the column with binding buffer (40 mm Tris pH = 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), the His-tagged fusion protein was eluted using buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The fusion protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris pH = 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, after which the lipoyl protein was cleaved off using thrombin (GE Healthcare) and separated from ACTR or NCBD by loading the solution onto the nickel-Sepharose fast flow column. The flow-through, containing ACTR or NCBD, was subjected to a reversed phase chromatography step, using C-8 (ACTR or NCBD) or C-18 (NCBD only) columns (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences). The identity of purified ACTR or NCBD was verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The concentration of NCBDY2108W and NCBDWT was determined by measuring the Trp and Tyr absorbance at 280 nm, respectively. For wild-type ACTR (ACTRWT), which does not contain any Trp or Tyr, the concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 205 nm using an extinction coefficient obtained from amino acid analysis. The kinetics of NCBD/ACTR association was characterized using an upgraded SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Measurements were performed at T = 277 or 283 K, in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. Stopped-flow experiments at high salt conditions were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 0.93 m NaCl, whereas binding kinetic measurements at high trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 m TMAO. Excitation was at 280 nm, and the change in fluorescence upon binding was monitored using a 320-nm long-pass cutoff filter. Association rate constants (konapp) were determined by varying the concentration of ACTRWT while keeping the concentration of NCBDY2108W constant at 1 μm. In the case of ACTRQ1042W/NCBDWT and ACTRL1076W/NCBDWT, konapp was determined by varying the concentration of NCBDWT, with the concentration of the Trp-ACTR variants held constant at 1 μm (277 K) or 3 μm (283 K). Overall dissociation rate constants (koffapp) were determined using displacement experiments. For NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT, the koffapp was measured by mixing a preformed NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT complex solution (1.1–2.2 μm NCBDY2108W mixed with 1–2 μm ACTRWT) with an excess of [NCBDWT] and monitoring the change in fluorescence. For NCBDWT/ACTRWT, koffapp was determined by mixing a preformed NCBDWT/ACTRWT (2–3 μm NCBDWT mixed with 2 μm ACTRWT) with an excess of [NCBDY2108W]. For ACTRQ1042W/NCBDWT and ACTRL1076W/NCBDWT, the preformed complex solution contained 2.2 μm ACTRQ1042W or ACTRL1076W mixed with 2 μm NCBDWT, and koffapp was obtained by adding an excess of [ACTRWT]. The fluorescence change upon binding for the salt bridge mutants, ACTRD1068L and NCBDR2104L, was very different from that of the ACTRWT/NCBDY2108W, and two other optical filters were used in the experiments, a 330-nm band-pass filter and a 355-nm cutoff filter, respectively. CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control system. A cuvette with a path length of 1 mm was used, and far-UV spectra were recorded at T = 298 K, from 260 to 200 nm with a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and a 2-s response time. Sample conditions were 10–23 μm protein in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. All spectra were corrected for the contribution from the buffer. CD-monitored thermal denaturation was performed by following the signal at 222 nm, using a scan speed of 1 K/min. Equilibrium measurements were carried out on an SLM 4800 spectrofluorometer (SLM instruments). Experiments were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. For binding experiments between NCBD and ACTR, Trp excitation was at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm, whereas for 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) fluorescence, experiments were performed at T = 298 K, excitation was at 350 nm, and the fluorescence emission was recorded from 400 to 662.5 nm. Trp residues greatly facilitate the use of fluorescence-based methods to study the kinetics of binding with high sensitivity. However, neither NCBD nor ACTR contain any Trp. Early attempts were made to see whether the fluorescence of the sole tyrosine, Tyr-2108, in NCBD could be used to monitor the binding to ACTRWT. However, only a small fluorescence change could be observed with the stopped-flow technique, and a high concentration of NCBD (>10 μm) was needed to obtain reliable observed rate constants. We therefore performed a screening where we made single amino acid substitutions, replacing a certain residue with a Trp at different locations in NCBD. These Trp variants where then evaluated on the basis of binding kinetics and of their free and bound state behavior using CD spectroscopy and equilibrium fluorescence measurements to determine which of these engineered Trp variants would be most suitable as a model for wild-type NCBD (NCBDWT). Out of these, the replacement of Tyr with Trp at position 2108 (NCBDY2108W) resulted in an NCBD variant that exhibited the largest fluorescence change upon binding of ACTRWT (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2A). The apparent dissociation rate constant, koffapp, as well as its temperature dependence (data not shown), as determined by displacement experiments, was the same for NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT and NCBDWT/ACTRWT (Table 1). The CD spectrum of NCBDY2108W was very similar to that of NCBDWT in terms of both shape and magnitude of the CD signal (Fig. 3A). The high similarity of the CD properties is also extended to the NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT and NCBDWT/ACTRWT complexes (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CD-monitored thermal denaturation of NCBDY2108W showed an apparent noncooperative transition similar to that of NCBDWT (Fig. 3C) and in good agreement with previous studies (14Demarest S.J. Deechongkit S. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E.

The thermal denaturations of the bimolecular complexes, NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT and NCBDWT/ACTRWT, respectively, show that both have a clear transition, with a melting temperature of around 52 °C, reflecting well folded structures of the complexes (Fig. 3D). In addition, both NCBDY2108W and NCBDWT bind the fluorescent hydrophobic probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity and with a blue-shifted emission, which is characteristic for proteins with molten globular properties. Finally, kinetic binding experiments using high concentrations of NCBDWT and monitoring Tyr fluorescence suffered from a low signal-to-noise ratio, but were consistent with those of NCBDY2108W. Taken together, NCBDY2108W proved to be a good pseudo-wild-type of NCBDWT and was therefore subjected to a detailed kinetic study.TABLE 1Binding kinetics of NCBD/ACTR variants in 20 mm phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl at two different temperaturesNCBD/ACTR variantT = 277 KT = 283 Kkoffappkonapp × 107λ3koffappkonapp × 107λ3s−1m−1 s−1s−1s−1m−1 s−1s−1NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT2.6 ± 0.042.8 ± 0.11.15 ± 0.074.5 ± 0.045.9 ± 0.11.88 ± 0.04NCBDWT/ACTRWT2.6 ± 0.1NV4.4 ± 0.5NVNCBDWT/ACTRQ1042W1.5 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.2NV2.9 ± 0.19.8 ± 1.0NVNCBDWT/ACTRL1076W3.3 ± 0.2aTwo dissociation phases were observed.2.3 ± 0.2NV6.9 ± 0.5aTwo dissociation phases were observed.7.4 ± 0.6NV0.5 ± 0.03aTwo dissociation phases were observed.1.0 ± 0.2aTwo dissociation phases were observed.a Two dissociation phases were observed.

The determined apparent association rate constants for ACTRQ1042W/NCBDWT and ACTRL1076W/NCBDWT, at 277 K, were very similar to those of NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT (Table 1), which further validates the use of NCBDY2108W as a representation of NCBDWT. We measured the kinetics of association of NCBD/ACTR using the stopped-flow technique and by varying the concentration of ACTRWT and monitoring the fluorescence change of NCBDY2108W. Alternatively, NCBDWT was varied at a constant concentration of ACTRQ1042W or ACTRL1076W, respectively. Because of the fast binding kinetics, the experiments were performed at low temperatures, 283 and 277 K, to accurately determine the observed rate constant, kobs. The binding kinetics of NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT was biphasic with a fast phase with positive amplitude and a slow phase with negative amplitude (Fig. 4A) at 20 mm phosphate (pH = 7.4), 150 mm NaCl. The concentration dependences of both kinetic phases were analyzed (Fig. 4B). The fast phase increased linearly with ACTRWT concentration with a slope of 3 × 107 m−1 s−1, which is the apparent association rate constant at 277 K (Table 1). The slow phase remained rather constant with ACTRWT concentration with a rate constant ∼1.2 s−1. The apparent overall dissociation constant, koffapp, was 2.6 s−1 at 277 K (Fig. 5), as determined in a displacement experiment. In a multistep binding reaction, this experimental parameter is a function of all first order rate constants, and it is normally equal to or smaller than the lowest microscopic off-rate constant on the reaction pathway. Biphasic dissociation kinetics was observed for the complex between ACTRL1076W and NCBDWT, i.e. when the Trp was placed in the C-terminal helix of ACTR, with koffapp = 3.3 and 0.5 s−1, respectively. The initial association of NCBD and ACTR is thus very rapid, and the apparent konapp is among the fastest that has been determined so far for an IDP system and the first to be characterized for a system where both binding partners are IDPs. A simple extrapolation using the values of konapp, determined at 277 and 283 K to the physiological temperature 310 K, shows that the binding reaction approaches the diffusion-controlled limit, with a kon ∼109 m−1 s−1. The temperature dependences of koffapp for NCBDY2108W/ACTRWT, NCBDWT/ACTRWT, NCBDWT/ACTRL1076W, and NCBDWT/ACTRQ1042W are all similar. The koffapp at physiological temperature (310 K) was determined to be around 130 s−1 for NCBDWT/ACTRWT. We also performed measurements at high salt concentration to investigate the role of electrostatics in the binding reaction. At 0.9 m NaCl, an additional kinetic phase was detected. This phase was rather constant with ACTRWT concentration (within the range it could be accurately fitted) with a value of ∼40 s−1 (Fig. 6). Interestingly, both the fast and the slow phases were not significantly affected by the addition of salt (2 × 107 m−1 s−1 and 0.9 s−1, respectively). This suggested that the salt affected a particular step in the binding reaction that was too fast to detect at low salt. We note, however, that we could not detect the 40 s−1 phase when an excess of NCBDY2108W was mixed rapidly with ACTRWT. The reason might be that the higher total fluorescence in this experiment obscured the phase. The importance of a highly conserved and buried salt bridge in the NCBD/ACTR complex, formed between Asp-1068 in ACTR and Arg-2104 in NCBD, has been the subject of an experimental mutational analysis by Wright and colleagues (14Demarest S.J. Deechongkit S. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Packing, specificity, and mutability at the binding interface between the p160 co-activator and CREB-binding protein.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), where both Asp-1068 and Arg-2104 were mutated to leucine, thus replacing the salt bridge with a hydrophobic interaction. Further, in a recent molecular dynamics simulation study (17Zhang W. Ganguly D. Chen J. Residual structures, conformational fluctuations, and electrostatic interactions in the synergistic folding of two intrinsically disordered proteins.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002353Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it was concluded that this salt bridge stabilizes an on-pathway intermediate toward the bound state. To test whether the 40 s−1 phase detected at high salt concentration corresponded to formation of this salt bridge, we made the mutant D1068L in ACTRWT and R2104L in NCBDY2108W and performed binding experiments at high and low salt. All three kinetic phases were affected by the D1068L/R2104L mutations. In addition, the fluorescence properties were modulated such that the sign of the amplitude for the fast phase turned negative (Fig. 7). At low salt, the concentration dependence of the first phase yielded a konapp value of 1.5 × 106 m−1 s−1, i.e. 20-fold lower than that of the wild-type domains (Table 1). The second phase λ2 was now clearly hyperbolic, with a λ2max value of around 20 s−1 (Fig. 7 and Table 2). The presence of the slow phase λ3 was not clear. It showed a decrease (0.2 s−1), along with a small amplitude, such that it approached a phase related to photobleaching. Further, fitting of all three phases simultaneously yielded a k−3 value that was much lower than koffapp from a separate displacement experiment (3 s−1). On the other hand, fitting of a simpler two-step scheme to the salt bridge mutant gave parameters that were consistent with both koffapp and overall Kd value (Table 2, Figs. 2B and 7). At 0.9 m NaCl, the amplitude of the fast phase λ1 decreased such that a quantitative analysis was difficult. However, we estimated the slope of the phase, konapp, to 0.2 × 106 m−1 s−1, showing that other residues than Asp-1068 in ACTRWT and Arg-2104 in NCBDY2108W influence binding electrostatics.TABLE 2Estimated microscopic rate constants from global fitting of experimental binding kinetics data obtained for the NCBDR2104L/ACTRD1068L mutant complex at 277 Kk1k−1k2k−2Scheme 1aSee Fig. 7B.1.5 ± 0.2 × 106bUnits are in m−1 s−1.48 ± 3.716 ± 2.02.8 ± 0.2Scheme 2aSee Fig. 7B.19 ± 2.250 ± 3.51.3 ± 0.2 × 106bUnits are in m−1 s−1.2.8 ± 0.2a See Fig. 7B.b Units are in m−1 s−1. Open table in a new tab It was shown previously that NCBDR2104L displays a more cooperative urea denaturation than NCBDWT (14Demarest S.J. Deechongkit S. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Packing, specificity, and mutability at the binding interface between the p160 co-activator and CREB-binding protein.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with an unfolding transition that occurs at about 1 m higher urea concentration. Furthermore, the magnitude of the CD signal at 222 nm of the unbound NCBDR2104L corresponded to a 25% increase in helix content when compared with NCBDWT, a result that was corroborated by NMR experiments (14Demarest S.J. Deechongkit S. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Packing, specificity, and mutability at the binding interface between the p160 co-activator and CREB-binding protein.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); thus, the ground state structures are different for NCBDWT and NCBDR2104L, which complicates the kinetic analysis. Although the kinetic analysis of the D1068L/R2104L double mutation is complex, it is clear that these charged residues contribute to the high association rate constant observed for the binding of ACTR and NCBD. The most likely explanation for the appearance of the middle phase λ2 is slowing down of an intramolecular step that is facilitated by formation of the salt bridge because the phase appears both at high salt (with wild-type domains) as well as upon mutation of the salt bridge.

https://openalex.org/W2103233191,"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease appears to be strongly linked to the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and, especially, formation of soluble Aβ1-42 oligomers. It was recently demonstrated that the cellular prion protein, PrP(C), binds with high affinity to these oligomers, acting as a putative receptor that mediates at least some of their neurotoxic effects. Here we show that the soluble (i.e. glycophosphatidylinositol anchor-free) prion protein and its N-terminal fragment have a strong effect on the aggregation pathway of Aβ1-42, inhibiting its assembly into amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, the prion protein prevents formation of spherical oligomers that normally occur during Aβ fibrillogenesis, acting as a potent inhibitor of Aβ1-42 toxicity as assessed in experiments with neuronal cell culture. These findings may provide a molecular level foundation to explain the reported protective action of the physiologically released N-terminal N1 fragment of PrP(C) against Aβ neurotoxicity. They also suggest a novel approach to pharmacological intervention in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020972813,"The timing of lung maturation is controlled precisely by complex genetic and cellular programs. Lung immaturity following preterm birth frequently results in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and Broncho-Pulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), which are leading causes of mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Mechanisms synchronizing gestational length and lung maturation remain to be elucidated. In this study, we designed a genome-wide mRNA expression time-course study from E15.5 to Postnatal Day 0 (PN0) using lung RNAs from C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J mice that differ in gestational length by ∼30 hr (B6<A/J). Comprehensive bioinformatics and functional genomics analyses were used to identify key regulators, bioprocesses and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation. We identified both temporal and strain dependent gene expression patterns during lung maturation. For time dependent changes, cell adhesion, vasculature development, and lipid metabolism/transport were major bioprocesses induced during the saccular stage of lung development at E16.5-E17.5. CEBPA, PPARG, VEGFA, CAV1 and CDH1 were found to be key signaling and transcriptional regulators of these processes. Innate defense/immune responses were induced at later gestational ages (E18.5-20.5), STAT1, AP1, and EGFR being important regulators of these responses. Expression of RNAs associated with the cell cycle and chromatin assembly was repressed during prenatal lung maturation and was regulated by FOXM1, PLK1, chromobox, and high mobility group families of transcription factors. Strain dependent lung mRNA expression differences peaked at E18.5. At this time, mRNAs regulating surfactant and innate immunity were more abundantly expressed in lungs of B6 (short gestation) than in A/J (long gestation) mice, while expression of genes involved in chromatin assembly and histone modification were expressed at lower levels in B6 than in A/J mice. The present study systemically mapped key regulators, bioprocesses, and transcriptional networks controlling lung maturation, providing the basis for new therapeutic strategies to enhance lung function in preterm infants."

Studies by Richardson and co-workers (18Chaston T.B. Lovejoy D.B. Watts R.N. Richardson D.R. Examination of the antiproliferative activity of iron chelators. Multiple cellular targets and the different mechanism of action of triapine compared with desferrioxamine and the potent pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazine analogue 311′.Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 402-414PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that cellular iron uptake and efflux are minimally perturbed in 3-AP-treated cultured cells in the first hours of exposure. These interesting findings prompted us to undertake a detailed investigation to understand the mechanism of 3-AP-promoted inhibition of β2 in vitro and in cell culture in the early stages of inhibitor treatment where cell viability remains high, cell cycle is not perturbed, and downstream cytotoxicity is not yet apparent. Our studies in vitro have investigated the effect of 3-AP and its iron complexes on RNR activity, depletion of its essential Y·, and iron loss from the [(FeIII2-Y·)(FeIII2)] cluster of β2 alone and in the active holo-complex [(α2)m(β2] in a non-cycling or cycling state. The relative rates of Y· loss and iron loss have been measured and vary dependent upon the states of β2 (β2 alone, cycling- or non-cycling holo-complex). In all cases, however, Y· loss precedes iron loss, suggesting that β2-specific inhibition can be explained by the direct reduction of Y·. These data implicate Fe(II)-(3-AP) as the reductant that can rapidly reduce Y·. The observations that Y· loss occurs in the presence and, importantly, in the absence of O2 and that Y· levels are unaffected by O2̇̄ or H2O2 and the failure to detect oxidative modifications by additional studies using OxyblotTM technology and mass spectrometry on inhibited β2 rule out ROS as the basis for Y· reduction. We have also investigated the effects of 3-AP in K562, COS-1, and hydroxyurea (HU)-resistant TA3 cells on β2 activity in cell lysates, 55Fe content of β2 immunoprecipitated from 55Fe-labeled cells, the stability of the inhibited β2, and the Y· levels in intact cells. Furthermore, OxyblotTM technology of the whole protein pool failed to reveal differences between 3-AP-treated and untreated cells. Together with in vitro data, the rapid and potent RNR inhibition in cells within 30 min of 3-AP treatment is most consistent with the formation of Fe(II)-(3-AP) from free 3-AP with intracellular Fe, which then engages in the direct reduction of the essential Y· of β2. The inhibition occurs in the period where cell viability remains high, and the activity of α2 and other abundant iron-dependent enzymes such as aconitase, a sensitive indicator of oxidative stress, are maintained. These findings further underscore the specificity of 3-AP-promoted β2-specific inhibition and downplay nonspecific indirect models discussed above. They provide initial insight into understanding how inhibition of β2 is involved in the cytotoxic effects of 3-AP. All in vitro studies were performed on hRNR subunits recombinantly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (10Wang J. Lohman G.J. Stubbe J.

Specific activities for CDP reduction were 700–890 nmol min−1mg−1 for α and 3000–4100 nmol min−1mg−1 for β containing 0.9–1.2 Y·/β2 and 3.6 iron/β2.

However, extensions of these approaches to two or higher-dimensional data, such as images, are much less common. Here, we reduce this gap by applying the ideas of the permutation entropy combined with a relative entropic index. We build up a numerical procedure that can be easily implemented to evaluate the complexity of two or higher-dimensional patterns. We work out this method in different scenarios where numerical experiments and empirical data were taken into account. Specifically, we have applied the method to i) fractal landscapes generated numerically where we compare our measures with the Hurst exponent; ii) liquid crystal textures where nematic-isotropic-nematic phase transitions were properly identified; iii) 12 characteristic textures of liquid crystals where the different values show that the method can distinguish different phases; iv) and Ising surfaces where our method identified the critical temperature and also proved to be stable."

Relevant clinical data and basic lifestyle data were available for all patients. The tissue samples were DNA extracted and real-time PCR assays were used for viral detection. The highest prevalence, 10% (5/54), was found for EBV. MCV, HPyV6, and HPyV7 were detected in single patient samples (2% each), while WUV, KIV, JCV, BKV, LPV, SV40, TSV and CMV were not detected in the 54 breast cancer specimens analysed here. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the potential role of viruses, and particularly EBV, in breast carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082438035,"PRMT6 belongs to the family of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase (PRMT) enzymes that catalyze the methylation of guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues. PRMT6 has been shown to modify the tail of histone H3, but the in vivo function of PRMT6 is largely unknown. Here, we show that PRMT6 regulates cell cycle progression. Knockdown of PRMT6 expression in the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS results in an accumulation of cells at the G2 checkpoint. Loss of PRMT6 coincides with upregulation of p21 and p27, two members of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. Gene expression and promoter analysis show that p21 and p27 are direct targets of PRMT6, which involves methylation of arginine-2 of histone H3. Our findings imply arginine methylation of histones by PRMT6 in cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2018691246,"Signaling by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) has been implicated in early lung development, adult lung homeostasis and tissue-injury repair. However, the precise mechanism of action and the spatio-temporal pattern of BMP-signaling during these processes remains inadequately described. To address this, we have utilized a transgenic line harboring a BMP-responsive eGFP-reporter allele (BRE-eGFP) to construct the first detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation during lung development, homeostasis and adult-lung injury repair. We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury."
https://openalex.org/W1970761716,"Yeast respond to increased cytosolic iron by activating the transcription factor Yap5 increasing transcription of CCC1, which encodes a vacuolar iron importer. Using a genetic screen to identify genes involved in Yap5 iron sensing, we discovered that a mutation in SSQ1, which encodes a mitochondrial chaperone involved in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, prevented expression of Yap5 target genes. We demonstrated that mutation or reduced expression of other genes involved in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (YFH1, ISU1) prevented induction of the Yap5 response. We took advantage of the iron-dependent catalytic activity of Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase expressed in yeast to measure changes in cytosolic iron. We determined that reductions in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis did not affect the activity of cytosolic gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. We show that loss of activity of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly complex proteins or deletion of cytosolic glutaredoxins did not reduce expression of Yap5 target genes. These results suggest that the high iron transcriptional response, as well as the low iron transcriptional response, senses iron-sulfur clusters. Yeast respond to increased cytosolic iron by activating the transcription factor Yap5 increasing transcription of CCC1, which encodes a vacuolar iron importer. Using a genetic screen to identify genes involved in Yap5 iron sensing, we discovered that a mutation in SSQ1, which encodes a mitochondrial chaperone involved in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, prevented expression of Yap5 target genes. We demonstrated that mutation or reduced expression of other genes involved in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster synthesis (YFH1, ISU1) prevented induction of the Yap5 response. We took advantage of the iron-dependent catalytic activity of Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase expressed in yeast to measure changes in cytosolic iron. We determined that reductions in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis did not affect the activity of cytosolic gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. We show that loss of activity of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly complex proteins or deletion of cytosolic glutaredoxins did not reduce expression of Yap5 target genes. These results suggest that the high iron transcriptional response, as well as the low iron transcriptional response, senses iron-sulfur clusters. Yeast respond to changes in the intracellular concentration of transition metal levels by altering transcription of genes that encode proteins required for metal acquisition, storage, or usage. Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to iron deprivation by inducing the expression of about 20 genes collectively referred to as the iron regulon (for review, see Refs. 1Kaplan J. McVey Ward D.

These genes encode cell surface and vacuolar elemental iron transporters, cell surface siderophore transporters, proteins involved in iron-independent metabolic pathways, and proteins that destabilize transcripts involved in iron storage and metabolism. The expression of these genes is regulated by the transcription factor Aft1 and to a lesser extent by the paralogous Aft2. Aft(s) reside in the cytosol and translocate into the nucleus in response to low iron where they occupy the promoters of iron regulon genes. Studies suggest that Aft1 responds to changes in mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster production and export, for which iron is an essential substrate (3Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. Transcription of the yeast iron regulon does not respond directly to iron but rather to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Defects in the assembly of cytosolic Fe-S cluster-containing proteins do not activate the iron regulon (4Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R.

The precise role of Fe-S clusters in regulating the iron regulon remains to be clarified, but it is thought that the cytosolic glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4, which can obtain Fe-S clusters independent of the cytosolic Fe-S machinery (5Mühlenhoff U.

Yap5 is constitutively present in the nucleus, where it occupies the promoters of at least three genes (CCC1, TYW1, GRX4) (8Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J.

Most notably, CCC1, which encodes the vacuolar iron importer, plays a major role in regulating cytosolic iron concentration (8Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J.

The activation domain of Yap5 contains 7 cysteines important for iron sensing as mutation of those cysteines reduces transcription. Iron is known to participate in redox reactions, which can affect cysteine sulfhydryls. We determined that Yap5 was not activated by oxygen radicals as H2O2 addition did not activate Yap5 transcription and high iron under anaerobic conditions activated Yap5 transcription (8Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We utilized a genetic screen to identify the mechanism of high iron induction of Yap5. We found that Yap5 activation is dependent on the mitochondrial production of Fe-S clusters as Yap5-dependent transcription does not occur in the absence of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis. We showed that reductions in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis do not decrease cytosolic iron levels. We also show that the cytosolic Fe-S assembly complex is not involved for Fe-S cluster dependent Yap5 activation. The wild type strains DY150 or DY1457 (W303 background) and deletion strains were used for most experiments. The Δccc1 and Δyfh1 strains were described previously (3Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M.

The Δisu1 strain was generated in a DY150 background by PCR amplifying the deletion construct with the KanMX marker from the homozygous diploid deletion collection (Research Genetics, Stanford, CA). Deletion strains of Δgrx3Δgrx4 were derived from BY4742 (S288C background), and the GalDRE2 and GalNAR1 were gifts from Dr. Winge (University of Utah). The double deletion Δccc1Δyfh1 strain was generated by PCR amplification of the CCC1 deletion construct and recombination into the background strain. SSQ1 was deleted in DY1640 diploid cells by PCR amplification of the KanMX marker from the heterozygous diploid deletion collection (Research Genetics) and transformed with a plasmid containing MET3-SSQ1.

Cells were plated on 200 μm iron-containing plates and exposed to UV for 12 s. Candidates were selected by a β-galactosidase color assay and −HIS plate spot assay. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by a kinetic assay (7Pujol-Carrion N. Belli G. Herrero E.

Protein determinations were performed using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and enzyme activity is expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein. Blue color colony assays were performed by transferring fresh yeast colonies to a nitrocellulose membrane, cells were permeabilized by freeze/thaw in liquid nitrogen, and color was developed by adding X-gal overnight at 30 °C (12Hintner J.P.

First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a SuperScript III kit from Invitrogen. Real-time PCR was performed using primers for the detection of CCC1 transcription (5′-tcggtggcggttatctactt-3′ and 5′-accacccacaacaaccattt-3′), primers for the detection of FET3 (5′-tca cag ttt cga tcc gga caa cca-3′ and 5′-tcc ac gaga aca aga ccc aaa cct-3′), and primers for the detection of TYW1 (5′-aac aaa tgg tgg cga aag ac-3′ and 5′-tgg atg aac atg cca aag aa-3′). Expression levels were normalized to the internal control CMD1, as described previously (8Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For Western blot assays, cell extracts were prepared by homogenization with glass beads in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl lysate buffer with 1× protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich). Mouse anti-FLAG antibody and mouse anti-PGK antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-Yap5 (1:500) was generated in our laboratory using purified Yap5 as an antigen. Mouse anti-carboxypeptidase Y (1:3000) was obtained from Mitosciences Inc. (Eugene, OR). Mouse anti-HIS-G (1:5000) was obtained from Invitrogen. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as secondary antibody. Western blots were developed using Western Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (GDO) plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Stolz from Stuttgart University, Germany. The gene was cloned into yeast vector pRS426 using SpeI and BamHI restriction sites, and its expression was under the control of ADH1 promoter. A FLAG tag was added to the carboxyl terminus of GDO. Plasmids were transformed into yeast cells, grown on suitable selective medium to exponential growth phase, and harvested by centrifugation. Transformed cells were washed with deionized water and lysed by glass bead agitation in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich)). The cell lysates were then subjected to GDO activity assay as described previously (12Hintner J.P. Lechner C. Riegert U. Kuhm A.E. Storm T. Reemtsma T. Stolz A.

The assay mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mm 2,3-dihydroxy-benzoic acid (gentisic acid) as substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was monitored at 340 nm, and enzyme activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 10.2 cm−1mm−1. The activity was expressed as nmol of substrate converted per minute per mg of protein. We designed a genetic screen to identify genes involved in iron-dependent Yap5 transcription. We engineered a Δccc1 strain that contained two independent Yap5 reporters. The strain was deleted for HIS3 and contained an integrated HIS3 gene under the control of a GAL1 promoter (Fig. 1). This strain also contained a plasmid-based chimeric transcription factor composed of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the cysteine-rich activation domain of YAP5. The fusion protein encoded by this plasmid responds to iron and will induce GAL1 promoter-regulated genes (8Li L. Bagley D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Yap5 is an iron-responsive transcriptional activator that regulates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, this strain will be a HIS auxotroph in the absence of iron-induced Gal4-Yap5 activity. The second reporter was an integrated CCC1-lacZ construct containing the CCC1 promoter fused to the lacZ gene. Incubation of the strain in low iron results in cells auxotrophic for histidine, which do not express β-galactosidase. The addition of iron resulted in HIS prototrophy and expression of β-galactosidase. The use of two different reporter constructs, which respond to two different transcription factors, ensures that any identified mutation must be in a common iron-sensing system rather than in an individual transcription factor/reporter system. The engineered cells were UV-mutagenized and exposed to high iron, and LacZ-negative cells (“white” cells) were selected for LacZ activity and then examined for HIS auxotrophy. Candidates that showed decreased CCC1-lacZ activity and HIS auxotrophy were selected for further study. One candidate, UV mutant 109b, showed these phenotypes (Fig. 2A). The phenotypes were recessive as determined by diploid analysis (data not shown).FIGURE 2Identification of a mutant SSQ1 that affects Yap5 induction of CCC1. A, serial dilutions of the parental strain and UV mutant (UV mut) 109b cells were spotted on plates in the presence or absence of histidine. Cells were grown for 3 days, and then a β-galactosidase assay was performed. B, parental, UV mutant 109b, and UV mutant 109b, transformed with library plasmid 16 (lib #16), were grown overnight in low iron medium, 500 μm iron was added for 2.5 h, and a quantitative β-galactosidase assay performed. Cell protein was determined, and the data are expressed as specific activity. The data are the average of at least three experiments and are presented as the mean ± S.D.

Cell protein was determined, and the β-galactosidase assay data are expressed as specific activity. The data are the average of at least three experiments and are presented as the mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UV mutant 109b was transformed with a LEU2 genomic library and selected for cells that could express β-galactosidase and grow on −HIS medium (Fig. 2B). Library plasmid 16 conferred iron-dependent growth on −HIS plates and restored iron-dependent β-galactosidase activity. The library clone 16 plasmid was recovered and sequenced, and subcloning identified SSQ1 as the gene responsible for complementation. We sequenced the chromosomal copy of SSQ1 in UV mutant 109b and identified a missense mutation, which resulted in an amino acid substitution L217S. Deletion of SSQ1 in our parental strain W303 resulted in lethality, suggesting that the missense mutation was hypomorphic. The finding that the mutation was a hypomorph might explain why complementation was partial, although it is possible that there was a second mutation in the strain. The observation that a conditional shut-off of SSQ1 phenocopies the inhibition of Yap5-mediated transcription, however, ensures that SSQ1 is the gene responsible for the phenotype. SSQ1 is a nuclear gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein chaperone that plays an important role in the mitochondrial synthesis of Fe-S clusters (13Lutz T. Westermann B. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. The mitochondrial proteins Ssq1 and Jac1 are required for the assembly of iron sulfur clusters in mitochondria.J. Mol.

Ssq1, a mitochondrial Hsp70 involved in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) center biogenesis: similarities to and differences from its bacterial counterpart.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Decreased levels of Ssq1 compromise Fe-S cluster synthesis, leading to decreased activities of Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes, an inability to grow on respiratory substrates, and induction of the iron regulon. All three of these phenotypes are seen in mutant 109b (data not shown). The inability to induce CCC1-lacZ in mutant 109b and the inability to grow on −HIS medium were complemented by transformation with an SSQ1-containing plasmid (Fig. 2C). As shown below, reduced levels of other proteins required for mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis prevent iron-induced expression of Yap5 target genes. There are a number of explanations for why cells defective in Fe-S cluster synthesis fail to induce Yap5 target genes. Notably, defects in Fe-S cluster synthesis lead to increased mitochondrial iron, and mitochondrial iron sequestration may result in low cytosolic iron, preventing the high iron transcriptional response. Previously, we suggested that cytosolic iron is not low in cells with defects in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis (3Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. Transcription of the yeast iron regulon does not respond directly to iron but rather to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a result confirmed by others (15Irazusta V. Obis E. Moreno-Cermeño A. Cabiscol E. Ros J. Tamarit J. Yeast frataxin mutants display decreased superoxide dismutase activity crucial to promote protein oxidative damage.Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To measure cytosolic iron, we utilized a mutant enzyme involved in ergosterol synthesis. Erg25 is a methyl sterol oxidase required for the demethylation of 4,4,-dimethylzymosterol to zymosterol. Erg25 is a putative iron-containing enzyme, and the mutant Erg25-2 showed decreased activity when cytosolic iron levels were decreased (16Li L. Kaplan J. Characterization of yeast methyl sterol oxidase (ERG25) and identification of a human homologue.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Loss of Fe-S cluster synthesis did not affect the activity of the Erg25-2, suggesting that cytosolic iron was not decreased. The measurement of Erg25 activity, however, was indirect and was based on the accumulation of sterol intermediates in intact cells. Further, the methyl sterol oxidase enzymatic reaction requires mitochondrial-produced heme, which in turn is dependent on mitochondrial iron. It is possible that decreased Erg25 activity reflected decreased mitochondrial function rather than decreased cytosolic iron. Based on these concerns, we looked for an independent measure of cytosolic iron to assay the effect of decreased Fe-S cluster synthesis on induction of the low and high iron response. Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans GDO catalyzes the ring fission reaction that degrades gentisate (17Hintner J.P. Reemtsma T. Stolz A. Biochemical and molecular characterization of a ring fission dioxygenase with the ability to oxidize (substituted) salicylate(s) from Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37250-37260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This pathway does not exist in yeast, and yeast do not express GDO. The crystal structure for GDO has been solved, and it shows that Fe(II) is the sole cofactor (18Matera I. Ferraroni M. Bürger S. Scozzafava A. Stolz A. Briganti F.

Biol. 2008; 380: 856-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The iron binding site is solvent-accessible, and GDO has a relatively low affinity for iron as it binds iron with only three ligands (3 His residues). In contrast, Escherichia coli iron-superoxide dismutase binds iron with four ligands (3 His residues and 1 Asp residue) (19Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L.

GDO-bound iron can be removed by ferrous chelators, and the inactivated enzyme can be incompletely reactivated by the addition of reduced iron but not other metals (20Harpel M.R. Lipscomb J.D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6301-6311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we generated a yeast plasmid expressing GDO under the control of the ADH1 promoter. GDO expressed in yeast showed activity using gentisate as a substrate. Similar levels of activity were seen for both untagged and carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged versions of GDO (data not shown). There was low GDO activity in medium made into low iron medium through the addition of the impermeable iron chelator BPS (Fig. 3A). Deletion of CCC1, which prevents import of iron to vacuoles, resulted in increased GDO activity in iron-replete medium. The addition of iron to BPS medium resulted in increased GDO activity. Cells overexpressing the vacuolar iron transporter Ccc1 showed decreased GDO activity (Fig. 3B)."
https://openalex.org/W2120666343,"We have demonstrated previously that the cellular HuR protein binds U-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Sindbis virus RNA and relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon Sindbis virus infection in 293T cells. In this study, we show that two alphaviruses, Ross River virus and Chikungunya virus, lack the conserved high-affinity U-rich HuR binding element in their 3' UTRs but still maintain the ability to interact with HuR with nanomolar affinities through alternative binding elements. The relocalization of HuR protein occurs during Sindbis infection of multiple mammalian cell types as well as during infections with three other alphaviruses. Interestingly, the relocalization of HuR is not a general cellular reaction to viral infection, as HuR protein remained largely nuclear during infections with dengue and measles virus. Relocalization of HuR in a Sindbis infection required viral gene expression, was independent of the presence of a high-affinity U-rich HuR binding site in the 3' UTR of the virus, and was associated with an alteration in the phosphorylation state of HuR. Sindbis virus-induced HuR relocalization was mechanistically distinct from the movement of HuR observed during a cellular stress response, as there was no accumulation of caspase-mediated HuR cleavage products. Collectively, these data indicate that virus-induced HuR relocalization to the cytoplasm is specific to alphavirus infections and is associated with distinct posttranslational modifications of this RNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2034351145,"Adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) is a gene delivery vector constructed as a hybrid between adeno-associated virus and filamentous phage. Tumor targeting following systemic administration has previously been demonstrated in several in vivo cancer models, with tumor specificity achieved through display of an α(v) integrin-targeting ligand on the capsid. However, high titers of AAVP are required for transduction of large numbers of mammalian cells. This study is the first to investigate the mechanisms involved in entry and intracellular trafficking of AAVP. Using a combination of flow cytometry, confocal, and electron microscopy techniques, together with pharmacological agents, RNAi and dominant negative mutants, we have demonstrated that targeted AAVP endocytosis is both dynamin and clathrin-dependent. Following entry, the majority of AAVP particles are sequestered by the endosomal-lysosomal degradative pathway. Finally, we have demonstrated that disruption of this pathway leads to improved transgene expression by AAVP, thus demonstrating that escape from the late endosomes/lysosomes is a critical step for improving gene delivery by AAVP. These findings have important implications for the rational design of improved AAVP and RGD-targeted vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2037562352,"Tissues respond to injury by releasing acute phase reaction (APR) proteins which regulate inflammation and angiogenesis. Among the genes upregulated in wounded tissues are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and the acute phase reactant orosomucoid-1 (ORM1). ORM1 has been shown to modulate the response of immune cells to TNFα, but its role on injury- and TNFα-induced angiogenesis has not been investigated. This study was designed to characterize the role of ORM1 in the angiogenic response to injury and TNFα.Angiogenesis was studied with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo angiogenesis assays. Injured rat aortic rings cultured in collagen gels produced an angiogenic response driven by macrophage-derived TNFα. Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR showed that TNFα and ORM1 were upregulated prior to angiogenic sprouting. Exogenous ORM1 delayed the angiogenic response to injury and inhibited the proangiogenic effect of TNFα in cultures of aortic rings or isolated endothelial cells, but stimulated aortic angiogenesis over time while promoting VEGF production and activity. ORM1 inhibited injury- and TNFα-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK in aortic rings, but not of NFκB. This effect was injury/TNFα-specific since ORM1 did not inhibit VEGF-induced signaling, and cell-specific since ORM1 inhibited TNFα-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK in macrophages and endothelial cells, but not mural cells. Experiments with specific inhibitors demonstrated that the MEK/ERK pathway was required for angiogenesis. ORM1 inhibited angiogenesis in a subcutaneous in vivo assay of aortic ring-induced angiogenesis, but stimulated developmental angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay.ORM1 regulates injury-induced angiogenesis in a time- and context-dependent manner by sequentially dampening the initial TNFα-induced angiogenic response and promoting the downstream stimulation of the angiogenic process by VEGF. The context-dependent nature of ORM1 angioregulatory function is further demonstrated in the CAM assay where ORM1 stimulates developmental angiogenesis without exerting any inhibitory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2017404719,"pH and Na(+) homeostasis in all cells requires Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. In most cases, their activity is tightly pH-regulated. NhaA, the main antiporter of Escherichia coli, has homologues in all biological kingdoms. The crystal structure of NhaA provided insights into the mechanism of action and pH regulation of an antiporter. However, the active site of NhaA remained elusive because neither Na(+) nor Li(+), the NhaA ligands, were observed in the structure. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that purified NhaA binds Li(+) in detergent micelles. This interaction is driven by an increase in enthalpy (ΔH of -8000 ± 300 cal/mol and ΔS of -15.2 cal/mol/degree at 283 K), involves a single binding site per NhaA molecule, and is highly specific and drastically dependent on pH; Li(+) binding was observed only at pH 8.5. Combining mutational analysis with the isothermal titration calorimetry measurements revealed that Asp-163, Asp-164, Thr-132, and Asp-133 form the Li(+) binding site, whereas Lys-300 plays an important role in pH regulation of the antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W2011832904,"Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a neutrophil-derived serine proteinase with broad substrate specificity. We have recently demonstrated that NE is capable of entering tumor cell endosomes and processing novel intracellular substrates. In the current study, we sought to determine the mechanism by which NE enters tumor cells. Our results show that NE enters into early endosomal antigen-1(+) endosomes in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent but flotillin-1- and caveolin-1-independent fashion. Cathepsin G (but not proteinase-3) also enters tumor endosomes via the same mechanism. We utilized (125)I-labeled NE to demonstrate that NE binds to the surface of cancer cells. Incubation of radiolabeled NE with lung cancer cells displays a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 284 nm. Because NE is known to bind to heparan sulfate- and chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans, we treated cells with glycanases to remove these confounding factors, which did not significantly diminish cell surface binding or endosomal entry. Thus, NE and CG bind to the surface of cancer cells, presumably to a cell surface receptor, and subsequently undergo clathrin pit-mediated endocytosis."

The occurrence of multiple insemination events was investigated after 2 field samplings of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in La Reunion Island using microsatellite markers. Respectively, 14 and 13 females after the first and the second sampling laid eggs. Seven wild females out of the 27 laying females were found with a progeny involving more than one father. This result is important for the new alternative mosquito control methods and raises the importance of pre- and post-copulatory competition."

All women identified to be pregnant May-July 2008 (n=881) were interviewed about pregnancy-related issues and linked to the HDSS database for socio-demographic data. Women were followed-up via antenatal care (ANC) register reviews at the health facilities to collect data related to ANC services received, including HIV testing. Adjusted relative risk (aRR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for not being HIV tested were calculated using multivariable binomial regression among the 544 women who remained after record review.Despite high ANC attendance (96%), the coverage of HIV testing was 64%. Only 6% of pregnant women who sought ANC at a facility without HIV testing services were referred for testing and only 20% received counseling regarding HIV. At ANC facilities with HIV testing services, 85% were tested. Only 4% of the women tested had been couple tested for HIV. Living more than three kilometers away from a health facility with HIV testing services was associated with not being tested both among the poorest (aRR,CI; 1.44,1.02-2.04) and the least poor women (aRR,CI;1.72,1.12-2.63).The lack of on site HIV testing services and distant ANC facilities lead to missed opportunities for PMTCT, especially for the poorest women. Referral systems for HIV testing need to be improved and testing should be expanded to lower level health facilities. This is in order to ensure that the policy of HIV testing during pregnancy is implemented more effectively and that testing is accessible for all."

https://openalex.org/W2166910167,"Chromosomal rearrangements occur readily in nature and are a major reshaping force during genome evolution. Such large scale modifications are usually deleterious causing several fitness defects, but sometimes can confer an advantage and become adaptive. For example the DAL metabolic cluster in yeast was assembled in recent evolutionary times in the Hemiascomycetes lineage, through a set of rearrangements that brought together the genes involved in the allantoin degradation pathway. In eukaryotes, the existence of physical clustering of genes with related functions supports the notion that neighbouring ORFs tend to be co-expressed and that the order of genes along the chromosomes may have biological significance, rather than being random as previously believed. In this study, we investigate the phenotypic effect that inversions have on the DAL gene cluster, expressed during nitrogen starvation. In all Saccharomyces ""sensu stricto"" species the order of the DAL cluster is conserved, while in the ""sensu lato"" species Naumovia castellii, which grows significantly worse than S. cerevisiae on allantoin, the cluster includes two nested inversions encompassing three DAL genes. We constructed several inverted and non-inverted S. cerevisiae strains possessing different inversions including those to mimic the configuration of the N. castellii DAL cluster. We showed that the inversion of DAL2 lower its own expression and reduces yeast fitness during nitrogen starvation. This rearrangement also altered the expression of the neighbouring genes DAL1 and DAL4. Moreover, we showed that the expression of the DAL4 anti-sense transcript (SUT614) does not change upon inversions of DAL2 and therefore is unlikely to be involved in its regulation. These results show that the order of the DAL cluster has an impact on the phenotype and gene expression, suggesting that these rearrangements may have been adaptive in the ""sensu stricto"" group in relation to the low availability of nitrogen in the environment."

A series of heparan sulfate mimetic small molecules targeting VEGF/VEGFR pathway has been synthesized. Among them, compound 8 (2-butyl-5-chloro-3-(4-nitro-benzyl)-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde) was identified as a significant binding molecule for the heparin-binding domain of VEGF, determined by high-throughput-surface plasmon resonance assay. The data predicted strong binding of compound 8 with VEGF which may prevent the binding of VEGF to its receptor. We compared the structure of compound 8 with heparan sulfate (HS), which have in common the functional ionic groups such as sulfate, nitro and carbaldehyde that can be located in similar positions of the disaccharide structure of HS. Molecular docking studies predicted that compound 8 binds at the heparin binding domain of VEGF through strong hydrogen bonding with Lys-30 and Gln-20 amino acid residues, and consistent with the prediction, compound 8 inhibited binding of VEGF to immobilized heparin. In vitro studies showed that compound 8 inhibits the VEGF-induced proliferation migration and tube formation of mouse vascular endothelial cells, and finally the invasion of a murine osteosarcoma cell line (LM8G7) which secrets high levels of VEGF. In vivo, these effects produce significant decrease of tumor burden in an experimental model of liver metastasis. Collectively, these data indicate that compound 8 may prevent tumor growth through a direct effect on tumor cell proliferation and by inhibition of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis mediated by VEGF. In conclusion, compound 8 may normalize the tumor vasculature and microenvironment in tumors probably by inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2122176343,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is usually accompanied by intensive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, which may contribute to arrhythmogenic sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms underlying the development of cardiac fibrosis are incompletely understood. To investigate the role of perivascular inflammation in coronary artery remodeling and cardiac fibrosis during hypertrophic ventricular remodeling, we used a well-established mouse model of LVH (transverse aortic constriction [TAC]). Three days after pressure overload, macrophages and T lymphocytes accumulated around and along left coronary arteries in association with luminal platelet deposition. Consistent with these histological findings, cardiac expression of IL-10 was upregulated and in the systemic circulation, platelet white blood cell aggregates tended to be higher in TAC animals compared to sham controls. Since platelets can dynamically modulate perivascular inflammation, we investigated the impact of thrombocytopenia on the response to TAC. Immunodepletion of platelets decreased early perivascular T lymphocytes' accumulation and altered subsequent coronary artery remodeling. The contribution of lymphocytes were examined in Rag1−/− mice, which displayed significantly more intimal hyperplasia and perivascular fibrosis compared to wild-type mice following TAC. Collectively, our studies support a role of early perivascular accumulation of platelets and T lymphocytes in pressure overload-induced inflammation."

Here, we report further NMR analyses for obtaining structural insights at the residue-specific level between PI-binding effector protein and PI-nanodisc, using the FYVE domain of early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), denoted as EEA1 FYVE, and PI(3)P-nanodisc as a model system. We performed a combination of the NMR analyses including chemical shift perturbation, transferred cross-saturation, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments. These enabled an identification of the interaction surface, structural change, and relative orientation of EEA1 FYVE to the PI(3)P-incorporated lipid bilayer, substantiating that NMR analyses of protein-membrane interactions using nanodisc makes it possible to show the residue-specific interactions in the lipid bilayer environment."
https://openalex.org/W2075201088,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is a key player in Alzheimer's disease, was recently reported to possess an Fe(II) binding site within its E2 domain which exhibits ferroxidase activity [Duce et al. 2010, Cell 142: 857]. The putative ligands of this site were compared to those in the ferroxidase site of ferritin. The activity was indirectly measured using transferrin, which scavenges the Fe(III) product of the reaction. A 22-residue synthetic peptide, named FD1, with the putative ferroxidase site of APP, and the E2 domain of APP were each reported to exhibit 40% of the ferroxidase activity of APP and of ceruloplasmin. It was also claimed that the ferroxidase activity of APP is inhibited by Zn(II) just as in ferritin. We measured the ferroxidase activity indirectly (i) by the incorporation of the Fe(III) product of the ferroxidase reaction into transferrin and directly (ii) by monitoring consumption of the substrate molecular oxygen. The results with the FD1 peptide were compared to the established ferroxidase activities of human H-chain ferritin and of ceruloplasmin. For FD1 we observed no activity above the background of non-enzymatic Fe(II) oxidation by molecular oxygen. Zn(II) binds to transferrin and diminishes its Fe(III) incorporation capacity and rate but it does not specifically bind to a putative ferroxidase site of FD1. Based on these results, and on comparison of the putative ligands of the ferroxidase site of APP with those of ferritin, we conclude that the previously reported results for ferroxidase activity of FD1 and – by implication – of APP should be re-evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2056658567,"The investigation of associations between rare genetic variants and diseases or phenotypes has two goals. Firstly, the identification of which genes or genomic regions are associated, and secondly, discrimination of associated variants from background noise within each region. Over the last few years, many new methods have been developed which associate genomic regions with phenotypes. However, classical methods for high-dimensional data have received little attention. Here we investigate whether several classical statistical methods for high-dimensional data: ridge regression (RR), principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLS), a sparse version of PLS (SPLS), and the LASSO are able to detect associations with rare genetic variants. These approaches have been extensively used in statistics to identify the true associations in data sets containing many predictor variables. Using genetic variants identified in three genes that were Sanger sequenced in 1998 individuals, we simulated continuous phenotypes under several different models, and we show that these feature selection and feature extraction methods can substantially outperform several popular methods for rare variant analysis. Furthermore, these approaches can identify which variants are contributing most to the model fit, and therefore both goals of rare variant analysis can be achieved simultaneously with the use of regression regularization methods. These methods are briefly illustrated with an analysis of adiponectin levels and variants in the ADIPOQ gene."
https://openalex.org/W1981014188,"Stamen movements can be understood as a mechanism influencing pollen presentation and increasing outbreeding success of hermaphroditic flowers via optimized male function. In this study we experimentally analyzed the factors regulating autonomous and thigmonastic (triggered by flower visitors) stamen movements in eight species of Loasaceae. Both types of stamen movements are positively influenced by light and temperature and come to a virtual standstill in the dark and at low temperatures (12°C). Pollen presentation is thus discontinued during periods where pollinators are not active. Overall stamen presentation increases with increasing flower age. Contrary to expectation, no geometrical correlation between the floral scale stimulated and the stamen fascicle reacting exists, indicating that the stimulus is transmitted over the receptacle and stamen maturation dictates which and how many stamens react. Thigmonastic stamen presentation is dramatically accelerated compared to autonomous movement (3–37 times), indicating that the rate of stamen maturation can be adjusted to different visitation schedules. Flowers can react relatively uniformly down to stimulation intervals of 10–15 min., consistently presenting comparable numbers of stamens in the flower c. 5 min. after the stimulus and can thus keep the amount of pollen presented relatively constant even under very high visitation frequencies of 4–6 visits/h. Thigmonastic pollen presentation dramatically reduces the overall duration of the staminate phase (to 1/3rd in Nasa macrothyrsa). Similarly, the carpellate phase is dramatically reduced after pollination, down to 1 d from 4 d. Overall flower longevity is reduced by more than 2/3rds under high visitation rates (<3 d versus 10 d under visitor exclusion) and depleted and pollinated flowers are rapidly removed from the pool. Complex floral behaviour in Loasaceae thus permits a near-total control over pollen dispensation schedules and floral longevity of the individual flower by an extraordinary fine-tuning to both biotic and abiotic factors."

Using an adoptive transfer model, we investigated the role of the respective T cell subset. Magnetic bead separated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from oxazolone sensitized C57BL/6 mice were transferred into RAG-/- mice, followed by hapten challenge and analysis of inflammatory parameters at 24 hours post exposure. The CD4+ T cell recipient mice developed partial contact hypersensitivity responses to oxazolone. CD8+ T cells caused significant amplification of the response in recipients of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells including ear swelling, type 1 inflammatory mediators, and cell killing. Unexpectedly, CD8+ T cells were not sufficient to mediate contact hypersensitivity, although abundantly present in the lymph nodes in the CD8+ T cell reconstituted mice. There were no signs of inflammation at the site of hapten exposure, indicating impaired recruitment of CD8+ T cells in the absence of CD4+ T cells. These data show that CD4+ T cells mediate contact hypersensitivity to oxazolone, but CD8+ T cells contribute with the most potent effector mechanisms. Moreover, our results suggest that CD4+ T cell function is required for the mobilization of CD8+ effector T cells to the site of hapten exposure. The results shed new light on the relative importance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during the effector phase of contact hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2085850949,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is frequently associated with human disease, including cancer, and thus represents a key therapeutic target. However, Wnt/β-catenin signaling also plays critical roles in many aspects of normal adult tissue homeostasis. The identification of mechanisms and strategies to selectively inhibit the disease-related functions of Wnt signaling, while preserving normal physiological functions, is in its infancy. Here, we report the identification of exogenous chondroitin sulfate-E (CS-E) as an inhibitor of specific molecular and biological outcomes of Wnt3a signaling in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We demonstrate that CS-E can decrease Wnt3a signaling through the negative regulation of LRP6 receptor activation. However, this inhibitory effect of CS-E only affected Wnt3a-mediated induction, but not repression, of target gene expression. We went on to identify a critical Wnt3a signaling threshold that differentially affects target gene induction versus repression. This signaling threshold also controlled the effects of Wnt3a on proliferation and serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Limiting Wnt3a signaling to this critical threshold, either by CS-E treatment or by ligand dilution, interfered with Wnt3a-mediated stimulation of proliferation but did not impair Wnt3a-mediated reduction of serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that both induction and repression of Wnt3a target genes in NIH3T3 cells require the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. Our data establish the feasibility of selective inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional programs and biological outcomes through the exploitation of intrinsic signaling thresholds."

They consisted of I/R injuries (1) by ligation of left coronary artery, or (2) using Langendorff apparatus. Langendorff was used to focus the mechanism of APC excluding coagulation cascade in a working heart. Each experiment had an APC group (n = 10) and a control group with normal saline (n = 10). Injections of these solutions into rats were performed 30 minutes before the planned-I/R injury. Cardiac performance after the procedure was evaluated by echocardiography or indices with Langendorff apparatus. Coronary flow (CF) was measured in the global I/R injury model. Western blotting was performed to detect the change of AKT1 signal in myocardium after global I/R injury. Results LV function improved significantly in the APC group: %EF at 2 weeks after procedure, 70.8%±4.5% vs. 56.5%±0.7%; APC vs. control; p<0.01. Percent LV development pressure (LVDP) also improved in the APC group significantly, 88.8%±45.3% vs. 28.1%±15.4%; APC vs. control; p<0.01. In APC group, %CF improved significantly, 88.5%±15.8% vs. 65.0%±13.4%; APC vs. control; p<0.01. It was enhanced significantly when acetylcholine was administered; % CF: 103.5%±9.9% vs. 87.0%±12.1%; APC vs. control; p<0.05. Western blotting revealed that APC significantly induced activation of phosphorylated AKT1 in myocardium (p<0.05). Conclusions APC has a novel effect to protect myocardium and cardiac performance against I/R injury through improvement of endothelial function and activation of AKT1."
https://openalex.org/W2021972026,"The guideline physical activity levels are prescribed in terms of time, frequency, and intensity (e.g., 30 minutes brisk walking, five days a week or its energy equivalence) and assume that different activities may be combined to meet targeted goals (exchangeability premise). Habitual runners and walkers may quantify exercise in terms of distance (km/day), and for them, the relationship between activity dose and health benefits may be better assessed in terms of distance rather than time. Analyses were therefore performed to test: 1) whether time-based or distance-based estimates of energy expenditure provide the best metric for relating running and walking to hypertensive, high cholesterol, and diabetes medication use (conditions known to be diminished by exercise), and 2) the exchangeability premise.Logistic regression analyses of medication use (dependent variable) vs. metabolic equivalent hours per day (METhr/d) of running, walking and other exercise (independent variables) using cross-sectional data from the National Runners' (17,201 male, 16,173 female) and Walkers' Health Studies (3,434 male, 12,384 female).Estimated METhr/d of running and walking activity were 38% and 31% greater, respectively, when calculated from self-reported time than distance in men, and 43% and 37% greater in women, respectively. Percent reductions in the odds for hypertension and high cholesterol medication use per METhr/d run or per METhr/d walked were ≥ 2-fold greater when estimated from reported distance (km/wk) than from time (hr/wk). The per METhr/d odds reduction was significantly greater for the distance- than the time-based estimate for hypertension (runners: P<10(-5) for males and P=0.003 for females; walkers: P=0.03 for males and P<10(-4) for females), high cholesterol medication use in runners (P<10(-4) for males and P=0.02 for females) and male walkers (P=0.01 for males and P=0.08 for females) and for diabetes medication use in male runners (P<10(-3)).Although causality between greater exercise and lower prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes cannot be inferred from these cross-sectional data, the results do suggest that distance-based estimates of METhr/d run or walked provide superior metrics for epidemiological analyses to their traditional time-based estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1964607002,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) carries significant mortality and morbidity. Predicting which patients will become infected could lead to measures to reduce the incidence of VAP.The goal was to begin constructing a model for VAP prediction in critically-injured trauma patients, and to identify differentially expressed genes in patients who go on to develop VAP compared to similar patients who do not. Gene expression profiles of lipopolysaccharide stimulated blood cells in critically injured trauma patients that went on to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (n=10) was compared to those that never developed the infection (n=10). Eight hundred and ten genes were differentially expressed between the two groups (ANOVA, P<0.05) and further analyzed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. Functional analysis using Gene Ontology and KEGG classifications revealed enrichment in multiple categories including regulation of protein translation, regulation of protease activity, and response to bacterial infection. A logistic regression model was developed that accurately predicted critically-injured trauma patients that went on to develop VAP (VAP+) and those that did not (VAP-). Five genes (PIK3R3, ATP2A1, PI3, ADAM8, and HCN4) were common to all top 20 significant genes that were identified from all independent training sets in the cross validation. Hierarchical clustering using these five genes accurately categorized 95% of patients and PCA visualization demonstrated two discernable groups (VAP+ and VAP-).A logistic regression model using cross-validation accurately predicted patients that developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and should now be tested on a larger cohort of trauma patients."
https://openalex.org/W1991766505,"Background In early 2009, a novel influenza A(H1N1) virus that emerged in Mexico and United States rapidly disseminated worldwide. The spread of this virus caused considerable morbidity with over 18000 recorded deaths. The new virus was found to be a reassortant containing gene segments from human, avian and swine influenza viruses. Methods/Results The first case of human infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 in Pakistan was detected on 18th June 2009. Since then, 262 laboratory-confirmed cases have been detected during various outbreaks with 29 deaths (as of 31st August 2010). The peak of the epidemic was observed in December with over 51% of total respiratory cases positive for influenza. Representative isolates from Pakistan viruses were sequenced and analyzed antigenically. Sequence analysis of genes coding for surface glycoproteins HA and NA showed high degree of high levels of sequence identity with corresponding genes of regional viruses circulating South East Asia. All tested viruses were sensitive to Oseltamivir in the Neuraminidase Inhibition assays. Conclusions Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Pakistan form a homogenous group of viruses. Their HA genes belong to clade 7 and show antigenic profile similar to the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009. These isolates do not show any amino acid changes indicative of high pathogenicity and virulence. It is imperative to continue monitoring of these viruses for identification of potential variants of high virulence or drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2110696023,"Secretory vesicles are required for release of chemical messengers to mediate intercellular signaling among human biological systems. It is necessary to define the organization of the protein architecture of the ‘human’ dense core secretory vesicles (DCSV) to understand mechanisms for secretion of signaling molecules essential for cellular regulatory processes. This study, therefore, conducted extensive quantitative proteomics and systems biology analyses of human DCSV purified from human pheochromocytoma. Over 600 human DCSV proteins were identified with quantitative evaluation of over 300 proteins, revealing that most proteins participate in producing peptide hormones and neurotransmitters, enzymes, and the secretory machinery. Systems biology analyses provided a model of interacting DCSV proteins, generating hypotheses for differential intracellular protein kinases A and C signaling pathways. Activation of cellular PKA and PKC pathways resulted in differential secretion of neuropeptides, catecholamines, and β-amyloid of Alzheimer's disease for mediating cell-cell communication. This is the first study to define a model of the protein architecture of human DCSV for human disease and health."
https://openalex.org/W2050944764,"Genotyping of human papillomarvirus (HPV) is crucial for patient management in a clinical setting. This study accesses the combined use of broad-range real-time PCR and high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for rapid identification of HPV genotypes.Genomic DNA sequences of 8 high-risk genotypes (HPV16/18/39/45/52/56/58/68) were subject to bioinformatic analysis to select for appropriate PCR amplicon. Asymmetric broad-range real-time PCR in the presence of HRM dye and two unlabeled probes specific to HPV16 and 18 was employed to generate HRM molecular signatures for HPV genotyping. The method was validated via assessment of 119 clinical HPV isolates.A DNA fragment within the L1 region was selected as the PCR amplicon ranging from 215-221 bp for different HPV genotypes. Each genotype displayed a distinct HRM molecular signature with minimal inter-assay variability. According to the HRM molecular signatures, HPV genotypes can be determined with one PCR within 3 h from the time of viral DNA isolation. In the validation assay, a 91% accuracy rate was achieved when the genotypes were in the database. Concomitantly, the HRM molecular signatures for additional 6 low-risk genotypes were established.This assay provides a novel approach for HPV genotyping in a rapid and cost-effective manner."
https://openalex.org/W1976124899,"We have recently shown a high prevalence of diabetes and obesity in rural Cameroon, despite an improved lifestyle. Diabetes in rural Africa remains underdiagnosed and its role in increasing risk of atherosclerosis in these populations is unknown. We investigated the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors in a population of subjects with recently-diagnosed diabetes from rural Cameroon.In a case-control study, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured in 74 subjects with diabetes (diagnosed <2 years), aged 47-85 and 109 controls comparable for age and sex. Subjects were recruited during a health campaign conducted in April 2009. Blood glucose control (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose) and major cardiovascular risk factors (complete lipid panel, blood pressure) were also measured. Mean carotid IMT was higher in subjects with diabetes than healthy controls at each scanned segment (common, internal carotid and bulb) (P<0.05), except the near wall of the left bulb. Vascular stiffness tended to be higher and pressure-strain elastic modulus of the left carotid was increased in subjects with diabetes than controls (P<0.05), but distensibility was similar between the two groups. At least one plaque >0.9 mm was found in 4%, 45.9% and 20% of diabetic subjects at the common, bulb or internal carotid, respectively. Only 25% of patients had an HbA1c<7%, while over 41.6% presented with marked hyperglycemia (HbA1c>9%). The prevalence of diabetic subjects with abnormal levels of LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or blood pressure was 45%, 16.6%, 15% and 65.7%, respectively.Carotid thickness is increased in subjects with diabetes from a rural area of Cameroon, despite the relatively recent diagnosis. These findings and the high rate of uncontrolled diabetes in this population support the increasing concern of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in African countries and indicate the need for multifaceted health interventions in urban and rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W2016419209,"Due to their self-catalytic properties, small RNAs with bulge bases are hypothesized to be primordial molecules which could form elementary translation systems. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the binding propensity of small RNAs by calculating the free energy barrier corresponding to the looped out conformations of bulge bases, which presumably act as the binding sites for ligands in these small RNAs. We find that base flipping kinetics can proceed at atmospheric pressure but with a very small propensity. Furthermore, the free energy barrier associated with base flipping depends on the stacking with neighboring bases. Next, we studied the base flipping kinetics with pressure. We find that the free energy associated with base looping out increases monotonically as the pressure is increased. Furthermore, we calculate the mean first-passage time of conformational looping out of the bulge base using the diffusion of reaction coordinate associated with the base flipping on the underlying free energy surface. We find that the mean first-passage time associated with bulge looping out increases slowly upon increasing pressures P up to 2000 atm but changes dramatically for P>2000 atm. Finally, we discuss our results in the light of the role of hydration shell of water around RNA. Our results are relevant for the RNA world hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2072984222,"The GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) docking/scaffold protein is a key mediator of the MET-tyrosine kinase receptor activated by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). Activated MET promotes recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1, which in turn recruits multiple proteins and mediates MET signaling leading to cell survival, motility, and morphogenesis. We previously reported that, without its ligand, MET is a functional caspase target during apoptosis, allowing the generation of a p40-MET fragment that amplifies apoptosis. In this study we established that GAB1 is also a functional caspase target by evidencing a caspase-cleaved p35-GAB1 fragment that contains the MET binding domain. GAB1 is cleaved by caspases before MET, and the resulting p35-GAB1 fragment is phosphorylated by MET upon HGF/SF binding and can interact with a subset of GAB1 partners, PI3K, and GRB2 but not with SHP2. This p35-GAB1 fragment favors cell survival by maintaining HGF/SF-induced MET activation of AKT and by hindering p40-MET pro-apoptotic function. These data demonstrate an anti-apoptotic role of caspase-cleaved GAB1 in HGF/SF-MET signaling."
