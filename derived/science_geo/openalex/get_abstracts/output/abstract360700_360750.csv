https://openalex.org/W2046505430,"Although in vitro observations suggest that cross-presentation of antigens is mediated primarily by CD8α + dendritic cells, in vivo analysis has been hampered by the lack of systems that selectively eliminate this cell lineage. We show that deletion of the transcription factor Batf3 ablated development of CD8α + dendritic cells, allowing us to examine their role in immunity in vivo. Dendritic cells from Batf3 –/– mice were defective in cross-presentation, and Batf3 –/– mice lacked virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses to West Nile virus. Importantly, rejection of highly immunogenic syngeneic tumors was impaired in Batf3 –/– mice. These results suggest an important role for CD8α + dendritic cells and cross-presentation in responses to viruses and in tumor rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2106723742,"Direct imaging of exoplanetary systems is a powerful technique that can reveal Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, can enable detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres, and is a key step toward imaging Earth-like planets. Imaging detections are challenging because of the combined effect of small angular separation and large luminosity contrast between a planet and its host star. High-contrast observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes have revealed three planets orbiting the star HR 8799, with projected separations of 24, 38, and 68 astronomical units. Multi-epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion for all three imaged planets. The low luminosity of the companions and the estimated age of the system imply planetary masses between 5 and 13 times that of Jupiter. This system resembles a scaled-up version of the outer portion of our solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2040182688,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a mammalian histone methyltransferase that contributes to the epigenetic silencing of target genes and regulates the survival and metastasis of cancer cells. EZH2 is overexpressed in aggressive solid tumors by mechanisms that remain unclear. Here we show that the expression and function of EZH2 in cancer cell lines are inhibited by microRNA-101 (miR-101). Analysis of human prostate tumors revealed that miR-101 expression decreases during cancer progression, paralleling an increase in EZH2 expression. One or both of the two genomic loci encoding miR-101 were somatically lost in 37.5% of clinically localized prostate cancer cells (6 of 16) and 66.7% of metastatic disease cells (22 of 33). We propose that the genomic loss of miR-101 in cancer leads to overexpression of EZH2 and concomitant dysregulation of epigenetic pathways, resulting in cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W2056448794,"Our decisions are guided by information learnt from our environment. This information may come via personal experiences of reward, but also from the behaviour of social partners. Social learning is widely held to be distinct from other forms of learning in its mechanism and neural implementation; it is often assumed to compete with simpler mechanisms, such as reward-based associative learning, to drive behaviour. Recently, neural signals have been observed during social exchange reminiscent of signals seen in studies of associative learning. Here we demonstrate that social information may be acquired using the same associative processes assumed to underlie reward-based learning. We find that key computational variables for learning in the social and reward domains are processed in a similar fashion, but in parallel neural processing streams. Two neighbouring divisions of the anterior cingulate cortex were central to learning about social and reward-based information, and for determining the extent to which each source of information guides behaviour. When making a decision, however, the information learnt using these parallel streams was combined within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that human social valuation can be realized by means of the same associative processes previously established for learning other, simpler, features of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2024605337,"Fomalhaut, a bright star 7.7 parsecs (25 light-years) from Earth, harbors a belt of cold dust with a structure consistent with gravitational sculpting by an orbiting planet. Here, we present optical observations of an exoplanet candidate, Fomalhaut b. Fomalhaut b lies about 119 astronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU of the dust belt, matching predictions of its location. Hubble Space Telescope observations separated by 1.73 years reveal counterclockwise orbital motion. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at most three times that of Jupiter; a higher mass would lead to gravitational disruption of the belt, matching predictions of its location. The flux detected at 0.8 μm is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no greater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 μm and the lack of detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include starlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to the orbits of the Galilean satellites. We also observe variability of unknown origin at 0.6 μm."

https://openalex.org/W2020241645,"Most industrial processes make use of heterogeneous catalysts, which typically consist of nanometre-sized particles of metal or metal oxide dispersed on a solid support material. Any attempt to unravel how such complex systems function requires detailed information on the morphology and chemical composition of the catalysts during operation. Microspectroscopy methods have now advanced to a stage where this challenge can be tackled. Using a specially designed nanoreactor and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, de Smit et al. have achieved direct imaging of an iron-based Fisher–Tropsch catalyst with nanometre-resolution and reveal how changes in the catalyst correlate with its activity. The same approach could help understand — and improve — other heterogeneous catalysts and important chemical processes occurring at surfaces. The modern chemical industry uses heterogeneous catalysts in almost every production process1. They commonly consist of nanometre-size active components (typically metals or metal oxides) dispersed on a high-surface-area solid support, with performance depending on the catalysts’ nanometre-size features and on interactions involving the active components, the support and the reactant and product molecules. To gain insight into the mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysts, which could guide the design of improved or novel catalysts, it is thus necessary to have a detailed characterization of the physicochemical composition of heterogeneous catalysts in their working state at the nanometre scale1,2. Scanning probe microscopy methods have been used to study inorganic catalyst phases at subnanometre resolution3,4,5,6, but detailed chemical information of the materials in their working state is often difficult to obtain5,6,7. By contrast, optical microspectroscopic approaches offer much flexibility for in situ chemical characterization; however, this comes at the expense of limited spatial resolution8,9,10,11. A recent development promising high spatial resolution and chemical characterization capabilities is scanning transmission X-ray microscopy4,12,13, which has been used in a proof-of-principle study to characterize a solid catalyst14. Here we show that when adapting a nanoreactor specially designed for high-resolution electron microscopy7, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy can be used at atmospheric pressure and up to 350 °C to monitor in situ phase changes in a complex iron-based Fisher–Tropsch catalyst and the nature and location of carbon species produced. We expect that our system, which is capable of operating up to 500 °C, will open new opportunities for nanometre-resolution imaging of a range of important chemical processes taking place on solids in gaseous or liquid environments."
https://openalex.org/W2002374533,"Archaea are prokaryotic organisms that lack endomembrane structures. However, a number of hyperthermophilic members of the Kingdom Crenarchaea, including members of the Sulfolobus genus, encode homologs of the eukaryotic endosomal sorting system components Vps4 and ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III). We found that Sulfolobus ESCRT-III and Vps4 homologs underwent regulation of their expression during the cell cycle. The proteins interacted and we established the structural basis of this interaction. Furthermore, these proteins specifically localized to the mid-cell during cell division. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant Vps4 in Sulfolobus resulted in the accumulation of enlarged cells, indicative of failed cell division. Thus, the archaeal ESCRT system plays a key role in cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2084800734,"Leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection or inflammation requires multiple adhesive events. Although numerous players promoting leukocyte-endothelial interactions have been characterized, functionally important endogenous inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion have not been identified. Here we describe the endothelially derived secreted molecule Del-1 (developmental endothelial locus-1) as an anti-adhesive factor that interferes with the integrin LFA-1-dependent leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Endothelial Del-1 deficiency increased LFA-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion in vitro and in vivo. Del-1-/- mice displayed significantly higher neutrophil accumulation in lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation in vivo, which was reversed in Del-1/LFA-1 double-deficient mice. Thus, Del-1 is an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory cell recruitment and could provide a basis for targeting leukocyte-endothelial interactions in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033734320,"Analyses of the KNM-WT 15000 Homo erectus juvenile male partial skeleton from Kenya concluded that this species had a tall thin body shape due to specialized locomotor and climatic adaptations. Moreover, it was concluded that H. erectus pelves were obstetrically restricted to birthing a small-brained altricial neonate. Here we describe a nearly complete early Pleistocene adult female H. erectus pelvis from the Busidima Formation of Gona, Afar, Ethiopia. This obstetrically capacious pelvis demonstrates that pelvic shape in H. erectus was evolving in response to increasing fetal brain size. This pelvis indicates that neither adaptations to tropical environments nor endurance running were primary selective factors in determining pelvis morphology in H. erectus during the early Pleistocene."
https://openalex.org/W1970410141,"A molecular network that exhibits critical correlations in the spatial order that is characteristic of a random, entropically stabilized, rhombus tiling is described. Specifically, we report a random tiling formed in a two-dimensional molecular network of p-terphenyl-3,5,3',5'-tetracarboxylic acid adsorbed on graphite. The network is stabilized by hexagonal junctions of three, four, five, or six molecules and may be mapped onto a rhombus tiling in which an ordered array of vertices is embedded within a nonperiodic framework with spatial fluctuations in a local order characteristic of an entropically stabilized phase. We identified a topological defect that can propagate through the network, giving rise to a local reordering of molecular tiles and thus to transitions between quasi-degenerate local minima of a complex energy landscape. We draw parallels between the molecular tiling and dynamically arrested systems, such as glasses."
https://openalex.org/W2016538371,"We measured the nucleation and growth kinetics of solid silicon (Si) from liquid gold-silicon (AuSi) catalyst particles as the Si supersaturation increased, which is the first step of the vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires. Quantitative measurements agree well with a kinetic model, providing a unified picture of the growth process. Nucleation is heterogeneous, occurring consistently at the edge of the AuSi droplet, yet it is intrinsic and highly reproducible. We studied the critical supersaturation required for nucleation and found no observable size effects, even for systems down to 12 nanometers in diameter. For applications in nanoscale technology, the reproducibility is essential, heterogeneity promises greater control of nucleation, and the absence of strong size effects simplifies process design."
https://openalex.org/W2017250893,"Understanding a chemical reaction ultimately requires the knowledge of how each atom in the reactants moves during product formation. Such knowledge is seldom complete and is often limited to an oversimplified reaction coordinate that neglects global motions across the molecular framework. To overcome this limit, we recorded transient impulsive Raman spectra during ultrafast photoisomerization of cis -stilbene in solution. The results demonstrate a gradual frequency shift of a low-frequency spectator vibration, reflecting changes in the restoring force along this coordinate throughout the isomerization. A high-level quantum-chemical calculation reproduces this feature and associates it with a continuous structural change leading to the twisted configuration. This combined spectroscopic and computational approach should be amenable to detailed reaction visualization in other photoisomerizing systems as well."
https://openalex.org/W1991616145,"Climate models incorporate photosynthesis-climate feedbacks, yet we lack robust tools for large-scale assessments of these processes. Recent work suggests that carbonyl sulfide (COS), a trace gas consumed by plants, could provide a valuable constraint on photosynthesis. Here we analyze airborne observations of COS and carbon dioxide concentrations during the growing season over North America with a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model. We successfully modeled the persistent vertical drawdown of atmospheric COS using the quantitative relation between COS and photosynthesis that has been measured in plant chamber experiments. Furthermore, this drawdown is driven by plant uptake rather than other continental and oceanic fluxes in the model. These results provide quantitative evidence that COS gradients in the continental growing season may have broad use as a measurement-based photosynthesis tracer."
https://openalex.org/W2112721417,"The insulin/IGF-like signalling (IIS) pathway has diverse functions in all multicellular organisms, including determination of lifespan. The seven insulin-like peptides (DILPs) in Drosophila are expressed in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. Partial ablation of the median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) in the brain, which produce three DILPs, extends lifespan, reduces fecundity, alters lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and increases oxidative stress resistance. To determine if reduced expression of DILPs is causal in these effects, and to investigate possible functional diversification and redundancy between DILPs, we used RNA interference to lower specifically the transcript and protein levels of dilp2, the most highly expressed of the mNSC-derived DILPs. We found that DILP2 was limiting only for the increased whole-body trehalose content associated with mNSC-ablation. We observed a compensatory increase in dilp3 and 5 mRNA upon dilp2 knock down. By manipulation of dfoxo and dInR, we showed that the increase in dilp3 is regulated via autocrine insulin signaling in the mNSCs. Our study demonstrates that, despite the correlation between reduced dilp2 mRNA levels and lifespan-extension often observed, DILP2 reduction is not sufficient to extend lifespan. Nor is the increased trehalose storage associated with reduced IIS sufficient to extend lifespan. To understand the normal regulation of expression of the dilps and any functional diversification between them will require independent control of the expression of different dilps."
https://openalex.org/W1969868512,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) catalyzes a series of reactions to convert single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded DNA for host cell integration. This process requires a variety of enzymatic activities, including DNA polymerization, RNA cleavage, strand transfer, and strand displacement synthesis. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the interactions between RT and nucleic acid substrates in real time. RT was observed to slide on nucleic acid duplexes, rapidly shuttling between opposite termini of the duplex. Upon reaching the DNA 3' terminus, RT can spontaneously flip into a polymerization orientation. Sliding kinetics were regulated by cognate nucleotides and anti-HIV drugs, which stabilized and destabilized the polymerization mode, respectively. These long-range translocation activities facilitate multiple stages of the reverse transcription pathway, including normal DNA polymerization and strand displacement synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091674359,"Background Tinnitus is an auditory phantom perception that is most likely generated in the central nervous system. Most of the tinnitus research has concentrated on the auditory system. However, it was suggested recently that also non-auditory structures are involved in a global network that encodes subjective tinnitus. We tested this assumption using auditory steady state responses to entrain the tinnitus network and investigated long-range functional connectivity across various non-auditory brain regions. Methods and Findings Using whole-head magnetoencephalography we investigated cortical connectivity by means of phase synchronization in tinnitus subjects and healthy controls. We found evidence for a deviating pattern of long-range functional connectivity in tinnitus that was strongly correlated with individual ratings of the tinnitus percept. Phase couplings between the anterior cingulum and the right frontal lobe and phase couplings between the anterior cingulum and the right parietal lobe showed significant condition x group interactions and were correlated with the individual tinnitus distress ratings only in the tinnitus condition and not in the control conditions. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates existence of a global tinnitus network of long-range cortical connections outside the central auditory system. This result extends the current knowledge of how tinnitus is generated in the brain. We propose that this global extend of the tinnitus network is crucial for the continuos perception of the tinnitus tone and a therapeutical intervention that is able to change this network should result in relief of tinnitus."

We have recently reported an E3 family (termed UBR1 through UBR7) characterized by the 70-residue UBR box, among which UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 were captured during affinity-based proteomics with synthetic degrons. Here we characterized substrate binding specificity and recognition domains of UBR proteins. Pull-down assays with recombinant UBR proteins suggest that 570-kDa UBR4 and 300-kDa UBR5 bind N-degron, whereas UBR3, UBR6, and UBR7 do not. Binding assays with 24 UBR1 deletion mutants and 31 site-directed UBR1 mutations narrow down the degron-binding activity to a 72-residue UBR box-only fragment that recognizes type-1 but not type-2 residues. A surface plasmon resonance assay shows that the UBR box binds to the type-1 substrate Arg-peptide with Kd of ∼3.4 μm. Downstream from the UBR box, we identify a second substrate recognition domain, termed the N-domain, required for type-2 substrate recognition. The ∼80-residue N-domain shows structural and functional similarity to 106-residue Escherichia coli ClpS, a bacterial N-recognin. We propose a model where the 70-residue UBR box functions as a common structural element essential for binding to all known destabilizing N-terminal residues, whereas specific residues localized in the UBR box (for type 1) or the N-domain (for type 2) provide substrate selectivity through interaction with the side group of an N-terminal amino acid.

In the present study we characterized substrate binding specificities and recognition domains of UBR proteins. In our binding assays, UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 were captured by N-terminal degradation determinants, whereas UBR3, UBR6, and UBR7 were not. We also report that in contrast to other E3 systems that usually recognize substrates through protein-protein interface, UBR1 and UBR2 have a general substrate recognition domain termed the UBR box. Remarkably, a 72-residue UBR box-only fragment fully retains its structural integrity and thereby the ability to recognize type-1 N-end rule substrates. We also report that the N-domain, structurally and functionally related with bacterial N-recognins, is required for recognizing type-2 N-end rule substrates. We discuss the evolutionary relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic N-recognins. Overexpression of UBR Proteins in Mammalian Cells—The plasmid pcDNA3flagUBR2 (9Kwon Y.T. Xia Z. An J.Y.

The human UBR4 cDNA was excised from plasmid 7124A (a gift from Dr. Scott Vande Pol, University of Virginia) using SalI and NotI, and was subcloned into the plasmid pENTR3C (Invitrogen) to yield the entry vector pENTR3ChUBR4. By using the Gateway system (Invitrogen), the 15.9-kb UBR4 open reading frame was transferred from the pENTR3ChUBR4 to the destination vector pcDNA6.2/clumio-DEST (Invitrogen), yielding plasmid pcDNA6.2/cluvhUBR4 that expresses C-terminal lumio-V5-tagged UBR4 with a size of 570 kDa in COS7 cells from the PCMV promoter. Plasmids S503 and S3 (gifts from Drs. Michelle Henderson and CKW Watts, Garvan Institute of Medical Research) were used to express N-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length human UBR5 and its truncated derivative UBR5-(889-1877) in mammalian cells from PSV40 promoter.

Escherichia coli clps gene was amplified using genomic DNA from the strain DH5α cells (Invitrogen). The wheat germ lysate containing amino acids, RNA polymerases, DNA templates, and [35S]methionine (Amersham Bioscience) was incubated for 24 h at 25 °C in the CECF unit. Glycerol (50 μl) was added to the reaction mixture (50 μl) to stabilize expressed proteins. To evaluate the level of synthesized proteins, the incorporated 35S was counted using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Synthesized proteins were stored at -20 °C and used for assays within 3 days. Proteins were also expressed using the transcription-translation-coupled TnT system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (10Tasaki T. Mulder L.C. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A.

The X-peptide Pull-down Assay—For the X-peptide pull-down assay, a set of 12-mer peptides (X-peptides) bearing N-terminal Arg (type 1), Phe (type 2), Trp (type 2), or Gly (stabilizing control) residues were cross-linked through the C-terminal Cys residue to Ultralink Iodoacetyl beads (Pierce) as described previously (10Tasaki T. Mulder L.C. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, left). The ratio of peptides to beads was ∼1 μmol of peptides per 1-ml beads. Alternatively, the otherwise identical 12-mer peptides, bearing C-terminal biotinylated Lys instead of Cys, were conjugated, via biotin, to streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience) to a ratio of 1-1.5 μmol of peptides per 1 ml of beads (Fig. 1B, right). RTS wheat germ lysates (50 μl) expressing 35S-labeled proteins were diluted 2-fold and centrifuged to remove precipitates. An aliquot (10-20 μl) of soluble extract, containing 50-100 μg of total protein, was diluted in 250 μl of binding buffer A (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.15 m KCl, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9) and mixed with X-peptide beads (7.5-μl packed volume for cross-linked peptide beads or 10-μl packed volume for biotinylated peptide beads). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with a gentle rotation in the presence or absence of dipeptides. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,400 × g for 30 s, washed three times with 0.25 ml of binding buffer A, resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 55 °C for 30 min. To analyze the binding property of endogenous UBR proteins, extracts from mouse testes were prepared and subjected to the X-peptide pull-down assay essentially as described (10Tasaki T. Mulder L.C. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). COS7 cell extracts expressing UBR proteins were diluted to ∼1.0 mg/ml in binding buffer A for pull-down assays. Denatured proteins in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were separated in 10% BisTris acrylamide gel with MES buffer, followed by fixing with solution A (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water) for 20 min and subsequently with solution B (25% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water) for 10 min. The 35S-labeled proteins were detected using autoradiography or, for quantitation, using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to express 31 mutant 50-kDa UBR1-(1-453) proteins, each of which contained a mutation to alanine (Ala), by using overlap extension PCR (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Two first round PCRs, with primers containing mismatch nucleotides, generated two DNA fragments with overlap extension of 15-24 bp. PCR primer sequences are available upon request. The second round PCR, using two DNA fragments from the first round PCRs as templates, yielded a single chimeric DNA fragment containing a mutation to Ala. The resulting PCR fragments were used as templates in the third PCR to generate the PT7 promoter-based linear DNA templates for the RTS protein expression system. The final mutant DNA fragments were evaluated by sequencing. Bacterial Expression and Purification of MBP-UBR1-(91-191)-His6 and MBP-His6—A cDNA fragment encoding C-terminal His6-tagged UBR1-(91-191) was subcloned into a bacterial expression vector pMAL-c4X (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA) that expresses maltose-binding protein (MBP). The resulting plasmid pMalUBRbox expresses MBP-UBR1-(91-191)-His6. MBP-UBR1-(91-191)-His6 and its control, MBP-His6, were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and subjected to two-step purification using amylose-resin column chromatography (New England Biolabs) and cobalt-Sepharose column chromatography (Pierce). Purified proteins (5 μg) were subjected to the X-peptide pull-down assay for 1 h in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) Assay—The direct surface plasmon resonance was measured using a Biacore T100 biosensor (GE Healthcare). Prior to peptide loading, the surface of the SA sensor chip was conditioned by 4-5 washes of 1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 30 s to wash off nonspecifically or poorly bound streptavidin. Biotinylated Arg-peptide, Phe-peptide, and Gly-peptide, adjusted to 20 nm in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% P20 surfactant), were immobilized on the surface of the SA sensor chip at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to reach ∼200 response units. Purified MBP-UBR1-(91-191)-His6 and MBP-His6, adjusted to 5 μm in the binding buffer, were injected at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. After dissociation for 60 s, the surface was regenerated back to bound peptides by a 30-s injection of 50 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Kinetics experiments were performed using MBP-UBR1-(91-191)-His6 at varying concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.25, 2.5, and 3.13 μm). A duplicate concentration at 3.13 μm was used to determine cycle to cycle variability, and all data were double-referenced to a buffer-only control and a reference flow cell without biotinylated peptides. The data were fit using a 1:1 interaction model where A + B = AB, including terms for mass transport, using Biacore T100 Evaluation Software version 1.1.1. Binding Properties of UBR Proteins to Destabilizing N-terminal Residues—We employed X-peptide pull-down assays to characterize the binding specificities of UBR proteins for destabilizing N-terminal residues. X-peptide beads (X = Arg (type 1), Phe (type 2), or Gly (stabilizing control)) (Fig. 1B) were mixed with mouse testes extracts and precipitated by centrifugation, followed by immunoblotting to detect the presence of UBR proteins in precipitates. Arg-peptide captured endogenous UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 from testes extracts, whereas Phe-peptide brought down UBR1, UBR2, and UBR4, but not UBR5 (Fig. 1C, data not shown). None of these UBR proteins were detected in precipitates prepared by Gly-peptide. Thus, we confirmed that endogenous UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 can be captured by destabilizing N-terminal residues using a different experimental setting. (Because either method for peptide-bead conjugation, through C-terminal Cys or biotin, gave essentially the same results, the conjugation method is not specified in subsequent experiments.) The binding of UBR1 (Fig. 1D), UBR2, and UBR4 (data not shown) to the type-2 substrate Phe was not inhibited by increasing salt (NaCl) concentrations up to 1.0 m. This result indicates that type-2 substrate recognition involves hydrophobic interaction, consistent with type-2 N termini (Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile) being bulky “hydrophobic.” In contrast, the binding of UBR1 and UBR5 to the type-1 substrate Arg was significantly affected by salt concentrations at a range of 0.15-0.5 m (Fig. 1D), in agreement with type-1 substrates (Arg, Lys, and His) being “basic."
https://openalex.org/W2170535446,"Disease epidemics have caused extensive damage to tropical coral reefs and to the reef-building corals themselves, yet nothing is known about the abilities of the coral host to resist disease infection. Understanding the potential for natural disease resistance in corals is critically important, especially in the Caribbean where the two ecologically dominant shallow-water corals, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata, have suffered an unprecedented mass die-off due to White Band Disease (WBD), and are now listed as threatened under the US Threatened Species Act and as critically endangered under the IUCN Red List criteria. Here we examine the potential for natural resistance to WBD in the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis by combining microsatellite genotype information with in situ transmission assays and field monitoring of WBD on tagged genotypes. We show that six percent of staghorn coral genotypes (3 out of 49) are resistant to WBD. This natural resistance to WBD in staghorn corals represents the first evidence of host disease resistance in scleractinian corals and demonstrates that staghorn corals have an innate ability to resist WBD infection. These resistant staghorn coral genotypes may explain why pockets of Acropora have been able to survive the WBD epidemic. Understanding disease resistance in these corals may be the critical link to restoring populations of these once dominant corals throughout their range."
https://openalex.org/W2089543102,"Rab proteins influence vesicle trafficking pathways through the assembly of regulatory protein complexes. Previous investigations have documented that Rab11a and Rab8a can interact with the tail region of myosin Vb and regulate distinct trafficking pathways. We have now determined that a related Rab protein, Rab10, can interact with myosin Va, myosin Vb, and myosin Vc. Rab10 localized to a system of tubules and vesicles that have partially overlapping localization with Rab8a. Both Rab8a and Rab10 were mislocalized by the expression of dominant-negative myosin V tails. Interaction with Rab10 was dependent on the presence of the alternatively spliced exon D in myosin Va and myosin Vb and the homologous region in myosin Vc. Yeast two-hybrid assays and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies confirmed that Rab10 binding to myosin V tails in vivo required the alternatively spliced exon D. In contrast to our previous work, we found that Rab11a can interact with both myosin Va and myosin Vb tails independent of their splice isoform. These results indicate that Rab GTPases regulate diverse endocytic trafficking pathways through recruitment of multiple myosin V isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2014217689,"When an atom or molecule is ionized by an x-ray, highly excited states can be created that then decay, or autoionize, by ejecting a second electron from the ion. We found that autoionization after soft x-ray photoionization of molecular oxygen follows a complex multistep process. By interrupting the autoionization process with a short laser pulse, we showed that autoionization cannot occur until the internuclear separation of the fragments is greater than approximately 30 angstroms. As the ion and excited neutral atom separated, we directly observed the transformation of electronically bound states of the molecular ion into Feshbach resonances of the neutral oxygen atom that are characterized by both positive and negative binding energies. States with negative binding energies have not previously been predicted or observed in neutral atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1973217961,"Lumican and fibromodulin compete for collagen type I binding in vitro, and fibromodulin-deficient mice have 4-fold more lumican in tendons. These observations indicate that homologous sequences in lumican and fibromodulin bind to collagen type I. Here, we demonstrate that lumican binding to collagen type I is mediated mainly by Asp-213 in leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 7. The mutation D213N in lumican impairs interaction with collagen, and the lumican fragment spanning LRRs 5-7 is an efficient inhibitor of collagen binding. Also, the lumican LRR 7 sequence-based synthetic peptide CYLDNNKC inhibits the binding to collagen. Homologous collagen-binding site in fibromodulin, located in LRRs 5-7, inhibits the binding of lumican to collagen, and the mutation E251Q in this fibromodulin fragment does not inhibit the lumican-collagen binding. Lumican, but not the D213N mutation, lowers the melting point and affects the packing of collagen fibrils."

https://openalex.org/W1985206041,"The paralyzed zebrafish strain relaxed carries a null mutation for the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) beta(1a) subunit. Lack of beta(1a) results in (i) reduced membrane expression of the pore forming DHPR alpha(1S) subunit, (ii) elimination of alpha(1S) charge movement, and (iii) impediment of arrangement of the DHPRs in groups of four (tetrads) opposing the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a structural prerequisite for skeletal muscle-type excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. In this study we used relaxed larvae and isolated myotubes as expression systems to discriminate specific functions of beta(1a) from rather general functions of beta isoforms. Zebrafish and mammalian beta(1a) subunits quantitatively restored alpha(1S) triad targeting and charge movement as well as intracellular Ca(2+) release, allowed arrangement of DHPRs in tetrads, and most strikingly recovered a fully motile phenotype in relaxed larvae. Interestingly, the cardiac/neuronal beta(2a) as the phylogenetically closest, and the ancestral housefly beta(M) as the most distant isoform to beta(1a) also completely recovered alpha(1S) triad expression and charge movement. However, both revealed drastically impaired intracellular Ca(2+) transients and very limited tetrad formation compared with beta(1a). Consequently, larval motility was either only partially restored (beta(2a)-injected larvae) or not restored at all (beta(M)). Thus, our results indicate that triad expression and facilitation of 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) charge movement are common features of all tested beta subunits, whereas the efficient arrangement of DHPRs in tetrads and thus intact DHPR-RyR1 coupling is only promoted by the beta(1a) isoform. Consequently, we postulate a model that presents beta(1a) as an allosteric modifier of alpha(1S) conformation enabling skeletal muscle-type EC coupling."

Although already much is known about the role of ATP in fundamental processes of living systems, data about its compartmentalization are rather scarce, and we still have only very limited understanding of whether patterns in the distribution of intracellular ATP concentration (“ATP inhomogeneity”) do exist and have a regulatory role. Here we report on the analysis of coupling of local ATP supply to regulation of actomyosin behavior, a widespread and dynamic process with conspicuous high ATP dependence, which is central to cell shape changes and cell motility. As an experimental model, we use embryonic fibroblasts from knock-out mice without major ATP-ADP exchange enzymes, in which we (re)introduce the ATP/ADP exchange enzyme adenylate kinase-1 (AK1) and deliberately manipulate its spatial positioning by coupling to different artificial location tags. By transfection-complementation of AK1 variants and comparison with yellow fluorescent protein controls, we found that motility and spreading were enhanced in cells with AK1 with a focal contact guidance tag. Intermediary enhancement was observed in cells with membrane-targeted or cytosolic AK1. Use of a heterodimer-inducing approach for transient translocation of AK1 to focal contacts under conditions of constant global AK1 activity in the cell corroborated these results. Based on our findings with these model systems, we propose that local ATP supply in the cell periphery and “on site” fuelling of the actomyosin machinery, when maintained via enzymes involved in phosphoryl transfer, are codetermining factors in the control of cell motility.

Maintenance of adequate ATP supply is of crucial importance for the mechanisms of structural remodeling in cells with high shape plasticity, especially under high energy-demanding circumstances (1Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During processes like cell motility or phagocytosis, the cell movement and cellular shape changes require active restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton. By spatially controlled polymerization of ATP-bound G-actin monomers to the plus end of growing actin filaments and formation of multiple branches, a dense network is built, which is called the actin cortex, based on its specific localization within the cell (2Chhabra E.S. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In this network, ATP hydrolysis and release of Pi drive actin filament dynamics by modulating filament stability and determine nucleotide-dependent filament conformation and interaction(s) with regulatory actin-binding proteins (3Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, force generation needed for contraction and cell movement is controlled by myosin and nonmuscle myosin ATPases (4Volkmann N. Hanein D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and also upstream signaling, involving small GTPases, is contingent upon nucleotide exchange (5Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar). Taken together, actomyosin dynamics is overall an energy-demanding process, directly coupled to ATP availability. Indeed, actomyosin-based processes may consume a major fraction of cellular energy (6Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the coupling between global ATP supply and cytoskeletal dynamics seems reciprocal, because in tissues under ischemia, actomyosin activity is set in accordance with ATP availability (7Gourlay C.W. Ayscough K.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Against this background, it is an important question whether ATP-to-actomyosin coupling also acts at the subcellular level and could have a role in spatial control of cell dynamics. Studies in Physarum polycephalum pointed for the first time to a role for patterns in distribution of intracellular ATP concentration in the coordination of cell motility behavior, probably via effects on cytoskeletal dynamics (8Ueda T. Mori Y. Kobatake Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 169: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our recent work on the process of phagocytosis pointed in the same direction and gave new insight into how ATP production in cellular microdomains, mediated by brain-type creatine kinase-driven phosphotransfer, relates to local coordination of actin-based cell shape remodeling (9Kuiper J.W. Pluk H. Oerlemans F. van Leeuwen F.N. de Lange F. Fransen J. Wieringa B. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, our understanding of the significance of local distribution of ATP/ADP pools (i.e. inhomogeneity in intracellular [ATP]/[ADP]) and the diverse molecular mechanisms that contribute to patterning in distribution is still very limited. Here we study the supposed regulatory and codetermining role of ATP/ADP supply in microdomains further by analyzing its coupling to actomyosin-based activities in spatially confined areas in the cell cortex. We used manipulation of the intracellular positioning of the enzyme adenylate kinase-1 (AK1 4The abbreviations used are: AK1, adenylate kinase-1; BAK-/-, CK-B/AK1 double knock-out; CK-B, creatine kinase-B; EVH1, Ena-Vasp homology domain 1; FC, focal contact; FKBP, FK506 binding protein; FN, fibronectin; FRB, FKBP rapamycin-binding domain; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MYR, myristoylation domain; WT, wild type; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein.4The abbreviations used are: AK1, adenylate kinase-1; BAK-/-, CK-B/AK1 double knock-out; CK-B, creatine kinase-B; EVH1, Ena-Vasp homology domain 1; FC, focal contact; FKBP, FK506 binding protein; FN, fibronectin; FRB, FKBP rapamycin-binding domain; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MYR, myristoylation domain; WT, wild type; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein.; 2 ADP ↔ ATP + AMP (10Janssen E.

The Enzymes. 1973; (Boyer, P. D., ed) pp. , Academic Press, Inc., New York: 297-305Google Scholar), also used as an ATP sensor in the literature (12Yegutkin G.G. Mikhailov A. Samburski S.S. Jalkanen S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3378-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) as a tool to alter the intracellular landscape for ATP/ADP exchange and local fuelling by ATP. By testing the effects of different peripheral anchoring locations during cell motility, we provide new evidence for the idea that subcellular compartmentalization of ATP has an important role in cell shape control, presumably via regulation of local actomyosin behavior. Cell Culture—Primary fibroblasts derived from 16.5 days post coitum mouse embryos (from wild type or AK1/CK-B double knock-out (BAK-/-) strains) were immortalized pool-wise using standard 3T3 cultivation protocols. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Phoenix (HEK293) packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum. Retroviral Constructs and Transfections—Mouse AK1, focal contact (FC)-targeted AK1 (EVH1-AK1), myristoylation-tagged AK1 (MYR-AK1), and YFP controls were expressed from recombinant inserts, cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites of retroviral vector pLZRS-IRES-Zeo (13Michiels F. van der Kammen R.A. Janssen L. Nolan G. Collard J.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 295-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce location tags, we used PCR and primers with BamHI sites to generate a 345-bp segment from Ena-Vasp homology domain 1 (EVH1) from Mena (14Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) cDNA or a 50-bp myristoylation-domain segment from AK1β cDNA (15Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Marzinotto S. Monte M. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively, and fused these 5′-upstream of DNA segments encoding Myc-tagged versions of AK1 and YFP. Location tags were 115 amino acids (EVH1) and 14 amino acids (MYR) long and carried their own ATG codons. To avoid ambiguity in translation initiation, natural start codons in the AK1 and YFP open reading frames were substituted by alanine codons. To study effects of inducible translocation of AK1, we used the ARGENT regulated heterodimerization kit (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals) based on rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of FKBP- and FRB-tagged proteins. The FKBP fragment (316 bp) from the pC4EN-F1 plasmid (ARIAD) was PCR-amplified, provided with EcoRI/XhoI sites, and cloned into the pLZRS-IRES-Zeo behind the EVH1-Myc sequence to generate the targeting construct. To generate the vector for FRB-tagged AK1, a 276-bp FRB fragment was PCR-amplified from plasmid pC4-RhE (ARIAD) template DNA with primers containing BamHI/BglII sites and cloned into the BamHI site upstream of the Myc-tagged AK1 sequence in vector pLZRS-IRES-Zeo. Constructs and targeting principle are depicted in Fig. 4, A and B. Integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate viral particles, Phoenix (HEK293) cells were grown on poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated plates and transfected with retroviral pLZRS-IRES-Zeo constructs (5 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl; Invitrogen). After 8–16 h, medium with viral particles was harvested and filtered, Polybrene (5 μg/ml) was added, and the mixture was used to infect MEF-BAK-/-. After 24 h, medium was replaced by medium containing zeocin (450 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and cells were kept under permanent selection for at least 2 weeks. Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis were performed using standard procedures. Primary or secondary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-AK1 serum (1:5000) (16Janssen E. Kuiper J. Hodgson D. Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 256: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-Myc serum (1:100, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; University of Iowa), polyclonal anti-YFP (1:3000) (17Cuppen E. Wijers M. Schepens J. Fransen J. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3299-3308PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-Tubulin (1:2000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; University of Iowa), and goat anti-mouse IRDye800 (Rockland) or goat anti-rabbit Alexa680 (Molecular Probes), respectively. Staining signals were detected using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described (16Janssen E. Kuiper J. Hodgson D. Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 256: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-AK1 (rabbit serum, 1:3000), anti-Myc (mouse serum, 1:5), or monoclonal anti-vinculin (1:500; Sigma) and goat-anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 or -Alexa 568 (1:500, Molecular Probes), respectively. F-actin was visualized with phalloidin-Alexa 660 (1:300; Molecular Probes). Samples were analyzed on an Axiophot2 (Carl Zeiss) or a DMRA (Leica) fluorescence microscope using ×63 and ×100 oil immersion objectives. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. TIRF Microscopy—MEFs complemented with EVH1-YFP were trypsinized, resuspended in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and allowed to recover in suspension for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were plated on fibronectin (FN; 10 μg/ml)-coated WillCo dishes (WillCo Wells, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and microscopic time lapse imaging was performed using an Olympus IX2 microscope equipped with a laser-based TIRFM module. Cell Spreading Assay—Serum-starved cells were allowed to adhere and spread to FN-coated coverslips for 30 min, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with phalloidin-Texas Red (1:300; Molecular Probes), and co-stained with antibodies against vinculin and AK1. Ten random fields were imaged per coverslip with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope MRC1024 using a ×10 objective. The total area covered after spreading was determined by Adobe Photoshop software, and the average surface occupied per cell was calculated. Spreading efficiencies were calculated using MEF-YFP cells as control. Cell Migration Assays and Time Lapse Microscopy—Cell migration analysis was assessed as described elsewhere using FN (1 μg/ml)-coated coverslips (18Van Horssen R. Galjart N. Rens J.A. Eggermont A.M. ten Hagen T.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 1536-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Prior to the monitoring, MEFs were starved for 4–24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum and 5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin before basic fibroblast growth factor (200 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added to stimulate migration. Time lapse imaging was done for 24 h in a microscope stage incubator (Oko-Lab) on a Nikon DiaPhot microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C8484-05G digital camera. Images were taken every 10 min using TimeLapse Software (Oko-Lab), version 2.7, with a ×10 objective. Cells were tracked using Metamorph 6.1 measurement software (Universal Imaging Corp.) taking nuclei as reference. For each treatment, at least eight migrating cells of 3–5 independent assays were analyzed. The total track distance (T) and the direct distance from start to end point (D) were used to calculate D/T ratios reflecting the directionality of cell movements (19Pankov R. Endo Y. Even-Ram S. Araki M. Clark K. Cukierman E. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Single cell motility assays were performed using an automated multiwell cell tracking system, as described (20Krooshoop D.J. Torensma R. van den Bosch G.J. Nelissen J.M. Figdor C.G. Raymakers R.A. Boezeman J.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 280: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). AK Activity Assay—AK enzyme activity measurements were done as described (16Janssen E. Kuiper J. Hodgson D. Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 256: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP Measurements—Cellular ATP levels were measured using the luciferase-based CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) according the manufacturer's protocol. 20,000–40,000 cells were lysed in freshly prepared CellTiter-Glo reagent, and ATP levels were calculated using an ATP standard curve. Luminescence was recorded using a LUMIstar Optima luminometer (BMG Labtech). Rapalog-induced Repositioning of AK1—We used the chemical dimerization strategy based on heterodimerization of FKBP and FRB protein domains by rapalog (21Castellano F. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Gouin E. Machesky L. Cossart P. Chavrier P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to reposition ATP/ADP exchange capacity in the cell. MEF-BAK-/-, stably transfected with EVH1-FKBP and empty MEF-BAK-/- cells (control), were retrovirally transduced with FRB-AK1 and directly (passages 2–8) used for motility and immunofluorescence studies. Rapalog-treated (200 nm; ARIAD) and nontreated cells were analyzed for subcellular positioning of AK1, and cell migration was monitored. Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 3–6 independent experiments. Groups were compared with Student’s t test for single values, ratio t test for ratio values, and one-sample t test for relative values and considered significantly different when p was <0.05. Expression and Localization of (Targeted) AK1 in MEFs— MEFs derived from BAK-/- mice were used to generate cell lines expressing nontargeted (cytosolic), FC-targeted, and membrane-targeted AK1. The BAK-/- background was chosen, because AK1- and CK-B-catalyzed reactions share ATP-generating capacity and thus show redundancy in function. AK1 and CK-B are the only members of their respective families occurring at detectable levels in the cytosol of WT MEFs. Here we restricted ourselves to the analysis of the role of AK1 alone. Transduction of MEF-BAK-/- cells with retroviral expression vectors for the different AK1 variants or YFP controls (Fig. 1A) yielded pools of cells that were designated MEF-AK1, MEF-EVH1-AK1, or MEF-MYR-AK1. As shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), proteins of the correct size were produced, at expression levels of EVH1- and MYR-tagged AK1 that were roughly 2–3 times higher than that of endogenous AK1 in WT MEFs. Only in MEF-EVH1-AK1 cells an additional truncated extra protein was produced, but we know that this product results from use of an internal ATG start codon within the EVH1 sequence. Because the majority of the AK1 molecules appeared as a tagged form, no further action was taken on this point. For the YFP controls, we noted a lower expression of the EVH1-YFP variant compared with the nontargeted and MYR-YFP protein (Fig. 1B). Enzymatic activity assays (Fig. 1C) revealed that the total ATP-generating capacity in cells with EVH1- or MYR-tagged AK1 variants was lower than in MEF-AK1 but considerably higher than in MEF-YFP controls. Activity was completely inhibited by Ap5A, a potent AK inhibitor. Of note, the total cellular ATP level remained virtually unchanged upon complementation with WT or tagged AK1 and was determined at 0.025 ± 0.013 pmol/cell for MEF-BAK-/- cells and at 0.018 ± 0.012, 0.017 ± 0.009, and 0.015 ± 0.004 pmol/cell for MEF-AK1, MEF-EVH1-AK1, and MEF-MYR-AK1 cells, respectively (values of three independent experiments ± S.D.; no significant differences). In hindsight this is not a surprising finding, since the role of AK is in ADP-ATP exchange and the setting of the cell's energy charge does not necessarily change upon transfection of cells in culture. AK1 is reported to be a monomeric cytosolic protein, which also occurs in trace amounts on nuclear and vesicular membranes (22Ruan Q. Chen Y. Gratton E. Glaser M. Mantulin W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3177-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our retrovirally transduced cells, we found AK1 (like the YFP control) smoothly distributed across the cytosol, with an apparent concentration around nuclei, close to membranes of the Golgi compartment (Fig. 1, D and E). For EVH1-AK1 and EVH1-YFP, we found, besides a cytosolic localization, a strong accumulation at structures resembling FC (Fig. 1, D and E), where these proteins co-localized with vinculin (Fig. 1, F and G). Strikingly, for EVH1-AK1, co-localization was mostly observed in the cell periphery, whereas we also found FC that stained positive for vinculin only (Fig. 1F). For EVH1-YFP, we observed some FC that stained mutually exclusively for YFP or vinculin (Fig. 1G). Only a small fraction of EVH1-protein decorated FC at any given time point. As anticipated, (re)addition of the AK1β-derived MYR tag drove proteins into membrane anchoring, exactly as reported for the natural variant (15Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Marzinotto S. Monte M. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Janssen E. Kuiper J. Hodgson D. Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 256: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both MYR-AK1 and MYR-YFP showed a punctuate distribution pattern, with protein decorating vesicular and plasma membranes (Fig. 1, D and E). Live imaging of MEF-MYR-YFP cells confirmed that the small cluster-like structures represent (mobile) vesicles (data not shown). Dynamics of EVH1 Targeting during Cell Spreading—To obtain an in depth picture for timing of targeting, we analyzed MEF-EVH1-YFP cells during adherence to FN with TIRF microscopy. During early spreading (20 min), EVH1-YFP appeared in dotlike structures, which were preferentially located at the cell periphery (Fig. 2A, arrowheads), resembling immature FC, also known as spreading initiation centers (23de Hoog C.L. Foster L.J. Mann M. Cell. 2004; 117: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mature focal adhesions with a more elongated shape were abundantly present at 120 min (Fig. 2B, arrows). Maturation of dotlike structures into elongated FC was followed by video recording (Fig. 2C and supplemental Movie 1). Our data show that fusing proteins to the EVH1 domain results in effective targeting to FC during cell spreading, with apparently no detrimental effects on the spreading process proper. We conclude that our strategy of deliberate swapping of cellular positioning of AK1 forms a reliable basis to study effects of spatial rewiring of ATP/ADP supply capacity. ATP/ADP Exchange Capacity Determines Cell Spreading— To assess the functional-modulatory effects of changes in local ATP supply on cytoskeletal behavior, we first tested adherence-spreading ability of the different cells. Comparison of spreading ability revealed no differences between MEF-AK1 and MEF-YFP (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly, for cells with targeted AK1, we found that expression of EVH1-AK1, but not MYR-AK1, induced a small but significant (p = 0.0357, n = 4) increase of ∼25% in the area over which spreading occurred. Targeting of EVH1-AK1 during spreading proceeded as anticipated, as confirmed by staining for AK1 and vinculin (Fig. S1). These findings suggest that the ATP/ADP exchange activity of AK1, when brought to spatially restricted areas in the cell cortex, codetermines spreading behavior. ATP/ADP Exchange Capacity Determines Cell Motility—To study other effects of changes in local ATP/ADP on cell behavior, we used the barrier assay for cell motility analysis (18Van Horssen R. Galjart N. Rens J.A. Eggermont A.M. ten Hagen T.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 1536-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all AK1-complemented MEFs showed significant increased migration as compared with YFP controls (Fig. 3A). Highest stimulation of motility was observed in MEF-EVH1-AK1 cells (∼530 μm in 24 h; Fig. 3A). Also for MEF-MYR-AK1 cells, the increase in motility compared with MEF-AK1, was significant. Experiments using conventional single cell motility assays confirmed the activating effect of EVH1-AK1, although effects were less evident (Fig. S2). All YFP control cells behaved comparably, with migration distances around 250 μm (Fig. 3A). Directionality of cell movements was slightly higher for MEF-EVH1-AK1 (Fig. 3B). Migration morphology revealed minor differences (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Movies 2–7). Consistently, MYR-targeted cells appeared somewhat bigger in culture. Still images of fixed cells, captured at different phases in the cyclic motility process, revealed that the typical AK1 distribution patterns with cytosolic, FC, or membrane accumulation were globally preserved for all complemented MEF but that variation in enzyme location occurred during motility (Fig. S3, A–C). For example, in MEF-EVH1-AK1 cells, dotlike foci in leading edges were seen, resembling newly formed FC, and AK1 staining in mature FC disappeared over time (Fig. S3B). Importantly, co-staining experiments with phalloidin revealed that AK1 never co-localized with static F-actin in stress fibers (Fig. S3D). Instead, EVH1-AK1 remained concentrated at cell peripheral endings of stress fibers, where the more dynamic actin resides. MYR-AK1 was mainly located at the rim of the leading edge shortly after migration induction. AK1 and MYR-AK1 also locally accumulated in intracellular vesicles, at the cell periphery and retracting tails (Fig. S3, asterisks). Effects of Inducible Translocation of ATP/ADP Exchange Capacity on Cell Motility—To obtain better control over background variation in global ATP/ADP exchange activity and the time frame in which the effects of (re)location of AK1 can be induced, we next used rapamycin-analog (rapalog)-mediated heterodimerization of FRB (domain of mTOR that binds FKBP12) and FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein) to transiently translocate AK1 (21Castellano F. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Gouin E. Machesky L. Cossart P. Chavrier P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Effects of shifting AK1 location were studied for the EVH1 derivative only, the location tag that gave the most prominent effects in previous experiments. To create host cells with an acceptor-destination target, BAK-/- cells were first transduced with a retroviral vector encoding an EVH1-FKBP12 fusion protein. These host cells were infected again, now with FRB-AK1. Constructs and concept are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. Comparison of immunofluorescent staining patterns before and after the addition of rapalog revealed that our experimental design was successful, because a substantial fraction of FRB-AK1 molecules translocated from the cytosol to FC-located EVH1-FKBP partners (Fig. 4C, arrows). This inducible repositioning of FRB-AK1 in MEF-EVH1-FKBP cells had a strong effect on migration distance, as demonstrated by the significant increase in migratory activity in 24 h (p = 0.0009, n = 4; Fig. 4, D and E). Strikingly, migration distances observed in cells with and without rapalog accurately overlapped with those of MEF-AK1 and MEF-EVH1-AK1 (see Fig. 3A). Since by this set of experiments we have managed to uncouple effects of enzyme level and activity from effects of enzyme location, we conclude that (re)positioning of the ATP/ADP exchange capacity indeed forms a distinct condition that, among others, determines the motility properties of cells. Experimental Model System—To design a new experimental setting for the study of coupling between local ATP supply and cell dynamics, we developed a transfection complementation strategy with AK1 fusion proteins in MEFs derived from BAK-/-) mice. Both AK1 and CK-B are principal enzymes for offering fuel-demanding systems access to locally produced ATP (10Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S. Terjung R.R. Wieringa B. Terzic A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6371-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B. Cell. 1993; 74: 621-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and their removal therefore gave us the opportunity to study effects of redistribution of enzymatic ATP/ADP exchange capacity without background effects. To achieve altered distribution patterning over cytosol and cell cortical areas, we provided AK1 (or YFP controls) with an N-terminal tag from the EVH1 domain of Mena, a protein known to localize at filopodial tips, leading edges, and FC (14Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) or with a MYR sequence derived from a known natural isoform of AK1, AK1β (16Janssen E. Kuiper J. Hodgson D. Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2004; 256: 59-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EVH1 domain was chosen, because FCs are known as centers of high local actin polymerization activity during assembly, maturation, and disassembly of adhesion (de)formation (25Choi C.K. Vicente-Manzanares M. Zareno J. Whitmore L.A. Mogilner A. Horwitz A.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Use of the MYR domain as tag would allow us to bring the ATP supply capacity of AK1 into a near membrane position. Both tags drive ATP supply close to regions of cortical actomyosin activity needed for membrane protrusion and cell migratory activity.

This increase of the serum adiponectin levels has been hypothesized to be related to the rimonabant-induced amelioration of insulin resistance linked to obesity, although experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we generated adiponectin knock-out (adipo(-/-))ob/ob mice. After 21 days of 30 mg/kg rimonabant, the body weight and food intake decreased to similar degrees in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice. Significant improvement of insulin resistance was observed in the ob/ob mice following rimonabant treatment, associated with significant up-regulation of the plasma adiponectin levels, in particular, of high molecular weight adiponectin. Amelioration of insulin resistance in the ob/ob mice was attributed to the decrease of glucose production and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver induced by rimonabant but not to increased glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the rimonabant-treated adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice also exhibited significant amelioration of insulin resistance, although the degree of improvement was significantly lower as compared with that in the ob/ob mice. The effects of rimonabant on the liver metabolism, namely decrease of glucose production and activation of AMPK, were also less pronounced in the adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice. Thus, it was concluded that rimonabant ameliorates insulin resistance via both adiponectin-dependent and adiponectin-independent pathways.

There is a demand for effective and safe anti-obesity agents that can produce and maintain weight loss and improve the metabolic syndrome.

The results of the RIO-Lipids study provided evidence of a weight loss-independent effect of rimonabant on the plasma adiponectin levels (15Després J.P. Golay A. Sjöström L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 2121-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the metabolic improvements induced by rimonabant could be attributed, at least in part, to a moderate but significant increase in the plasma circulating adiponectin levels (15Després J.P. Golay A. Sjöström L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 2121-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). However, whether the rimonabant-induced increase in the plasma levels of adiponectin might be causally involved in the effects of rimonabant, in particular its insulin-sensitizing effects, has not been addressed experimentally. To address this issue, in the present study, we used adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (30Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H. Yano W. Ogata H. Tokuyama K. Takamoto I. Mineyama T. Ishikawa M. Moroi M. Sugi S. Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Noda T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8748-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to investigate whether rimonabant might be capable of ameliorating insulin resistance in the absence of adiponectin. We found that rimonabant significantly decreased the body weight and food intake to similar degrees in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice. Furthermore, we found significant amelioration of the insulin resistance in the ob/ob mice, in association with significant up-regulation of the serum adiponectin levels after 21 days of treatment with rimonabant at 30 mg/kg, body weight. The amelioration of insulin resistance in the ob/ob mice was attributed to the decrease of glucose production and activation of AMPK in the liver but not the increased glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle, induced by the drug. Interestingly, insulin resistance was also significantly, although only partially, improved in the adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice. Thus, the results suggest that rimonabant ameliorates insulin resistance via both adiponectin-dependent and adiponectin-independent pathways. Animals and Genotyping—The mice were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed standard chow, CE-2 (CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The composition of the chow was as follows: 25.6% (w/w) protein, 3.8% fiber, 6.9% ash, 50.5% carbohydrates, 4% fat, and 9.2% water. Ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice were generated by intercrossing adipo(+/-)ob/+ mice. All the mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background (30Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H.

The animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo. Rimonabant Treatment Study—Rimonabant (SR141716) or vehicle (0.1% Tween 80 in saline) was administered to ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight by oral gavage, once daily for 21 consecutive days. Rimonabant was kindly provided by Sanofi-Aventis (Montpellier, France). We measured the body weights and food intake of the mice once daily for 21 consecutive days. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Study—Clamp studies were carried out as described previously (30Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H. Yano W. Ogata H. Tokuyama K. Takamoto I.

In brief, 2 days before the study, an infusion catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia induced by sodium pentobarbital. Studies were performed on the mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after 8 h of fasting. A primed continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) was administered (25.0 milliunits/kg/min), and the blood glucose concentration, monitored every 5 min, was maintained at 100-130 mg/dl by administration of glucose (5 g of glucose/10 ml enriched to ∼20% with [6,6-2H2]glucose (Sigma)) for 120 min. Blood was sampled via tail tip bleeds at 90, 105, and 120 min for determination of the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd). Rd was calculated according to nonsteady-state equations (30Kubota N.

Western Blot Analysis—Tissues were excised and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The sample buffer for analysis under reducing conditions was composed of 3% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Samples were mixed with 5× sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min for heat denaturation, separated on polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were detected with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the Akt and AMPK phosphorylation and protein levels, lysates of liver and muscle were analyzed using anti-phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) antibody, anti-phospho-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), and anti-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) antibodies. For the analysis under nonreducing conditions, 2-mercaptoethanol was excluded from the sample buffer described above. To examine the isoforms of adiponectin, the serum samples were diluted 20-fold. Anti-mouse adiponectin antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with the globular domain of mouse recombinant adiponectin produced in Escherichia coli (21Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y.

Tissue Sampling for Insulin Signaling Pathway Study—Mice were anesthetized after 16 h of starvation, and 0.05 unit of human insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) was injected into the inferior vena cava. After 5 min, the liver was removed, and the specimens were used for protein extraction as described above. Plasma Adiponectin and Lipid Measurements—The mice were deprived of access to food for 16 h before the measurements. The plasma adiponectin levels were determined with a mouse adiponectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Serum triglyceride and free fatty acids (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were assayed by enzymatic methods. Measurement of Adipocyte Size—Epididymal white adipose tissue and subcutaneous fat were routinely processed for paraffin embedding, and 4-μm sections were cut and mounted on silanized slides. The adipose tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the total adipocyte area was manually traced and analyzed using the Win ROOF software (Mitani Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan). The white adipocyte area was measured in 200 or more cells/mouse in each group, in accordance with a previously described method (30Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H. Yano W.

Oil Red O Staining and Quantification—Lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 6-μm frozen sections of the liver fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, according to a previously described method (33Kubota N.

After an additional wash for 1 min with 60% isopropyl alcohol, the livers were stained for 10 min at 37 °C with freshly diluted Oil Red O solution (6 parts of Oil Red O stock solution and 4 parts of H2O; the Oil Red O stock solution contained 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropyl alcohol). After one wash for 2 min with 60% isopropyl alcohol and one wash for 1 min with H2O, the livers were stained for 5 min with hematoxylin. The stain was then washed off with running water, and the silanized slides were stained. Oil Red O staining was quantified on digital images. Color images were acquired with a Nikon digital camera and analyzed using the Image J software. The percentage of the area of Oil Red O staining was measured from 9-10 different sections/mouse in each experimental group. Values were expressed as percentage of area. Analysis of O2 Consumption—Oxygen consumption was measured every 3 min for 24 h in the fasting mice using an O2/CO2 metabolism measurement device (model MK-5000; Muromachikikai, Tokyo, Japan). After rimonabant treatment for 21 days, each mouse was placed in a sealed chamber (560-ml volume) with an air flow rate of 500 ml/min at room temperature. The amount of oxygen consumed was converted to ml/min by multiplying it with the flow rate. RNA Preparation and Taqman PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues in vivo with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove genomic DNA, cDNA was synthesized with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was prepared from 3T3L1 cells in vitro with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Co., Düsseldorf, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA levels were quantitatively analyzed by fluorescence-based reverse transcriptase-PCR. The reverse transcription mixture was amplified with specific primers using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector equipped with a thermocycler. The primers used for MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), resistin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A, the hepatic isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, protein phosphatase 2C, and cyclophilin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The relative expression levels were compared by normalization to the expression levels of cyclophilin. Cell Culture and Differentiation of 3T3L1 Adipocytes and Rimonabant Treatment—3T3L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.25 units/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 2 days, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.025 units/ml insulin. All studies were performed on adipocytes 10 days after the initiation of differentiation (Day 0). Rimonabant treatment (100 nm and 1 μm) was started on Day 0, and DMSO was used as the vehicle. Prior to the start of the experiments, the differentiated adipocytes were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose for 16 h at 37 °C. Absence of Adiponectin Had No Effect on Rimonabant-induced Suppression of Body Weight and Daily Food Intake—The body weight gain was similar between the untreated ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 1A), as reported previously (30Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kubota T. Kumagai H. Itoh S. Satoh H. Yano W. Ogata H. Tokuyama K. Takamoto I. Mineyama T. Ishikawa M. Moroi M. Sugi S. Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Noda T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8748-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The food intake was also comparable between the untreated ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 1B). Rimonabant significantly decreased the body weight and food intake to similar degrees in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 1, A and B). After 21 days of rimonabant treatment, both the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice weighed 10% less than the corresponding untreated mice (Fig. 1A). Moreover, rimonabant treatment significantly decreased the white adipose tissue (WAT) mass in both subcutaneous and visceral (epididymal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal) fat to similar degrees in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the presence of adiponectin is required for the reduction of the average adipocyte size induced by rimonabant treatment, we histologically analyzed the epididymal fat pad and subcutaneous WAT after fixation and quantitation of the adipocyte size. The distribution of the adipocyte size in the rimonabant-treated ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice was similarly narrowed to that in the untreated ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 1, D and E), and rimonabant treatment significantly reduced the average adipocyte size in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice to a similar degree (Fig. 1F). These findings indicate that the absence of adiponectin had no effect on either the rimonabant-induced decrease of the body weight or the food intake of the mice and that rimonabant treatment can induce a reduction of adipocyte size in the absence of adiponectin or leptin or both. Rimonabant Increased the Energy Expenditure and Decreased the Serum Triglyceride and Free Fatty Acid Levels to a Similar Degree in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob Mice—In addition to suppressing food intake, rimonabant has been demonstrated to increase the energy expenditure (10Liu Y.L.

Liu J. Zhou L. Godlewski G. Harvey-White J. Jeong W. Batkai S. Marsicano G. Lutz B. Buettner C. Kunos G. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3160-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Since the involvement of adiponectin in this action of rimonabant remains unclear, we investigated the effects of rimonabant on energy expenditure. First, we measured the rectal temperature in the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice. The temperature was essentially the same (Fig. 2A), and rimonabant treatment significantly increased the rectal temperature of the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice to a similar degree (Fig. 2A). Second, we investigated the oxygen consumption after 21-day treatment with rimonabant and found that in the dark phase of the daily light cycle, rimonabant increased the energy expenditure to a similar degree in both the ob/ob and adipo(-/-)ob/ob mice (Fig. 2B). This effect of rimonabant on the energy expenditure in the ob/ob mice did not require the presence of adiponectin. We next investigated the effects of rimonabant treatment on the serum lipid levels. In addition to reducing the body weight, rimonabant has been demonstrated to reduce the serum triglyceride (TG) (15Després J.P. Golay A. Sjöström L. N. Engl. J.

We investigated the relative influence of these two deterministic filters on the phenotypic structure of insectivorous bat ensembles in southern Africa. We used null models to simulate the random phenotypic patterns expected in the absence of competition or prey defences and analysed the deviations of the observed phenotypic pattern from these expected random patterns. The phenotypic structure at local scales exhibited non-random patterns consistent with both competition and prey defense hypotheses. There was evidence that competition influenced body size distribution across ensembles. Competition also influenced wing and echolocation patterns in ensembles and in functional foraging groups with high species richness or abundance. At the same time, prey defense filters influenced echolocation patterns in two species-poor ensembles. Non-random patterns remained evident even after we removed the influence of body size from wing morphology and echolocation parameters taking phylogeny into account. However, abiotic filters such as geographic distribution ranges of small and large-bodied species, extinction risk, and the physics of flight and sound probably also interacted with biotic filters at local and/or regional scales to influence the community structure of sympatric bats in southern Africa. Future studies should investigate alternative parameters that define bat community structure such as diet and abundance to better determine the influence of competition and prey defences on the structure of insectivorous bat ensembles in southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2114559322,"Calcium-binding protein 1 (CaBP1), a neuron-specific member of the calmodulin (CaM) superfamily, modulates Ca2+-dependent activity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Here we present NMR structures of CaBP1 in both Mg2+-bound and Ca2+-bound states and their structural interaction with InsP3Rs. CaBP1 contains four EF-hands in two separate domains. The N-domain consists of EF1 and EF2 in a closed conformation with Mg2+ bound at EF1. The C-domain binds Ca2+ at EF3 and EF4, and exhibits a Ca2+-induced closed to open transition like that of CaM. The Ca2+-bound C-domain contains exposed hydrophobic residues (Leu132, His134, Ile141, Ile144, and Val148) that may account for selective binding to InsP3Rs. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis reveals a Ca2+-induced binding of the CaBP1 C-domain to the N-terminal region of InsP3R (residues 1-587), whereas CaM and the CaBP1 N-domain did not show appreciable binding. CaBP1 binding to InsP3Rs requires both the suppressor and ligand-binding core domains, but has no effect on InsP3 binding to the receptor. We propose that CaBP1 may regulate Ca2+-dependent activity of InsP3Rs by promoting structural contacts between the suppressor and core domains."

There is considerable interest in the precise molecular mechanisms that organisms use to directly sense CO2. Here we demonstrate that a mammalian recombinant G-protein-activated adenylyl cyclase and the related Rv1625c adenylyl cyclase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are specifically stimulated by CO2. Stimulation occurred at physiological concentrations of CO2 through increased kcat. CO2 increased the affinity of enzyme for metal co-factor, but contact with metal was not necessary as CO2 interacted directly with apoenzyme. CO2 stimulated the activity of both G-protein-regulated adenylyl cyclases and Rv1625c in vivo. Activation of G-protein regulated adenylyl cyclases by CO2 gave a corresponding increase in cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Comparison of the responses of the G-protein regulated adenylyl cyclases and the molecularly, and biochemically distinct mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase revealed that whereas G-protein-regulated enzymes are responsive to CO2, the soluble adenylyl cyclase is responsive to both CO2 and bicarbonate ion.

The predominant biologically active forms of Ci are CO2 and HCO3- and their relative contributions to the total Ci pool are pH-dependent. Biological roles for CO2 and HCO3- include photosynthetic carbon fixation (1Falkowski P.G. Raven J.A. Aquatic Photosynthesis. 2nd Ed.

Given its importance in biology, the identification of CO2 responsive signaling pathways is key to understanding how organisms cope with fluctuating CO2. Two seven transmembrane receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, have been shown to confer CO2 responsiveness in Drosophila neurons (6Jones W.D. Cayirlioglu P. Kadow I.G. Vosshall L.B.

Despite these impressive advances, no eukaryotic signaling enzymes unequivocally demonstrated to respond to CO2 have been identified. The mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) synthesizes the second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP and is directly stimulated by HCO3- (11Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Kelly J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Sunahara R.K. Taussig R. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 168-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The Class III ACs can be divided into four subclasses (a–d) based upon polymorphisms within the active site (19Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). sAC is a member of Class IIIb, a subclass characterized partly by replacement of a substrate binding Asp with Thr. The Class IIIa ACs include the mammalian G-protein-stimulated ACs and numerous prokaryotic examples. These have been previously assumed to be non-responsive to Ci (12Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). All prokaryotic Class IIIb ACs examined to date respond to Ci including enzymes from organisms as diverse as Anabaena PCC 7120, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Stigmatella aurantiaca, and Chloroflexus aurantiacus (20Cann M.J. Hammer A. Zhou J. Kanacher T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35033-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi M. Buck J. Levin L.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 503-509PubMed Google Scholar). Two Class IIIb ACs, Slr1991 of Synechocystis PCC 6803 and CyaB1 of Anabaena PCC 7120, have been proven to respond to CO2 and not HCO3-, giving rise to the idea of AC as a true gas-sensing molecule (22Hammer A.

The finding that Class IIIb ACs respond to CO2 and not HCO3- necessitates an examination of the assumption that G-protein-regulated ACs and related prokaryotic enzymes do not respond to Ci. Here we demonstrate, contrary to previous work, that a recombinant G-protein-regulated AC and the Class IIIa Rv1625c AC of M. tuberculosis H37Rv show a pH-dependent response to Ci due to specific stimulation by CO2 at physiologically relevant concentrations. CO2 interacted directly with the apoprotein and modulated the activity of both the prokaryotic enzyme and G-protein-regulated AC in vivo. Finally, we contrasted the responses of sAC- and G-protein-regulated ACs to different species of Ci and propose that the mammalian cAMP signaling pathway is able to discriminate between CO2 and HCO3- in vivo.

Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—AC assays were performed at 37 °C (Rv1625c204–443) or30 °C (7C1·2C2) in a final volume of 100 μl and contained 50 mm buffer, 2 mm [2,8-3H]cAMP (150 Bq), and [α-32P]ATP (25 kBq) if not stated otherwise (29Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were adjusted to maintain substrate utilization at <10%. The following buffers were used at pH 6.5 (Mes), pH 7.0–7.5 (Mops), and pH 8.0–8.5 (Tris-hydrochloride). Enzyme, buffer, and substrate were prepared at the appropriate pH. CO2 was quantified by titration against NaOH. Assay pH was stable over a period of at least 40 min. For dose-response experiments, NaHCO3 was added to the assay, and the CO2 concentration was calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and the total salt concentration was adjusted with NaCl. All errors correspond to the S.E. If absent, errors were smaller than the symbol used to depict the data point. Adenylyl Cyclase Assays at Ci Disequilibrium—For Ci disequilibrium assays, dissolved CO2 was prepared by bubbling into double-distilled H2O at 0 °C to saturation and quantified by titration against NaOH. NaHCO3 and NaCl were prepared in double-distilled H2O at 0 °C. CO2, HCO3-, or Cl– were subsequently added to the assay at 0 °C simultaneous with substrate to the required concentration. Buffer and substrate for assays were prepared at the appropriate pH and temperature for the experiment. pH changes in assays were monitored using a pH electrode (Biotrode; Hamilton) connected to a computer with a PC card (Orion Sensorlink). The pH was measured in a time-driven acquisition mode in assays identical to those used for biochemistry. All pH measurements were accurate to ± 0.02 pH units (manufacturers specifications). All errors correspond to the S.E. CO2 Activation of AC in Vivo—pCTXLacZ, a plasmid with lacZ expression driven from a cAMP-responsive promoter, and pQE30-Rv1625c204–443 (25Guo Y.L. Seebacher T.

Cells were grown in Luria broth with 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin, 50 μgml–1 kanamycin, and 5 μgml–1 tetracycline at 30 °C until an A600 of 0.6. Rv1625c204–443 protein production was induced with 30 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were pelleted at 4000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in Luria broth containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.1. Cell suspensions were bubbled with either 10% (v/v) CO2 in air or in air for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were disrupted with 0.1 mg of sodium deoxycholate and 1% (v/v) toluene and mixed for 10 min at 30 °C. The lysate was made up to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm ortho-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with 2 m sodium carbonate, and absorbance was read at 420 nm. A standard curve was generated using 0–250 μm ortho-nitrophenol. CO2 Binding Assays—1 ml of 50% (v/v) Sephadex G50 in 50 mm Mes, pH 6.5 (bed volume 0.5 ml), was pre-spun at 1500 × g for 30 s. A freshly prepared binding reaction of 23 nmol of protein, 30 mm NaH14CO3, pH 6.5, and 50 mm Mes, pH 6.5, (total volume 50 μl) was immediately added and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 30 s, and the flow-through collected into 50 μl of 2 m NaOH. Scintillation counting was used to measure 14C counts in the flow-through. Measurement of Intracellular pH—HEK 293T cells attached to a 24-mm diameter glass coverslip were loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) through exposure to 1 μm BCECF-AM (an acetoxymethyl ester derivative) for 30 min. Intracellular pH was measured by exciting a small patch of cells at 490 and 440 nm using a microspectroflourometric system and measuring emission at 535 nm. pHi was calibrated using the high potassium nigericin method (30Hegyi P. Rakonczay Z. Gray M.A. Argent B.E. Pancreas. 2004; 28: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). cAMP Accumulation in Vivo—HEK 293T cells were cultured in 12-well plates and labeled overnight with 1.5 μCi of [3H]adenine at 80–90% confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated at the required CO2 concentration in preincubation media (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 117 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, 10 mm sucrose, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Preincubation mixes were pre-gassed with the desired CO2 concentration and adjusted to pH 7.0. The assay was initiated after 30 min by the addition of agonist and incubated at the required CO2 concentration. Assays were stopped with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP. Products were quantified by twin column chromatography (29Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were harvested after treatment as above except in the absence of [3H]adenine and isobutylmethylxanthine. Immunoblotting was performed using standard methodologies with anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) and anti-α-tubulin as load control.

Nature. 1975; 254: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Rv1625c gene of M. tuberculosis encodes an enzyme consisting of six putative transmembrane helices and a single Class IIIa AC catalytic domain (25Guo Y.L. Seebacher T. Kurz U. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 37Reddy S.K. Kamireddi M. Dhanireddy K. Young L. Davis A. Reddy P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35141-35149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The predicted topology, therefore, resembles one-half of a mammalian G-protein-regulated AC enzyme. A further similarity arises in the active site where six key catalytic residues distributed among the two catalytic domains of the G-protein-regulated ACs are present in Rv1625c to generate a homodimeric enzyme with two active sites (Fig. 1a). The Class IIIa Rv1625c AC was reported to be insensitive to Ci under experimental conditions where HCO3- was the predominant form of Ci. We expressed the AC domain of Rv1625c as a recombinant protein (Rv1625c204–443) and investigated the response of enzyme to constant Ci at varying pH (Fig. 1b). Relative stimulation (Ci:Cl–) varied from less than 1 at pH 8.5 (0.1 mm CO2, 19.6 mm HCO3-, 0.3 mm CO2–3) to 6.3 at pH 6.5 (7.7 mm CO2, 12.3 mm HCO3-). Stimulation of Rv1625c specific activity was most evident below pH 7.5, explaining a failure to previously observe a stimulation with Ci (20Cann M.J. Hammer A. Zhou J. Kanacher T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35033-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A requirement for low pH to observe a response to Ci is consistent with a role for CO2 as the activating species but may also be due to the altered protonation status of Rv1625c204–443 limiting the ability of the enzyme to respond to HCO3- at higher pH. We, therefore, assayed Rv1625c204–443 under conditions of Ci disequilibrium to determine whether CO2 or HCO3- is the activating species (22Hammer A. Hodgson D.R. Cann M.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Cooper T.G. Filmer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1081-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC assays performed under conditions of Ci disequilibrium exploit the fact that acquisition of the CO2/HCO3- equilibrium is significantly slowed at low temperature. We defined conditions for assaying AC under conditions of disequilibrium by following the acquisition of the CO2/HCO3- equilibrium through measuring the pH of a weakly buffered (5 mm) Mes solution on the addition of 20 mm CO2 or NaHCO3 in the presence or absence of carbonic anhydrase at 0 °C (data not shown). 4P. D. Townsend, P. M. Holliday, D. R. W. Hodgson, and M. J. Cann, unpublished observations. In this manner we defined conditions for assaying AC under conditions of disequilibrium using 20 mm CO2 or HCO3- as a 10-s assay period at 0 °C after the addition of Ci. Under these conditions, Ci is predominantly in the form added to the assay (CO2 or HCO3-) and has not significantly advanced toward the equilibrium determined by assay pH (clamped with 100 mm Mes in the actual AC assays). Control experiments demonstrated that under the conditions used for the assay final pH was equivalent when either CO2, HCO3-, or Cl– were added, demonstrating that any observed stimulation was due to addition of Ci and not a change in assay pH (Fig. 1c; inset). Ci disequilibrium assays proved that Rv1625c204–443 responded to CO2 and not HCO3- (Fig. 1c). This demonstrates that a Class IIIa AC is able to respond to Ci and confirms that the response is to CO2, as with Class IIIb ACs. Given the similarity in response to CO2 seen in Rv1625c204–443 and Class IIIb ACs, we examined the kinetic parameters for Rv1625c and compared them to the Class IIIb ACs (Table 1). CO2 stimulated Rv1625c204–443 specific activity through an increase in kcat, similar to findings with Class IIIb ACs, supporting the idea that the two subclasses share a similar mechanism of response to CO2 (20Cann M.J. Hammer A. Zhou J. Kanacher T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35033-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Hammer A. Hodgson D.R. Cann M.J. Biochem.

Concentrations over 12 mm caused a gradual decrease in specific activity from this peak, making an EC50 impossible to unambiguously calculate. Stimulation was significant to a 95% confidence interval at 1.9 mm CO2.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for Rv1625c204–443 and 7C1·2C2ParameterRv1625204-4437C1·2C2Cl-CO2Cl-CO2Vmax (nmol of cAMP mg-1 min-1)30.4 ± 0.876.0 ± 2.844.9 ± 2.876.4 ± 4.1Km[ATP] (mm) (S.D.)0.54 ± 0.021.72 ± 0.091.89 ± 0.252.04 ± 0.23kcat (s-1)5.914.66.410.7 Open table in a new tab Given the clear relationship between Rv1625c and the Class IIIb ACs with respect to the kinetics of activation in response to CO2, we investigated the activation mechanism. Mutation of a key substrate determining lysine (Lys-646) in the Class IIIb CyaB1 AC of Anabaena ablated the response of the enzyme to CO2 (20Cann M.J. Hammer A. Zhou J. Kanacher T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35033-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We generated recombinant protein for the corresponding mutation in Rv1625c (K296A) and assessed its response to CO2. Surprisingly, Rv1625c204–443 K296A retained responsiveness to CO2. 4P. D. Townsend, P. M. Holliday, D. R. W. Hodgson, and M. J. Cann, unpublished observations. This finding was not unique to Rv1625c as the corresponding mutation in the Class IIIb Slr1991 AC of Synechocystis (K177A) was also responsive to CO2. 4P. D. Townsend, P. M. Holliday, D. R. W. Hodgson, and M. J. Cann, unpublished observations. It is plausible that the substrate determining lysine is not actually a direct site of action for CO2, and we sought evidence for an alternative binding site. Ci has been proposed to help recruit the second metal ion to the active site of the Class IIIb CyaC AC of Spirulina platensis (39Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Assay of Rv1625c204–443 at varying Mn2+ concentrations revealed that CO2 increased the slope of the dose response (6.6) compared with NaCl (3.0), indicating an increase in cooperativity between binding sites (Fig. 2a). On the basis of their findings in CyaC, Steegborn et al. (39Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) suggested that Ci interacted directly with an active site metal ion. Given our findings on Mn2+ recruitment for Rv1625c, we further investigated this hypothesis. Attempts to identify the metal co-factor as a site of CO2 interaction through enzyme assay proved uninformative, and we, therefore, developed an alternative methodology. Radiolabeled CO2 bound to protein has been previously recovered after mixing and rapid gel filtration (40Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5599-5601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, performed a binding analysis to examine the requirements for CO2 binding to enzyme. CO2 bound Rv1625204–443 with no requirement for metal or substrate (Fig. 2b). Identical results were obtained for the Class IIIb ACs Slr1991 and CyaB1. 4P. D. Townsend, P. M. Holliday, D. R. W. Hodgson, and M. J. Cann, unpublished observations. Control proteins including bovine serum albumin and an alternative hexahistidine-tagged protein 4P. D. Townsend, P. M. Holliday, D. R. W. Hodgson, and M. J. Cann, unpublished observations. showed recovery indistinguishable from buffer alone, indicating an absence of any specific CO2 binding. These data would appear to eliminate a requirement for metal in the active site for CO2 binding, but it is possible that metal co-purified with protein and remained bound to enzyme. We, therefore, investigated CO2 binding in a mutant protein in which both metal binding aspartate residues were mutated to alanine (39Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The low yield of protein for Rv1625c204–443 D256A/D300A made this experiment impossible for Rv1625c. We, therefore, performed the equivalent experiment in the mutant protein Slr1991120–337 D137A/D181A (Fig. 2c). This confirmed that CO2 binding occurred in the absence of metal despite the fact that the protein was catalytically inactive.4 At physiological pH and CO2 concentrations, only N-terminal α-amino groups and lysine side chain ∊-amino groups are likely to be sufficiently dissociated to react with CO2 (42Lorimer G.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This is borne out in crystal structures in which carbamates are formed at lysine side chain ∊-amino groups (e.g. Refs. 43Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It is also possible that changes in the local environment may permit arginine to participate in a CO2 binding site (46Cotelesage J.J.H. Puttick J. Goldie H. Rajabi B. Novakovski B. Delbaere L.T.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the hypothesis that Ci interacts with active site metal is incorrect and that future mechanistic studies should be directed toward sites within the apoprotein. No prokaryotic ACs have been demonstrated to respond in vivo to increases in CO2/HCO3-. This is of obvious importance if prokaryotic ACs are to be posited as sensors of CO2. A demonstration that Rv1625c is responsive to CO2 in vivo is problematic as the numerous ACs in Mycobacterium make specific effects on Rv1625c impossible to distinguish. We, therefore, monitored the activity of Rv1625c expressed in E. coli using a cAMP responsive lacZ reporter construct as a suitable alternative. Using cAMP-driven expression of lacZ as readout, we observed a consistent increase in Rv1625c204–443 activity at elevated CO2 (Fig. 2d). LacZ produced due to endogenous cAMP was not responsive to CO2 (Fig. 2d, Vector). As transcription of the E. coli cya gene (the Class I E. coli AC) is down-regulated by cAMP, expression of Rv1625c204–443 likely reduced endogenous cAMP production and eliminated the possibility that our observations were due to the endogenous Cya AC (47Inada T. Takahashi H. Mizuno T. Aiba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that a prokaryotic AC can be stimulated by CO2 in an intact bacterium and, thus, fulfils a key criterion for AC as a functional CO2 sensor in bacteria. Building on our findings with Rv1625c, we investigated CO2 as a stimulating ligand for a related mammalian G-protein regulated AC, an experiment of some importance as CO2-stimulated signaling enzymes are not known in eukaryotes (7C1·2C2; Fig. 1a). We investigated the response of 7C1·2C2 to 20 mm total Ci over the pH range 6.5–8.5 (Fig. 3a). Similar to Rv1625c, optimal stimulation of 7C1·2C2 by Ci occurred at low pH, suggesting a direct response to CO2. Assay under conditions of Ci disequilibrium prov"

CAPS1 appears to have an additional and as yet unexplained function in vesicular catecholamine uptake or storage as CAPS1-deficient chromaffin cells exhibit strongly reduced vesicular catecholamine levels. Here we describe a role of CAPS proteins in vesicular monoamine uptake. Both CAPS1 and CAPS2 promote monoamine uptake and storage mediated by the vesicular monoamine transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2. Monoamine uptake of vesicular preparations from embryonic brains of CAPS1 deletion mutants is decreased as compared with corresponding preparations from wild type littermates, and anti-CAPS1 or anti-CAPS2 antibodies inhibit monoamine sequestration by synaptic vesicles from adult mouse brain. In addition, overexpression of CAPS1 or CAPS2 enhances vesicular monoamine uptake in Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express VMAT1 or VMAT2. CAPS function has been linked to the heterotrimeric GTPase Go, which modulates vesicular monoamine uptake. We found that the expression of CAPS1 is decreased in brain membrane preparations from mice lacking Go2α, which may explain the reduced monoamine uptake by Go2α-deficient synaptic vesicles. Accordingly, anti-CAPS1 antibodies do not further reduce monoamine uptake by Go2α-deficient synaptic vesicles, whereas antibodies directed against CAPS2, whose expression is not altered in Go2α-deficient brain, still reduce monoamine uptake into Go2α-deficient vesicles. We conclude that CAPS proteins are involved in optimizing vesicular monoamine uptake and storage mediated by VMAT1 and VMAT2.

Monoamine uptake via VMAT1 and VMAT2 is regulated by vesicle-associated heterotrimeric G-proteins, which is illustrated by the fact that in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the α-subunit of Go2 inhibits monoamine uptake (13Höltje M. von Jagow B.

The role of CAPS proteins in VMAT-mediated vesicular catecholamine uptake and storage is currently discussed controversially because corresponding studies undertaken so far have yielded contradictory results. Experiments on chromaffin cells of CAPS1-deficient mice indicated a role of CAPS1 in catecholamine loading as CAPS1-deficient chromaffin cells exhibit strongly reduced catecholamine levels in their secretory granules. Indeed, many fusing chromaffin granules of CAPS1-deficient chromaffin cells contain no catecholamines at all (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F.

Chromaffin cells of mice lacking both CAPS1 and CAPS2 exhibit an additional reduction in the refilling and maintenance of a pool of rapidly releasable chromaffin granules but no further reduction in vesicular catecholamine sequestration as compared with chromaffin cells of mice lacking only CAPS1 (16Liu Y.

After homogenization in 1 ml of water containing 10 mm HEPES and protease inhibitors, homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g, and the postnuclear supernatant was spun down for 30 min at 360,000 × g. The resulting pellets were resuspended in potassium-glutamate-ATP buffer (150 mm potassium glutamate; 20 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; 4 mm EGTA; 2.9 mm MgCl2 (is equivalent to 1 mm free Mg2+); and 2 mm ATP, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH). After genotyping, two samples of identical genotype were pooled for further analysis. Uptake assays were performed as described before (21Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M. Winter S. Pahner I.

Preincubation of Synaptic Vesicles with Anti-CAPS Antibodies and Subsequent Serotonin Uptake Assays—Anti-CAPS1 and anti-CAPS2 antibodies and the corresponding preimmune sera were dialyzed against potassium-glutamate-ATP buffer (150 mm potassium glutamate; 20 mm 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid; 4 mm EGTA; 2.9 mm MgCl2 (is equivalent to 1 mm free Mg2+); and 2 mm ATP, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH) overnight at 4 °C.

After that, uptake assays were performed as described before (21Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M. Winter S. Pahner I. Walther D.J. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol.

Immunoblot Analysis—Subcellular fractions were prepared from mouse brains as described (22Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J.

After determination of protein content, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). ECL-processed films were scanned, and protein bands were densitometrically quantified using the Labimage 1D program (KAPELAN, Halle, Germany). It was ensured that signals were in the linear range of the ECL detection system. Quantification of proteins comparing wild type and knock-out samples were performed from the same gel using actin as internal standard. CHOVMAT1 and CHOVMAT2 Cell Lines—VMAT1-expressing CHO cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CHOVMAT2 cells (21Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M. Winter S. Pahner I. Walther D.J. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33373-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells were transfected with CAPS-DNA using the Lipofectamine™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen). 2 days after transfection, cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and serotonin uptake assays. After selective permeabilization of plasma membranes by SLO, serotonin uptake into intracellular compartments by VMAT1 or VMAT2 was assayed as described (21Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M.

Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% formaline in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 45 min at room temperature. After three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline and one rinse with water, coverslips were mounted on glass slides for fluorescence microscopic analysis. Experimental Design—All experiments presented were repeated at least two times. Individual uptake experiments were performed in triplicate. Values are presented as mean ± S.D. Absence of CAPS Proteins Decreases Vesicular Serotonin Uptake—Electrophysiological evidence indicates that the deletion of CAPS1 reduces vesicular monoamine uptake or storage in chromaffin granules (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Efforts to obtain direct biochemical evidence for an effect of the CAPS1 deletion on vesicular monoamine uptake has been confounded by the fact that CAPS-deficient mice die at birth and thus yield only very small amounts of chromaffin granules that are not sufficient for biochemical uptake assays. To circumvent this problem, we tested first whether monoamine uptake assays into synaptic vesicles prepared from E18 embryonic mouse brains are feasible. Using E18 embryonic synaptic vesicles, we found that serotonin uptake was 3-fold higher without additives as compared with uptake measured in the presence of 6 μm of the VMAT blocker reserpine, indicating a specific uptake via VMAT2 (Fig. 1A, left panel). This allowed us to analyze monoamine uptake by synaptic vesicles of CAPS1 deletion mutants prepared at E18. Due to the low uptake seen in samples from embryonic brains, serotonin uptake assays using vesicular preparations from embryonic brains of wild type, CAPS1+/-, and CAPS1-/- mice were performed with 400 nm serotonin instead of 40 nm, resulting in an increased uptake in general. Serotonin uptake was significantly decreased in vesicles from CAPS1-/- mice as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 1A, right panel). Unspecific accumulation of serotonin in the presence of reserpine was comparable for all genotypes and subtracted (see the legend for Fig. 1A). Vesicles from heterozygous mice did not exhibit a significant reduction of serotonin uptake. The reduced serotonin uptake of CAPS1-deficient vesicles is not due to reduced VMAT2 expression, which was not altered in CAPS1 knock-out vesicles, indicating an impact of the deletion mutation on VMAT function rather than expression (Fig. 1B). Likewise, expression of the vesicular proton pump is normal in CAPS1 knock-out vesicles (Fig. 1B), which indicates that vesicles from CAPS1 knock-out retain the protein machinery to generate a normal electrochemical ΔμH+ gradient. The above data indicate that genetic deletion of CAPS1 specifically perturbs vesicular monoamine uptake activity of embryonic synaptic vesicles. Encouraged by these data, we tested next whether a reduction of uptake can also be seen when CAPS protein function in synaptic vesicles from adult brain is perturbed by specific antibodies. Synaptic vesicles were incubated with anti-CAPS1 or anti-CAPS2 antibodies and the respective preimmune sera prior to the uptake procedure. Although preincubation with preimmune sera showed no effect, incubation with both anti-CAPS antibodies reduced serotonin uptake by 40% (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies used in the perturbation assay, vesicular preparations from CAPS1-/- and the corresponding wild type embryonic brains were incubated with the anti-CAPS1 antibody. As expected, a decrease in the uptake by the anti-CAPS1 antibody was only observed in the wild type but not in the CAPS1-/- preparation (Fig. 1D). Uptake into CAPS1-/- vesicles was reduced as compared with wild type vesicles, confirming the effect of the CAPS1 mutation seen before. These results indicate that both CAPS isoforms influence monoamine uptake and/or storage in a similar manner and that the reduced uptake activity seen in vesicles from CAPS1-deficient brain is most likely a direct effect of the CAPS1 loss and not due to a secondary developmental or homeostatic effect. Expression of CAPS1 Is Decreased in Brains of Go2α-/- Mice—Both CAPS1 and the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein Go2 are involved in monoamine uptake and storage (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J.

Schade M.A. Thomure A.M. Miller K.G. Genetics. 2006; 172: 943-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the expression of CAPS1 and CAPS2 in brain fractions of wild type and Go2α-/- mice. CAPS1 levels were significantly reduced in homogenates and synaptosomal fractions of Go2α-/- deletion mutants as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 2A), whereas CAPS2 levels were similar in brains from both genotypes (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, the effects of anti-CAPS1 and anti-CAPS2 antibodies on serotonin uptake of synaptic vesicles from Go2α-/- mice were determined and compared with the effect induced in vesicles of wild type mice. Specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated previously (7Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F.J. Hofmann K. Brose N. Reim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52802-52809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S.

In accordance with the lower expression levels of CAPS1 in Go2α-/- mutants, there was no effect of anti-CAPS1 antibodies on vesicular serotonin uptake into Go2α-/- vesicles (Fig. 2C, left panel). In contrast, the effect of anti-CAPS2 antibodies on serotonin uptake by synaptic vesicles was even more pronounced in Go2α-/- vesicles than in wild type samples (Fig. 2C, right panel). The differential effects of anti-CAPS1 and anti-CAPS2 antibodies on synaptic vesicles from Go2α-/- mice further confirms the specificity of the antibodies used. Generally, serotonin uptake was lower in synaptic vesicles from Go2α-/- animals as compared with vesicles of wild type animals, as observed previously, although VMAT expression is increased in Go2α-/- mice (15Brunk I. Blex C. Sanchis-Segura C. Sternberg J. Perreau-Lenz S. Bilbao A. Hörtnagl H. Baron J. Juranek J. Laube G. Birnbaumer L. Spanagel R. Ahnert-Hilger G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3736-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Probably, the reduced expression of CAPS1 accounts for the reduced monoamine uptake in vesicles of Go2α-/- mice. Transfection of VMAT-expressing CHO Cells with CAPS1 and CAPS2 Increases Vesicular Serotonin Uptake—The data reported above show that both genetic deletion of CAPS and perturbation of CAPS function by specific antibodies reduce monoamine uptake into synaptic vesicles. To see whether increased CAPS function leads to the opposite effect, i.e. increased vesicular monoamine uptake, CHO cell lines that permanently express either VMAT1 or VMAT2 were transiently transfected with CAPS-encoding cDNAs and assayed for VMAT activity. These VMAT-expressing cell lines are devoid of plasma membrane monoamine transporters and monoamine-synthesizing or -degrading enzymes, and VMATs were shown to reside on endosomal compartments when expressed in CHO cells (24Brunk I. Höltje M. von JaGow B. Winter S. Sternberg J. Blex C. Pahner I. Ahnert-Hilger G. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2006; 175: 305-332Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After permeabilization of the plasma membrane, this model system is well suited for studies on vesicular monoamine uptake and its regulation (21Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M. Winter S. Pahner I. Walther D.J. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33373-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). VMAT1- and VMAT2-expressing CHO cells were transiently transfected with CAPS1 or CAPS2 cDNA. The respective CAPS sequences were placed in front of an IRES-eGFP sequence for fluorescence analysis of transfection efficiency. An IRES-eGFP-vector cDNA was used for control transfections. Kinetics of serotonin transport by VMAT1 and VMAT2 were analyzed following SLO permeabilization in CAPS1- (Fig. 3A) or CAPS2-transfected (Fig. 3B) CHOVMAT cells in comparison with vector-transfected cells. Transfection with CAPS1 significantly increased vmax values of VMAT1 and VMAT2 expressed in CHO cells, in comparison with IRES-eGFP-transfected cells (Fig. 3A), whereas Km values remained unchanged. Likewise, transfection with CAPS2 cDNA led to an increase of vmax values for both VMAT isoforms with almost no change in Km values (Fig. 3B and Table 1). These results confirm the notion that CAPS1 and CAPS2 promote vesicular monoamine uptake and/or storage.TABLE 1Effects of CAPS1 and CAPS2 on VMAT1 and VMAT2 uptake kinetics CHO cells expressing either VMAT1 or VMAT2 were transfected with eukaryotic expression vectors encoding rat CAPS1 or human CAPS2 and eGFP via an IRES-eGFP sequence. Kinetics of serotonin transport by VMAT1 and VMAT2 were analyzed in CAPS1 or CAPS2 transfected CHOVMAT cells following SLO permeabilization, in comparison with their respective control cells transfected with vectors encoding eGFP only. Uptake was assayed for 10 min at 37 °C using potassium-glutamate-ATP buffer containing 40 nm [3H]serotonin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled serotonin.

The results are consistent with prior observations indicating a requirement of CAPS for filling of chromaffin granules (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U.

They also reveal a functional link between Go2α, which was shown previously to regulate monoamine storage, and CAPS1 as CAPS1 expression is decreased in brains of Go2α-/- mice.

Previous investigations of an additional role of CAPS proteins in vesicular monoamine uptake and storage yielded contradictory results (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F.

Our present results are in line with one of these earlier studies, which demonstrated a facilitating role of CAPS in large dense core vesicle loading in mouse chromaffin cells (10Speidel D.

In adrenal chromaffin cells from embryonic CAPS1-/- mutants, up to 70% empty (i.e. catecholamine-free) chromaffin granules were shown to undergo exocytosis. Additionally, cytosolic levels of catecholamine metabolites were found to be strongly increased in adrenal glands of CAPS1-/- mice, indicating a shift from vesicular to cytosolic catecholamine pools. These observations were interpreted in the context of a dysfunction of vesicular catecholamine loading or storage in the absence of CAPS1 (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F.

A recent study on chromaffin cells of deletion mutant mice lacking both CAPS isoforms also suggested, besides a strong deficit in exocytosis, fusion of empty vesicles (16Liu Y. Schirra C. Stevens D.R. Matti U. Speidel D. Hof D. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5594-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, knock-down of CAPS1 in PC12 cells led to a higher accumulation of exogenous norepinephrine, and the endogenous level of dopamine was increased (17Fujita Y. Xu A. Xie L. Arubachalam L. Chou T.-C. Jiang T. Chiew S.-K. Kourtesis J. Wang L. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21392-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although catecholamine filling of secretory vesicles was not tested in this study, e.g. by directly correlating high resolution membrane fusion measurements with amperometric recordings of released catecholamines as was done in the conflicting study (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5594-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the phenomenon of increased norepinephrine accumulation and endogenous dopamine levels after CAPS1 knock-down was attributed solely to a reduction of (constitutive) secretion in CAPS1 knock-down cells. An additional direct role of CAPS proteins in vesicular monoamine uptake was excluded categorically (17Fujita Y. Xu A. Xie L. Arubachalam L. Chou T.-C. Jiang T. Chiew S.-K. Kourtesis J. Wang L. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21392-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the endogenous amounts of dopamine and norepinephrine do not correlate in the various knock-down clones (i.e. high levels of dopamine were found associated with lower levels of norepinephrine and vice versa), whereas comparable amounts were seen in the control cells (17Fujita Y. Xu A. Xie L. Arubachalam L. Chou T.-C. Jiang T. Chiew S.-K. Kourtesis J. Wang L. Gaisano H.Y. Sugita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21392-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that knock-down of CAPS1 also affects metabolism of dopamine or its turnover to norepinephrine. A change in the metabolic balance may also explain the selectively reduced amounts of dopamine as compared with the almost unchanged amounts of norepinephrine in the CAPS1-/- chromaffin cells (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Essentially, without direct information on vesicular uptake characteristics, changes in the metabolic balance of dopamine and its metabolites can only be used as a very indirect readout for vesicular uptake, especially in a cell culture system such as PC12 cells. Our present study demonstrates that both CAPS isoforms promote vesicular monoamine uptake and storage in both VMAT1-expressing and VMAT2-expressing cells (Figs. 1, 2, 3), thus supporting the data obtained in chromaffin cells of CAPS deletion mutants (10Speidel D. Bruederle C.E. Enk C. Voets T. Varoqueaux F. Reim K. Becherer U. Fornai F. Ruggieri S. Holighaus Y. Weihe E. Bruns D. Brose N. Rettig J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5594-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CAPS isoforms in CHOVMAT cells leads to effects, i.e. increased monoamine uptake (Fig. 3), that are opposite to those seen upon CAPS deficiency in deletion mutants (Fig. 1A) or after loss of function due to antibody-mediated perturbation (Fig. 1C). In view of these findings and the fact that neither VMAT2 nor vesicular proton pump levels are changed in CAPS1-deficient vesicles (Fig. 1B), we conclude that CAPS proteins positively regulate monoamine uptake and that the reduced vesicular monoamine uptake in CAPS-deficient cells is a direct consequence of CAPS loss rather than a secondary, indirect effect of the mutation. CAPS proteins may stabilize synaptic vesicles, allowing them to store higher amounts of monoamines by shifting the electrical proton gradient (ΔμH+) across the vesicle membrane to higher values. An increase of the ΔpH component of ΔμH+ would allow more monoamines to be stored inside vesicles and would counteract nonspecific leakage (24Brunk I. Höltje M. von JaGow B. Winter S. Sternberg J.

Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). However, the protein levels of the proton pump is not affected in CAPS1-/- vesicle preparations, and the loading of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles is only weakly affected by deletion of CAPS1 and CAPS2 (8Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. S⊘rensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.-S. Brose N. Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which indicates that the electrochemical gradient is functional in CAPS-deficient vesicles and that CAPS proteins preferentially regulate storage of monoamines in VMAT2-containing vesicles. Functional Relationship between CAPS1 and Go2α—The α-subunit of Go2 was shown to regulate vesicular monoamine storage. Vesicular monoamine uptake is decreased in Go2α-/- mice (15Brunk I. Blex C. Sanchis-Segura C. Sternberg J. Perreau-Lenz S. Bilbao A. Hörtnagl H. Baron J. Juranek J. Laube G. Birnbaumer L. Spanagel R. Ahnert-Hilger G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3736-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Thus, both CAPS proteins and Go2 are involved in vesicular monoamine loading. In addition, loss-of-function mutation of the heterotrimeric Go protein of C. elegans partly suppresses phenotypic deficits of unc-31 (CAPS) mutants, which further indicates a functional interplay between Unc-31/CAPS and Go2α (25Charlie N.K. Schade M.A. Thomure A.M. Miller K.G. Genetics. 2006; 172: 943-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In view of these facts, a second objective of the present study was to investigate the functional relationship between CAPS and Go2α. To this end, the expression levels of both CAPS isoforms were determined in brains of wild type and Go2α-/- mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Only the expression of CAPS1 was decreased in Go2α-/- brains as compared with wild type samples, and application of anti-CAPS1 antibodies did not further interfere with vesicular monoamine uptake into synaptic vesicles of Go2α-/- mice (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, CAPS2 levels were not altered in Go2α-/- brains, and the inhibitory effect of anti-CAPS2 antibodies on vesicular monoamine uptake was still pronounced in Go2α-/- samples (Fig. 2C). In adult brains, CAPS1 and CAPS2 are expressed differentially (5Sadakata T. Itakura M. Kozaki S. Sekine Y. Takahashi M. Furuichi T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 495: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F.J. Hofmann K. Brose N. Reim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52802-52809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the midbrain, CAPS2 is concentrated in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (5Sadakata T. Itakura M. Kozaki S. Sekine Y. Takahashi M. Furuichi T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 495: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The nigro-striatal dopamine system was previously shown to be disturbed in Go2α-/- mice (15Brunk I. Blex C. Sanchis-Segura C. Sternberg J. Perreau-Lenz S. Bilbao A. Hörtnagl H. Baron J. Juranek J. Laube G. Birnbaumer L. Spanagel R. Ahnert-Hilger G. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3736-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the different effects of anti-CAPS1 and anti-CAPS2 antibodies on vesicular monoamine uptake of Go2α-/- vesicles seem to be related to alterations of dopaminergic signaling in Go2α-/- mice and to the fact that CAPS1 and CAPS2 are expressed in different subpopulations of monoaminergic neurons. Alternatively, the fact that anti-CAPS2 antibodies still inhibit vesicular monoamine uptake in Go2α-/- brain samples, whereas anti-CAPS1 antibodies do not, may be due to the fact that CAPS1 levels are already significantly reduced in Go2α-/- brain, whereas CAPS2 levels are not. Together, our findings are compatible with the notion that the reduced expression of CAPS1 accounts for the reduced monoamine uptake in vesicles of Go2α-/- mice. So far, the molecular basis of the role of CAPS proteins in vesicle loading remains unclear. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, chemical cross-linking experiments, or yeast two-hybrid assays, we were unable to detect a direct interaction between CAPS proteins and VMATs or Go2α (data not shown). Thus, either a direct interaction between CAPS and VMATs or Go2α does not occur in vivo or the corresponding interactions are weak and/or transient. Nevertheless, CAPS1 might be involved in a signaling cascade that is activated by the vesicular monoamine content, and that depends on the first intravesicular loop of VMAT and vesicle-associated Go2α (21Brunk I.

Conclusions—In summary, the present study shows that CAPS proteins facilitate vesicular monoamine uptake and/or storage, most likely by exerting a direct modulatory effect on the uptake machinery. Although this finding is in striking contrast to a previous study in which the effects of CAPS knock-down was studied in cell lines (17Fujita Y. Xu A. Xie L. Arubachalam L. Chou T.-C. Jiang T.

The cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) is presumably a major mediator of cGMP effects, and the cGMP analogue Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (Rp-PET) (chemical name: β-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer) is currently considered one of the most permeable, selective, and potent cGKI inhibitors available for intact cell studies. Here, we have evaluated the properties of Rp-PET using cGKI-expressing and cGKI-deficient primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), purified cGKI isozymes, and an engineered cGMP sensor protein. cGKI activity in intact VSMCs was monitored by cGMP/cGKI-stimulated cell growth and phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Unexpectedly, Rp-PET (100 μm) did not efficiently antagonize activation of cGKI by the agonist 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) in intact VSMCs. Moreover, in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, Rp-PET (100 μm) stimulated cell growth in a cGKIα-dependent manner. Kinase assays with purified cGKI isozymes confirmed the previously reported inhibition of the cGMP-stimulated enzyme by Rp-PET in vitro. However, in the absence of the agonist cGMP, Rp-PET partially activated the cGKIα isoform. Experiments with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based construct harboring the cGMP binding sites of cGKI suggested that binding of Rp-PET induces a conformational change similar to the agonist cGMP. Together, these findings indicate that Rp-PET is a partial cGKIα agonist that under certain conditions stimulates rather than inhibits cGKI activity in vitro and in intact cells.

Small-molecule modulators of cGMP generators and effectors are important biochemical tools as well as established and prospective drugs for the treatment of human diseases, such as erectile dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and various cardiovascular disorders (1Evgenov O.V.

Based on pharmacological and genetic studies, the cGK type I (cGKI) is considered the major mediator of cGMP signaling in many tissues including the cardiovascular system (5Foller M. Feil S.

The mammalian cGKI is a cytosolic Ser/Thr protein kinase comprising an N-terminal regulatory domain with two cGMP-binding sites and a C-terminal catalytic domain. It exists in two isoforms termed cGKIα and cGKIβ. The isozymes have identical cGMP-binding sites and catalytic domains but differ in their N-terminal ∼100 amino acids, which contribute to homodimerization, sensitivity to cGMP activation, and interaction with anchoring and substrate proteins. Recent in vivo studies with transgenic mice demonstrated that both isoforms can induce smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (9Weber S. Bernhard D. Lukowski R. Weinmeister P. Worner R. Wegener J.W. Valtcheva N. Feil S. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Feil R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the respective molecular mechanisms behind these effects are controversial (6Hofmann F. Feil R. Kleppisch T. Schlossmann J. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 10Mendelsohn M.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, opposing effects of cGMP/cGKI signaling have been reported on the growth and phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (11Feil R. Feil S. Hofmann F. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 71-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Lincoln T.M. Wu X. Sellak H. Dey N. Choi C.S. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The inconsistency of the results concerning the function of cGKI might in part be related to unexpected effects of the pharmacological cGKI activators and inhibitors that are commonly used to distinguish between cGKI-dependent and cGKI-independent signaling. For instance, cGMP analogues can bind to multiple cGMP receptors and can elevate the cAMP level by inhibiting the cAMP-degrading PDE3 (8Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1313-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Aizawa T. Wei H. Miano J.M. Abe J. Berk B.C. Yan C. Circ.

Moreover, there is evidence that one of the most frequently used cGKI inhibitors, KT5823, does not at all inhibit cGKI activity both in vitro and in intact cells and may in fact inhibit other protein kinases (15Bain J.

These inhibitors are based on cell-permeable modified peptide substrates (18Dostmann W.R. Taylor M.S. Nickl C.K. Brayden J.E. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14772-14777Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or on the allosteric activator cGMP (see Fig. 1A) (19Schwede F. Maronde E. Genieser H. Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Agonistic cGMP analogues have been converted to antagonists by exchanging one oxygen atom of the cyclic phosphate moiety with sulfur in the equatorial position with respect to the sugar ring (20Butt E. van Bemmelen M. Fischer L. Walter U. Jastorff B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The resulting antagonistic Rp-phosphorothioate cGMP analogues are supposed to bind to the cGMP-binding sites of cGKI without inducing the conformational change crucial for allosteric activation of the enzyme (21Chu D.M.

For instance, the cGMP analogue 8-Br-PET-cGMP (PET) is a cGKI agonist (23Sekhar K.R. Hatchett R.J. Shabb J.B. Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Wells J.N. Jastorff B. Butt E. Chakinala M.M. Corbin J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 103-108PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (Rp-PET) (see Fig. 1B) competitively inhibits activation of purified cGKI by cGMP (24Butt E. Pohler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rp-PET is currently considered one of the most permeable, selective, and potent cGKI inhibitors available for intact cell studies (14Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R. Tang X.B.

Jastorff B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the present study, we intended to validate the selectivity and efficacy of Rp-PET as a cGKI inhibitor in intact cells by comparing its effects on cGKI-expressing and cGKI-deficient VSMCs. Surprisingly, Rp-PET did not efficiently inhibit but rather stimulated cGKI-mediated processes in VSMCs. In vitro experiments with purified cGKI isozymes and an engineered cGKI-based cGMP sensor protein supported these findings, suggesting that Rp-PET is a partial agonist rather than an antagonist of cGKIα. Materials—cGMP (catalogue number G 001), 8-Br-cGMP (catalogue number B 004), 8-Br-PET-cGMP (PET; catalogue number P 003), Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS (Rp-PET; catalogue number P 007), and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (catalogue number C 013) were purchased from Biolog Life Science Institute. Compounds were dissolved in water, and stock solutions (100 mm for cGMP and 8-Br-cGMP and 10 mm for the other compounds) were stored at -20 °C. Intact Cell Studies (Cell Culture, Growth Assays, Western Blotting, and Antibodies)—Primary VSMCs were obtained from aortae of 3-6-week-old cGKI-deficient (cGKIL-/L-) (25Wegener J.W. Nawrath H. Wolfsgruber W. Kuhbandner S. Werner C. Hofmann F. Feil R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and litter-matched control (cGKI+/+ or cGKI+/L-) mice or from aortae of 8-week-old SM-Iα or SM-Iβ smooth muscle rescue mice (9Weber S. Bernhard D. Lukowski R. Weinmeister P. Worner R. Wegener J.W. Valtcheva N. Feil S. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Feil R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin as described previously (26Kuhbandner S. Brummer S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Hofmann F. Feil R. Genesis. 2000; 28: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine cell growth, primary VSMCs were plated on 96-well culture plates (20,000 cells/well) in the absence or presence of 8-Br-cGMP and/or Rp-PET. After 72 h, the cell number was determined by the MTS assay (CellTiter 96® AQueous, Promega) or by staining with toluidine blue O. The MTS assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were washed once with serum-free medium to remove non-adherent cells. Subsequently, 20 μl of the MTS reagent were added to 100 μl of serum-free medium in each well. The A492 was measured after a 30- and 60-min incubation at 37 °C in a humidified, 6% CO2 atmosphere. For toluidine blue O staining, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed and stained for 10 min in 100 μl of ice-cold toluidine blue O solution (0.5% (w/v) toluidine blue O in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde). Excess dye was removed by five washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Stained cells were incubated in 100 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS to release the dye and the A620 was determined. Phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was detected by Western blotting via the band shift to a higher apparent molecular weight when VASP is phosphorylated at Ser-157 (8Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1313-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primary VSMCs were plated on 6-well culture plates (100,000 cells/well) and grown for 7 days to a confluence of 80-90%. Subsequently, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for a further 48 h. Then cells were preincubated for 30 min with Rp-PET or vehicle followed by a 30-min incubation in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cGMP. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.7% (w/v) SDS, 1.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against VASP (Alexis Biochemicals, catalogue number Alx-210-725, 1:2000), Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, catalogue number 9272, 1:1000), and cGKI (1:5000). The rabbit polyclonal cGKI antiserum, termed “cGKI common (DH),” detects both cGKIα and cGKIβ. It was raised against recombinant bovine cGKIα and affinity-purified using cGKIα coupled to BrCN-Sepharose. The cGKIα protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described (27Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13152-13158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—A radioactive assay was used to determine the kinase activity of purified recombinant bovine cGKIα and cGKIβ. Both isozymes were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography (27Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F.

The reaction mix contained 50 mm Mes, 0.4 mm EGTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm ATP (∼100 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP), 40 μm substrate peptide GRTGRRNSI-amide, and various concentrations of cGMP and/or Rp-PET. Reactions were started by adding 10 ng of purified enzyme. After 5 min, 80 μl of the reaction mix were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper (2.5 × 3.0 cm). Then the filter papers were washed three times for 10 min in 85 mm phosphoric acid, dried, and put into scintillation vials to measure 32P incorporation. Activity was calculated as μmol of phosphate transferred per minute and mg of kinase. Ka values for reaching half-maximal activity were determined from the inflection points of the activation curves. Ki values for inhibition of the enzyme to half-maximal activity were determined by Dixon plots (29Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—Aqueous Rp-PET and PET stock solutions (10 mm, sodium salt) were stored at -20 °C. Before MS analysis, they were allowed to thermally equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min. For ESI-MS, stock solutions were diluted with water/acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. For spiking, PET was added to the Rp-PET aliquot in a 30:70 (v/v) ratio. Solutions were infused (4 μl/min) into the ESI source using a Parmer Infusion 74900 series syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.). Mass spectra were acquired in the negative ion mode using a HCT Plus ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a standard ESI source (Bruker-Daltonics). Spectra (50-1000 m/z) were acquired in the standard enhanced mode (scan rate 8100 m/z per second). Dry gas (5 liters/min) temperature was set to 300 °C, the nebulizer was set to 10.0 p.s.i., and the electrospray voltage was set to 4000 V. Maximal accumulation time was set to 200 ms. Loading of the trap was controlled by the instrument (ICC 70000). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Measurements—A fusion protein (cGi-500, Ref. 30Russwurm M. Mullershausen F. Friebe A.

Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Cary eclipse spectrofluorometer equipped with a microplate accessory (Varian Inc., excitation at 436 nm) in white half-area microplates (Greiner, catalogue number 675075) using 5 μl of the cytosol containing the indicator in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A (25 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Concentration-response curves for the compounds were assessed by recording of CFP and YFP emissions at 475 and 525 nm, respectively, for 5 min, subtracting the background emission of a water-filled well and calculating the emission ratio of 475 to 525 nm. The effects of Rp-PET (Fig. 1B) on intact cells were studied in murine primary aortic VSMCs, which express both cGKIα and cGKIβ (31Feil R. Gappa N. Rutz M. Schlossmann J. Rose C.R. Konnerth A.

This cell culture system has been proven useful to identify cGKI-dependent functions. Previous studies have shown that the stimulation of cell growth and VASP phosphorylation by the membrane-permeable cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP is indeed mediated via activation of cGKI (31Feil R.

Feil R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tested whether Rp-PET could inhibit cGMP/cGKI-stimulated VSMC growth and phosphorylation of VASP. As expected, the cGKI agonist 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) induced cell growth and VASP phosphorylation in cGKI-expressing cells (Fig. 2, left panels) but was ineffective in cGKI-knock-out cells (Fig. 2, right panels). Surprisingly, Rp-PET (100 μm) had no significant effect on 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm)-induced growth and phospho-VASP. When applied under basal conditions, i.e. in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP, Rp-PET even stimulated cell growth and VASP phosphorylation in control VSMCs (Fig. 2, left panels). Growth stimulation by Rp-PET alone was reproducible and highly significant, but clearly weaker than with 8-Br-cGMP. Importantly, Rp-PET had no effects on cGKI-deficient cells (Fig. 2, right panels), demonstrating that its apparent agonistic activity in control VSMCs was indeed mediated by cGKI. To further investigate the potential partial agonistic activity of Rp-PET, its effects on the activity of purified cGKIα and cGKIβ were examined. Both enzymes displayed cGMP-dependent kinase activity with characteristic Ka values for stimulation with cGMP (Ka ∼0.1 and ∼1 μm for cGKIα and cGKIβ, respectively; Fig. 3, no inhibitor, and Fig. 4). Increasing concentrations of Rp-PET caused a right shift of the cGMP activation curves for both the cGKIα isoform (Fig. 3A, upper panel) and the cGKIβ isoform (Fig. 3B, upper panel), as expected for an inhibitor. By using Dixon plots (29Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar), Ki values of 0.03 and 0.05 μm were determined for cGKIα (Fig. 3A, lower panel) and cGKIβ (Fig. 3B, lower panel), respectively. These Ki values were similar to Ki values reported previously for the inhibition of the cGKI isozymes by Rp-PET in vitro (24Butt E. Pohler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of cGMP-activated cGKIα by Rp-PET was less complete than inhibition of cGKIβ (Fig. 3, upper panels, black arrows). Moreover, when added in the absence of cGMP, Rp-PET appeared to increase the activity of cGKIα but not cGKIβ above basal levels (Fig. 3, upper panels, broken arrows). These findings were consistent with the partial agonistic effect of Rp-PET observed in intact cells and suggested that Rp-PET might preferentially activate the cGKIα isozyme. Indeed, Rp-PET alone increased the kinase activity of cGKIα in a concentration-dependent manner with a Ka value of 1 μm (Fig. 4A). In line with a partial agonistic activity, the maximal kinase activity that could be induced with Rp-PET was lower than with cGMP, reaching ∼38% of the enzyme activity in the presence of saturating cGMP concentrations. In contrast, Rp-PET did not significantly alter the kinase activity of the cGKIβ isoform (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Effect of Rp-PET on the activity of purified cGKIα (A) and cGKIβ (B) in the absence of added cGMP. Kinase activity was plotted against increasing concentrations of Rp-PET (open circles) and compared with cGMP activation curves (filled squares). Kinase activity was normalized to maximal cGMP stimulation. Out of three independent kinase assays, one representative experiment is shown. Data are given as means ± S.D. (n = 3 per data point).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It seemed possible that the apparent activation of purified cGKIα by Rp-PET was caused by spontaneous exchange of the sulfur atom of the cyclic phosphorothioate moiety of Rp-PET with oxygen, resulting in conversion of the Rp-analogue to the corresponding agonistic compound, PET (Fig. 1B; see Technical Information about Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS, update October 15, 2007, Biolog Life Science Institute). To exclude this possibility and to analyze the homogeneity of the Rp-PET compound, the aliquot used for the kinase assays was examined by ESI-MS. Only peaks at m/z ratios corresponding to the molecular mass of Rp-PET could be detected (Fig. 5, left panel), indicating that the compound was pure and that exchange of sulfur with oxygen or other chemical alterations had not occurred. Spiking of Rp-PET with the potential conversion product PET, which is 16 Da lighter, confirmed that these compounds could clearly be resolved by the experimental setup (Fig. 5, right panel). Thus, the mass spectrum confirmed that Rp-PET itself exerted the partial agonistic effect on cGKIα that was observed in the kinase assays. To further verify its partial agonistic activity, the effects of Rp-PET on the isolated cGMP-binding domains of cGKI were studied by FRET measurements. For these measurements, the two cGMP-binding sites of bovine cGKI were sandwiched between CFP and YFP, respectively (30Russwurm M. Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Jager R. Russwurm C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This construct contains only the cGMP-binding sites, which are identical in cGKIα and cGKIβ but lacks the N-terminal region that differs between the isozymes. Binding of the agonist cGMP to the FRET construct induces a conformational change that can be monitored as altered FRET signal (30Russwurm M. Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Jager R. Russwurm C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas binding of an antagonist does not produce a FRET change. In line with a partial agonistic activity of Rp-PET, increasing concentrations of Rp-PET caused a similar, albeit weaker, FRET change as the known agonists cGMP and PET (Fig. 6). The combined results of the in vitro kinase assays with purified cGKI isoforms (Figs. 3 and 4) and of the FRET measurements (Fig. 6) suggest the following model. Rp-PET binds to the cGMP-binding sites of both cGKI isozymes. Although it acts as an antagonist of cGKIβ, its binding to cGKIα induces a conformational change that partially activates the enzyme. To confirm that Rp-PET activates cGKIα but not cGKIβ in intact cells, growth assays were performed with so-called SM-Iα or SM-Iβ smooth muscle rescue VSMCs, which express only the cGKIα or the cGKIβ isoform, respectively (9Weber S. Bernhard D. Lukowski R. Weinmeister P. Worner R. Wegener J.W. Valtcheva N. Feil S. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Feil R. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, Rp-PET (100 μm) stimulated the growth of SM-Iα but not SM-Iβ cells (Fig. 7). 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) was effective in both cell preparations, demonstrating that, in principle, both cGKI isozymes can promote VSMC growth. The differential sensitivity of cGKIα versus cGKIβ to the partial agonistic effect of Rp-PET must be related to their different N termini, which apparently differ in their ability to couple ligand binding to activation of the catalytic region. Indeed, the N termini determine the differential sensitivity of the isozymes to cGMP activation, the cGKIα isoform being ∼10 times more sensitive to cGMP than cGKIβ (34Ruth P. Landgraf W. Keilbach A. May B. Egleme C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Target-specific effects have also been reported for the Rp-phosphorothioate cGMP analogue Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, which is an antagonist of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel but an agonist of the photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (35Kramer R.H. Tibbs G.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS is also used as cGK inhibitor (36Butt E. Eigenthaler M. Genieser H.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we tested its effect on cGKI activity in the absence of cGMP. Similar to Rp-PET, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS did not alter the basal kinase activity of cGKIβ but partially activated the cGKIα isozyme to ∼35% of the maximal cGMP-stimulated activity with a Ka value of 1 μm (data not shown). In the original reports on the use of Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (36Butt E. Eigenthaler M. Genieser H.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Rp-PET (24Butt E. Pohler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as cGK inhibitors, the effects of these compounds on cGKI activity in the absence of cGMP were not determined. However, in line with the present results, other investigators have noticed partial agonistic effects of both Rp-PET and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS on cGKI (37Taylor M.S. Okwuchukwuasanya C. Nickl C.K. Tegge W. Brayden J.E. Dostmann W.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38Vaandrager A.B. Edixhoven M. Bot A.G. Kroos M.A. Jarchau T. Lohmann S. Genieser H.G. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11816-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Partial agonistic activity has also been reported for Rp-phosphorothioate cAMP analogues that are used as inhibitors of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (39Gjertsen B.T. Mellgren G. Otten A. Maronde E. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Vintermyr O.K. McKnight G.S. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20599-20607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As a partial agonist, Rp-PET should, in principle, be able to inhibit cGMP-activated cGKI in intact cells. The failure of our initial attempts to inhibit cGKI-mediated VSMC growth and VASP phosphorylation in the presence of 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP by an equimolar concentration of Rp-PET (Fig. 2) might be related to an inappropriate intracellular ratio of 8-Br-cGMP to Rp-PET. Indeed, when the nominal 1:1 ratio was decreased to 1:4, i.e. 50 μm 8-Br-cGMP and 200 μm Rp-PET, cGMP/cGKI-mediated cell growth and VASP phosphorylation were significantly inhibited by Rp-PET (Fig. 8). These results are consistent with a previous study showing that Rp-PET can inhibit cGMP-activated cGKI in intact cells under certain conditions (24Butt E. Pohler D. Genieser H.G. Huggins J.P. Bucher B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3110-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Considering the 46-fold higher lipophilicity (14Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R. Tang X.B. Christensen A.E. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Bos J.L. Doskeland S.O. Beavo J.A. Butt E. Nat. Meth. 2008; 5: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the 4-fold higher concentration of Rp-PET versus 8-Br-cGMP used in our experiment, it appears that the inhibitory potential of Rp-PET in intact cells is quite moderate and that it must be present in large excess to inhibit the effect of a strong agonist such as 8-Br-cGMP. Taken together, the present study indicates that the cGMP analogue Rp-PET, which is frequently used as cGKI inhibitor, is a cGKIβ antagonist and partial cGKIα agonist and, therefore, affects cGKI activity in a complex isoform-dependent manner. In intact cells, Rp-PET may either inhibit or activate cGKI-mediated pathways depending on the intracellular cGMP level and the prevalence of the cGKIα or cGKIβ isoform. Other studies have shown that Rp-PET can also exert cGKI-independent effects (40Gambaryan S. Geiger J. Schwarz U.R. Butt E. Begonja A. Obergfell A. Walter U. Blood. 2004; 103: 2593-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Marshall S.J. Senis Y.A. Auger J.M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Salmon G. Peterson J.T. Burslem F. Watson S.P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), perhaps via modulation of PDEs (3Kemp-Harper B. Feil R. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R. Tang X.B. Christensen A.E. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Bos J.L. Doskeland S.O. Beavo J.A. Butt E. Nat. Meth. 2008; 5: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The unpredictable behavior of Rp-PET complicates the interpretation of intact cell studies. Rp-PET should be used with caution as cGKI inhibitor and not as sole proof for the involvement of cGKI in signaling pathways. We thank S. Feil and A. Gerling for providing mice, M. Zeeb, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2084606589,"We have determined the kinetic mechanism and motile properties of the switch 1 mutant S217A of myosin Va. Phosphate dissociation from myosin V-ADP-Pi (inorganic phosphate) and actomyosin V-ADP-Pi and the rate of the hydrolysis step (myosin V-ATP → myosin V-ADP-Pi) were all ∼10-fold slower in the S217A mutant than in wild type (WT) myosin V, resulting in a slower steady-state rate of basal and filamentous actin (actin)-activated ATP hydrolysis. Substrate binding and ADP dissociation kinetics were all similar to or slightly faster in S217A than in WT myosin V and mechanochemical gating of the rates of dissociation of ADP between trail and lead heads is maintained. The reduction in the rate constants of the hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation steps reduces the duty ratio from ∼0.85 in WT myosin V to ∼0.25 in S217A and produces a motor in which the average run length on actin at physiological concentrations of ATP is reduced 10-fold. Thus we demonstrate that, by mutational perturbation of the switch 1 structure, myosin V can be converted into a low duty ratio motor that is processive only at low substrate concentrations.

Thus we demonstrate that, by mutational perturbation of the switch 1 structure, myosin V can be converted into a low duty ratio motor that is processive only at low substrate concentrations. During the past 2 decades a considerable number of different myosins have been discovered (1Odronitz F. Kollmar M. Genome Biol.. 2007; 8: R196Google Scholar). Myosin V is the best characterized among the so-called unconventional myosins (i.e. those not belonging to class II), and it serves as an important model molecule for studying actomyosin interactions and single molecule processive motility (2Sellers J.R. Veigel C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 2006; 18: 68-73Google Scholar). Myosin V is a highly processive motor whose role is to transport cargo along actin filaments or bundles inside the cell (3Wu X. Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Sci.. 1997; 110: 847-859Google Scholar, 4Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E.

The kinetic mechanism of myosin V is significantly different from that of conventional myosins such as muscle myosin II, as it remains bound to actin (filamentous actin) through a number of ATPase cycles (6De La Cruz E.M.

Myosin V has a high duty ratio: a single-headed myosin V-S1 (myosin V, subfragment 1) is in the strongly bound AM-ADP state 80–90% of the time during ATP hydrolysis. An additional mechanism for promoting highly processive runs is the preferential release of ADP from the trail head because of mechanochemical gating, which causes a drastic reduction of the rate constant of ADP release from the lead head (9Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 766-773Google Scholar, 10Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Although there are significant differences between the ATPase mechanisms of the different myosins, the structure of the nucleotide binding pocket (composed of the switch 1 and 2 regions and the P-loop) is highly conserved. The position of the Ser217 (Ser236 in Dictyostelium myosin II) residue of the switch 1 loop (the first serine in the NDNSSRFG sequence) is shown in Fig. 1. It had been shown previously by mutagenesis in Dictyostelium (12Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Google Scholar) and in smooth muscle myosin II (13Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Google Scholar) that the substitution of serine 236 to alanine retains at least partial enzymatic and motile function in these mutant myosins. Therefore, the OH group is not an essential part of the catalytic mechanism, but the rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis is reduced several fold. However, neither of these studies includes a detailed kinetic analysis to determine which steps of the catalytic mechanism were altered by the mutation. Here we have exploited the higher affinity of myosin V-ADP-Pi for actin to determine the effect of the mutation on the rate constants of the product dissociation steps following the power stroke, which could not be determined using either Dictyostelium or smooth muscle myosin. We also conducted single molecule motility studies using total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) 5The abbreviations used are: TIRF, total internal reflectance fluorescence; S1, subfragment 1; HMM, heavy meromyosin; deac-aminoATP, 3′-(7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonylamino)-3′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; deac-aminoADP, 3′-(7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonylamino)-3′-deoxyadenosine 5′-diphosphate; mdATP, 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; mdADP, 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-diphosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBP, phosphate-binding protein; WT, wild type; MDCC-PBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide phosphate binding protein. microscopy to determine how the changes in the kinetic mechanism affect the motile properties of the molecule. Preparation of WT and S217A Myosin V-S1 and Myosin V-HMM—Constructs of mouse WT PVL1392 myosin V-S1 (subfragment 1), coding for amino acids 1–907 (6IQ calmodulin binding domains), and heavy meromyosin (HMM), coding for amino acids 1–1090, were used to engineer the mutants. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the mutant clones were verified by automated fluorescence dye terminator sequencing. The recombinant DNA was transfected into Sf9 insect cells, and the recombinant virus was purified by several rounds of plaque purification. Myosin V-S1 and HMM(S217A) were co-expressed with calmodulin in a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system, purified using FLAG affinity chromatography (8Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Google Scholar), and then concentrated and fractionated on a MonoQ ion exchange column with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m KCl. The protein concentration was determined from A280 - 1.5 A320 (A320 was subtracted to correct for light scattering) using the extinction coefficients per active site of ϵ280 = 0.112 μm-1 cm-1 for the S1 and ϵ280 = 0.120 μm-1 cm-1 for the HMM construct calculated from the number of tyrosine and tryptophan residues and their molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem.. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). All preparations were analyzed by SDS-protein gel electrophoresis and by active site titration with deac-aminoATP. The protein was stored on ice in buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, and 400 mm KCl, pH 7.2, and used within 72 h. Reagents—Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (15Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar). ATP and ADP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N-Methylanthraniloyl derivatives of the 2′-deoxynulceotides mdADP and mdATP were synthesized and purified according to the method of Hiratsuka (16Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar). Deac-aminoADP and deac-aminoATP were synthesized by the method of Webb et al. (17Webb M.R. Reid G.P. Munasinghe V.R. Corrie J.E. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 14463-14471Google Scholar). Deoxymant nucleotide concentrations were based upon the molar extinction coefficient of ϵ355 = 5400 m-1cm-1 (16Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar), and deac-amino nucleotide concentrations were based upon molar extinction coefficients of ϵ429 = 46800 m-1cm-1 (17Webb M.R. Reid G.P. Munasinghe V.R. Corrie J.E. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 14463-14471Google Scholar). Steady-state Basal and Actin-activated ATPase Measurements—Steady-state ATPase activities were measured by an NADH-coupled assay at 25 °C in buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 40 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 200 μm NADH (18Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J.. 1972; 126: 635-644Google Scholar). Changes in NADH absorption at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6220 m-1cm-1) were followed in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. The ATPase activity of blanks containing actin but no myosin was subtracted from the actomyosin data. Quench-flow Experiments—Chemical quench measurements were done using a computer-controlled stepper motor apparatus built in our laboratory (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Google Scholar) to drive syringes in a mixing unit from KinTek Corp. (Austin, TX). Solutions of myosin V (15 μl) and ATP (10 μl containing 100,000 dpm of [γ32P]ATP) were mixed, held in a delay line for the desired time, and then quenched by a second mix with 0.3 m KH2PO4, 2 n HCl to give a final volume of 1.0 ml. The total radioactivity in each sample was determined by counting 0.3 ml of the sample directly. A 0.6-ml portion of the sample was mixed with an equal volume of a 10% w/v charcoal slurry and spun for 3 min at 10,000 rpm in a tabletop Eppendorf centrifuge to remove unhydrolyzed ATP, and 0.6 ml of the supernatant solution was counted. The percent hydrolysis was obtained from the ratio of the radioactivity in charcoal treated to directly counted samples after subtracting the background from each. The data were then fit to a 2 exponential equation using Simplex fitting routines in Scientist to obtain amplitude and rate information. Stopped-flow Experiments—All stopped-flow measurements were done at 20 °C using an SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp.) fitted with two 2-ml and one 5-ml syringe. The excitation light from a 75-watt xenon lamp was selected by using a 0.2-m monochromator (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). deac-aminoATP, deac-aminoADP, and MDCC-PBP were excited at 430 nm, and the emitted light was selected using a 450 nm long-pass filter. In the experiments where deoxymantATP was used, excitation was at 360 nm and emission was selected using a 400 nm long-pass filter. Light scattering was measured by using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and a 400 nm long-pass filter. Stocks of myosin V(S217A) mutants were diluted from buffer containing 400 mm KCl to obtain the desired protein concentration and a final KCl concentration of 125 mm just prior to use. In double mixing experiments myosin V was mixed with ATP or deac-aminoATP in buffer containing no KCl, incubated for the required time, and then mixed with actin containing the desired nucleotide chase (also in buffer with no KCl). The final concentration of buffer in the flow cell was 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA. Actin filaments were stabilized with equimolar phalloidin. Stock solutions of actin (80 μm) and ADP (2 mm) were treated for 1 h at 20 °C with 1 mm glucose and 0.01 unit/ml hexokinase to remove traces of ATP in experiments where the actin contained an ADP chase. Phosphate dissociation from the actomyosinADP-Pi complex was measured using MDCC-PBP as described (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Google Scholar). Background Pi was removed by preincubating the stopped-flow apparatus and all working solutions with the phosphate mop consisting of 0.1 mm 7-methylguanosine and 0.01 units/ml purine-nucleoside phosphorylase. Single Molecule Motility Assay—The single molecule motility assay was performed by using TIRF as described previously (20Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Google Scholar, 21Sakamoto T. Yildez A. Selvin P.R. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry.. 2005; 44: 16203-16210Google Scholar). Calmodulin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 568, exchanged for endogenous calmodulins of WT myosin V-HMM and the S217A mutant, and observed with TIRF using a 532 nm diode laser to excite the Alexa Fluor. Velocity was determined from the time dependence of the movement of the fluorophore using Metamorph software. Average run lengths, 〈d〉, were determined by fitting the run length data, which had been put in 0.25-μm bins, to single exponential curves (not shown). Data Analysis and Kinetic Simulation—Three to four data traces of 1000 points were averaged, and the observed rate constants were obtained by fitting one or two exponential terms to the data using the software package included with the KinTek stopped-flow instrument. Scientist (Micromath) software was used to replot the data for publication and for kinetic simulations. Steady-state Measurements—The basal and actin-activated ATPase activities of the myosin V-S1(S217A) and HMM-(S217A) mutants, measured with an NADH-coupled ATP-regenerating system, are summarized in the top two rows of Table 1. WT myosin V-S1 and HMM were used as controls. The hydrolysis rates were determined from the change in absorption at 340 nm, which was linear between 1 and 20 min after initiating the reaction. The basal ATPase activity for both the S1 and HMM mutants was 0.002 and 0.0028 s-1 (calculated per active site), which is ∼10-fold lower than the values measured for WT myosin V-S1 and HMM. Actin accelerated the ATPase activity of myosin V(S217A) by ∼1000-fold, reaching a Vmax of 2.7 s-1 for S1(S217A) and 1.7 s-1 for HMM(S217A), which is ∼5-fold slower than WT. Half-maximal activation (KATPase) occurred at an actin concentration of 8.6 μm for the S1 and 2.5 μm for the HMM mutants. Both were ∼3-fold higher than observed for WT (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of kinetic parameters for WT and myosin V (S217A) A = Actin, M = myosin V, T = ATP, D = ADP, P = phosphate.

Global fits of the data were used to determine the rate constants of deac-aminoATP binding (kT), the rate-limiting step of steady-state deac-aminoATP hydrolysis (k-DAP), and the concentration of active sites. The second order rate constants of deac-aminoATP binding to myosin V(S217A), kT, were 3.2 μm-1s-1 for S1 and 3.7 μm-1s-1 for HMM, which are essentially the same as those observed for the WT myosin V-S1 and HMM (9Forgacs E.

Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Google Scholar). There is a ∼5-fold reduction in the rate of deac-aminoATP hydrolysis to 0.005–0.0055 s-1 by myosin V-S1(S217A) and myosin V-HMM(S217A) compared with the rates measured for WT myosin V (9Forgacs E.

The concentration of active sites measured by single turnover experiments was 0.9–1.1 times the concentration determined by A280, which indicates that the lower rates in the mutants are due to the difference in kinetic properties and not to a reduced fraction of active enzyme molecules. ATP Binding and Hydrolysis in the Absence of Actin—Myosin V and most other myosins have a tryptophan residue (Trp484 in myosin V) in the relay loop that is an intrinsic fluorescence sensor of conformational changes occurring in the nucleotide binding pocket resulting from substrate binding and hydrolysis (23Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Google Scholar, 24Yengo C.M. Chrin L.R. Rovner A.S. Berger C.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Google Scholar, 25Park S. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 11732-11741Google Scholar, 26Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Google Scholar). We did single mixing stopped-flow experiments in which we mixed apyrase-treated (to ensure that the myosin does not have ADP bound) WT myosin V-S1 or myosin V-S1(S217A) with substoichiometric ATP concentrations (data not shown). The rapid increase in tryptophan fluorescence is the result of ATP binding to myosin V and hydrolysis to myosin V-ADP-Pi, which was followed by a slow decrease produced by the dissociation of phosphate at 0.03 s-1 in the WT and 0.002 s-1 in the S217A mutant. Data from experiments in which myosin V was mixed with excess ATP were fit by single exponentials (Fig. 3, A and B). The observed rate constants showed hyperbolic dependence upon ATP concentration (Fig. 3C) in which the maximal rate constant was 84 s-1 for WT S1 and 9.9 s-1 for the S217A mutant. The 8–9-fold decrease suggests that the hydrolysis step (kAH+ k-AH) is significantly slower in the S217A mutant than in WT myosin V. The initial slope of 2.3 μm-1s-1 for WT myosin V-S1, which measures the rate constant of ATP binding, is similar to published values (6De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Google Scholar, 7Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Google Scholar). A slightly larger rate constant of 3.4 μm-1s-1 was obtained for the myosin V-S1(S217A) mutant. Direct Measurement of ATP Hydrolysis by Quench Flow—Quench flow is the only method that unambiguously measures the hydrolysis step and does not require any assumptions be made for interpretation of the molecular basis of the signal. Myosin V has been reported previously to have a rapid initial burst corresponding to a rapid (>100 s-1) and thermodynamically favorable hydrolysis of ATP in the active site of the enzyme (6De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Google Scholar). We did single and multiple turnover quenched-flow experiments to determine whether the mutant myosin V-S1 shows a Pi burst and to estimate the KH in the absence of actin. Under single turnover conditions ([ATP]/[S1] = 0.25) the time course of the hydrolysis can be fit by a double exponential with fast and slow phases having amplitudes of 0.74 and 0.18 for WT myosin V and 0.84 and 0.17 for the S217A mutant, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B, solid symbols). Estimates of ∼4 for KH can be obtained from the ratio of the amplitudes of the rapid and slow phases. Given that the ATP hydrolysis is fast, the rate constants for the fast phase (1.1 s-1 for WT myosin V and 0.85 s-1 for S217A) are limited by the rate of ATP binding. In experiments in which ATP was in excess ([ATP]/[S1] = 4) the burst phase is smaller for both WT and S217A, and the rate constant of the burst is faster for WT myosin V. The observed rate constants were plotted against the sum of ATP and protein concentrations (Fig. 4C). A linear dependence of the hydrolysis rate constant upon ATP concentration to >30 s-1 was observed for WT S1, whereas a hyperbolic fit resulted in an extrapolated maximal rate constant of 8.2 s-1 for myosin V-S1(S217A). Although the maximum rate of the hydrolytic step was not determined for WT myosin by quench flow, the measured value at the highest applied ATP concentration was more than 5 times higher than for the mutant, and the quench-flow data support the conclusion obtained from Fig. 3 that the ATP hydrolysis step is significantly slower in the S217A mutant. The slow phases are ∼10-fold slower for the S217A than the WT, which is consistent with the rates measured by the NADH-coupled steady-state assays, tryptophan fluorescence, and single turnover stopped-flow experiments. Phosphate Dissociation from Actomyosin V-ADP-Pi—The rate constant of phosphate dissociation from the actomyosinADP-Pi complex can be measured by using a fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Google Scholar). In a double mixing stopped-flow experiment, myosin V-S1 or HMM was first mixed with ATP under single turnover conditions and incubated to allow ATP binding and hydrolysis to occur, which was then followed by mixing with actin to measure the kinetics of Pi dissociation. The MDCC-PBP was present at the same concentration in all three syringes, to obtain a large excess over phosphate in the stopped-flow cell. To prevent phosphate contamination, all solutions were preincubated with phosphate mop (for the components and concentrations see “Experimental Procedures”). To obtain the observed rate constants, time courses were fit with double exponential equations. Representative traces are shown in Fig. 5, A and B. The fast phase had a fractional amplitude of 0.9, which is attributed to the Pi release from the actomyosinADP-Pi complex produced from myosinADP-Pi binding to actin. The slow phase (0.2 s-1) had a significantly smaller fractional amplitude (0.09), and based on our previous work with skeletal myosin (10Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Google Scholar, 19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Google Scholar), it measures the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis by myosin V-ATP bound to actin. A hyperbolic fit of the dependence of kobs for the faster phase of Pi dissociation upon actin concentration has a maximal rate of 16.2 ± 1.6 s-1 and an apparent actin dissociation constant of 9.4 ± 2.6 μm for the actomyosin V-S1(S217A)ADP-Pi products (Fig. 5C). A similar maximum phosphate dissociation rate of 21 ± 1 s-1 and a Kapp of 5.3 ± 0.9 μm were obtained for the myosin V-HMM(S217A) (Fig. 5C). The rate constants of Pi dissociation measured here for myosin V(S217A) are ∼10 times less than the rate constants measured for WT myosin V-S1 and HMM as reported previously (4Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature.. 1999; 400: 590-593Google Scholar, 10Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Google Scholar, 22Forgacs E.

ATP Induced Dissociation of Actomyosin V-S1(S217A)—ATP binding to the actomyosin complex induces a conformational change that results in weaker binding and subsequent dissociation of most types of myosin from actin. We measured the decrease in light scattering following mixing actomyosin V-S1(S217A) with ATP, which was fit by two exponential terms (Fig. 6A). A linear fit of the dependence of the faster rate upon ATP concentration gives a second order rate constant of 0.29 μm-1s-1 (Fig. 6B). The end point of the light-scattering signal observed upon mixing actomyosin V-S1(S217A) with ATP is approximately half-way between light scattering of the actomyosin V-S1(S217A) and the light-scattering signal from actin in the absence of myosin V-S1. These experiments indicate that at the end of the rapid phase myosin V-S1(S217A) is only ∼50% dissociated from 5 μm actin. The Kapp is, therefore, ∼5 μm for myosin V-S1(S217A)-ATP binding to actin. The relatively small amplitude of the slow phase indicates that there is not a significant change in the affinity of the myosin for actin associated with the hydrolysis step. Because the rates of hydrolysis, phosphate dissociation, and ADP dissociation are similar, it would be expected that actomyosin V-S1(S217A) intermediates with bound ATP, ADP-Pi, and ADP would all be present during the steady state. The maximum rate constant of the fast phase is attributed to the dissociation of myosin V-S1(S217A)-ATP from the actin. The maximum rate constant of the slow phase, 18 s-1, is in reasonably good agreement with the modeled rate of 24 s-1 at which a reaction with a hydrolysis rate constant of 8 s-1 and a phosphate dissociation rate constant of 16 s-1 approaches the steady-state binding of myosin V-S1(S217A) to actin after mixing actomyosin with ATP. We could not observe a change in light scattering for WT actomyosin V-S1 because of the tight binding of myosin V to actin in the presence of ATP (data not shown). ADP Dissociation from Myosin V-S1(S217A) in the Absence and Presence of Actin—The dissociation of deac-aminoADP from the S1(S217A) was measured by mixing the myosin V-S1(S217A)-deac-aminoADP complex with excess ATP. A rate constant of 0.86 s-1 was obtained by fitting a single exponential to the fluorescence decrease (Fig. 7A). The rate constant of deac-aminoADP dissociation from actomyosin V-S1(S217A)-deac-aminoADP was determined to be 1.34 s-1 in an experiment in which the initial mixture of actin, myosin V-S1(S217A), and deac-aminoADP were mixed with ATP (Fig. 7B). The dissociation of ADP, deoxymantADP, and deac-aminoADP from actomyosin V-S1(S217A) was also measured by light scattering. Actomyosin V-S1(S217A)-ADP complexes were mixed with ATP, and the rate constant of ADP dissociation was determined using light scattering to measure the rate at which excess ATP dissociated the myosin V from actin. Dissociation rate constants of 17 s-1 (ADP), 20 s-1 (mdADP), and 0.9 s-1 (deac-aminoADP) were measured for dissociation of nucleoside diphosphates from actomyosin V-S1(S217A) (Fig. 7, C–E). Rate constants of 10, 17, and 0.5 s-1 were measured for the dissociation of the same series of nucleotide diphosphates from WT actomyosin V-S1 (data not shown). These experiments show that ADP, deoxymantADP, and deac-aminoADP dissociation occurs at a slightly higher rate from the actomyosin V-S1(S217A) than from WT actomyosin V-S1 complexes (22Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Kovacs M. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Google Scholar). Measurement of deac-aminoADP Dissociation from Actomyosin V-deac-aminoADP-Pi Complexes—We used double mixing stopped-flow experiments to measure the rate constants of the deac-aminoADP dissociation from the actomyosin V-HMM(S217A)-deac-aminoADP-Pi complex and to determine whether the dissociation rate from the lead head is reduced in S217A as was observed previously in the WT. Equimolar concentrations of mutant myosin V-S1 or HMM and deac-aminoATP were mixed, and the reaction was aged for 20 s to allow deac-aminoATP to bind and be hydrolyzed by myosin V. The kinetics of product dissociation were measured after a second mix with phalloidin-actin and either a 2 mm ATP chase or a 2 mm hexokinase-treated ADP chase to prevent deac-aminoADP rebinding.

However, the precise role of Ski in muscle cell differentiation and its underlying molecular mechanism are not fully understood. To elucidate the involvement of Ski in muscle terminal differentiation, two retroviral systems were used to achieve conditional overexpression or knockdown of Ski in satellite cell-derived C2C12 myoblasts. We found that enforced expression of Ski promoted differentiation, whereas loss of Ski severely impaired it. Compromised terminal differentiation in the absence of Ski was likely because of the failure to induce myogenin (Myog) and p21 despite normal expression of MyoD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional reporter experiments showed that Ski occupied the endogenous Myog regulatory region and activated transcription from the Myog regulatory region upon differentiation. Transactivation of Myog was largely dependent on a MEF3 site bound by Six1, not on the binding site of MyoD or MEF2. Activation of the MEF3 site required direct interaction of Ski with Six1 and Eya3 mediated by the evolutionarily conserved Dachshund homology domain of Ski. Our results indicate that Ski is necessary for muscle terminal differentiation and that it exerts this role, at least in part, through its association with Six1 and Eya3 to regulate the Myog transcription.

Colmenares C. Richmond C. Stavnezer E. Oncogene.. 1997; 15: 459-471Google Scholar, 27Heyman H.C. Stavnezer E. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 26996-27003Google Scholar). Ski does not bind DNA directly (28Nagase T. Mizuguchi G. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Res... 1990; 18: 337-343Google Scholar) but interacts with several different transcription factors to modulate transcription as either a co-activator or a co-repressor depending on its DNA binding partner. Both v-ski and c-ski cause oncogenic transformation and induce myogenic differentiation in non-muscle avian embryo fibroblasts (2Stavnezer E. Barkas A.E. Brennan L.A. Brodeur D. Li Y. J.

Virol... 1991; 65: 4929-4935Google Scholar). The latter activity involves activation of muscle-specific genes, including the myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) genes, MyoD and myogenin (Myog) (29Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E.

Genes Dev... 1990; 4: 1462-1472Google Scholar). Moreover expression of Ski increases in skeletal muscle at midgestation of mouse development (33Namciu S. Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Dev. Dyn... 1995; 204: 291-300Google Scholar). The requirement of the endogenous gene for normal muscle development was demonstrated by the observation that Ski-null mice show a marked decrease in skeletal muscle mass (34Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2029-2039Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that regulation of myogenesis by Ski might be mediated by its ability to activate transcription driven by the regulatory elements of muscle-specific genes, such as myosin light chain 1/3 (MLC1/3), the muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and most importantly Myog (35Engert J.C. Servaes S. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Rosenthal N. Nucleic Acids Res... 1995; 23: 2988-2994Google Scholar, 36Kobayashi N. Goto K. Horiguchi K. Nagata M. Kawata M. Miyazawa K. Saitoh M. Miyazono K.

The Ski-responsive cis element of Myog resides in a 184-bp regulatory region immediately upstream of the Myog promoter. This region has been shown to be sufficient for the complete recapitulation of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Myog during embryogenesis (36Kobayashi N. Goto K. Horiguchi K. Nagata M.

Biol... 1992; 12: 3665-3677Google Scholar). DNA binding sites for MyoD and myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) in this regulatory region were found to be necessary for Myog transcription (40Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1992; 12: 3665-3677Google Scholar, 41Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science.. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Google Scholar, 42Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes Dev... 1990; 4: 582-595Google Scholar). Transient reporter assays have shown that Ski cooperates with MyoD and MEF2 to activate transcription from the 184-bp Myog regulatory region (36Kobayashi N. Goto K. Horiguchi K. Nagata M. Kawata M. Miyazawa K. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Genes Cells.. 2007; 12: 375-385Google Scholar). However, no direct interactions between Ski and these muscle-specific transcription factors have been reported. In vitro studies have revealed that terminal differentiation of myoblasts proceeds through a highly ordered sequence of events. These cells express MyoD while proliferating, but when growth stimuli are removed, they initiate expression of Myog followed by the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle. Subsequently these postmitotic myocytes express muscle-specific contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain (MHC) and finally fuse into multinucleated myotubes (43Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 132: 657-666Google Scholar). This process is governed mainly by two families of transcription factors, the MRFs and MEF2 (44Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9366-9373Google Scholar, 45Sartorelli V. Caretti G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 2005; 15: 528-535Google Scholar, 46Berkes C.A. Tapscott S.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol... 2005; 16: 585-595Google Scholar). The MRF gene family includes MyoD, Myf5, Myog, and MRF4 (44Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 9366-9373Google Scholar, 47Perry R.L. Rudnick M.A. Front. Biosci... 2000; 5: D750-D767Google Scholar, 48Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol... 2002; 18: 747-783Google Scholar). All MRF family members share a highly conserved basic region and adjacent helix-loop-helix motif (bHLH) that mediates binding to a consensus DNA sequence, CANNTG, known as the E box, that is present in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes. Forced expression of any MRF gene is capable of inducing expression of muscle-specific genes and activation of myogenic differentiation even in non-muscle cells. The MEF2 proteins belong to the superfamily of MADS (MCM1-agamous-deficient serum response factor) box transcription factors and directly bind an A+T-rich element found in the promoters and enhancers of many muscle specific genes (49Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev... 1991; 5: 2327-2341Google Scholar). Genetic analysis reveals that members of the MEF2 family are also essential for terminal muscle differentiation (50Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol... 1995; 172: 2-14Google Scholar). Another cis element, the MEF3 site (consensus sequence, TCAGGTT), is also present in the 133-bp Myog regulatory region. Studies of transgenic mice demonstrated that mutation of this MEF3 site abolishes correct expression of a Myog-LacZ transgene during embryogenesis (51Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 14220-14225Google Scholar). Two skeletal muscle-specific members of the Six family (sine oculis homeodomain-containing transcription factors), Six1 and Six4, bind to the MEF3 element and transactivate Myog transcription (51Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 14220-14225Google Scholar). Drosophila sine oculis (so) has been shown to act synergistically with eyes absent (eya) and dachshund (dac) by direct protein-protein interactions. Similar interactions underlie the synergism of their mammalian homologues Six, Eya, and Dach (10Hammond K.L. Hanson I.M. Brown A.G. Lettice L.A. Hill R.E. Mech.

This evolutionarily conserved regulatory network of Eya/Six/Dach has been shown to regulate myogenesis in chicken somite culture and in the chick limb and to activate transcription of reporters containing the Myog MEF3 site (52Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 3231-3243Google Scholar, 53Li X. Oghi K.A. Zhang J. Krones A. Bush K.T. Glass C.K. Nigam S.K. Aggarwal A.K. Maas R. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature.. 2003; 426: 247-254Google Scholar). Interaction of mammalian Dach with Six protein is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved DHD motif (60Li X. Perissi V. Liu F. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Science.. 2002; 297: 1180-1183Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that by virtue of its possession of these conserved domains (7Wilson J.J. Malakhova M. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Hegde R.S. Structure (Lond.).. 2004; 12: 785-792Google Scholar, 10Hammond K.L. Hanson I.M. Brown A.G. Lettice L.A. Hill R.E. Mech. Dev... 1998; 74: 121-131Google Scholar, 12Davis R.J. Shen W. Heanue T.A. Mardon G. Dev. Genes Evol... 1999; 209: 526-536Google Scholar) Ski might also interact with Six and Eya proteins to regulate Myog expression and thereby control commitment of myogenic cells to terminal differentiation (52Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 3231-3243Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed this possibility by exploiting the well characterized mouse muscle satellite cell line, C2C12, as a model system. Using retroviral vectors to achieve tetracycline-regulated overexpression or knockdown of Ski, we asked whether Ski might not only stimulate but also be required for terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells. To probe the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of Myog by Ski, the E box, MEF2, and MEF3 sites in the Myog regulatory region were investigated as the possible cis response elements. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we asked whether direct binding of Ski to MyoD, MEF2c, Six1, and/or Eya3 mediates its transcriptional activity. Finally chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to determine whether Ski resides at the endogenous Myog regulatory region prior to or concomitant with the initiation of terminal differentiation. Construction of Retroviral Vectors—The replication-defective retroviral vector LNITX was kindly provided by Dr. Fage and was described earlier (61Odelberg S.J. Kollhoff A. Keating M.T. Cell.. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the human SKI cDNA was excised from the plasmid pSHHSKIN1D using BamHI and ClaI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and inserted into the LINTX vector at the PmeI site to produce LNIT-huSKI. The replication-defective retroviral vector TMP-tTA was modified from the SIN-TREmiR30-PIG (TMP) vector (kindly provided by Dr. Scott Lowe) (62Dickins R.A. Hemann M.T. Zilfou J.T. Simpson D.R.

Graham E. Baldock R. Bhattacharya S.S. Hill R.E. Development.. 1991; 112: 1053-1061Google Scholar) gene (66Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar). The sequences of shRNAs targeting mouse Ski were chosen using RNAi Codex and are designated by their positions in the mouse Ski cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF435852): mSki1145 (bases 1145–1163), mSki1819 (bases 1819–1837), and mSki977 (bases 977–995). DNA forms of these shRNA inserts were generated by PCR amplification of 97-base synthetic oligonucleotides using Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and a common set of primers (5′-cagaggctcgagaaggtatattgctgttgacagtgagcg-3′ and 5′-cgcggcgaattccgaggcagtaggca-3′). The PCR products were subsequently digested with XhoI and EcoRI and inserted between these sites within TMP-tTA vector to generate TMP-tTA-mSki1145, TMP-tTA-mSki1819, and TMP-tTA-mSki977. Clones containing these shRNA-encoding inserts were sequence-verified. Tissue Culture and Transfection—Proliferating mouse C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in growth medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.002% Fungizone (Invitrogen). To avoid spontaneous differentiation, cells were always kept in subconfluent (60–70%) conditions. Terminal differentiation was induced by switching subconfluent cells (80%) to differentiation medium (DM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% heat-inactivated horse serum, and antibiotics as in GM. Morphological differentiation, judged by myotube formation, was documented by digital photography of phase-contrast microscopic images. Retroviral Packaging and Infection—The retrovirus packaging cell line PA317 (ATCC number SD3443) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. They were transfected with retroviral constructs by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, the medium was harvested, and live cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The retrovirus-containing supernatant was used to infect exponentially growing C2C12 cells at 40% confluence in the presence of 10 ng/ml Polybrene (Sigma). The infection was repeated with freshly harvested virus 12 h later. After an additional 12 h of culture, C2C12 cells were switched to GM plus 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox; an analog of tetracycline) and antibiotics (G418 at 750 μg/ml for LNITX-based constructs and puromycin at 2 ng/ml for TMP-tTA-based constructs). Two weeks later the resulting individual colonies were isolated using cloning discs according to the manufacturer's protocol (PGC Scientifics, 62-6151-14) and expanded in GM with Dox and G418 or puromycin. After culture in GM minus Dox, clones were screened by Western blot analysis for tetracycline-regulated Ski overexpression or knockdown. Western Blotting—Whole-cell extracts were prepared from confluent C2C12 cells on 100-mm culture dishes as follows: cells were scraped into 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After 10-min incubation on ice, the suspension was subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of proteins were boiled in protein loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol), separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore). For most antibodies, blots were preblocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and incubated with primary antibodies in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed with TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase followed by washes with TBST. Signals were detected using either enhanced chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce) or CDP-Star® alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescent substrate (1:50; Tropix) and exposure to HyBlot CL autoradiography film (Denville Scientific). When using anti-Ski G8 monoclonal antibody, the blots were preblocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS (7.7 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm NaH2PO4, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), 0.4% casein, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (40,000), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Tween, pH 7.2) and then incubated with primary antibody in the same solution for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed with blocking buffer and further incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently the blots were washed with blocking buffer and then with assay buffer (0.1 m EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% azide, pH 10.0), and the signal was detected with CDP-Star alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescent substrate as above. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: Ski (monoclonal antibody (1:2000; G8, Learner Research Institute Hybridoma Core Facility) or rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; H329, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), Myog (1:1000; F5D, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), TFIIE-α (1:3000; C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), MHC (1:1000; MF-20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), MyoD (1:1000; 5.8A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-FLAG (1:5000; M2, Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were: alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) and anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) (1:30,000; Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Mouse IgG TrueBlot™ and Rabbit IgG TrueBlot (1:1000; eBioscience). Immunofluorescence—C2C12 myoblasts (2 × 104) were seeded into each well of LAB-TEK® 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) coated with 1 μg/cm2 laminin (Invitrogen) in GM and switched to DM for 3 days. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 30 min at room temperature; permeabilized with 10% goat serum, 1% Triton X-100, and PBS for 10 min; and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS, 10% goat serum, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Chambers were washed with PBST (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and mounted in Vectashield aqueous mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained using an Olympus BX50 upright fluorescence microscope equipped with Polaroid digital camera PDMC2, Polaroid PDMC2 software, and fluorescent illumination. Images were assembled using Photoshop CS (Adobe). The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence: MyoD (1:100; 5.8A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Myog (1:100; F5D, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), MHC (1:200; MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and p21 (1:100; SX118, BD Pharmingen). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488- or Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:300; Molecular Probes). Control experiments performed with normal IgG as the primary antibody yielded no signal above the background. Quantification was performed by counting at least 1000 DAPI-stained nuclei in more than 10 random fields per culture plate. For MHC, the differentiation index = nuclei within MHC-stained multinucleate myotubes/total number of DAPI-stained nuclei, and the fusion index = the average number of nuclei per MHC-stained myotube. For nuclear proteins, the differentiation index = number of antibody-stained nuclei/total number of DAPI-stained nuclei. All experiments were performed in triplicate on three independent cultures, and the standard deviation was calculated. Real Time PCR—RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with DNase I treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase SuperScript™ III (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR (iCycler iQ™, Bio-Rad) was performed using SYBR® Green PCR Core Reagents (Applied Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocols. PCR was performed for 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s followed by a single 72 °C extension step for 5 min. Primer sequences used for real time PCR will be provided upon request. Analyses were performed in triplicate on RNA samples from three independent experiments. Threshold cycles (Ct) of target genes were normalized against the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), and relative transcript levels were calculated from the Ct values as Y = 2–ΔCt where Y is -fold difference in amount of target gene versus Gapdh and ΔCt = Ctx – CtGapdh. ChIP—Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed essentially as described before (67Young D.P. Kushner I. Samols D. J. Immunol... 2008; 181: 2420-2427Google Scholar). Briefly C2C12 cells cultured in GM or DM for 2 days were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were scraped and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Suspensions were sonicated to yield chromatin with an average DNA length of 200–500 bp. Equal amounts of chromatin from each sample (2 × 106 cells/assay) we"

Here we compared ppGpp/DksA mediated control of σ54-dependent transcription in these two organisms. Our in vivo experiments employed P. putida mutants and manipulations of factors implicated in ppGpp/DksA mediated control of σ54-dependent transcription in combination with a series of σ54-promoters with graded affinities for σ54-RNA polymerase. For in vitro analysis we used a P. putida-based reconstituted σ54-transcription assay system in conjunction with DNA-binding plasmon resonance analysis of native and heterologous σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzymes. In comparison with E. coli, ppGpp/DksA responsive σ54-transcription in the environmentally adaptable P. putida was found to be more robust under low energy conditions that occur upon nutrient depletion. The mechanism behind this difference can be traced to reduced promoter discrimination of low affinity σ54-promoters that is conferred by the strong DNA binding properties of the P. putida σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme.

In addition to the household σ70-factor, most bacteria encode a variable number of alternative σ-factors that fall into two families based on primary amino acid sequences and regulatory properties. The largest of these is the σ70-family, which encompasses most alternative σ-factors within four subgroups that all form RNAP holoenzymes that can spontaneously initiate transcription (1Gruber T.M.

Orthologs of the structurally distinct σ54-subunit are the only members of the second family. σ54 imposes kinetic constrains that lock the σ54-RNAP holoenzyme in a non-productive closed complex. Thus, σ54-dependent transcription always requires activators, called bacterial enhancer-binding proteins or bEBPs, which use ATP catalysis to remodel σ54-RNAP/DNA interactions to stimulate DNA melting and formation of the transcription competent open-complex (reviewed in Ref. 2Wigneshweraraj S.

Many bacteria from different phylogenetic groups use σ54-dependent transcription to control numerous environmental-responsive processes ranging from expression of chemotaxis transducers and assembly of motility organs, through alginate biosynthesis, to nitrogen assimilation and the utilization of different carbon sources (Refs. 2Wigneshweraraj S.

The metabolically and environmentally versatile Pseudomonas putida species use σ54-dependent transcription extensively (5Cases I. Ussery D.W. de Lorenzo V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This group of organisms, in combination with resident catabolic plasmids, is notably associated with its ability to use aromatic compounds as growth substrates. In many cases, the expression of these pathways are ultimately dependent on σ54-RNAP and are subject to global regulatory input. This results in suppression of transcription of the specialized catabolic genes when energetically more favorable carbon sources are present (reviewed in Refs. 6Shingler V. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1226-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 7Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One such example is the dimethylphenol dmp-system of the plasmid pVI150, in which transcription of the dmp-operon for production of the catabolic enzymes is driven by the σ54-Po promoter. Transcription from σ54-Po is controlled in response to the presence of phenolic dmp-pathway substrates through the action of the divergently transcribed dmpR gene product, which binds the aromatic compounds to achieve its active transcriptional-promoting form (8O'Neill E. Ng L.C. Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9O'Neill E. Wikstrom P. Shingler V.

For the DmpR-regulated σ54-Po promoter, the bacterial alarmone ppGpp acts together with DksA to provide a link between σ54-dependent transcription and the metabolic status of the cell. This dominant global regulation results in silencing of Po activity until nutrient depletion at the exponential to stationary growth phase transition (11Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C. Skarfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nystrom T. Shingler V. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the levels of ppGpp vary enormously and are rapidly elevated in response to both nutritional limitation and physicochemical stress to redirect transcriptional capacity toward genes required to counteract adverse conditions (reviewed in Ref. 15Magnusson L.U. Farewell A. Nystrom T. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 236-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Both ppGpp and DksA directly target RNAP so that the relatively constant levels of DksA sensitize RNAP to the cellular levels of ppGpp to directly inhibit or stimulate transcription from susceptible σ70-dependent promoters of E. coli (16Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Paul B.J. Berkmen M.B. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Lack of ppGpp and/or DksA severely reduces σ54-dependent Po activity in both E. coli and P. putida without altering the constant levels of σ54 in the cell (11Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C. Skarfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nystrom T. Shingler V. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Artificial synthesis of ppGpp during exponential growth on rich media, on the other hand, results in transcription from Po under conditions where it is normally silent (11Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C. Skarfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nystrom T. Shingler V. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, whereas ppGpp and/or DksA-deficiency in E. coli severely limit transcription from Po and a range of other σ54-dependent promoters in vivo, they do not have any apparent effects in an E. coli reconstituted in vitro σ54-dependent transcription system (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together with the demonstration that σ54-RNAP levels are limiting in the cell (12Laurie A.D. Bernardo L.M. Sze C.C. Skarfstad E. Szalewska-Palasz A. Nystrom T. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1494-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the properties of RNAP mutations that bypass the need for ppGpp for efficient σ54-dependent transcription, these findings have led to a model in which ppGpp synthesis indirectly results in elevated levels of σ54-RNAP through competition between σ54 and other σ-factors for varying levels of core RNAP that are available for holoenzyme formation (12Laurie A.D.

Brännström K. Shingler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18046-18056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DksA and ppGpp have also been found to play other roles in the DmpR/σ54-Po regulatory circuit that would also contribute to the abrupt high level transcription observed from Po at the exponential to stationary phase growth transition (14Johansson L.U. Solera D. Bernardo L.M. Moscoso J.A. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). First, ppGpp and DksA directly stimulate transcription by σ70-RNAP from the Pr promoter of the dmpR gene to elevate DmpR levels (14Johansson L.U. Solera D. Bernardo L.M. Moscoso J.A. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, ppGpp and DksA might also elevate the levels of IHF (integration host factor) that facilitates productive interaction between Po-bound σ54-RNAP and DmpR bound to its distally located binding sites (upstream activation sites, UASs) (19Sze C.C. Laurie A.D. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, DmpR also stimulates its own production through a mechanism in which σ54-RNAP activity at the σ54-Po promoter stimulates σ70-Pr output. This regulation thus generates a feed forward loop that is dependent on not only the direct effects of ppGpp and DksA on Pr activity, but also their effects on IHF and σ54-RNAP levels required for Po activity (14Johansson L.U. Solera D. Bernardo L.M. Moscoso J.A. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Much of the analysis of the mechanisms of ppGpp/DksA-mediated control of σ54-transcription have been identified using mutants of E. coli, which has a very different lifestyle than the environmentally and nutritionally adaptable soil Pseudomonads. In addition to bouts of feast and famine, soil bacteria are frequently exposed to extremes in physicochemical parameters (temperature, water content etc). When faced with aromatic compounds, bacteria are confronted with chemicals that, can potentially be catabolized as a carbon and energy source for growth, but are also toxic stress agents (Ref. 20Dominguez-Cuevas P. Gonzalez-Pastor J.E. Marques S. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11981-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and references therein). Transcription from σ54-promoters, as with any other type of promoter, functions within the context of the evolutionary selected regulatory network of the host bacteria. In this work we sought to test if regulatory mechanisms that couple σ54-dependent transcription to cellular physiology in E. coli also operate in P. putida. In particular, we were interested to determine whether the properties of the σ54-RNAPs from E. coli and P. putida underlie differences in ppGpp/DksA control of σ54-promoter activity that we observed in vivo in these two organisms. General Procedures—E. coli and P. putida strains (Table 1) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (LB), (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with the following antibiotics as appropriate for the strain and resident plasmid selection: carbenicillin (Cb, 100 μg ml–1 for E. coli and 2 mg ml–1 for P. putida), kanamycin (Km, 50 μg ml–1 for both E. coli and P. putida), tellurite (Tel, 40 μg ml–1 for P. putida), tetracycline (Tc, 5 μg ml–1 for E. coli and 50 μg ml–1 for P. putida), and trimethoprim (Tp, 100 μg ml–1 for E. coli). M9 minimal media plates (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 100 μg ml–1 thiamine were used for prototrophy tests. E. coli DH5 was used for construction and maintenance of all but R6K-based suicide plasmids for which the replication permissive S17λpir host was used.TABLE 1Bacterial strainsStrainaResistance abbreviations are: Cm, chloramphenicol; Km, kanamycin; Gm, gentamycin; Tc, tetracycline; Tel, tellurite; Sm, streptomycin; Tp, trimethoprim.Relevant propertiesRef./SourceE. coli strains BL21(DE3) pLysSIPTG inducible T7 polymerase expression host54Rosenberg A.H.

Plasmids were constructed by a common procedure of assembly on pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) followed by subcloning into an RSF1010-based plasmid to generate the broad host range (16 to 20 copies per cell) transcriptional reporters (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Construction of pBluescript-based plasmids pVI769 and pVI733 has previously been described (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVI769 carries the dmpR-Po promoter region with unique NdeI and BamHI sites located –39 relative to the transcriptional start of Po for insertion of σ54-promoter regions upstream of the promoterless luxAB genes. Plasmid pVI733 carries the same DNA as pVI769 but with a non-native XhoI site engineered at –122 to –117 relative to the transcriptional start of Po. The XhoI to NdeI Po promoter upstream region of pVI733 was replaced by the equivalent region of Pu using a custom designed linker, resulting in pVI778. In the next step, linkers with the desired σ54-promoter sequences were introduced into pVI778, as previously described (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), to give pVI779 (xh-Pu/Po-luxAB), pVI780 (xh-Pu/Pu-luxAB), pVI781 (xh-Pu/PpspA-luxAB), and pVI782 (xh-Pu/PglnA-luxAB). The promoter-luxAB fusions of pVI779 to pVI782 were then excised as BglII to HindIII fragments and cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the RSF1010-based broad host range plasmid pVI432 (13Bernardo L.M. Johansson L.U. Solera D. Skarfstad E. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), resulting in pVI789 to pVI792, respectively. To generate a monocopy luxAB transcriptional reporter of the dksA promoter in P. putida, we used the KmR R6K-based suicide plasmid pKm705L that carries the promoterless luxAB genes downstream of a polylinker (22Sarand I. Osterberg S. Holmqvist S. Holmfeldt P. Skarfstad E. Parales R.E. Shingler V. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1320-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The promoter region of P. putida dksA was then amplified as a KpnI to SacI fragment using primers dksApro-f and dksApro-r and inserted between these sites of pKm705L to generate pVI906 for subsequent single site recombination into the chromosome of P. putida as previously described (22Sarand I. Osterberg S. Holmqvist S. Holmfeldt P. Skarfstad E. Parales R.E. Shingler V. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1320-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DksA Expression Plasmid—The expression plasmid pVI905 encoding P. putida His-DksA was constructed as described for E. coli His-DksA that is functionally indistinguishable from its native counterpart in in vivo and in vitro assays (16Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The P. putida dksA coding region (TIGR PP4693) was amplified as an NheI to HindIII fragment using primers dksA-f and dksA-r and cloned between these sites of pET28a (Novagen), to give pVI905. pfrA Gene Inactivation Plasmid—To generate a gene replacement mutant of the pfrA gene of P. putida (TIGR PP0191), an XhoI to BamHI fragment spanning the 5′- and 3′-ends of the pfrA gene with a unique BglII site replacing codons 17 to 156 was generated by overlapping PCR using primers pfrAup-f, pfrAup-r, pfrAdo-f, and pfrAdo-r. The resulting XhoI to BamHI fragment was cloned between these sites of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) to generate pVI909. A BamHI fragment carrying the Km gene of p34S-Km3 (23Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was then cloned into the BglII site of pVI909, with the antibiotic resistance gene transcribing in the same direction as the pfrA gene, generating pVI910. Finally, the resulting ΔpfrA::Km gene replacement was cloned as an XhoI to BamHI fragment between the XhoI and BglII sites of the R6K suicide plasmid pDM4-Tc (22Sarand I. Osterberg S. Holmqvist S. Holmfeldt P. Skarfstad E. Parales R.E. Shingler V. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1320-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) resulting in pVI911. Strain Generation—Introduction of the lacIQ/Ptac-ihfAB mini-Tc transposon carried on the suicide plasmid pUTtetPF (24Teras R. Hõrak R. Kivisaar M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) into the chromosome of P. putida KT2440::dmpR-Tel was by conjugation from the E. coli donor host S17λpir. Tellurite and tetracycline were used as counter selection for the donor and recipient parental strains, respectively. To generate the ΔpfrA::Km kanamycin gene replacement mutant of P. putida KT2440::dmpR-Tel, pVI911 was introduced by conjugation from S17λpir, with tellurite and kanamycin used as counter selection for the donor and recipient parental strains. Double site recombinants were identified by screening for loss of the plasmid-encoded Tc resistance marker, and verified by diagnostic PCR using primers specific for the intact pfrA gene and the ΔpfrA::Km kanamycin gene replacement. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—Luciferase assays of the luxAB gene product were performed on cultures grown and assayed at 30 °C. To ensure balanced growth, overnight cultures were diluted and grown into exponential phase prior to a second dilution to A600 of 0.05 to 0.08 and initiation of the experiment by addition of the DmpR effector 2-methylphenol or the XylR effector 3-methylbenzylalcohol to a final concentration of 2 mm for P. putida strains and 0.5 mm for E. coli strains. When used, IPTG (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) was present throughout growth from overnight cultures. Light emission from 100 μl of whole cells using 1:2000 dilution of decanal was measured using a PhL Luminometer (Aureon Biosystems). Data points are the average of duplicate determinations from each of two or more independent experiments. Immunoblot Analyses—Crude extracts of soluble cytosolic proteins, SDS-PAGE separation, and electrotransfer to membranes for immunodetection of proteins were as described previously (25Shingler V. Pavel H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against E. coli DksA (gift from D. Downs, Wisconsin) was pre-cleared against total cell lysate of an E. coli DksA null mutant (RK201) prior to use. Other polyclonal antisera used were directed against P. putida IHF (26Valls M.

Antibody-decorated bands were revealed using Amersham Biosciences polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and ECL+Plus reagents as directed by the manufacturer. ppGpp and Purified Proteins for in Vitro Assays—The nucleotide ppGpp was synthesized from ribosome-associated RelA as previously described (27Cashel M.

Recent studies suggest that the gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GOF mutations of SHP-2 induce these phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we show that GOF mutations in SHP-2, such as E76K and D61G, drastically increase spreading and migration of various cell types, including hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. More importantly, in vivo angiogenesis in SHP-2 D61G knock-in mice is also enhanced. Mechanistic studies suggest that the increased cell migration is attributed to the enhanced β1 integrin outside-in signaling. In response to β1 integrin cross-linking or fibronectin stimulation, activation of ERK and Akt kinases is greatly increased by SHP-2 GOF mutations. Also, integrin-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases is elevated. Interestingly, mutant cells with the SHP-2 GOF mutation (D61G) are more sensitive than wild-type cells to the suppression of cell motility by inhibition of these pathways. Collectively, these studies reaffirm the positive role of SHP-2 phosphatase in cell motility and suggest a new mechanism by which SHP-2 GOF mutations contribute to diseases.

The phenotypes demonstrated by loss of SHP-2 function are apparently attributed to the role of SHP-2 in the cell signaling pathways induced by growth factors/cytokines. SHP-2 generally promotes signal transmission in growth factor/cytokine signaling in both catalytic-dependent and -independent fashion (1Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In addition to the role of SHP-2 in cell proliferation and differentiation, the phenotypes induced by loss of SHP-2 function may be associated with its role in cell migration. Indeed, dominant negative SHP-2 disrupts Xenopus gastrulation, causing tail truncations (13Tang T.L. Freeman Jr., R.M. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y.

Part of the reason for this discrepancy might be due to the difference in the cell models used. Catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 was often used to determine the role of SHP-2 in cell signaling. In the catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2-overexpressing cells, the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 is inhibited. However, as SHP-2 also functions independent of its catalytic activity, overexpression of catalytically deficient SHP-2 may also increase its scaffolding function, generating complex effects. The critical role of SHP-2 in cellular function is further underscored by the identification of SHP-2 mutations in human diseases. Genetic lesions in PTPN11 that cause hyperactivation of SHP-2 catalytic activity have been identified in the developmental disorder Noonan syndrome (24Tartaglia M. Mehler E.L. Goldberg R. Zampino G.

F4 mice were used in this study. All animal procedures complied with the NIH Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ba/F3, an IL-3-dependent murine pro-B lymphoma cell line, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% conditioned medium produced by murine IL-3 cDNA-transfected X630 hematopoietic cells. Anti-SHP-2, anti-ERK, and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Abs) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Gab2 and anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) Abs were provided by Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt Abs were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Human fibronectin was supplied by Sigma. The MTS cell proliferation assay (a colorimetric method for determining numbers of viable cells) kit was obtained from Promega Life Science (Madison, WI). The small GTPase assay kit was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). Matrigel, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were provided by BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Rabbit anti-Von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibody was from ABR-Affinity Bio-Reagents (Golden, CO). Generation of Bone Marrow-derived Mast Cells and Macrophages—Bone marrow cells freshly isolated from 10- to 12-week-old SHP-2D61G/+ mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and mouse recombinant IL-3 (10 ng/ml) for 4 weeks. Mast cell phenotype was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis with Abs specific for c-kit and FcγRII/RIII. At the time of use, greater than 98% of the cultured cells were mast cells. To generate bone marrow-derived macrophages, bone marrow cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 20% L-cell conditioned medium (as a source of mouse colony-stimulating factor 1). After 24 and 48 h, non-adherent cells were collected and seeded into new tissue culture plates. Following 5 to 7 days of culture, cells were confirmed as macrophages as more than 90% of semi-adherent cells were positive for Mac-1 and F4/80. Adhesion/Spreading and Migration Assay—For the adhesion/spreading assay, 24-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin at 4 °C overnight and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Plates were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Wells coated with 1% BSA/PBS alone were used as controls. Test cells (5 × 105) suspended in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with 2% BSA were seeded into each well and centrifuged at 600 × g for 1 min to allow attachment of cells to the bottom of the wells. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in a5%CO2 incubator, unattached cells were removed by washing twice with pre-warmed RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% BSA. Adherent cells were quantified using the MTS assay. Migration assays were performed using transwells (8 μm pore size, 6.5 mm diameter; Corning Costa, Cambridge, MA) pre-coated on both sides of the transwell membranes with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. The lower chambers contained 600 μl of RPMI 1640 or DMEM with 2% FBS. Test cells (2 × 105 cells suspended in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 or DMEM with 2% BSA) were loaded into the upper chambers. They were allowed to migrate into lower chambers for 7 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells randomly migrating to the lower chambers were collected and counted on a hemacytometer. In the meantime, cells on the upper surface of the transwell membranes were mechanically removed. Migrated cells adhering to the lower side of the membranes were fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa, and enumerated under a microscope at ×200 magnification. In some experiments, transwell membranes were stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% methanol. Migrated cells adhering to the lower side of the membranes were quantified by measuring OD595 of the dye eluted with 10% acetic acid (50 μl). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—To induce integrin signaling, exponentially growing Ba/F3 or mast cells were starved in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% BSA for 5 h. Cells were collected and suspended in PBS (1 × 107 cells/ml) and incubated on ice for 15 min with monoclonal Ab against β1 integrin (anti-CD29, Ha/5, Pharmingen) or hamster IgM as a control. Cells were washed once with PBS and then stimulated by cross-linking using anti-hamster IgM monoclonal Ab at 37 °C for 5 and 15 min as reported (33Yu W.M. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Qu C.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1–2 μg of purified Abs. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. Small GTPase Assay—RhoA/Cdc42/Rac1 GTPase activation was determined by the GST-Rhotekin-RBD (for RhoA) or GST-PAK-CRIB (for Rac1 and Cdc42) pull-down assays. Cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in RIPA buffer containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Supernatants were collected quickly after centrifugation. An equal volume of whole cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 60 μg of GST-Rhotekin-RBD or GST-PKA-CRIB glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-pan-RhoA, anti-pan-Rac1, or anti-pan-Cdc42 Abs. Total cellular RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 levels in the whole cell lysates were also determined by immunoblotting. In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay—In vivo assessment of angiogenesis was performed as previously described (34Juarez J.C. Guan X. Shipulina N.V. Plunkett M.L. Parry G.C. Shaw D.E. Zhang J.C. Rabbani S.A.

Matrigel on ice was mixed with heparin (50 μg/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (800 ng/ml), and vascular endothelial growth factor (300 ng/ml). The Matrigel mixture of 0.5 ml was injected subcutaneously into flank areas (left and right sides) near the bottom and midline of the abdomen of 8–10-week-old SHP-2D61G/+ mice or WT littermates. Animals were sacrificed 9 days after Matrigel injection. The mouse skin was detached along the abdominal midline, and the Matrigel plugs were retrieved. The samples were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histology or dispensed in PBS buffer for analysis of hemoglobin levels. For measurement of hemoglobin, each Matrigel plug was dispersed in 1 ml of PBS and homogenized. The resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (50 μl) were mixed (1:5) with Drabkin's solution (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured and the hemoglobin levels were calculated based on the standard curve generated using purified human hemoglobin (Sigma). The results were normalized based on the hemoglobin levels of the mice, as SHP-2D61G/+ mice show slightly decreased hemoglobin in peripheral blood. In addition, Matrigel plugs were processed for cryosections followed by immunostaining with anti-vWF rabbit antiserum at 8 μg/ml. Normal rabbit IgG at the same concentration was used as the negative control. vWF positive endothelial cells/capillary vessels were quantified under a microscope. SHP-2 GOF mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome and childhood leukemias. Recent studies suggest that the SHP-2 GOF mutations play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, biochemical functions of GOF mutant SHP-2 are not fully understood. During our previous studies characterizing the mechanisms by which the SHP-2 GOF mutation E76K impacts IL-3 signaling, we noticed that Ba/F3 cells transduced with SHP-2 E76K displayed enhanced adhesion/spreading to tissue culture dishes (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the adhesion capability of WT SHP-2 overexpressing cells was not altered (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the migrating capability of SHP-2 E76K cells was greatly increased compared with the cells overexpressing WT SHP-2 or the cells transduced with the control vector (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the GOF mutation E76K in SHP-2 impacts cell spreading and movement. The results described above were obtained from SHP-2 E76K overexpressing cells. To exclude the possibility that the elevated SHP-2 protein level might affect the analyses and to further test whether other GOF mutations in SHP-2 can also enhance cell spreading and migration, we examined hematopoietic cells from SHP-2 D61G knock-in mice in which expression of mutant SHP-2 is at the physiological level (28Araki T. Mohi M.G. Ismat F.A. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Yang W. Pao L.I. Gilliland D.G. Epstein J.A. Neel B.G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Macrophages derived from SHP-2D61G/+ mice (SHP-2D61G/D61G mice are lethal at around embryonic day 13.5) adhered and spread much faster than WT macrophages when replated into non-tissue culture plates (Fig. 2A). Likewise, mast cells derived from SHP-2D61G/+ mice showed markedly increased adhesion/spreading in tissue culture plates (Fig. 2B). We also assessed the migrating capability of SHP-2D61G/+ cells. Compared with WT mast cells, SHP-2D61G/+ cells demonstrated drastically enhanced migration across transwell membranes. The numbers of cells migrating and attaching to the lower side of the membranes (Fig. 2C) as well as in the medium in the lower chambers (data not shown) were substantially increased compared with those of WT cells. To determine whether the effect of SHP-2 D61G mutation on cell motility is cell type-specific, we generated WT, SHP-2D61G/+, and SHP-2D61G/D61G embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from embryonic day 13.5 embryos, immortalized the cells by the 3T3 protocol, and evaluated cell behaviors. Spreading of SHP-2 mutant MEFs was also greatly increased compared with WT cells (Fig. 2D). Moreover, homozygous (SHP-2D61G/D61G) mutant cells spread much faster than heterozygous (SHP-2D61G/+) cells, especially at the early time points. Consistent with this result, migration of both homozygous and heterozygous cells was also enhanced (Fig. 2E). We also tested WT and mutant MEFs immortalized with SV40 large T antigen. Similar results were obtained (data not shown). These observations suggest that heterozygous GOF mutations of SHP-2 as identified in human diseases are sufficient to enhance cell motility and that the mutant SHP-2 functions in a dominant manner in this cellular process. The mechanisms by which GOF mutations in SHP-2 enhance cell spreading and migration were then investigated. We examined the impact of SHP-2 mutations on the signaling pathways activated by β1 integrin that plays a critical role in these cellular processes. In Ba/F3 cells, transduction of SHP-2 E76K, but not WT SHP-2 increased β1 integrin cross-linking-induced activation of ERK and Akt kinases (Fig. 3A). The increased activation of ERK and Akt pathways does not seem to be attributed to the high expression level of the mutant SHP-2 because β1 integrin-induced ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways were also drastically enhanced in SHP-2 D61G knock-in (SHP-2D61G/+) mast cells (Fig. 3B) in which the mutant SHP-2 is expressed at the physiological level. The enhanced activation of ERK and Akt correlated with the increased interaction between mutant SHP-2 (SHP-2 D61G) and the scaffolding protein Gab2 (Fig. 3C) that plays an important role in the ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways (37Gu H. Maeda H. Moon J.J. Lord J.D. Yoakim M. Nelson B.H. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7109-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The increased interaction between mutant SHP-2 and Gab2 is likely due to the SHP-2 conformational change induced by D61G mutation. D61G mutation disrupts intramolecular binding between the N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2) and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain, making SHP-2 bind more effectively to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab2 because there is no longer any free-energy cost to disrupting the N-SH2/PTP interface and opening the N-SH2 phosphotyrosine binding pocket. In agreement with the results obtained from hematopoietic cells, MEFs harboring heterozygous and homozygous D61G mutations also showed greatly increased activation of ERK kinases following fibronectin stimulation (Fig. 3D), consistent with a recent study (38Eminaga S. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15328-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in the heterozygous or homozygous cells at either the basal levels or in response to fibronectin stimulation was increased, rather than decreased, although SHP-2 D61G expressed in these cells possesses enhanced catalytic activity (25Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hahlen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 39Keilhack H. David F.S.

This result supports the general positive role of SHP-2 catalytic activity in integrin signaling. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further determined. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of SHP-2 activating mutations on activation of the Rho family small GTPases that have been shown to be critical in regulating cell motility. The role of SHP-2 phosphatase in activation of the Rho family small GTPases has been controversial. Both positive and negative roles for SHP-2 in RhoA activation have been reported (18Kodama A.

These results were obtained from calpeptin (a reported tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor)-treated cells, SHP-2 loss-of-function mutant cells, or dominant negative mutant SHP-2-overexpressing cells. The SHP-2 GOF mutation knock-in cells now provide an alternative model to clarify the role of SHP-2 in small GTPase activation. Accordingly, we determined small GTPase activities in SHP-2D61G/+ mast cells. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, integrin cross-linking-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 was greatly enhanced in SHP-2 D61G mutant cells, whereas activation of Cdc42 was slightly elevated. We also assessed RhoA GTPase activation in the SHP-2 E76K-transduced Ba/F3 cells in response to β1 integrin cross-linking. Similar results were obtained (data not shown). These data reaffirm that SHP-2 plays a positive role in activation of this family of small GTPases. To determine whether increased activation of RhoA, ERK, and PI3K/Akt pathways is responsible for the enhanced spreading and migration of SHP-2 D61G mutant cells, we treated WT and mutant MEFs with MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or transduced the cells with a dominant negative RhoA mutant (RhoA N19) (40Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and then assessed cell migration. The results showed that inhibition of these pathways decreased motility of both WT and mutant cells. Interestingly, SHP-2 D61G mutant cells were more sensitive than WT cells to the inhibition of these pathways (Fig. 4). These results suggest that enhanced activation of ERK, Akt, and RhoA pathways contributes to the increased motility of SHP-2 mutant cells. Finally, to confirm the effect of GOF mutations in SHP-2 on cell motility, we assessed angiogenesis of SHP-2 D61G mutant mice using a well characterized in vivo assay of angiogenesis (35Zhang J.C. Claffey K. Sakthivel R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Shaw D.E. Leal J. Wang Y.C. Lu F.M. McCrae K.R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2589-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Zhang J.C. Donate F. Qi X.

Matrigel containing basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor was injected subcutaneously into SHP-2D61G/+ mice or WT littermates. The Matrigel plugs were retrieved 9 days later. Blood vessel formation in the Matrigel plugs was determined based on their hemoglobin content. As shown in Fig. 5A, angiogenesis in the Matrigel plugs in SHP-2D61G/+ mice was significantly increased. To further verify this result, cryosections prepared from the Matrigel plugs were immunostained for vWF, a marker protein of endothelial cells (41Oswald J. Boxberger S. Jorgensen B. Feldmann S. Ehninger G. Bornhauser M. Werner C. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 42Jin K. Zhu Y. Sun Y. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 5, B and C, vWF positive endothelial cells/capillary vessels are significantly increased in the Matrigel plugs dissected from SHP-2D61G/+ mice. These results suggest that endothelial cells in the mutant mice have increased migration, although the increased angiogenesis in SHP-2D61G/+ mice may be due to enhanced integrin signaling and growth factor signaling. In summary, in this report we have shown that Noonan syndrome/leukemia mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase dramatically enhance cell motility. Our findings clarify the role of SHP-2 in adhesion-dependent activation of the RhoA family small GTPases. Moreover, they provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SHP-2 GOF mutation-associated diseases. Many developmental processes such as heart morphogenesis and vasculogenesis require the precise regulation of cell motility. Conceivably, certain phenotypes of SHP-2-associated Noonan syndrome or JMML might arise from aberrant cell motility induced by SHP-2 mutations. For example, lymphedema, one of the prominent phenotypes of Noonan syndrome, the pathogenesis of which has been unclear, might be induced by the increased motility of endothelial cells and thereby aberrant development of capillary vessels of the lymphatic system. Also, hepatomegaly caused by massive leukocyte infiltration into the liver in JMML is likely attributable to the increased motility of leukocytes. Additionally, as in vivo angiogenesis plays an important role in cancer formation and metastasis, our data indicate that GOF mutations in SHP-2 may contribute to tumorigenesis by enhancing tumor angiogenesis. The enhanced cell motility by GOF mutations in SHP-2 is apparently associated with the increased integrin outside-in signaling. Integrin-induced ERK, PI3K/Akt, as well as small GTPase pathways are hyper-activated by SHP-2 GOF mutations. Moreover, SHP-2 mutant cells are more sensitive than WT cells to the inhibition of these pathways in terms of the suppression of cell motility. However, detailed signaling mechanisms by which GOF mutations in SHP-2 enhance integrin signaling remain to be further determined. It seems that GOF mutations in SHP-2 impact adhesion-induced signaling by either promoting activation of upstream kinases or decreasing its efficiency of dephosphorylation of its downstream substrates. Physical interaction between SHP-2 D61G and Gab2 is significantly prolonged. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2 is greatly increased, even though Gab2 is a target of the catalytic activity of SHP-2 and the catalytic activity of SHP-2 D61G is increased (25Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hahlen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 39Keilhack H. David F.S. McGregor M. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30984-30993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, altered physical and functional interactions between mutant SHP-2 and its target proteins may play an important role. It is conceivable that the substrate specificity of the mutant SHP-2 is changed as the consequence of the mutation in the N-SH2 domain. This notion is also supported by previous observations that interaction between SHP-2 with Gab1 in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation is enhanced by Noonan syndrome/leukemia-associated SHP-2 mutations (28Araki T. Mohi M.G. Ismat F.A. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Yang W. Pao L.I. Gilliland D.G. Epstein J.A. Neel B.G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 39Keilhack H.

Mutat. 2004; 23: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study showed that SHP-2 D61G mutation induced hyper-tyrosyl phosphorylation of the transmembrane glycoproteins, SIRPα and PZR (38Eminaga S. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15328-15338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the two prominent targets of SHP-2 involved in cell adhesion and migration. Clearly, further studies are needed to define how GOF mutations in the N-SH2 domain change the accessibility of the catalytic site of SHP-2 to substrate proteins and how these changes diminish its efficiency in dephosphorylating the targets.

https://openalex.org/W2091858433,"HLA-DM (DM) mediates exchange of peptides bound to MHC class II (MHCII) during the epitope selection process. Although DM has been shown to have two activities, peptide release and MHC class II refolding, a clear characterization of the mechanism by which DM facilitates peptide exchange has remained elusive.We have previously demonstrated that peptide binding to and dissociation from MHCII in the absence of DM are cooperative processes, likely related to conformational changes in the peptide-MHCII complex. Here we show that DM promotes peptide release by a non-cooperative process, whereas it enhances cooperative folding of the exchange peptide. Through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence polarization (FP) we show that DM releases prebound peptide very poorly in the absence of a candidate peptide for the exchange process. The affinity and concentration of the candidate peptide are also important for the release of the prebound peptide. Increased fluorescence energy transfer between the prebound and exchange peptides in the presence of DM is evidence for a tetramolecular complex which resolves in favor of the peptide that has superior folding properties.This study shows that both the peptide releasing activity on loaded MHCII and the facilitating of MHCII binding by a candidate exchange peptide are integral to DM mediated epitope selection. The exchange process is initiated only in the presence of candidate peptides, avoiding possible release of a prebound peptide and loss of a potential epitope. In a tetramolecular transitional complex, the candidate peptides are checked for their ability to replace the pre-bound peptide with a geometry that allows the rebinding of the original peptide. Thus, DM promotes a ""compare-exchange"" sorting algorithm on an available peptide pool. Such a ""third party""-mediated mechanism may be generally applicable for diverse ligand recognition in other biological systems."

Cellular PS1 is cleaved to yield N-terminal fragments (NTFs) and carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) that associate to form functional heterodimers (3Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H.

In addition, the PS1/γ-secretase complex promotes the ϵ cleavage of cell surface type I transmembrane proteins like APP, receptors, and cell-cell adhesion factors including cadherins. The ϵ cleavages occur close to the membrane/cytoplasm interface and promote the production of soluble peptides containing the cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence of the cleaved proteins (CTFs). Many of these peptides have been shown to function as transcription factors and cell surface-to-nucleus communication signals (for review, see Ref. 7Marambaud P. Robakis N.K. Genes Brain Behav.. 2005; 4: 134-146Google Scholar). In agreement with this function of the γ-secretase proteolytic complex, PS1 is found at the plasma membrane in cell-cell contact sites where it associates with the cadherin-catenin adherens junctions (1Georgakopoulos A.

Formation of the PS1-cadherin complexes depends on the juxtamembrane region of cadherins at a site that is also important for the cadherin binding of p120 catenin (p120ctn), an integral component of the cadherin-catenin adherens junctions (8Baki L.

The p120ctn-catenin family contains 10–12 armadillo repeats (13McCrea P.D. Park J.I. Biochim. Biophys.

Because cadherins and PS1 are also known to play important roles in neuronal development and function (21Feng R. Wang H. Wang J. Shrom D. Zeng X. Tsien J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2004; 101: 8162-8167Google Scholar, 22Saura C.A. Choi S.Y. Beglopoulos V. Malkani S. Zhang D. Shankaranarayana Rao B.S. Chattarji S. Kelleher III, R.J. Kandel E.R. Duff K. Kirkwood A. Shen J. Neuron.. 2004; 42: 23-36Google Scholar), we took advantage of PS1 and cadherin mutants defective in p120ctn binding and employed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology to examine the role of p120ctn in the γ-secretase processing of cadherins. Our results indicate that p120ctn plays a central role in the γ-secretase association and processing of cadherins. In contrast, p120ctn suppresses APP processing and Aβ production, possibly by recruiting γ-secretase to cadherins and thus limiting its availability for the processing of APP. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibody 33B10 against residues 331–350 of the loop domain of PS1 and polyclonal antibody against the PS1 N-terminal fragment (antibody 222) have already been described (1Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M. Gordon R. Holstein G.R. Martinelli G. Mehta P. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 893-902Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the PS1 C-terminal fragment (S182) and N- and E-cadherin (H63 and H108) were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody and p120ctn were from BD Biosciences. 33B10 and anti-N-cadherin monoclonal antibody were used only for Western blot analysis. γ-Secretase inhibitor L665,458 was obtained from Calbiochem. Retroviral expression vector expressing pMX/PS1NTF or pMX/PS1CTF was generated by insertion of the corresponding cDNA into HindIII and EcoRI or into EcoRI, respectively. Other PS1 retroviral expression vectors were generated with pMX-IRES-GFP (23Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol.. 1996; 24: 324-329Google Scholar) and have been described previously (24Serban G. Kouchi Z. Baki L. Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C.M. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 36007-36012Google Scholar). Human N-cadherin was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 with EcoRI and NotI sites. Human E-cadherin was subcloned into the pMX vector with XhoI and NotI sites for viral transduction. The shRNA pSIREN-Retro vector against mouse or human p120ctn was constructed by inserting the sequences reported previously (14Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 163: 525-534Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used for the construction of a retroviral vector for human or mouse p120ctn shRNA: 5′-GATCTCCgccagaagtggtgcgaataTTCAAGAGAtattcgcaccacttctggcTTTTTG-3′, 5′-AATTCAAAAAgccagaagtggtgcgaataTCTCTTGAAtattcgcaccacttctggcGGA-3′, 5′-GATCTCCgccagaggtggttcggataTTCAAGAGAtatccgaaccacctctggcTTTTTG-3′, and 5′-AATTCAAAAAgccagaggtggttcggataTCTCTTGAAtatccgaaccacctctggcGGA-3′. All constructs were verified by sequencing. pcDNA3 vectors encoding VE-cadherin-GFP and Y658E mutant VE-cadherin-GFP were kindly given by Dr. D. Cheresh (25Potter M.D. Barbero S. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 31906-31912Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For PS1 expression in PS1-null fibroblasts or E-cadherin expression in SW48 cells, Phoenix α packaging cells were transfected with pMX retroviral vectors (23Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol.. 1996; 24: 324-329Google Scholar) and a pVSV-G plasmid (Clontech), and a retroviral gene was transferred into PS1–/– mouse fibroblasts or SW48 cells as described previously (24Serban G. Kouchi Z. Baki L. Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C.M. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 36007-36012Google Scholar). The transfection of VE-cadherin-GFP into Chinese hamster ovary cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GFP-positive fibroblasts or Chinese hamster ovary cells were sorted by using a MoFlo cell sorter after transduction. For p120ctn shRNA experiments, fibroblasts were infected with control retrovirus or retrovirus expressing p120ctn-specific shRNA, and the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting after transduction. Clonal p120ctn-depleted HEK293 cell lines were generated by transfection with control pSIREN vector or the vector expressing p120ctn-specific shRNA by Lipofectamine and limited dilution. Human N-cadherin was transfected into p120ctn KD cells by the Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blots (WBs) and Immunoprecipitations—For Western blot analysis, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), or HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 × complete protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation, cells were solubilized in HEPES buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or 1% digitonin or 10% glycerol and 0.2% dodecyl maltoside. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 40 min, and supernatants were pre-cleared with Protein A or Protein G for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated for 2 h or overnight with antibodies and treated for 1–2 h with Protein A or Protein G. Immunoprecipitates were washed with HEPES buffer containing detergent at least four times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro γ-Secretase Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell.. 2003; 114: 635-645Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells expressing exogenous N-cadherin were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and homogenized on ice. A supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and crude membranes were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 25 μl of assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4), completed with protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 2 or 12 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed on WBs and probed for N-cadherin. For APP intracellular domain (AICD) detection, in vitro assay was conducted in the same way except using SW48 cells. Sandwich Aβ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Collected conditioned media were analyzed using a BIOSOURCE Aβ40 kit (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) as described previously (26Shioi J. Georgakopoulos A. Mehta P. Kouchi Z. Litterst C.M. Baki L. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem.. 2007; 101: 674-681Google Scholar) or a Wako human Aβ42 kit according to the company's manual. SW48 cells were grown in the growth medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml insulin and 10 μmol/liter phosphoramidon for 24 h (27Walker E.S. Martinez M. Brunkan A.L. Goate A. J. Neurochem.. 2005; 92: 294-301Google Scholar), and the collected conditioned medium was mixed with Pefablock (1 mm) to minimize degradation of Aβ. Both the collected medium and different amounts of the standards of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were loaded together with the detection antibody supplied by the kits on the coated plates and incubated for 3 h at 23 °C. Data for AICD and Aβ40/42 were statistically analyzed by paired Student's t test. Mutations That Inhibit the p120ctn-Cadherin Binding Also Disrupt the PS1 Association with Cadherins—It has been reported that deletion of E-cadherin amino acid sequence 760–771 (corresponding to residues 604–615 of the mature protein) located at the juxtamembrane region of the protein disrupts its association with both p120ctn and PS1 (8Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Google Scholar, 28Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Google Scholar). Furthermore, E-cadherin mutant GGG759–761AAA, which is unable to bind p120ctn, also fails to bind PS1 (2Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar). To further examine the role of p120ctn in the cadherin association of PS1, we used the VE-cadherin mutant Y658E, which is unable to bind p120ctn (25Potter M.D. Barbero S. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 31906-31912Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that this mutant is also unable to bind PS1. Together, these data suggest that sequences critical to p120ctn-cadherin binding (for review, see Ref. 13McCrea P.D. Park J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 17-33Google Scholar) are also critical for the association of cadherins with PS1 (1Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M. Gordon R. Holstein G.R. Martinelli G. Mehta P. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 893-902Google Scholar, 2Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar, 8Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Google Scholar, 9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell.. 2003; 114: 635-645Google Scholar). Additional reports suggested direct binding of PS1 to the p120ctn family of proteins that includes δ-catenin and p0071 (10Stahl B. Diehlmann A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 9141-9148Google Scholar, 11Tanahashi H. Tabira T. Neuroreport.. 1999; 10: 563-568Google Scholar, 12Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport.. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Google Scholar), and we observed that PS1 deletion mutant 330–360, which is unable to associate with E-cadherin (24Serban G. Kouchi Z. Baki L. Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C.M. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 36007-36012Google Scholar), also failed to bind p120ctn (Fig. 1B). This last result is in agreement with reports that PS1 sequence 329–362, located in the C-terminal fragment of PS1 (PS1/CTF), promotes PS1 binding to p0071, a member of the p120 catenin family of proteins (10Stahl B. Diehlmann A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 9141-9148Google Scholar). The observation that sequences critical to p120ctn-cadherin or p120ctn-PS1 binding are also important for the cadherin-PS1 association, combined with evidence that PS1 binds directly to p120ctn, provides support to the theory that p120ctn mediates the PS1-cadherin association instead of competing with PS1 for cadherin (8Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Google Scholar). This theory is also consistent with our data that PS1 mutant 330–360 binds neither p120ctn nor E-cadherin (Fig. 1B). To verify that PS1/CTF mediates the cadherin-PS1 and p120ctn-PS1 associations, we transduced PS1 knockout (PS1–/–) fibroblasts with the PS1 fragments. Fig. 1C shows that PS1/CTF, when expressed alone, is able to form complexes with both cadherin and p120ctn. In contrast, PS1/NTF co-immunoprecipitates with p120ctn and N-cadherin only in the presence of PS1/CTF (Fig. 1C). Together, these data show that PS1/CTF mediates the PS1 association with both cadherin and p120ctn and that PS1 sequence 330–360 is critical to this association. p120ctn Mediates the Association of PS1 and Cadherins—The role of p120ctn in the PS1-cadherin interaction was further examined in p120ctn knockdown (KD) HEK293 cells, which express N-cadherin. Because down-regulation of p120ctn causes a decrease in the cellular levels of cadherins (14Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 163: 525-534Google Scholar, 19Elia L.P. Yamamoto M. Zang K. Reichardt L.F. Neuron.. 2006; 51: 43-56Google Scholar, 29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar), the KD cultures were transfected with N-cadherin so that its levels remained comparable with the levels of the control cultures (Fig. 2A, left panel). Knockdown of p120ctn had no effect on the cellular levels of PS1 fragments (Fig. 2A), and the amounts of the PS1-N-cadherin complexes in wild type (WT) and in p120ctn KD HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of exogenous N-cadherin were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Fig. 2A (middle and right panels) shows that knockdown of p120ctn results in a decrease in the PS1-cadherin complexes regardless of the cellular levels of cadherin, indicating that p120ctn is necessary for PS1 binding to N-cadherin. To examine whether p120ctn is also required for the interaction of full-length (uncleaved) PS1 and N-cadherin, PS1 mutant D257A, which is not processed into fragments (6Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature.. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar), was transduced into p120ctn KD HEK293 cells, and uncleaved PS1-cadherin complexes were determined. Fig. 2B shows that knockdown of p120ctn impaired the binding of PS1 mutant D257A to N-cadherin. Similar effects of p120ctn on the complexes between cadherin and full-length WT PS1 were observed when p120ctn KD HEK293 cells were transduced with PS1, a condition that results in excess uncleaved PS1 (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that p120ctn is necessary for the cadherin association of both uncleaved and cleaved PS1. In a different approach, we reintroduced p120ctn into the SW48 colon carcinoma cell line, which expresses no significant amounts of endogenous p120ctn (Fig. 2C) (29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar). To compensate for reduced levels of cadherin, we transduced these cells with exogenous E-cadherin, and the E-cadherin-PS1 complexes in these cell systems were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Fig. 2C shows that although exogenous p120ctn promoted the PS1-E-cadherin association, exogenous E-cadherin was unable to increase the PS1-E-cadherin association in the absence of p120ctn (Fig. 2C). Together, our data show that p120ctn is a prerequisite for the physical association between PS1 and E-cadherin. PS1 Deletion Mutant Unable to Bind p120ctn Fails to Process Cadherin Although It Promotes Processing of APP—To investigate the function of p120ctn in the PS1-mediated cadherin cleavage, we took advantage of deletion mutant PS1Δ330–360, which is unable to bind p120ctn (see above and Fig. 1B). Fig. 3A shows that in contrast to WT PS1, this mutant is able to process neither E-cadherin (upper panel) nor N-cadherin (lower panel). Exogenous PS1Δ330–360 replaces endogenous WT PS1 (supplemental figure) (3Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron.. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar), and no γ-secretase cleavage products of cadherin are detected in the mutant transfected cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, this mutant promotes the γ-secretase processing of APP (30Soriano S. Lu D.C. Chandra S. Pietrzik C.U. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 29045-29050Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, we obtained data that deletion mutant PS1Δ330–360 promotes APP processing and production of AICD (Fig. 3B). In addition, Fig. 3C shows that this mutant binds the γ-secretase substrates APP/CTFαβ as efficiently as WT PS1. To further explore the requirement of p120ctn for the γ-secretase processing of cadherins, we examined this processing in p120ctn KD HEK293 cells. Again, the cellular amounts of N-cadherin in the p120ctn KD cultures were adjusted as described above to approximately the same levels as in the control cells (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Fig. 3D shows that knockdown of p120ctn results in decreased production of N-cad/CTF2, the product of the γ-secretase processing of N-cadherin (9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell.. 2003; 114: 635-645Google Scholar). Inhibition of cadherin γ-secretase processing may result in increased levels of N-cad/CTF1 (2Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar). The lack of increased N-cad/CTF1 in Fig. 3D may be due to alternative proteolytic pathways in this cell line as is the case of APP/CTFαβ degradation through pathways other than γ-secretase (31Nunan J. Shearman M.S. Checler F. Cappai R. Evin G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2001; 268: 5329-5336Google Scholar, 32Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Grbovic O.M. Mercken M. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 36415-36424Google Scholar). Together, our results show that binding of PS1 to p120ctn is necessary for the γ-secretase processing of the cadherin substrates. Furthermore, it seems that PS1 sequence 330–360 specifically promotes cadherin processing, but is not necessary for APP processing. Thus, distinct PS1 sequences are important for the γ-secretase processing of APP and cadherins (33Kaether C. Capell A. Edbauer D. Winkler E. Novak B. Steiner H. Haass C. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Google Scholar, 34Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 751-754Google Scholar). p120ctn Enhances PS1-mediated E-cadherin Processing but Reduces Secreted Aβ Levels—That p120ctn binds PS1 and promotes the γ-secretase processing of cadherins prompted us to ask whether p120ctn may also affect the processing of APP and the production of Aβ. To test this hypothesis, we used the p120ctn-deficient SW48 cell line (29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar) and the in vitro assay of γ-secretase activity (9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell.. 2003; 114: 635-645Google Scholar). Fig. 4A (upper panel) shows that transduction of p120ctn into these cells stimulated the in vitro production of the E-cadherin γ-secretase product E-cad/CTF2. Furthermore, inhibition of γ-secretase activity resulted in the disappearance of E-cad/CTF2 and the increase of E-cad/CTF1, the precursor of E-cad/CTF2 (2Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cells transduced with p120ctn generated less AICD compared with mock-transduced cells, although the total levels of APP remained unchanged (Fig. 4A, lower panels). The levels of AICD were further quantified and analyzed for statistical significance (Fig. 4B). Secreted Aβx-40 and Aβx-42 levels in conditioned medium from p120ctn-transduced cell cultures were significantly reduced compared to those from mock-transduced cells (Fig. 4C). These results show that p120ctn enhances the γ-secretase processing of cadherins while decreasing the γ-secretase processing of APP indicated by the reduced production of both AICD and Aβ peptides, the products of the ϵ and γ cleavages of APP, respectively. p120ctn Associates with γ-Secretase and Links It to Cadherins—That p120ctn binds both PS1 and cadherins and promotes the γ-secretase processing of cadherins suggests that p120ctn may associate with the γ-secretase complex and thus may facilitate its interaction with the cadherin substrates. To investigate whether p120ctn forms complexes with the γ-secretase holoenzyme, we immunoprecipitated the components of the γ-secretase complex and probed the samples for the presence of p120ctn. Fig. 5 shows that p120ctn co-immunoprecipitates not only with PS1 but also with nicastrin (NCT) and APH-1, both components of the γ-secretase holoenzyme. Inversely, all known components of γ-secretase, including PS1, NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2 (4Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature.. 2003; 422: 438-441Google Scholar), co-immunoprecipitate with p120ctn. Together, these data indicate that p120ctn interacts with the γ-secretase complex. It has been reported that NCT interacts directly with APP, and this interaction serves to bring APP to the γ-secretase complex for processing (Fig. 5) (34Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 751-754Google Scholar). In contrast, cadherins bind to p120ctn but not to nicastrin (Fig. 5), and we failed to detect any p120ctn complexes with APP (data not shown). These observations suggest that cadherin substrates bind to the γ-secretase complex via p120ctn, whereas APP substrate is brought to the complex via nicastrin. Thus, APP and cadherins form distinct γ-secretase complexes mediated by distinct factors. By promoting cadherin recruitment, p120ctn may reduce the availability of the holoenzyme to other substrates including APP and thus decrease its processing. Classic cadherins, including E-, N-, and VE-cadherins, constitute a large family of cell-cell adhesion/communication factors necessary in both the development and function of mature organisms (35Arikkath J. Reichardt L.F. Trends Neurosci.. 2008; 31: 487-494Google Scholar). Cadherins function as central components of the adherens junctions, which include catenins, proteins that bind the intracellular (cytosolic) sequence of cadherins. p120ctn, an armadillo repeat protein member of the catenin family, binds the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic cadherin sequence and regulates cadherin stability. In addition, p120ctn plays important roles in development and gene expression (13McCrea P.D. Park J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 17-33Google Scholar, 17Daniel J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 59-68Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory showed that PS1 localizes at the plasma membrane where it forms complexes with the cadherin-catenin adherens junctions (1Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M. Gordon R. Holstein G.R. Martinelli G. Mehta P. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Mol.

Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar, 9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A.

Chem.. 2008; 283: 12691-12700Google Scholar). Additional in vitro studies indicated that members of the p120ctn family of proteins, including δ-catenin and p0071, bind directly to the large loop of PS1/CTF independently of cadherins (10Stahl B. Diehlmann A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 9141-9148Google Scholar, 11Tanahashi H. Tabira T. Neuroreport.. 1999; 10: 563-568Google Scholar, 12Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Neuroreport.. 1997; 8: 2085-2090Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of the p120ctn-PS1 binding remained elusive. In this study, we have presented evidence that p120ctn plays a central role in the γ-secretase processing of cadherins. Our data show that p120ctn is necessary for the association of PS1 and cadherin and that mutations that interrupt either the p120ctn-cadherin or p120ctn-PS1 binding also abolish the PS1-cadherin association. Furthermore, PS1 deletion mutant 330–360, which is unable to associate with cadherin (24Serban G. Kouchi Z. Baki L. Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C.M. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 36007-36012Google Scholar), also fails to bind p120ctn. The deleted sequence of this mutant is part of the large cytoplasmic loop of PS1/CTF. In agreement with the critical role of sequence 330–360 in p120ctn-PS1 binding, our data show that the PS1/CTF fragment mediates the binding of PS1 to both p120ctn and cadherin. The inability of this PS1 mutant to bind p120ctn is also in agreement with reports that PS1 sequence 329–362 is critical for the binding of PS1 to p0071ctn, another member of the p120ctn family (10Stahl B. Diehlmann A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 9141-9148Google Scholar). It is not surprising that full-length PS1 binds p120 because amino acid sequence 330–360 in PS1/CTF that binds p120 is also present in full-length PS1. At this point, it is unclear what the function of the p120-full-length PS1 complex is, but it is an interesting question whether full-length PS1 in a γ-secretase complex is able to promote cadherin processing. To further explore the role of p120ctn in the PS1 association with cadherins, we down-regulated this protein using shRNA technology and employed SW48 cells, which express no significant amounts of endogenous p120ctn (29Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 159: 465-476Google Scholar). These experimental approaches indicated that decreased cellular p120ctn results in decreased levels of PS1-cadherin complexes and that reintroduction of p120ctn in SW48 cells stimulates the PS1-E-cadherin association. In contrast, overexpression of E-cadherin is unable to increase the PS1-E-cadherin association in the absence of p120ctn. Combined with reports that p120ctn binds directly to cytoplasmic cadherin (36Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol.. 1998; 141: 779-789Google Scholar), these observations indicate that p120ctn mediates the PS1-cadherin association by binding both proteins and that p120ctn is a prerequisite for the physical association of PS1 and cadherin. However, this conclusion seems at variance with our previous report that overexpression of p120ctn may down-regulate the cadherin-PS1 complexes (8Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Google Scholar). At this point, we have no clear explanation for the contradiction. It is possible that the previous report resulted from technical problems stemming from multiple co-transfections of the cell line used in those experiments. We next addressed the physiological significance of the p120ctn-PS1-cadherin complex, focusing on the role of p120ctn in the γ-secretase processing of cadherins and APP. Down-regulation of p120ctn resulted in decreased γ-secretase processing of cadherins, indicated by the reduced production of the cadherin fragment cad/CTF2 (2Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar, 9Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K. Cell.. 2003; 114: 635-645Google Scholar), whereas introduction of p120ctn in the p120ctn-deficient SW48 cells stimulated production of cad/CTF2. These data show that p120ctn stimulates the γ-secretase processing of cadherins. Interestingly, exogenous p120ctn caused a significant inhibition of the γ-secretase processing of APP in SW48 cells indicated by an inhibition of both Aβ peptides and AICD. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that by promoting the cadherin association with γ-secretase, p120ctn redirects limited amounts of cellular γ-secretase activity from APP processing to cadherin processing. Alternatively, there is a possibility that the decrease in APP products in p120-transduced cells may be due to factors other than the p120-γ-secretase association like an increased degradation of these products, although presently there is no evidence for such a mechanism. Our data indicate that PS1 sequence 330–360 is necessary for PS1 binding to p120ctn and that this binding links the γ-secretase complex to cadherins, promoting their processing. In contrast, recent literature shows that NCT, another γ-secretase component, links APP and Notch to γ-secretase (34Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2001; 3: 751-754Google Scholar). Thus, APP and cadherins form distinct γ-secretase complexes mediated by distinct factors, suggesting that specific γ-secretase component proteins may be used to link specific substrates toγ-secretase for processing. That deletion mutant PS1Δ330–360 promotes the γ-secretase processing of APP and Notch but not cadherins is consistent with the conclusion that PS1 amino acid sequence 330–360 functions as a specific linker between cadherins and γ-secretase and shows that specific PS1 sequence may be used for the γ-secretase processing of distinct substrates. It is now clear that the γ-secretase complex binds to and processes a large number of substrates (7Marambaud P. Robakis N.K. Genes Brain Behav.. 2005; 4: 134-146Google Scholar). That APP and cadherins bind this complex through distinct mechanisms suggests the existence of diverse pathways linking different substrates to γ-secretase. The absence of p120ctn has been associated with abnormalities in spine development and synaptic transmission (19Elia L.P. Yamamoto M. Zang K. Reichardt L.F. Neuron.. 2006; 51: 43-56Google Scholar, 20Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Curr. Biol.. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Google Scholar). Our data raise the possibility that at least some of these abnormalities may be due to the role of p120ctn in the function of γ-secretase. Furthermore, because cadherins, PS1, and p120ctn family members have all been localized at the synapse, some of the effects of PS1 familial Alzheimer disease mutants on synaptic function may be related to abnormalities in the function of the trimeric PS1-p120ctn-cadherin complex.

https://openalex.org/W2149517210,"Background Stress Granules (SG) are sites of accumulation of stalled initiation complexes that are induced following a variety of cellular insults. In a genetic screen for factors involved in protecting human myoblasts from acute oxidative stress, we identified a gene encoding a protein we designate SGNP (Stress Granule and Nucleolar Protein). Methodology/Principal Findings A gene-trap insertional mutagenesis screen produced one insertion that conferred resistance to sodium arsenite. RT-PCR/3′ RACE was used to identify the endogenous gene expressed as a GFP-fusion transcript. SGNP is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus and defines a non-nucleolar compartment containing 5.8S rRNA, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Under oxidative stress, SGNP nucleolar localization decreases and it rapidly co-localizes with stress granules. The decrease in nucleolar SGNP following oxidative stress was accompanied by a large increase in nucleolar 5.8S rRNA. Knockdown of SGNP with shRNA increased global mRNA translation but induced growth arrest and cell death. Conclusions These results suggest that SGNP is an essential gene that may be involved in ribosomal biogenesis and translational control in response to oxidative stress."

Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar). cAMP-gated Ih, possibly in addition to the mechanosensory-transduction current, sets the membrane potential for a subpopulation of saccular hair cells (2Holt J.R. Eatock R.A. J. Neurophysiol... 1995; 73: 1484-1502Google Scholar, 3Farris H.E. Wells G.B. Ricci A.J. J. Neurosci... 2006; 26: 12526-12536Google Scholar). The membrane potential in the saccular hair cell subpopulation is sufficiently depolarized to activate voltage-gated calcium channels, permitting influx of calcium and secretion of hair cell transmitter (2Holt J.R. Eatock R.A. J. Neurophysiol... 1995; 73: 1484-1502Google Scholar). Given that saccular hair cells expressing IK1 in addition to Ih are more hyperpolarized, not supporting activation of the voltage-gated calcium channels, we predicted that spontaneous release of transmitter from the subpopulation of hair cells would constitute hair cell-generated spontaneous activity for the saccule (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar). However, little has been previously reported on the morphological localization of the HCN1 isoform in hair cells or possible links to structural proteins that mechanistically would localize HCN1 in hair cells (for preliminary report, see Ref. 4Ramakrishnan N.A. Drescher M.J. Drescher D.G. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. Abstr... 2007; 30: 31Google Scholar). In general, little is known about protein-protein interactions for the HCN isoforms that would modulate Ih and/or the associated instantaneous current (5Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 5101-5109Google Scholar). Protocadherin 15 is a proposed tip link protein involved in connecting shorter stereocilia to adjacent taller stereocilia in the stereociliary array of inner ear hair cells, facilitating the opening of the mechanosensory transduction channel in response to auditory and vestibular stimuli. The active tip link protein in Danio rerio is protocadherin 15a (6Seiler C. Finger-Baier K.C. Rinner O. Makhankov Y.V. Schwarz H. Neuhauss S.C. Nicolson T. Development.. 2005; 132: 615-623Google Scholar), characterized by splice variants in its carboxyl terminus. In the mammal, protocadherin 15 CD3 is hypothesized to be a tip link protein at insertion sites in the tips of the shorter stereocilia of the stereociliary array (7Ahmed Z.M. Goodyear R. Riazuddin S.

Acquisition of a Model Hair Cell Preparation from the Trout Saccule and an Organ of Corti Subfraction from the Rat Cochlea—Hair cell layers were isolated from the trout saccule as previously described (9Drescher D.G. Khan K.M. Arden R.L. Drescher M.J. Kerr T.P. Hatfield J.S. Brain Res... 1989; 485: 225-235Google Scholar, 10Drescher M.J. Drescher D.G. J. Neurochem... 1991; 56: 658-664Google Scholar), yielding a hair cell preparation of 1.5 × 106 saccular hair cells, free of intact supporting cells. An organ of Corti fraction was microdissected from rat cochlea (one-month-old ACI Black Agouti rats; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) as previously described and morphologically characterized (11Oh C.K. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Drescher D.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 70: 135-140Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis: Trout Hair Cell Layer—Yeast two-hybrid screening for the interacting proteins of trout hair cell HCN1 was performed (Matchmaker kit; Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the cytoplasmic amino terminus of trout saccular hair cell HCN1 (aa 1-118) as bait (see Fig. 1). PCR was carried out on trout hair cell cDNA with upstream primer 5′-GCCGAATTCATGGAAGATAAATCAAATTCGTTC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TGCGGATCCATAGGGATGAATGATCCA-3′ (restriction sites underlined). The corresponding amplification product was purified, restriction-digested with EcoRI and BamHI enzymes and inserted into a similarly digested pGBKT7 vector to produce a fusion construct with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The fusion products were proven to be transcriptionally inactive in appropriate nutrient-deficient media, a necessary condition for unequivocal interpretation of results. A trout hair cell cDNA library was created from the isolated hair cell layer (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G.

Hair cell message was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers, with an equal proportion of each cDNA used in constructing the library. Transformants of host strain AH 109 were plated on SD/-Leu medium, and the colonies were collected after 5 days. Cells containing bait constructs in strain Y187 were mixed with the cells containing prey constructs in AH 109 to screen for interacting proteins. The cells were allowed to mate in 2× YPD medium overnight at 30 °C and plated on a selection medium SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade. After 4-5 days, the larger colonies were used to identify, by PCR, the prey interacting with bait. Purified PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences were identified using BLAST (NCBI). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis: Rat Organ of Corti—Binding between HCN1 and protocadherin 15 CD3 was analyzed with yeast two-hybrid protocols. The HCN1 amino-terminal cytoplasmic region (HCN1-N) was PCR-amplified from a rat organ of Corti cDNA preparation, and the sequence was verified and cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7. Similarly, the carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15 CD3 in rat organ of Corti was targeted in PCR using specific primers (XM_238200) (nucleotides 295-831) (upper primer, 5′-TGGGGATCCATGATCAAGTTGGTGGTCGAT-3′; lower primer, 5′-GAATTCTCAGAGTTTTGTCATTGGTAT-3′) and cloned in the prey vector pGADT7. For the yeast two-hybrid assay, ∼500 ng of each vector was employed to cotransform AH 109 yeast strain using the standard protocol (Clontech yeast two-hybrid manual), and the transformants were plated on nutrient-deficient selection medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu) for 3-5 days. The colonies were picked and streaked on higher stringency medium (SD/-Trp/-His/-Leu/-Ade + 3-AT). Negative controls contained either the bait or the prey, along with corresponding empty vector. Western Blot for Saccular Hair Cell HCN1—The model saccular hair cell preparation (1.5 × 106 hair cells) was homogenized in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science or Sigma) and centrifuged at 20,900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1× SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer with NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) (10 min at 70 °C), and the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and loaded onto a 4-12% gel in an Invitrogen mini-cell apparatus. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was blocked with PBST buffer containing 1% nonfat milk (PBSTM) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at room temperature with the primary antibody (1:1,250) in PBSTM (plus 2% serum corresponding to the secondary antibody). The custom rabbit polyclonal primary antibody, (purified by protein A chromatography, Maine Biotechnology Services), targeted the specific peptide LHKASHALQSGSLSRDVRH found in the carboxyl terminus of full-length HCN1 sequence (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar). The membranes were washed and incubated for 1.5 h in the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the proteins were detected using Western Lightning chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunohistochemical Analysis—Saccular sacs were removed from the cranial cavity of 200-g rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and placed in fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice, for isolation of the saccular macula fraction, which included the sensory and nonsensory epithelium, otolithic membrane, basal lamina, and a connective tissue layer with afferent and efferent nerve fibers (9Drescher D.G. Khan K.M. Arden R.L. Drescher M.J. Kerr T.P. Hatfield J.S. Brain Res... 1989; 485: 225-235Google Scholar). Following 2-4 h in fixative, the saccular macular tissues were rinsed overnight in phosphate buffer at 4 °C, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. The isolation of the rat cochlea for immunohistochemical analysis has been previously described (12Drescher M.J. Drescher D.G. Khan K.M. Hatfield J.S. Ramakrishnan N.A. Abu-Hamdan M.D. Lemonnier L.A. Neuroscience.. 2006; 142: 139-164Google Scholar). In brief, the bony cochleas from 2-month-old ACI Black Agouti rats were perfused from basal to apical coil with the fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C (13Khan K.M. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Khan A.-M. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2002; 111: 291-302Google Scholar). Following fixation for 4-6 h, the bony cochleas were decalcified in 0.12 m EDTA, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.4, for 5-7 days at 4 °C. The cochlear tissues were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin. Four-μm deparaffinized sections of trout saccule and rat cochlea were sequentially incubated in 0.1% sodium borohydride (PBS plus 5 mm glycine) for 45 min, 3% H2O2 for 5 min (for avidin-biotin peroxidase method), 2% normal serum (corresponding to the species in which the secondary antibody was made) for 45 min, all at room temperature. The primary antibody was added for 12-16 h at 4 °C. The Vector ABC Elite protocol was used with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Alternatively, immunofluorescence was determined with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. The primary antibody for trout saccular hair cell HCN1 was a custom rabbit polyclonal (see “Western Blot for Saccular Hair Cell HCN1”) used at 1:1,250 dilution. Rat cochlear HCN1 was immunolocalized with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1:100 (Alomone APC-056), targeting the peptide (C)KP NSASNSRDDGNSVYPSK corresponding to amino acids 6-24 of rat HCN1 (GenBank™ accession number AAF62173). The amino terminus of rat HCN1 expressed as a fusion protein was immunolabeled with this antibody on Western blot (see Fig. 8A). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine immunostaining was examined with a Leitz Diaplan microscope and photographed with an Olympus OM-4T camera, and the negatives were digitized. Immunofluorescence was examined with an Olympus BX60 microscope with fluorescein excitation (470-490 nm) and emission (500-800 nm) filters and photographed with a PM 20 camera system, and the negatives were digitized. In this investigation of localization of HCN1 in the trout saccule and rat cochlea, two types of negative controls were performed; the primary antibodies were either preabsorbed with their respective antigens or omitted. Reverse Transcription-PCR for Rat Organ of Corti and PCR for Rat λ ZAP cDNA Libraries of Inner and Outer Hair Cells—The mRNA of microdissected organ of Corti subfractions was converted to cDNA via SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with either random hexamer or oligo(dT)12-18 primers (11Oh C.K. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Drescher D.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 70: 135-140Google Scholar). Primers for PCR targeting rat HCN1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053375) were 5′-CAGCAGCCGCAACAGCAACAA-3′ upstream (nucleotides 2328-2348), and 5′-TTTTCTGCATCTGGGTCTTTATTTAAGA-3′ downstream (nucleotides 2755-2782), predicted to yield a 455-bp amplification product. The expression of HCN1 message in cochlear hair cells was determined from application of rat-specific HCN1 primers in PCR to λ ZAP cDNA libraries (a cDNA library formed with a specifically modified λ phage vector, λ ZAP (Stratagene)) (14Barritt L.C. Fritzsch B. Beisel K.W. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 68: 42-54Google Scholar, 15Drescher M.J. Khan K.M. Beisel K.W. Karadaghy A.A. Hatfield J.S. Kim S.Y. Drescher A.J. Lasak J.M. Barretto R.L. Shakir A.H.

A first amplification with an HCN1 gene-specific primer upstream coupled with λ ZAP-T7 reverse primer downstream was followed by a second amplification with HCN1 gene-specific primers for the 455-bp PCR product. A second set of nested primers was applied to the 455-bp inner hair cell amplification product with 5′-CCACACCGAAAAATGAAGTGCA-3′ upstream (nucleotides 2419-2440) and 5′-CCTGCTCCCTGCCTGAAGGCCAGTG-3′ downstream (nucleotides 2609-2633), predicted to yield a 215-bp amplification product. All of the PCR products were sequenced-verified. GST Pull-down Assay for HCN1 and Protocadherin 15 CD3 of the Rat Organ of Corti—Rat HCN1-N was amplified from a rat organ of Corti cDNA preparation, using rat HCN1-specific upstream (5′-ATGGAAGGCGGCGGCAAGCCCAAC-3′) and downstream (5′-GGATGGATAATCCAGAAGCCTGC-3′) primers, to which BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites were added (TCGGATCC and GAATTC, respectively). The restriction-digested PCR products were ligated to similarly digested pRSET-A vector with a polyhistidine fusion tag. Carboxyl-terminal sequence of rat protocadherin 15 CD3 (CD3-C) (XM_238200) was similarly PCR-amplified with gene-specific upstream (5′-ATGATCAAGTTGGTGGTCGATAGGGA-3′) and downstream (5′-TCAGAGTTTTGTCATTGGTAT-3′) primers to which BamHI and Not1 sites (CTGGGATCC and TCGCGGCCGC, respectively) were added. The restriction-digested PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pGEX-6P-1 vector with GST fusion tag (Amersham Biosciences). Clones for HCN1-N and CD3-C were selected and sequence-verified, and fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using 1 mm final concentration of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion protein for HCN1-N was affinity-purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) or TALON magnetic beads (Clontech), with purification checked by 4-12% PAGE. The protein was dialyzed overnight in a Spectra Dispodialyzer (Sigma) with four or five buffer changes in PBST (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1× protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C, and concentration was estimated by a Quant-iT fluorescent assay kit in a Qubit™ fluorometer (Invitrogen). Affinity-purified rat HCN1-N polypeptide (0.5 μg) was mixed with bacterial lysate containing GST-CD3-C fusion protein (20 μg) in PBST containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 3 h at room temperature. In a separate series of experiments, Ca2+ was included at low μm levels. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (50%), preincubated in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin, were added for 1 h of incubation, and the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in PBST buffer. The immobilized proteins were eluted with protein gel-loading solution at 70 °C (10 min). The proteins recovered in the supernatant from centrifugation at 1,300 × g were separated by 4-12% PAGE and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated in PBSTM for 1 h at room temperature, with anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (1:5,000, Invitrogen) for 7 h, washed in PBST five times for 5 min each time, and incubated for 1 h in goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:6,000 in PBSTM). After six washes of the membrane in PBST, the HCN1-N fusion product was detected with an ECL chemiluminesence kit (GE Healthcare). Two negative controls were used, one containing the HCN1-N fusion product and bacterial lysate with the GST product instead of the GST-CD3-C fusion product and another containing a bacterial lysate without GST or GST-CD3-C. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis of Binding between HCN1 and Protocadherin 15 CD3 Expressed in Rat Organ of Corti—SPR experiments were performed as described (16Drescher D.G. Ramakrishnan N.A. Drescher M.J. Methods Mol. Biol... 2009; 493: 323-343Google Scholar) with a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). SPR is an optical technique for detecting molecular interactions in which either molecule is immobilized on a sensor chip. Binding of the mobile molecule (analyte) to the immobilized molecule (ligand) changes the refractive index of the film, which can be detected. Because the method strictly detects mass, labeling of the molecules is not required. In the present investigation, pRSET-A fusion proteins were made from rat organ of Corti cDNA for HCN1-N (see previous section for GST pulldown assays), the carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15 CD3 (CD3-C) and its deletion mutants. pRSET-B was used for the carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15 CD1 (CD1-C) (GenBank™ accession number XM_001075929). Upstream and downstream gene-specific primers for rat CD3-C were the same as those described for the GST pulldown assay except with added restriction enzyme sites for BamHI and Bgl2 (TGGGGATCC and TGAAGATCT, respectively). Gene-specific primers for CD1-C were 5′-CTTCCTCCTCCTCCTCGACCA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-TTACAAGGACGTTGACTGACT-3′ (downstream), with restriction enzymes sites for Bgl2 and EcoRI added (TCGAGATCT and GAATTC, respectively). Fusion proteins were affinity-purified as described in the previous section. Affinity-purified HCN1-N fusion polypeptide (ligand) was immobilized on a CM5 research grade sensor chip by amine coupling. The immobilization involved activation of carboxymethyl groups on a dextran-coated chip by reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide, followed by covalent bonding of the ligand to the chip surface via amide linkages. Reference surfaces were prepared in the same manner but blocked with ethanolamine. Binding analysis was carried out by injecting the affinity-purified CD3-C fusion peptide (analyte) into the flow cells (ligand and reference cell), and the interaction (response units, Ru) between analyte and ligand was recorded. Equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated from the ratio of reverse to forward rate constants, determined graphically. The determination of Ca2+ dependence of binding was based upon the analysis of Ca2+ levels in experimental solutions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. A Protocadherin 15a-like Protein Binds to Trout Saccular Hair Cell HCN1, Determined by Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid protocols were used to identify binding partners for HCN1, the primary HCN isoform underlying Ih in hair cells of the trout saccule (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar). Amino terminus sequence in bait construct pGBKT7 was tested in mating protocols with a saccular hair cell cDNA library in prey construct pGADT7-Rec. Transformation efficiency for the prey library was 8.4 × 105/3 μg of vector, based upon the number of colonies that appeared on the SD/-Leu plates after 5 days. The mating efficiency was 28.4% (∼1,560 colonies). After selection in a quadruple knock-out medium, the prey in ∼125 colonies were sequenced for the amino-terminal HCN1 bait (HCN1-N), aa 1-118 (Fig. 1). A protocadherin 15a-like protein was identified as a protein-binding partner for HCN1 amino terminus bait (Fig. 2A and 3, A and B). Binding was confirmed by switching bait and prey, at increased stringency by inclusion of 3-AT (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 3Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the trout saccular hair cell protocadherin 15a-like protein compared with corresponding sequences of D. rerio (GenBank™ accession number AY772390). A, comparison of nucleotide sequences of the carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15a aligned with Clustal. B, comparison of amino acid sequences of the carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15a for trout and D. rerio. C, indication of two SH3 binding sites, PQAP, PTLP, and PDZ3-interacting sequence LEMV in the trout saccular hair cell aa sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide sequence for the trout saccular hair cell protocadherin 15a-like protein corresponded to the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15a of D. rerio, with 46% nucleotide identity, 24% aa identity, and 41% aa similarity (Fig. 3A), the highest homology to any D. rerio protein. The trout sequence was in frame, ending with a stop codon corresponding in position to the stop codon for D. rerio protocadherin 15a. The trout protein contained two SH3-binding motifs, PQAP, PTLP, and one PDZ3-interacting sequence motif, LEMV (Fig. 3, B and C). The highest homology in contiguous amino acid sequence between the trout hair cell peptide and D. rerio protocadherin 15a was 37% identity and 50% similarity for aa 15-53 of 79. The corresponding homology of the trout saccular hair cell sequence to the carboxyl terminus sequence of D. rerio protocadherin 15b was 12% aa identity and 44% similarity. Binding between HCN1-N and the protocadherin 15a-like protein was unaffected by the elimination of the PDZ3-interacting sequence motif, LEMV, in the protocadherin15a-like protein (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that this motif was not involved in the interaction. The carboxyl terminus of protocadherin 15a is the only cytoplasmic portion of this presumptive tip link protein, which would be available for intracellular protein-protein binding, specifically demonstrated for the protocadherin 15a-like protein and HCN1 expressed in hair cells of the trout saccule. Immunolocalization of HCN1 in Hair Cells of the Trout Saccular Sensory Epithelium—A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against LHKASHALQSGSLSRDVRH found in the carboxyl terminus of HCN1 expressed in the model hair cell preparation from the trout saccule, for which the hair cell is the only intact cell type (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar). As predicted, the rabbit polyclonal, purified by protein A chromatography (Maine Biotechnology Services), immunolabeled a protein in the trout saccular hair cell preparation on Western blot (Fig. 4A) with the approximate size of 104 kDa, the predicted mass for HCN1 (1Cho W.J. Drescher M.J. Hatfield J.S. Bessert D.A. Skoff R.P. Drescher D.G. Neuroscience.. 2003; 118: 525-534Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF421883). Further, the rabbit polyclonal primary antibody immunolabeled saccular hair cells in the sensory epithelium detected with either immunofluorescence or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Fig. 4, B-D). Immunoreactivity was concentrated at apical, supranuclear sites of hair cells, extending to the lateral and basal cell membrane (Fig. 4B), which are sites of efferent input (17Drescher D.G. Ramakrishnan N.A. Drescher M.J. Chun W. Wang X. Myers S.F. Green G.E. Sadrazodi K. Karadaghy A.A. Poopat N. Karpenko A.N. Khan K.M. Hatfield J.S. Neuroscience.. 2004; 127: 737-752Google Scholar). In addition, HCN1 was immunolocalized to stereocilia, with discrete sites of expression that were gradated in their distribution (Fig. 4, C and D). HCN1 Expression in Cochlear Inner and Outer Hair Cells—HCN1 message was detected in the organ-of-Corti microdissected cochlear subfraction cDNA and in λ ZAP cDNA libraries of inner and outer hair cells (Fig. 5). The outer hair cell ∼420-bp amplification product and inner hair cell 455-bp product, the latter further characterized by nested primers, yielded HCN1 rat-specific nucleotide sequence. HCN1 protein was immunolocalized with a rabbit polyclonal antibody targeting the amino terminus (6-24 aa) of rat HCN1 (Alomone) and immunolabeling a fusion protein of organ of Corti HCN1-N on Western blot (see Fig. 8A). HCN1 immunoreactivity was localized to nerve fibers approaching and passing the habenula perforata to the organ of Corti. These fibers traversed the organ of Corti to the base of inner hair cells and outer hair cells (Fig. 6, A and C) and in part comprised afferent dendrites, consistent with HCN1 mRNA expression in spiral ganglion afferent cell bodies (Fig. 5A). Immunoreactivity for HCN1 protein was also found to be associated with hair cell stereocilia, both of inner hair cells and outer hair cells (Fig. 6), with immunostaining eliminated by preabsorption of the primary antibody with specific antigen (not illustrated).FI"

https://openalex.org/W1994453562,"Evidence strongly suggests that spontaneous doublet mutations in normal mouse tissues generally arise from chronocoordinate events. These chronocoordinate mutations sometimes reflect ""mutation showers"", which are multiple chronocoordinate mutations spanning many kilobases. However, little is known about mutagenesis of doublet and multiplet mutations (domuplets) in human cancer. Lung cancer accounts for about 25% of all cancer deaths. Herein, we analyze the epidemiology of domuplets in the EGFR and TP53 genes in lung cancer. The EGFR gene is an oncogene in which doublets are generally driver plus driver mutations, while the TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene with a more typical situation in which doublets derive from a driver and passenger mutation.EGFR mutations identified by sequencing were collected from 66 published papers and our updated EGFR mutation database (www.egfr.org). TP53 mutations were collected from IARC version 12 (www-p53.iarc.fr). For EGFR and TP53 doublets, no clearly significant differences in race, ethnicity, gender and smoking status were observed. Doublets in the EGFR and TP53 genes in human lung cancer are elevated about eight- and three-fold, respectively, relative to spontaneous doublets in mouse (6% and 2.3% versus 0.7%).Although no one characteristic is definitive, the aggregate properties of doublet and multiplet mutations in lung cancer are consistent with a subset derived from chronocoordinate events in the EGFR gene: i) the eight frameshift doublets (present in 0.5% of all patients with EGFR mutations) are clustered and produce a net in-frame change; ii) about 32% of doublets are very closely spaced (< or =30 nt); and iii) multiplets contain two or more closely spaced mutations. TP53 mutations in lung cancer are very closely spaced (< or =30 nt) in 33% of doublets, and multiplets generally contain two or more very closely spaced mutations. Work in model systems is necessary to confirm the significance of chronocoordinate events in lung and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2031026282,"We have reported that expression of Sprouty 2 (Spry2) is necessary for tumor formation by HRas(V12)-transformed fibroblasts. We now report on the role of Spry2 in the inhibition of UV(254 nm) radiation-induced apoptosis in HRas(V12)-transformed human fibroblasts. Silencing Spry2 in this context resulted in increased apoptosis, associated with decreased Akt activation and decreased phosphorylation of HDM2 at Ser-166, which has been shown to stabilize HDM2. As a consequence, when cells with silenced Spry2 were UV-irradiated, they exhibited diminished levels of HDM2 and elevated levels of p53. In agreement with these findings, overexpression of Spry2 in the parental non-transformed fibroblasts led to increased Akt activation and to the stabilization of HDM2. It also led to diminished expression of p53 and decreased apoptosis following UV irradiation. Silencing Spry2 in HRas-transformed cells decreased Rac1 activation, but independent expression of Spry2 in the non-transformed parental cells had no effect on Rac1, suggesting a specific involvement in the activation of Rac1 by Ras. Silencing Spry2 in HRas(V12)-transformed cells resulted in diminished interaction between HRas and Tiam1, a Rac1-specific nucleotide exchange factor. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 in cells with silenced Spry2 partly reversed the effect of Spry2 down-regulation. Furthermore, loss of Spry2 expression in HRas(V12)-transformed cells augmented the cytotoxicity of the DNA-damaging, chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, a process that was also reversed by active Rac1. Together, these data show that Spry2 inhibits apoptosis in response to DNA damage by regulating Akt, HDM2, and p53, by a process mediated partly by Rac1."
https://openalex.org/W2135787080,"The established paradigm indicates that low-lying marsh production is primarily regulated by submergence and the resulting edaphic conditions. The physical sedimentary environment is in turn deemed to affect production through its effect on marsh-surface elevation relative to sea level. However, our results working with Spartina anglica indicate that production and marsh perennation are controlled by variation in surface level relative to the plant's meristematic base and not hindered by prolonged submergence. These findings suggest that plant responses to changes in sedimentary conditions determine marsh development and survival in the short term, independently of long-term changes in relative sea level."
https://openalex.org/W2147133200,"Yeast strains lacking Anc1, a member of the YEATS protein family, are sensitive to several DNA damaging agents. The YEATS family includes two human genes that are common fusion partners with MLL in human acute leukemias. Anc1 is a member of seven multi-protein complexes involved in transcription, and the damage sensitivity observed in anc1Delta cells is mirrored in strains deleted for some other non-essential members of several of these complexes. Here we show that ANC1 is in the same epistasis group as SRS2 and RAD5, members of the postreplication repair (PRR) pathway, but has additive or synergistic interactions with several other members of this pathway. Although PRR is traditionally divided into an ""error-prone"" and an ""error-free"" branch, ANC1 is not epistatic with all members of either established branch, and instead defines a new error-free branch of the PRR pathway. Like several genes involved in PRR, an intact ANC1 gene significantly suppresses spontaneous mutation rates, including the expansion of (CAG)(25) repeats. Anc1's role in the PRR pathway, as well as its role in suppressing triplet repeats, point to a possible mechanism for a protein of potential medical interest."
https://openalex.org/W2013889630,"External guide sequences (EGSs) have successfully been used to inhibit expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We previously reported that EGS accessible and cleavable sites in the target RNAs can rapidly be identified by screening random EGS (rEGS) libraries. Here the method of screening rEGS libraries and a partial RNase T1 digestion assay were used to identify sites accessible to EGSs in the mRNA of a global virulence regulator MglB from Francisella tularensis, a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium. Specific EGSs were subsequently designed and their activities in terms of the cleavage of mglB mRNA by RNase P were tested in vitro and in vivo. EGS73, EGS148, and EGS155 in both stem and M1 EGS constructs induced mglB mRNA cleavage in vitro. Expression of stem EGS73 and EGS155 in Escherichia coli resulted in significant reduction of the mglB mRNA level coded for the F. tularensis mglB gene inserted in those cells."
