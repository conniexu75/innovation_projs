We observed a low frequency of somatic alterations (relative to other carcinomas) and extended the set of known PTC driver alterations to include EIF1AX, PPM1D, and CHEK2 and diverse gene fusions. These discoveries reduced the fraction of PTC cases with unknown oncogenic driver from 25% to 3.5%. Combined analyses of genomic variants, gene expression, and methylation demonstrated that different driver groups lead to different pathologies with distinct signaling and differentiation characteristics. Similarly, we identified distinct molecular subgroups of BRAF-mutant tumors, and multidimensional analyses highlighted a potential involvement of oncomiRs in less-differentiated subgroups. Our results propose a reclassification of thyroid cancers into molecular subtypes that better reflect their underlying signaling and differentiation properties, which has the potential to improve their pathological classification and better inform the management of the disease."

Given that the elderly population is dramatically increasing and that aging is the greatest risk factor for a majority of chronic diseases driving both morbidity and mortality, it is critical to expand geroscience research directed at extending human healthspan. Mammalian aging can be delayed with genetic, dietary, and pharmacologic approaches. Given that the elderly population is dramatically increasing and that aging is the greatest risk factor for a majority of chronic diseases driving both morbidity and mortality, it is critical to expand geroscience research directed at extending human healthspan. The NIH mission is “to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.” NIH-funded research is structured to address the major diseases driving morbidity and mortality. Interrogating and developing therapeutics for one disease at a time has often been productive. Will, however, the success of this approach be sustainable for the chronic aging diseases, such as neurodegenerative and metabolic syndromes, most cancers, and cardiovascular disease? Findings in the last few decades have made it impossible to ignore the integrative nature of human physiology. Pathologies thought to be disparate are now understood to be connected. This awareness raises the possibility that the stated goals in the NIH mission statement are best achieved by novel integrated approaches to health and disease, with the understanding that biological systems change with age. Basic aging research has always been intriguing but until recently seemed to hold few concrete solutions to advance health. Despite limited resources, the field recently erupted and now offers routes to achieve a new and ambitious goal—a substantial extension in health life expectancy, or “healthspan.” The lynchpin is that aging itself is the predominant risk factor for most diseases and conditions that limit healthspan. Moreover, interventions that extend lifespan in model organisms often delay or prevent many chronic diseases. This knowledge launched the era of geroscience, which strives to understand how aging enables chronic disease and seeks to develop novel multi-disease preventative and therapeutic approaches. The trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group (GSIG) held a recent summit where the mechanistic relationships between aging and chronic diseases were discussed. An executive session was tasked with identifying strategies to: (1) develop a systematic understanding of aging mechanisms; (2) elaborate mechanistic links between aging and chronic disease; and (3) recommend pathways to identify and develop therapies or preventative approaches for age-associated diseases. Here, we describe the summit’s conclusions, emphasizing the needs for a concerted effort to understand the aging process and to exploit this knowledge to extend human healthspan. Attempts to define the causes of aging have been impeded by the complexity of the phenotype coupled with the costs and duration of longevity studies. Recently, progress has accelerated, bringing geroscience to the forefront. First, invertebrate models have identified conserved molecular pathways impacting aging. Second, mammalian studies have generated a more detailed understanding of age-associated pathologic changes. Third, several interventions that extend lifespan have been shown to also improve aspects of healthspan—long-lived mutants are often resistant to age-related chronic diseases. Finally and urgently, the global population is aging, with looming dire economic and societal impacts. While life expectancy continues to rise, healthspan is not keeping pace because current disease treatment often decreases mortality without preventing or reversing the decline in overall health. Elders are sick longer, often coping with multiple chronic diseases simultaneously. Thus, there is an urgent need to extend healthspan. Key themes emerged regarding processes that promote aging, with recent reviews describing overlapping sets of five to ten processes processes (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G. Cell. 2013; 153: 1194-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar, Mahmoudi and Brunet, 2012Mahmoudi S. Brunet A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2012; 24: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Seven pillars were discussed at this recent summit (Figure 1). Specific recommendations for each pillar emerged (Table 1), but, more importantly, their connectedness was striking. The themes were not seven independent factors driving aging; rather, they were highly intertwined processes, and understanding the interplay between these seven pillars is critical.Table 1Critical Areas of Aging Research and Important GoalsAreas of Aging ResearchImportant GoalsAdaptation to stressBridge continuum from psychological to molecular stressesDifferentiate hormesis from toxic stressBetter align human and animal studiesEpigeneticsBiomarker development: chronologic vs. biologic agingLink age-related environmental inputs to epigenetic signaturesTest small molecules that regulate enzymes controlling epigenetic eventsInflammationDifferentiate adaptive and maladaptive inflammatory responsesDefine age-related inflammatory sources and their systemic effectsDetermine how obesity and metabolic dysfunction alter inflammation with ageMacromolecular damageGenerate systems-level understanding of the types of macromolecular damage and their roles in chronic disease statesUnderstand how stochastic damage influences the variability of agingMetabolismDefine role of signal transduction pathways linked to metabolism in the aging processUnderstand contribution of circadian clocks to aging and metabolismConnect metabolic dysfunction with tissue-specific decline in agingProteostasisIdentify proteostatic pathways that are overwhelmed in specific chronic disease statesExamine crosstalk between proteostasis machineriesUnderstand non-cell-autonomous signaling and activation of proteostasis pathwaysStem cells and regenerationDetermine whether declining adult stem cell function drives aging and chronic diseaseExamine how aging and associated disease impair adult stem cell functionDetermine how macromolecular damage accumulates in aging adult stem cell pools Open table in a new tab Collectively, chronic diseases comprise the majority of global disease burden and are the most common causes of mortality (http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/tools/data-visualizations). Medical research has historically targeted diseases separately, assuming that organ systems act independently. Yet, optimal functionality for any single system requires overall organismal health, impelling inquiries into the interdependence of these relationships to develop multiscale network models that incorporate the physiologic changes accompanying aging. Targeting diseases individually for an aging population is also complicated because most elders have multiple morbidities that interact, confounding therapeutic strategies. By understanding how aging enables pathology, new therapeutics will arise for multiple chronic diseases, providing an opportunity to extend human healthspan by targeting aging directly. There is cause for optimism; however, much must happen to achieve this goal, including an infusion of resources to accelerate research and regulatory changes that push medical care toward chronic disease prevention. Here, we focus on a limited set of short- and intermediate-term scientific goals that will accelerate geroscience and will launch novel approaches to reduce the impact of the major global healthcare burden: the chronic diseases of aging. The mouse has emerged as a primary mammalian model to understand aging and disease. Although mice develop only some pathologies approximating human aging, other pathologies can be modeled through transgenic or genome-editing approaches. There are, however, concerns about the validity of mouse models, as preclinical studies often identify therapeutics that fail in humans. Given that mouse studies provide much of the evidence for delayed aging, pro-longevity interventions that extend healthspan may also not achieve human validation. Yet, a key difference between aging studies and many disease models is that aging can be studied in normal mice or other species; therefore, evolutionarily conserved interventions can be identified that cut across species. Focus in three areas may improve consistency between mice and humans. First, mouse studies generally fail to use aged mice—most human chronic diseases rise with age, yet murine models invoke pathology in young mice. Aging creates a distinctive systemic milieu; drugs that show efficacy in the young may not work in the aged. Therefore, aging should be incorporated into animal chronic disease models, a recommendation increasing time and cost but also likely yielding results that will translate more accurately to humans and will thus provide long-term savings. A second goal is to employ whenever possible genetically outbred lines to introduce natural population variation, better mimicking human diversity. A third is to incorporate mild stress into mouse studies to more accurately reflect the human condition. These stresses should include low-level chronic stress, including psychological sources. Many animal studies use acute stresses that are not experienced by humans. It will also be essential to distinguish stresses that induce a hormetic response, protecting from later acute stress, from those unconditionally deleterious. Though aging promotes disease, new findings suggest the reciprocal may also be true: diseases and/or their treatments may accelerate aging pathologies. For instance, long-term cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can induce chronic inflammation and exhaust the adaptive immune response, accelerating unrelated age-associated pathologies (Pawelec et al., 2012Pawelec G. McElhaney J.E. Aiello A.E. Derhovanessian E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2012; 24: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This is also observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, attributable either to virus-induced inflammation or, ironically, treatment modalities (Pathai et al., 2014Pathai S. Bajillan H. Landay A.L. High K.P. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2014; 69: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Similarly, children subjected to chemotherapies often present with accelerated aging features decades later (Robison and Hudson, 2014Robison L.L. Hudson M.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). These findings highlight relationships between disease and aging, calling for a thorough analysis in humans and animal models. Mammalian lifespan, and also healthspan, can be modified by dietary, genetic, and pharmacologic interventions. Several drugs are reported to extend mouse lifespan and healthspan (Kennedy and Pennypacker, 2014Kennedy B.K. Pennypacker J.K. Transl. Res. 2014; 163: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that human aging can be delayed. Although obstacles exist, the repertoire of aging interventions should be greatly expanded. For instance, dietary restriction is long known to extend rodent lifespan, though not easily adapted to humans. Understanding links between diet and aging, as well as approaches like intermittent fasting, may yield practical strategies. Moreover, given that different mouse strains respond variably to dietary restriction, it may be necessary to design personalized diets optimizing healthspan based on individual genetics and lifestyle. The role of the microbiome in response to diet and aging also requires elaboration. Preliminary data suggest that the gut microbiome change dramatically with age (Heintz and Mair, 2014Heintz C. Mair W. Cell. 2014; 156: 408-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), although causes and effects remain undetermined. This area is particularly important for understanding obesity and metabolic diseases. In addition, it should be determined whether altering the microbiome offsets features of aging. Though early, the therapeutic hurdles to altering the gut microbiome may be more easily surmountable than those using standard pharmacology. Exciting findings have demonstrated that aging in rodents can be accelerated, stalled, or reversed simply by altering the systemic environment (Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2014Rando T.A. Wyss-Coray T. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2014; 69: S39-S42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings were initially spotlighted by heterochronic parabiosis experiments, in which the circulation of old and young mice was coupled. More recent findings from multiple labs now indicate that hallmarks of aging can be modulated by circulatory factors, which are beginning to be identified. This growing line of inquiry may offer tractable routes to extend healthspan. Rapamycin was the first drug shown to robustly extend mouse lifespan (Johnson et al., 2013Johnson S.C. Rabinovitch P.S. Kaeberlein M. Nature. 2013; 493: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), a finding repeated in different backgrounds. It also increases healthspan in most studies and is protective in many age-related disease models. Other drugs, including metformin and acarbose, also extend mouse lifespan (Harrison et al., 2014Harrison D.E. Strong R. Allison D.B. Ames B.N. Astle C.M. Atamna H. Fernandez E. Flurkey K. Javors M.A. Nadon N.L. et al.Aging Cell. 2014; 13: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013Martin-Montalvo A. Mercken E.M. Mitchell S.J. Palacios H.H. Mote P.L. Scheibye-Knudsen M. Gomes A.P. Ward T.M. Minor R.K. Blouin M.J. et al.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Continued efforts should be directed at identifying and optimizing new molecules with these properties and understanding those already identified (Kennedy and Pennypacker, 2014Kennedy B.K. Pennypacker J.K. Transl. Res. 2014; 163: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ultimately, drug combinations may be optimal. Further, many aging drugs approved for a single chronic disease (e.g., metformin, rapamycin) may have efficacy because they target basic aspects of aging. Therefore, a thorough analysis of drugs clinically approved for chronic diseases should be performed to identify those with the potential to increase healthspan. Conserved longevity pathways have been identified across disparate eukaryotic species. However, aging also depends on environmental factors, which may be modifiable. Yet, the specific environmental influences on aging, aside from obvious culprits such as smoking and obesity, remain poorly understood. Moreover, stochasticity plays a major role in aging processes. There is enormous variability in longevity traits among genetically identical individuals across all species tested. The causes of this stochasticity and its role in aging and age-related diseases remain poorly understood. Numerous aging genes have been identified in nonvertebrates, which now should be used to develop a systems-level understanding of aging, including both genetic and environmental influences. Studies should incorporate multiple assessments of cellular and organismal function, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as readouts of macromolecular damage and activation of stress response pathways. Achieving a holistic view of aging in organisms such as yeast, worms, and flies will likely impact our understanding of vertebrate aging, as did the identification of single genes in those organisms. It is also critical in mammals to assess the relationship among genetics, environment, and drug interventions to predict responses in human healthspan trials. Human genome association studies have identified aging-associated gene variations from either genome-wide unbiased or gene-targeted studies, examining orthologs of animal aging genes (Deelen et al., 2013Deelen J. Beekman M. Capri M. Franceschi C. Slagboom P.E. Bioessays. 2013; 35: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Working between mouse and human genetics will accelerate identification of human aging genes and their mechanisms. Strategies should include generating orthologous or identical human mutant alleles in mice, modeling rare variants in genes from conserved longevity pathways. The lack of validated molecular biomarkers of human aging has impeded progress. However, recent studies have uncovered promising candidates that, if validated, could be used to test interventions. Epigenetic studies are among the most exciting, with reports indicating that human age can be predicted by analyzing DNA methylation status. It remains unclear whether these markers forecast chronologic or biologic age, which are likely distinct. If they indeed measure biologic age, then a major hurdle to initiating human studies will be overcome. Also, if similar DNA methylation sites are identified in mice, they could be validated by determining whether interventions such as rapamycin delay the appearance of an aging profile and whether chronic stressors accelerate it. Other avenues to molecular biomarkers, including metabolomic and proteomic approaches, are also yielding promising candidates and deserve equal attention. Increasingly, inflammation is being linked to aging and chronic disease (Salvioli et al., 2013Salvioli S. Monti D. Lanzarini C. Conte M. Pirazzini C. Bacalini M.G. Garagnani P. Giuliani C. Fontanesi E. Ostan R. et al.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2013; 19: 1675-1679PubMed Google Scholar). Acute inflammatory responses to insults such as injury and infection are critical for organismal health and recovery. However, the basal inflammatory response rises with age, leading to low-level chronic inflammation that is likely maladaptive, promoting aging. There is a need to identify (1) the pathways by which adaptive and chronic inflammation are induced and (2) the outcomes of “inflammaging.” Interventions designed to reduce chronic inflammation while maintaining an effective adaptive response may have broad benefits. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple tissues during aging and have a unique senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP) that includes many proinflammatory cytokines (Coppé et al., 2008Coppé J.P. Patil C.K. Rodier F. Sun Y. Muñoz D.P. Goldstein J. Nelson P.S. Desprez P.Y. Campisi J. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: 2853-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). Cell senescence, whereby cells irreversibly cease proliferation in response to stress, was long suspected of driving organismal aging. However, the number of senescent cells in most aged tissues is limited. The SASP potentially explains how a few senescent cells can have broad, adverse effects by secreting proinflammatory factors with autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine activities. It is important to understand the in vivo consequences of senescent cells and identify interventional strategies that may mitigate their effects. Recent genetic strategies to ablate senescent cells in mice set the stage for determining to what extent they drive aspects of normal aging (Baker et al., 2011Baker D.J. Wijshake T. Tchkonia T. LeBrasseur N.K. Childs B.G. van de Sluis B. Kirkland J.L. van Deursen J.M. Nature. 2011; 479: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). Metabolic dysregulation accompanies aging and is exacerbated by chronic diseases such as type II diabetes. Among the critical questions to be addressed is how overnutrition and obesity affect the aging metabolome, whether pro-longevity interventions suppress age-related metabolic dysfunction, and how these interventions act in individuals with type II diabetes. These issues are relevant to inflammation as well, as adipose tissue is a major source of inflammatory cytokines. Determining how the proinflammatory response in adipose tissue is initiated and propagated and the systemic effects of this response on aging should be a high priority. Links between altered metabolism and inflammation may underlie connections between aging pathways previously thought to be independent. Though yeast, worms, flies and mice have been powerhouse aging models, there are fundamental gaps in the knowledge they provide. Understanding the diversity of biological processes that can accelerate or protect against age-related decline is critical and is best achieved by investment in new model organisms that accentuate other aspects of aging. A major limitation in aging research is the lack of primate and other vertebrate models for preclinical testing. Primates, often rhesus monkeys, are intermediate between rodents and clinical trials in humans. However, rhesus monkeys live three to four decades, making aging studies long and expensive. One solution is to develop a second primate model—the marmoset, whose lifespan is much shorter. Other short-lived vertebrates such as the African killifish may be useful for the same reason: aging and disease studies can be performed more rapidly than current counterparts like zebrafish and mice. Although human genetic data on aging and age-related diseases is exploding, the speed of hypothesis testing in current vertebrate models is lagging, and a short-lived vertebrate may provide a solution. Another model to consider is dogs, which live in their owner’s environment, are well understood with regard to aging and disease, and comprise a wide range of pedigrees, providing genetic diversity. Finding strategies to extend healthspan in dogs may be an excellent prelude to achieving the same goals in humans. Exceptionally long-lived species also offer promise. Though several species such as clams are intriguing, the naked mole rat has recently garnered interest. These rodents are approximately the same size as mice but reach 30 years of age and are apparently devoid of cancer. Comparative studies and genome sequencing have suggested possible mechanisms that underlie their extreme longevity. One particularly informative research path may be to engineer naked mole rat longevity mechanisms into mice. The goal of slowing aging has fascinated humankind for millennia but has only recently acquired credibility. Recent findings that aging can be delayed in mammals raise the possibility of prolonging human healthspan. There is near consensus among aging researchers that this is possible, but only if resources are available to accomplish goals in areas ranging from basic biology to translational medicine."

Here, we report a class of de-novo-designed prokaryotic riboregulators called toehold switches that activate gene expression in response to cognate RNAs with arbitrary sequences. Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. We show that switches can be integrated into the genome to regulate endogenous genes and use them as sensors that respond to endogenous RNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of toehold switches to regulate 12 genes independently and to construct a genetic circuit that evaluates 4-input AND logic. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology."

Commercially available cell-free systems are freeze dried onto paper, enabling the inexpensive, sterile, and abiotic distribution of synthetic-biology-based technologies for the clinic, global health, industry, research, and education. For field use, we create circuits with colorimetric outputs for detection by eye and fabricate a low-cost, electronic optical interface. We demonstrate this technology with small-molecule and RNA actuation of genetic switches, rapid prototyping of complex gene circuits, and programmable in vitro diagnostics, including glucose sensors and strain-specific Ebola virus sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2006192795,"Mechanisms for human memory T cell differentiation and maintenance have largely been inferred from studies of peripheral blood, though the majority of T cells are found in lymphoid and mucosal sites. We present here a multidimensional, quantitative analysis of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance over six decades of life in blood, lymphoid, and mucosal tissues obtained from 56 individual organ donors. Our results reveal that the distribution and tissue residence of naive, central, and effector memory, and terminal effector subsets is contingent on both their differentiation state and tissue localization. Moreover, T cell homeostasis driven by cytokine or TCR-mediated signals is different in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell lineages, varies with their differentiation stage and tissue localization, and cannot be inferred from blood. Our data provide an unprecedented spatial and temporal map of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance, supporting distinct pathways for human T cell fate determination and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2031025318,"The development of whole-body imaging at single-cell resolution enables system-level approaches to studying cellular circuits in organisms. Previous clearing methods focused on homogenizing mismatched refractive indices of individual tissues, enabling reductions in opacity but falling short of achieving transparency. Here, we show that an aminoalcohol decolorizes blood by efficiently eluting the heme chromophore from hemoglobin. Direct transcardial perfusion of an aminoalcohol-containing cocktail that we previously termed CUBIC coupled with a 10 day to 2 week clearing protocol decolorized and rendered nearly transparent almost all organs of adult mice as well as the entire body of infant and adult mice. This CUBIC-perfusion protocol enables rapid whole-body and whole-organ imaging at single-cell resolution by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy. The CUBIC protocol is also applicable to 3D pathology, anatomy, and immunohistochemistry of various organs. These results suggest that whole-body imaging of colorless tissues at high resolution will contribute to organism-level systems biology."

Oligodendrocytes wrap layers of specialized cell membrane around nerve fibers to form myelin, which provides electrical insulation to increase axonal conduction velocity and the speed of neural processing. Myelination is a largely postnatal process and it continues well into adulthood in humans. Practicing a skill can increase the volume of white matter regions employed in carrying out the task and, conversely, social isolation, with reduced external stimuli, leads to hypomyelination and impaired cognitive functions (Blumenfeld-Katzir et al., 2011Blumenfeld-Katzir T.

It is less clear to what extent mature oligodendrocytes can modulate their myelination. Whereas transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitors to the central nervous system results in the differentiation of new oligodendrocytes that readily myelinate axons after transplantation, transplanted mature oligodendrocytes fail to myelinate (Blakemore and Keirstead, 1999Blakemore W.F. Keirstead H.S. The origin of remyelinating cells in the central nervous system.J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 98: 69-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, newly differentiated rodent oligodendrocytes can myelinate axons in vitro, whereas mature oligodendrocytes do so only very inefficiently (Watkins et al., 2008Watkins T.A. Emery B.

Imaging of myelination by rodent cells in vitro and in vivo during zebrafish development have demonstrated that oligodendrocytes establish all their myelin segments within a few hours after terminal differentiation and there appears to be little plasticity in terms of generating new myelin sheaths after that time window (Czopka et al., 2013Czopka T.

However, manipulation of certain signaling pathways in mouse oligodendrocytes results in enhanced myelination and a larger number of myelin layers, indicating that the thickness of the myelin sheath may be dynamically modulated (Flores et al., 2008Flores A.I.

Thus, available data from model organisms indicate that the number of myelin segments of a mature oligodendrocyte is static, but that oligodendrocyte turnover and potentially modulating the thickness of myelin sheaths contributes to myelin remodeling. We have assessed the dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation and myelination in humans. The number of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum is established in childhood and remains stable after that. The oligodendrocyte population in human white matter is remarkably static once the full complement is established, with only 1/300 oligodendrocytes being exchanged annually, and oligodendrocyte generation cannot account for the increase in myelin volume in response to experience in humans. We conclude that myelin remodeling in white matter is independent of cell turnover and mainly carried out by mature oligodendrocytes in humans. We first set out to establish the time course of oligodendrocyte generation in humans. We focused on the corpus callosum, the largest commissure, which is easily delineated anatomically. The corpus callosum represents a white matter tract that is modulated by experience throughout life (Bengtsson et al., 2005Bengtsson S.L. Nagy Z. Skare S. Forsman L. Forssberg H. Ullén F.

Experience-dependent plasticity of white-matter microstructure extends into old age.Neuropsychologia. 2010; 48: 3878-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the integrity of the corpus callosum white matter correlates with the performance of this neural circuitry in humans (Johansen-Berg et al., 2007Johansen-Berg H.

Integrity of white matter in the corpus callosum correlates with bimanual co-ordination skills.Neuroimage. 2007; 36: T16-T21Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We used quantitative stereology to establish the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes in the human postmortem corpus callosum in subjects aged 0.2–92 years (n = 55). Mature oligodendrocytes were identified by their combined expression of SOX10, a general oligodendrocyte lineage marker (Stolt et al., 2002Stolt C.C. Rehberg S. Ader M. Lommes P. Riethmacher D. Schachner M. Bartsch U. Wegner M. Terminal differentiation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes depends on the transcription factor Sox10.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and NOGO-A, a marker for mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (Schwab, 2010Schwab M.E. Functions of Nogo proteins and their receptors in the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We found that 99.2% of corpus callosum cells that expressed NOGO-A were positive for adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (n = 1,496 cells) (Bhat et al., 1996Bhat R.V. Axt K.J. Fosnaugh J.S. Smith K.J.

Expression of the APC tumor suppressor protein in oligodendroglia.Glia. 1996; 17: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and 99.5% were positive for Myelin basic protein (n = 745 cells), both commonly used markers for mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, validating that NOGO-A can be used to accurately identify mature oligodendrocytes in this situation. SOX10+/NOGO-A− cells were defined as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online).Figure S1Oligodendrocyte Identification in the Human Corpus Callosum, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Mature oligodendrocytes (SOX10+/NOGO-A+/APC+, arrowheads) in histological section from the human postmortem corpus callosum.

The scale bars are 10 μm. The number of oligodendrocyte progenitors was highest in the youngest individuals and dropped during early childhood to approach stable numbers at ∼5 years of age (Figure 1B). Shortly after birth, there were very few mature oligodendrocytes, but the number increased rapidly in the perinatal period. The number of oligodendrocytes started to plateau at ∼5 years of age (88% of the final number). The sterological data indicated that 98.5% of the final number of oligodendrocytes was reached at 9 years of age. After this age the number of oligodendrocytes stayed largely stable throughout the rest of the human lifespan (Figure 1C; Tables S1 and S2). Measurements of white matter volume by magnetic resonance imaging have established a continuous increase into early adulthood (Lebel et al., 2012Lebel C. Gee M. Camicioli R. Wieler M. Martin W. Beaulieu C. Diffusion tensor imaging of white matter tract evolution over the lifespan.Neuroimage. 2012; 60: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). It is, however, not possible to selectively visualize myelin by imaging, and the change in volume will also be influenced by for example changes in axon number, axon diameter, and the number of glial cells. To establish the dynamics specifically of myelination, we biochemically isolated myelin from the human postmortem corpus callosum from subjects aged 0.2–92 years (n = 57, including all subjects in whom we had quantified the number of oligodendrocytes, Figure 1C) and measured the volume (Figure S2A). This revealed an initially steep increase in myelin volume (86% of the final volume was reached at 5 years of age). The increase continued into adolescence, reaching its maximum at 17 years of age. This was followed by a slow gradual decline during aging, largely paralleling the total volume of the corpus callosum established by imaging (Figures 2A and S2B; Tables S3 and S4).Figure 2Myelination of the Human Corpus CallosumShow full caption(A) The myelin volume in the corpus callosum of the same subjects as in Figures 1B and 1C.

There was substantial interindividual variation in corpus callosum myelin volume (coefficient of variation, CV = 48.3%, n = 57 subjects) and the number of oligodendrocytes (CV = 31.3%, n = 55), as well as the total volume of the corpus callosum, established by MRI (CV = 22.7%, n = 403). In contrast to the sexual dimorphism in oligodendrocyte generation and myelin gene expression in rodents (Cerghet et al., 2006Cerghet M. Skoff R.P. Bessert D. Zhang Z. Mullins C. Ghandour M.S. Proliferation and death of oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins are differentially regulated in male and female rodents.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), there was no statistically significant difference in the number of oligodendrocytes or myelin volume between men and women (p = 0.95 and p = 0.70, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). After the age of 5, when the number of oligodendrocytes started to plateau (Figure 1C), there was no correlation between the number of oligodendrocytes and the myelin volume (Figure 2B, Pearson’s correlation, r = −0.10, p = 0.52). Thus, the number of oligodendrocytes does not appear to be a major determinant of the myelin volume in humans after the initial expansion phase. White matter volume, and likely myelination, can increase several percent within a few weeks in humans in response to practicing a skill (Scholz et al., 2009Scholz J. Klein M.C. Behrens T.E. Johansen-Berg H. Training induces changes in white-matter architecture.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1370-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). If changes in myelin volume in response to experience is mediated by newly generated oligodendrocytes, rather than by preexisting mature oligodendrocytes modulating their myelination, a substantial proportion of the oligodendrocytes would need to be exchanged. To assess the cell turnover dynamics in human brain white matter, we retrospectively birth-dated corpus callosum cells by analyzing the integration of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C by accelerator mass spectrometry (Spalding et al., 2005Spalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). The 14C concentration in genomic DNA in cells from the human postmortem corpus callosum (n = 12 subjects), as well as frontal lobe white matter (n = 3), corresponded to the atmospheric levels within a few years after the birth of the individuals in subjects born after the nuclear bomb tests (Figure 3B; Table S5), indicating very limited cell turnover. In individuals born before the onset of the nuclear bomb tests, the 14C levels in genomic DNA were lower than at any time after 1955 (Figure 3B), establishing that a large proportion of cells in white matter had not been exchanged for more than 5 decades. We also measured the concentration of 14C in biochemically purified myelin (Table S5). In all individuals (n = 10), the 14C concentration in myelin corresponded to the atmospheric 14C concentration around the time of death of the subject (Figure 3C), demonstrating that myelin is contemporary and continuously exchanged in humans. This is in line with data from rodents, where it has been established that myelin proteins are comparatively stable proteins, albeit exchanged within months (Savas et al., 2012Savas J.N. Toyama B.H. Xu T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hetzer M.W. Extremely long-lived nuclear pore proteins in the rat brain.Science. 2012; 335: 942Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Toyama et al., 2013Toyama B.H.

Identification of long-lived proteins reveals exceptional stability of essential cellular structures.Cell. 2013; 154: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We cannot distinguish whether this reflects exchange of myelin sheaths or molecular turnover in stable myelin sheaths. Although oligodendrocytes are in majority in white matter tracts (75.4% ± 5.1% of cells in the human corpus callosum, mean ± SD, n = 22 subjects and 78.4% ± 2.2%, n = 6, in the frontal lobe, as assessed by flow cytometry, see below), it was important to specifically isolate and birth date oligodendrocytes, as it is likely that the turnover dynamics of diverse cell populations may be different. We developed a strategy to isolate oligodendrocyte nuclei by flow cytometry. We isolated SOX10+/APC+ nuclei from the human postmortem corpus callosum by flow cytometry from 34 subjects aged 4–92 (Figure 4A). The number of oligodendrocytes and the myelin volume was determined in all except three of these cases (shown in Figures 1 and 2). Reanalysis demonstrated 98.2% ± 1.2% (mean ± SD, n = 34 subjects) purity of the SOX10+/APC+ population (Figure S3). The specificity of the isolation was further assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), which revealed that 95.3%–99.6% of the mRNA for three different mature myelinating oligodendrocyte markers and SOX10 was present in the SOX10+/APC+ fraction (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the SOX10+/APC+ nuclear fraction was almost devoid of markers for astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitors, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells (Figure S3), establishing that the SOX10+/APC+ fraction consisted of highly enriched mature oligodendrocyte nuclei. Conversely, the nonoligodendrocyte fraction was highly enriched for markers for other cell types and largely depleted of markers for mature oligodendrocytes (Figures S3 and 4B) Thus, nearly all of the oligodendrocyte nuclei were isolated in the SOX10+/APC+ fraction.Figure S3Reanalysis of Flow Cytometry Isolated Oligodendrocyte and Nonoligodendrocyte Nuclei and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Reanalysis of flow cytometry isolated oligodendrocyte nuclei show 1.8% ± 1.2% contamination of nonoligodendrocyte nuclei in the SOX10+/APC+ population.(B) Reanalysis of flow cytometry isolated nonoligodendrocyte nuclei show 2.4% ± 1.6% contamination of oligodendrocyte nuclei.

Data in (C) represent mean ± SD (n = 3 individuals and independent experiments) In individuals born before the onset of the nuclear bomb tests in 1955 (n = 10), the 14C concentration in oligodendrocyte genomic DNA from the corpus callosum was higher than the prebomb atmospheric concentrations, demonstrating that oligodendrocytes had been generated after the onset of the 14C increase in 1955 (Figure 5A; Table S5). However, in 9 out of 10 individuals, the 14C concentration was lower than at any time after the onset of the nuclear bomb tests, establishing that a large proportion of the oligodendrocytes must have been generated before 1955 and lasted for more than 5 decades. Individuals born after the nuclear bomb tests had 14C concentrations in oligodendrocyte DNA that corresponded to within a few years after the subjects’ birth (Figure 5). We also carbon dated genomic DNA from oligodendrocyte nuclei (SOX10+/APC+) isolated from frontal lobe white matter (n = 6 individuals), which revealed very similar 14C concentrations to oligodendrocyte nuclei isolated from the corpus callosum (Figure S4A). The 14C levels were very similar in oligodendrocyte DNA (Figures 5 and S4A) and unsorted white matter cell DNA (Figure 3B), indicating that there cannot be any sizable subpopulation of oligodendrocytes with very different turnover dynamics in these regions, which were excluded in our strategy for isolating oligodendrocyte nuclei. We next carbon dated genomic DNA from oligodendrocytes isolated from prefrontal or frontal cortex gray matter in subjects aged 8–92 years (n = 20). Interestingly, individuals born before the onset of the nuclear bomb tests had higher and individuals born after the peak in atmospheric 14C concentration had lower 14C levels in gray matter oligodendrocytes compared to in white matter oligodendrocytes in the same subjects (Figures S4C and S4D). Isolated cortical and cerebellar neurons had 14C concentrations corresponding to the time around their birth (Figure S4B), in line with the lack of any detectable postnatal neurogenesis in these regions (Bergmann et al., 2012Bergmann O.

https://openalex.org/W2117009494,"Mammalian oocytes can reprogram somatic cells into a totipotent state enabling animal cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, the majority of SCNT embryos fail to develop to term due to undefined reprogramming defects. Here, we identify histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) of donor cell genome as a major barrier for efficient reprogramming by SCNT. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified reprogramming resistant regions (RRRs) that are expressed normally at 2-cell mouse embryos generated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) but not SCNT. RRRs are enriched for H3K9me3 in donor somatic cells and its removal by ectopically expressed H3K9me3 demethylase Kdm4d not only reactivates the majority of RRRs, but also greatly improves SCNT efficiency. Furthermore, use of donor somatic nuclei depleted of H3K9 methyltransferases markedly improves SCNT efficiency. Our study thus identifies H3K9me3 as a critical epigenetic barrier in SCNT-mediated reprogramming and provides a promising approach for improving mammalian cloning efficiency."

Moreover, ∼1/6 of neurogenic RGPs proceed to produce glia. These results suggest that progenitor behavior and histogenesis in the mammalian neocortex conform to a remarkably orderly and deterministic program. The mammalian neocortex commands all higher-order brain functions. It consists of an extraordinarily large number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons organized into distinct laminae. Previous studies showed that radial glia in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing neocortex are the progenitors that produce nearly all excitatory neurons (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009Kriegstein A. Alvarez-Buylla A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 149-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Prior to neurogenesis, radial glial progenitors (RGPs) divide symmetrically to amplify the progenitor pool. During the neurogenic phase, RGPs are believed to divide asymmetrically to produce neurons either directly or indirectly through transient amplifying progenitors, such as intermediate progenitors (IPs) (Florio and Huttner, 2014Florio M. Huttner W.B. Neural progenitors, neurogenesis and the evolution of the neocortex.Development. 2014; 141: 2182-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Consecutive waves of neurogenesis lead to the formation of cortical layers in an “inside-out” fashion; that is, late-born neurons migrate past early-born neurons and progressively occupy more superficial layers (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine Jr., J.B. Sidman R.L. Autoradiographic study of cell migration during histogenesis of cerebral cortex in the mouse.Nature. 1961; 192: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Although these studies have outlined a framework for our understanding of neocortical neurogenesis, precise knowledge of neuron production and organization, especially at the single-progenitor level, remains elusive. Proper functioning of the neocortex depends on the production and positioning of the correct number and diversity of neurons for intricate circuit assembly. To generate a neocortex of the appropriate size and cellular composition, an exquisite balance must be reached between the proliferation and differentiation of RGPs. This balance could be regulated at the level of individual RGPs, which might undergo defined sequences of fate choices during progenitor amplification and neurogenesis. However, recent studies in adult mammalian tissues, including the epidermis (Clayton et al., 2007Clayton E. Doupé D.P. Klein A.M. Winton D.J. Simons B.D. Jones P.H. A single type of progenitor cell maintains normal epidermis.Nature. 2007; 446: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), airway epithelium (Teixeira et al., 2013Teixeira V.H. Nadarajan P.

In this case, the behavior of individual progenitors appears to be stochastic, whereas the dynamics of the total population unfolds in a predictable manner. Interestingly, a similar scenario has been proposed in the developing zebrafish retina (He et al., 2012He J. Zhang G. Almeida A.D. Cayouette M. Simons B.D. Harris W.A.

Excitatory neurons in the neocortex are diverse in their dendrite morphology, axonal projection, and biophysical properties. This diversity is strongly tied to the histogenesis of the neocortex (Greig et al., 2013Greig L.C. Woodworth M.B. Galazo M.J. Padmanabhan H. Macklis J.D.

Sestan N. Anton E.S. Transcriptional co-regulation of neuronal migration and laminar identity in the neocortex.Development. 2012; 139: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Early-born neurons, occupying the deep layers (5–6), are predominantly composed of corticofugal neurons that project away from the neocortex to subcortical targets, such as thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. On the other hand, late-born neurons, occupying the superficial layers (2–4), are largely composed of intracortical neurons that project locally or to the contralateral cortical hemisphere. The overall coupling between histogenesis and neuronal subtypes implies that RGPs, as a population, progress through a succession of states, and the probabilities of generating distinct neuronal types change as a function of time and/or cell division. This “progressive competence restriction” model was supported by previous progenitor transplantation studies (Desai and McConnell, 2000Desai A.R. McConnell S.K.

In addition, dissociated and embryonic stem cell-derived cortical progenitors cultured in vitro recapitulate the sequential production of neuronal types as observed in vivo (Eiraku et al., 2008Eiraku M.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A number of neuronal type-specific transcription factors are already expressed in progenitors during early neocortical development (Greig et al., 2013Greig L.C. Woodworth M.B. Galazo M.J.

Transcriptional co-regulation of neuronal migration and laminar identity in the neocortex.Development. 2012; 139: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that distinct subpopulations of progenitors are responsible for producing particular types of neocortical excitatory neurons. For example, orthodenticle homolog 1 (OTX1), a homeodomain transcription factor, is selectively expressed in a subset of subcerebral neurons in layer 5, as well as a number of neurons in layer 6, and regulates their axonal projection (Frantz et al., 1994Frantz G.D.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5725-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weimann et al., 1999Weimann J.M. Zhang Y.A. Levin M.E. Devine W.P. Brûlet P. McConnell S.K. Cortical neurons require Otx1 for the refinement of exuberant axonal projections to subcortical targets.Neuron. 1999; 24: 819-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OTX1 is also abundantly expressed in the VZ progenitors during the period of deep-layer neuron production, and its expression in progenitors is greatly reduced during the generation of superficial-layer neurons (Frantz et al., 1994Frantz G.D. Weimann J.M. Levin M.E. McConnell S.K. Otx1 and Otx2 define layers and regions in developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5725-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc)-homeodomain transcription factors POU3F3/BRN1 and POU3F2/BRN2, markers largely specific for superficial-layer neurons, are expressed in VZ progenitors during superficial-layer neurogenesis and regulate the specification and migration of superficial-layer neurons (Dominguez et al., 2013Dominguez M.H. Ayoub A.E. Rakic P. POU-III transcription factors (Brn1, Brn2, and Oct6) influence neurogenesis, molecular identity, and migratory destination of upper-layer cells of the cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 2632-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent genetic fate-mapping experiments have suggested that, on the population level, progenitors expressing cut-like homeobox 2 (CUX2), another marker specific for callosal and other superficial-layer neurons, exclusively produce superficial-layer neurons (Franco et al., 2012Franco S.J. Gil-Sanz C. Martinez-Garay I. Espinosa A. Harkins-Perry S.R. Ramos C. Müller U. Fate-restricted neural progenitors in the mammalian cerebral cortex.Science. 2012; 337: 746-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), although conflicting results were subsequently reported (Guo et al., 2013Guo C. Eckler M.J. McKenna W.L. McKinsey G.L. Rubenstein J.L. Chen B. Fezf2 expression identifies a multipotent progenitor for neocortical projection neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1167-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, further investigation using additional and independent genetic lineage tracing approaches, especially at the single progenitor level, is necessary to faithfully uncover the precise lineage relationship of neocortical progenitors and neurons. Besides neurons, RGPs also produce glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), which have diverse roles in the development and maintenance of neurological function. Although gliogenesis is generally known to follow neurogenesis in the developing mammalian brain (Costa et al., 2009Costa M.R. Bucholz O. Schroeder T. Götz M.

Developmental genetics of vertebrate glial-cell specification.Nature. 2010; 468: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), their precise relationship in vivo at the individual progenitor level remains largely unexplored. Clonal analysis, through labeling of individual progenitor cells and following their progeny in the developing neocortex in vivo, could provide definitive answers to the ontogeny of neocortical neurons and glia. Indeed, previous clonal studies using retroviral labeling or chimeric mice have contributed to the current framework of neocortical neurogenesis (Kornack and Rakic, 1995Kornack D.R. Rakic P.

However, the lack of cellular resolution of progeny cell fate, vital for dissecting progenitor division patterns, and the imprecise spatiotemporal control of clonal labeling have so far precluded a definitive understanding of this complex and dynamic process. The MADM (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers) technique offers a solution (Hippenmeyer et al., 2010Hippenmeyer S. Youn Y.H. Moon H.M. Miyamichi K. Zong H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Luo L. Genetic mosaic dissection of Lis1 and Ndel1 in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2010; 68: 695-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Zong et al., 2005Zong H. Espinosa J.S. Su H.H. Muzumdar M.D. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice.Cell. 2005; 121: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In this study, we exploited the unprecedented resolution of MADM labeling and performed a quantitative clonal analysis of RGP division and lineage progression in the mouse neocortex. In MADM, Cre recombinase-mediated interchromosomal recombination in the G2 phase of dividing progenitors followed by X-segregation (G2-X, segregation of recombinant sister chromatids into separate daughter cells) reconstitutes one of two fluorescent markers, enhanced GFP (EGFP, green) or tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato, red), in each of the two daughter cells (Figure S1A available online) (Zong et al., 2005Zong H. Espinosa J.S. Su H.H. Muzumdar M.D. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice.Cell. 2005; 121: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). As such, G2-X MADM events result in permanent and distinct labeling of the two descendent lineages, thereby allowing a direct assessment of the division pattern (symmetric versus asymmetric) and potential (the number of progeny) of the original dividing progenitors. In addition, upon G2-Z (congregation of recombinant sister chromatids into the same daughter cell), G1, or G0 recombination events, green and red fluorescent proteins are restored simultaneously in the same cell, resulting in double-labeled (yellow) cells (Figure S1A). To specifically label neocortical excitatory neuron progenitors in a temporally controlled manner, we introduced the Emx1-CreERT2 transgene (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) into the MADM system and induced Cre activity through a single dose of tamoxifen (TM) administered to timed pregnant females at one of the following four embryonic stages: E10, E11, E12, and E13 (Figure S1B). Brains were analyzed at either postnatal day (P)7–P10 or P21– P30. We found no labeling in the absence of TM treatment (n = 5 brains). To ensure unequivocal clonal analysis, we titrated the TM dose to achieve very sparse labeling (see below). To recover all labeled cells, we performed serial sectioning and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of individual brains (Figure 1A). As expected, cells fluorescently labeled in green, red, or yellow exhibited the characteristic morphological features of neocortical excitatory neurons (Figures 1B and S2A). For example, in the entire hemisphere of a P21 brain exposed to TM at E10 (E10–P21), we observed only two clusters of neurons separated by 2,170 μm (Figure 1A and Movie S1), one consisting of green and red neurons (Figure 1C and Movie S2) and the other consisting of yellow neurons (Figures S2A and S2B ). There were no scattered neurons or mixed clusters of green or red neurons with yellow neurons. Similar labeling efficiency and distribution patterns were found in another five brains treated with TM at E10 and analyzed at P21–30. In total, from these brains, we recovered 33 green/red fluorescent neuron clusters, 10 yellow fluorescent neuron clusters, and no mixed clusters with both green/red and yellow fluorescent neurons. To further quantitatively assess the spatial distribution and clonal relationship of labeled neurons, we applied nearest-neighbor distance (NND) analysis to the 3D reconstruction data sets (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.H. Tan X. Zhang X.J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Diggle, 2003Diggle P.J. Statistical Analysis of Spatial Point Patterns. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). The NNDs among the green/red neurons (blue) or the yellow neurons (yellow) were significantly shorter than that of simulated random data sets (Figure 1D). In contrast, the NNDs among the green/red and yellow neurons (magenta) were substantially longer. Together, these results demonstrated that clonally related neurons originating from distinct, sparsely labeled progenitors form spatially segregated clusters, and each cluster represents a clone that arises from a single neural progenitor. Notably, glial cells were also observed in some clones (arrowheads, Figures 1B and S2A). We focused our analysis on green/red G2-X clusters of clonally related neurons, as they provide crucial information on the division pattern and lineage potential of labeled progenitors, which would be otherwise unavailable from a conventional labeling strategy. We quantified the size of clones labeled at different embryonic stages and found that the average clone size decreased progressively as development proceeded (Figure 1E), which is consistent with an overall reduction in the proliferative and neurogenic potential of progenitors over time. We occasionally observed G2-X clones containing only green or red neurons (Figure S3A), likely due to the apoptosis of one of the original two daughter cells. The overall rate of apoptosis in the neocortical excitatory neuron lineage appeared to be low (Figures S3B–S3E). Previous work has suggested that, during early neocortical development, RGPs divide either symmetrically to amplify their number or asymmetrically to produce neurons while self-renewing (Florio and Huttner, 2014Florio M. Huttner W.B. Neural progenitors, neurogenesis and the evolution of the neocortex.Development. 2014; 141: 2182-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). MADM clonal analysis validated these observations. We found that G2-X clones could be grouped into two types. They either contained sizable numbers of both green and red neurons (more than three neurons of each color) distributed throughout the superficial and deep layers (termed type I, Figure 2A, left) or else contained a “majority” population in one color and a “minority” population (less than four neurons, mostly one or two neurons) in the other color (termed type II, Figure 2A, right). Interestingly, in type II clones, the minority population always resided in the deeper layers relative to the majority population. Consistent with the “inside-out” sequence of neocortical neurogenesis (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine Jr., J.B. Sidman R.L. Autoradiographic study of cell migration during histogenesis of cerebral cortex in the mouse.Nature. 1961; 192: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), the minority population thus represents the earliest-born neurons in the labeled lineage. Moreover, the relative scarcity of the minority population indicates that the original daughter cell, from which the minority population arises, is either a neuron or an IP capable of undergoing only one to two rounds of division (i.e., producing no more than four neuronal progeny) (Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C. Martínez-Cerdeño V. Ivic L. Kriegstein A.R. Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), whereas the majority population originates from a self-renewing RGP. Therefore, type II clones represent asymmetric neurogenic clones (Figure 2A, right, top). In contrast, type I clones represent symmetric proliferative clones, as the two originally labeled daughter cells are most probably self-renewing RGPs, each capable of producing a large cohort of neuronal progeny (Figure 2A, left, top). The exquisite resolution of G2-X clones allowed a direct quantitative measurement of symmetric proliferative and asymmetric neurogenic division frequencies of RGPs in vivo. We found that the transition from symmetric proliferation to asymmetric neurogenesis occurs predominantly at E11–E12 (Figure 2B). Importantly, the explicit identification of asymmetric neurogenic clones (type II) enabled a quantitative assessment of the neurogenic capacity of individual RGPs as they switch from symmetric proliferative division to asymmetric neurogenic division. We found that the average size of asymmetric neurogenic clones labeled by TM treatment at E10–E12 was ∼8–9 neurons (Figure 2C). Moreover, the histogram of individual asymmetric neurogenic clone sizes could be described by a Gaussian-like distribution (which we term “Unitary Gaussian”; centered on a “mean” value of [μ0 = ]8.4 neurons and a SD of [δ = ]2.6 neurons; Figure 2D). The appearance of a defined peak at eight to nine neurons contrasted with what one would expect if RGPs in the neurogenic phase stochastically undergo terminal differentiation (i.e., exit cell cycle) at any time in a generation-independent manner, as this would result in a geometric (i.e., negative exponential) distribution of clone sizes with a peak at the smallest clone size. Instead, our data suggest that individual RGPs do not exit the cell cycle randomly but have a defined unitary output in neuronal production after they enter the neurogenic phase. Should this be the case, one would predict that symmetric proliferative divisions of RGPs prior to asymmetric neurogenic divisions predominantly produce clones with a size that is an integer multiple of the Gaussian unit. Indeed, we found that the overall size distribution for a majority of clones labeled at E10–E12 could be described as a series of Gaussians centered on integer multiples of the Unitary Gaussian mean (Figure 2E, black and colored lines), suggesting that excitatory neurons in the neocortex are produced in “quanta” (i.e., around eight to nine neurons) by RGPs. Interestingly, the size of asymmetric neurogenic clones was similar across different neocortical areas (Figure 2F), suggesting that the unitary neuronal output is a general property of RGPs. Similar results in excitatory neuron clonal labeling and properties were obtained when we used Nestin-CreERT2 (Figure S4), another transgenic mouse line with neural progenitor-specific expression of TM-inducible Cre (Imayoshi et al., 2006Imayoshi I. Ohtsuka T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Kageyama R. Temporal regulation of Cre recombinase activity in neural stem cells.Genesis. 2006; 44: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Notably, we occasionally observed labeled neocortical interneurons in Nestin-CreERT2;MADM brains that were readily distinguished based on morphology. Turning to the quantitative analysis of the behavior of type I symmetric proliferative clones (Figure 3A), we found that their average size progressively decreased over time (Figure 3B). Notably, two self-renewing RGPs produced by a “symmetric” proliferative division can have distinct proliferative and neurogenic potentials, as reflected by the differences in the number and spatial distribution of their neuronal progeny (green versus red subclones; Figure 3A). Remarkably, however, the sizes of sister subclones lay mostly within a factor of two from each other, i.e., less than one round of cell division apart (Figure 3C). Moreover, the mean ratio of the larger to smaller sister subclone size was surprisingly similar regardless of the total clone size or the time of induction (E10, 1.7 ± 0.2; E11, 1.6 ± 0.1; E12, 1.6 ± 0.1; p = 0.6; Figures 3C, black dots), suggesting that the proliferative potential of sister RGPs is similarly correlated at all stages. If RGPs transitioned into the neurogenic phase in a sporadic stochastic manner, one would expect the size of sister subclones to become decorrelated. Consistently, random pairing of subclones at each developmental stage led to drastically different ratios of larger to smaller subclone size. Thus, these results strongly suggest that the correlation between sister subclone sizes does not occur randomly but instead indicate that the proliferative potential of RGPs diminishes coherently and synchronously across generations. To search for further evidence of a coherent underlying program in the proliferative phase, we analyzed the size distribution of symmetric proliferative clones. Interestingly, the cumulative distribution of clone sizes could be well described by an exponential distribution at each time point (Figure 3D). Based on the unitary neuronal output (Figure 2), we estimated the rounds of proliferative division that RGPs underwent prior to neurogenic division to produce the clone (see Experimental Procedures). Importantly, we found that the corresponding distribution of proliferative divisions of individual RGPs at each time point was peaked with a width of ∼2.5 cell divisions (Figure 3E), indicating only a moderate degree of variation in proliferative capacity among RGPs induced at th"

Compared with the great variety of readers for histone methylation, few protein modules that recognize histone acetylation are known. Here, we show that the AF9 YEATS domain binds strongly to histone H3K9 acetylation and, to a lesser extent, H3K27 and H3K18 acetylation. Crystal structural studies revealed that AF9 YEATS adopts an eight-stranded immunoglobin fold and utilizes a serine-lined aromatic ""sandwiching"" cage for acetyllysine readout, representing a novel recognition mechanism that is distinct from that of known acetyllysine readers. ChIP-seq experiments revealed a strong colocalization of AF9 and H3K9 acetylation genome-wide, which is important for the chromatin recruitment of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. Together, our studies identified the evolutionarily conserved YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module and established a direct link between histone acetylation and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in transcription control."

We find that the Wnt receptor Frizzled2 (Fzd2) and its ligands Wnt5a/b are elevated in metastatic liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer cell lines and in high-grade tumors and that their expression correlates with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Pharmacologic and genetic perturbations reveal that Fzd2 drives EMT and cell migration through a previously unrecognized, noncanonical pathway that includes Fyn and Stat3. A gene signature regulated by this pathway predicts metastasis and overall survival in patients. We have developed an antibody to Fzd2 that reduces cell migration and invasion and inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in xenografts.

Second, both X and Y chromosomes have acquired and amplified genes independently of each other. These gene families are often expressed specifically in the testis, suggestive of functions in male gametogenesis (Hughes et al., 2010Hughes J.F. Skaletsky H. Pyntikova T.

Study of mammalian sex chromosomes and their relevance to human biology is hindered by the lack of high-quality reference sequences of X and Y chromosomes across a broad range of mammals. Our understanding of mammalian sex chromosomes and their evolution is presently supported by a limited set of high-quality single-haplotype sequences: complete X chromosome sequences from human and mouse, complete MSY sequences from human, rhesus, and chimpanzee, and the ancestrally derived sequences of the MSY in marmoset, mouse, rat, bull, and opossum (Bellott et al., 2014Bellott D.W.

Other analyses rely on cDNA sequences, physical maps, and partial genomic sequences (Li et al., 2013Li G. Davis B.W. Raudsepp T. Pearks Wilkerson A.J. Mason V.C. Ferguson-Smith M. O’Brien P.C.

None of the fully sequenced Y chromosomes is from a genetically tractable model organism. The mouse could potentially serve as such a model, offering rich opportunities to study mammalian Y chromosome biology. We thus embarked on this sequencing effort, whose results we now report, in 2002. Prior to our efforts, only limited sequences from the presumptive short arm were available to facilitate genetic studies of the mouse Y chromosome. The mouse MSY, which does not undergo crossing over with a homolog, is impervious to conventional genetic mapping methods, requiring instead approaches such as deletion mapping. When this study began, most identified genes, including the sex-determining gene Sry, mapped to the short arm (Burgoyne, 1998Burgoyne P.S.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The long arm was comparatively impenetrable due to its highly repetitive nature (Eicher et al., 1989Eicher E.M. Hutchison K.W. Phillips S.J. Tucker P.K. Lee B.K.

We recognized that mapping and sequencing the mouse MSY, given the repetitive long-arm sequences, would require a methodology with an extraordinary level of accuracy and precision. Our laboratory previously developed and used single-haplotype iterative mapping and sequencing (SHIMS) to assemble ampliconic sequences, long stretches of duplicated sequences that share high nucleotide identity, which are a common feature of primate sex chromosomes (Hughes et al., 2010Hughes J.F.

Here, we report the sequence of the mouse MSY and its implications for mammalian sex chromosome evolution and biology. Like previously sequenced primate MSYs, the mouse MSY has lost most of its ancestral genes and acquired and amplified other genes during the past 200–300 million years. These processes of gene decay and acquisition are especially prominent in the mouse compared to the primate MSYs. The mouse MSY retains only nine of 639 ancestral genes, far fewer than in primates. Remarkably, the overwhelming majority of the mouse MSY consists instead of newly acquired, massively amplified, rodent-specific sequence, which contains three major Y gene families. These Y gene families have X homologs that are products of convergent acquisition and amplification. The work reported here sheds light on the paradoxical combination of divergence and convergence between the X and Y chromosomes in mouse sex chromosome evolution and offers a genetically tractable model for experimentation in Y chromosome biology. The mouse MSY presented a technical challenge insurmountable by typical sequencing strategies. Prior evidence suggested that the mouse MSY contains highly repetitive sequences. We confirmed this by analyzing fingerprint contigs from C57BL/6J XY and XX bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries (RPCI-24 and RPCI-23, British Columbia Cancer Agency and Michael Smith Genome Science Center): male-specific fingerprint contigs displayed clone depths as great as 162-fold, whereas expected depth for single-copy Y sequence was 5-fold. Despite this unprecedented clone depth, we surmised from fingerprint analysis that individual repeat units were sufficiently large and complex to be amenable to BAC-based sequencing (Extended Experimental Procedures). We sequenced the C57BL/6J mouse MSY using SHIMS (Extended Experimental Procedures). We started by identifying 170 mouse MSY BACs containing unique base-pair substitutions termed Sequence Family Variants (SFVs) (Saxena et al., 2000Saxena R. de Vries J.W. Repping S. Alagappan R.K. Skaletsky H. Brown L.G. Ma P. Chen E. Hoovers J.M.N. Page D.C. Four DAZ genes in two clusters found in the AZFc region of the human Y chromosome.Genomics. 2000; 67: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Data S1 available online). These BACs were used to seed 121 contigs, which were expanded by iteratively selecting and sequencing BAC clones with SFV matches to existing contig ends. To ensure accurate SFV identification and BAC assembly, we aimed to sequence BACs with large overlaps of about 50–60 kb. We obtained a tiling path of 88.8 Mb in 19 contigs, of which 60.0 Mb was sequenced in at least two independent BACs (Table S1). This redundancy enabled a high degree of accuracy, an error rate of about one in 143,000 nucleotides (Extended Experimental Procedures), which allowed us to resolve large, almost perfect repeats. We were able to resolve and assemble the massively ampliconic mouse MSY sequences only by SHIMS; whole-genome shotgun methods would have produced a collapsed assembly, not representative of actual sequences. SHIMS, as demonstrated here, will enable sequencing and assembly of complex ampliconic genomic structures, variants of which are often associated with human disease (Bailey and Eichler, 2006Bailey J.A.

Hurles M.E. et al.Copy number variation: new insights in genome diversity.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). To confirm and validate the sequence map, and order and orient the 19 sequence contigs, we constructed a radiation hybrid (RH) map spanning the entire length of the chromosome. We generated a panel of 93 high-resolution RH clones, which we genotyped for 215 markers designed to distinguish sequence differences between mouse MSY amplicons (Data S1). RH mapping independently confirmed our sequence assembly in each of the 19 sequence contigs, and enabled us to order and orient the contigs (Table S2). We created a model Y chromosome assembly of 89.6 Mb, which comprises the 19 ordered and oriented contigs connected by estimated gaps (Data S1 and S2; Extended Experimental Procedures). We used this model assembly for all subsequent analyses. Based on the total sequence we obtained (88.8 Mb) and estimated gap sizes, we estimate our sequence to be 99.1% complete. This total sequence is within 6.2% of previous size estimates of the mouse Y chromosome as measured by flow cytometry (94.7 Mb) (Bergstrom et al., 1998Bergstrom D.E. Grieco D.A. Sonti M.M. Fawcett J.J. Bell-Prince C. Cram L.S. Narayanswami S. Simpson E.M. The mouse Y chromosome: enrichment, sizing, and cloning by bivariate flow cytometry.Genomics. 1998; 48: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The mouse MSY dwarfs the human, chimp, and rhesus MSYs in both the absolute and relative amounts of euchromatic and ampliconic sequence: 89.5 Mb, or 99.9%, of the mouse MSY is euchromatic, and 87.7 Mb, or 98.0%, of this euchromatin is ampliconic (Figures 1A and 1B ). The MSY’s ampliconic sequences are distinct from what are typically referred to as repetitive sequences, which are often thought of as gene poor, high in interspersed repeats, or even heterochromatic. In contrast, the mouse MSY ampliconic sequence (and consequently the entire mouse MSY) is gene dense and is similar in interspersed-repeat content to the sequenced primate MSYs or to mouse autosomes (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, the mouse MSY stands in contrast to theories that Y chromosomes should be degenerate, small, gene poor, and heterochromatic (Bachtrog, 2013Bachtrog D.

We obtained the complete sequence of the mouse Y centromere (Figure S1). Consisting of 90 kb of satellite repeats, the centromere is the only heterochromatic sequence (defined as satellite sequence) that we identified in the entire mouse MSY. This centromeric sequence has been shown to associate with kinetochore-specific histone H3 CENPA (Pertile et al., 2009Pertile M.D. Graham A.N. Choo K.H.A. Kalitsis P.

We envision broad applicability of RNA tomography as an accurate and sensitive approach for spatially resolved transcriptomics in whole embryos and dissected organs. The formation of spatially distinct gene expression domains is a ubiquitous process during metazoan development and is fundamental for the meticulous patterning required to drive embryogenesis. Identifying genetic pathways and regulators that are active in well-defined regions of the embryo is crucial to understand the processes of embryonic axis formation, tissue specification, and organ development. As a consequence, many studies in different model organisms and tissues, and at different developmental stages, have focused on identifying spatial patterns of gene expression on a large scale (Fowlkes et al., 2008Fowlkes C.C.

Because such studies rely on microscopy-based approaches like mRNA in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry—that unavoidably investigate only one or a few genes per sample—screening spatial expression patterns of the entire transcriptome has so far been out of reach. Conversely, RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to study gene expression on the genome-wide level, but is unable to yield spatially resolved information. Gene expression analysis after cell sorting can be used to determine cell-specific transcriptomes, but the spatial resolution as well as the number of different cell types that can be screened are limited (Birnbaum et al., 2003Birnbaum K. Shasha D.E. Wang J.Y. Jung J.W. Lambert G.M. Galbraith D.W. Benfey P.N. A gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root.Science. 2003; 302: 1956-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In situ sequencing of RNA in intact tissues has the potential to provide direct information about the spatial organization of the transcriptome (Ke et al., 2013Ke R. Mignardi M. Pacureanu A.

Amamoto R. et al.Highly multiplexed subcellular RNA sequencing in situ.Science. 2014; 343: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However, this method is currently restricted by low detection efficiency and has not yet been demonstrated to detect gene expression patterns in intact tissues. With current technology, a promising approach for spatially resolved transcriptomics consists of dissecting the specimen of interest and preparing individual sequencing libraries from the different pieces of tissue. In cases where manual dissection is difficult or impossible, such as the small embryos of typical model organisms, cryosectioning followed by RNA extraction from individual slices has been shown to provide spatial resolution along the sectioning coordinate (Combs and Eisen, 2013Combs P.A. Eisen M.B. Sequencing mRNA from cryo-sliced Drosophila embryos to determine genome-wide spatial patterns of gene expression.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e71820Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for high amounts of input RNA for preparing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries has so far limited the use of this approach for spatially resolved transcriptomics, because large amounts of carrier RNA have to be used for library preparation, severely reducing the number of useable sequencing reads.

Methods. 2009; 6: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) is now beginning to alleviate the restrictions caused by high input material requirements. Here, we present a method for spatially resolved transcriptomics based on cryosectioning that circumvents the need for carrier RNA and allows the generation of genome-wide spatial expression maps in 3D. In our approach, we cryosection individual zebrafish embryos into 50–100 thin slices, extract RNA from the individual sections, and make use of in vitro transcription for linear amplification of cDNA (Hashimshony et al., 2012Hashimshony T. Wagner F. Sher N. Yanai I. CEL-Seq: single-cell RNA-Seq by multiplexed linear amplification.Cell Reports. 2012; 2: 666-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) in order to minimize amplification biases (Figures 1A and 1B ). By sectioning individual embryos in three different directions, we measure RNA profiles along the three main body axes. Using mathematical image reconstruction inspired by optical tomography techniques such as computed tomography, and taking into account the shape of the embryo as determined by microscopy, we then reconstruct spatial expression patterns in 3D on a transcriptome-wide level. We provide a comprehensive genome-wide 3D expression atlas at three different stages of early zebrafish development—shield stage, 10 somites stage, and 15 somites stage—and we show in a proof-of-principle experiment using mouse embryonic forelimbs that the protocol can be applied to other model organisms and to isolated tissues or organs. We demonstrate that our approach can identify spatial expression patterns in the zebrafish embryo and validate selected candidates by traditional in situ hybridization. Our method and database represent a powerful resource to identify candidate genes expressed in any specific pattern without the need for anatomical annotation. Segmentation-stage zebrafish embryos are tightly wrapped around the yolk sac, with head and tail in close proximity (Figure 1A). To determine transcriptome-wide gene expression patterns along the anteroposterior axis, we removed the yolk and straightened zebrafish embryos at the 15 somites stage, allowing us to cryosection embryos from head to tail into ∼100 slices of 18 μm thickness (see sketch in Figure 1C). We then extracted RNA from each individual section after adding a defined amount of synthetic spike-in RNA to control for efficiency differences during the downstream protocol (Figures S1A–S1D available online). cDNA was generated for the individual sections using barcoded primers, which allowed us to pool samples for RNA amplification (Figure 1B; Experimental Procedures; Table S1). In vitro transcription allows linear amplification of the cDNA, thereby minimizing amplification biases (Hashimshony et al., 2012Hashimshony T. Wagner F. Sher N. Yanai I. CEL-Seq: single-cell RNA-Seq by multiplexed linear amplification.Cell Reports. 2012; 2: 666-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). We then prepared RNA-seq libraries, sequenced ∼30 million reads per embryo (50 bp paired-end), and mapped sequences to the zebrafish transcriptome (see Experimental Procedures). We detected ∼23,000 different genes, with ∼12,000 genes observed at more than four reads in at least two sections. We termed this procedure “tomo-seq” (the ancient Greek word “τóμoς” (tomos) means “slice” or “section”). Because the tomo-seq protocol generates libraries primed from polyA tails of transcripts, it is possible to identify exact 3′ transcript boundaries if sequencing reads are sufficiently long to reach into the polyA regions of the library (Figure S1E). Sequencing of pooled tomo-seq libraries at 250 bp read length allowed us to substantially improve annotation of 3′ UTRs in zebrafish (see Extended Experimental Procedures; Figure S1F–S1H; Data S1). By using these improved gene annotations, we ensured that a maximum number of sequencing reads could be mapped to the transcriptome. In addition to section-specific barcodes encoding spatial information, we used primers for reverse transcription that also contained a random barcode of 4 bp length, allowing for 44 = 256 different combinations. For sequencing reads mapping to the same gene, the random barcode reveals whether the reads are derived from the same molecule or from different molecules, based on whether or not the random barcode is identical (Grün et al., 2014Grün D. Kester L. van Oudenaarden A. Validation of noise models for single-cell transcriptomics.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, Kivioja et al., 2012Kivioja T.

Methods. 2012; 9: 72-74Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Comparing the number of different random barcodes to the number of reads per gene and section, we found that the complexity of our sequencing library was high, and we were not exhausting the library (Figure 1C), suggesting that additional lowly expressed genes might be detected at higher sequencing depth. We next evaluated the reproducibility of the tomo-seq technique across biological replicates. For two embryos at the 15 somites stage that were sectioned into ∼100 slices in opposite directions—one from head to tail, the other from tail to head—the Pearson correlation across all genes (summed over all sections) was >0.99 (Figure 1D), demonstrating excellent reliability of the protocol. To assess the ability of the tomo-seq protocol to determine spatial expression patterns, we then filtered the “head-to-tail” and “tail-to-head” data sets for genes exhibiting a spatially restricted peak of gene expression at any position along the anteroposterior axis. Cross-correlation of the head-to-tail and tail-to-head traces for all these genes revealed that peak positions aligned extremely well, indicating that tomo-seq allows reproducible detection of spatial expression patterns on the genome-wide scale (Figure 1E). Manual inspection of two marker genes expressed exclusively in the head or tail, six3a (Seo et al., 1998Seo H.C. Drivenes Ellingsen S. Fjose A. Expression of two zebrafish homologues of the murine Six3 gene demarcates the initial eye primordia.Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and cdx4 (Kudoh et al., 2001Kudoh T. Tsang M. Hukriede N.A. Chen X. Dedekian M. Clarke C.J. Kiang A. Schultz S. Epstein J.A. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. A gene expression screen in zebrafish embryogenesis.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), further confirmed the reproducibility and precision of our protocol (Figure 1F). We then proceeded to explore the ability of our method to identify different patterns of spatially-restricted gene expression by comparing our data to published expression patterns based on in situ hybridization data, sourced from the ZFIN expression database (Bradford et al., 2011Bradford Y. Conlin T. Dunn N. Fashena D. Frazer K. Howe D.G. Knight J. Mani P. Martin R. Moxon S.A.T. et al.ZFIN: enhancements and updates to the Zebrafish Model Organism Database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D822-D829Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We found that tomo-seq correctly identified the expression patterns of selected genes (Figure S2A). Importantly, even intricate patterns such as the two stripes of egr2b (krox20) located in rhombomeres 3 and 5 were resolved correctly (Figure 2A), demonstrating the high spatial resolution of our approach. However, it is important to note that the resolution of tomo-seq is determined by section thickness, placing limits on our ability to resolve small structures such as individual somites (Figure S2B). In summary, tomo-seq allows detection of a wide range of spatial expression patterns on the genome-wide level. The full data set is provided in Table S2.Figure 2Tomo-Seq Determines Gene Expression Patterns with High Spatial ResolutionShow full caption(A) Expression trace for egr2b in tail-to-head sample.(B) Tomo-seq data for posterior end of an 18 somites stage embryo sequenced at higher depth.

Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for limb skeleton formation but regulate digit number and identity.Nature. 2002; 418: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We next aimed to examine the resolution limits of our approach by comparing genes with very similar expression patterns. For this purpose, we removed the yolk, straightened and sectioned the posterior end of an embryo at the 18 somites stage, which we then sequenced at ∼10-fold higher depth compared to the previous samples. We selected mesp genes, which are expressed in the most newly-formed somites (Cutty et al., 2012Cutty S.J. Fior R. Henriques P.M. Saúde L. Wardle F.C. Identification and expression analysis of two novel members of the Mesp family in zebrafish.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2012; 56: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), as a test case for resolving subtle expression differences. Our data identify a strong peak for both mespaa and mespab corresponding to high expression in the newest-formed somite. Interestingly, tomo-seq further identified a small secondary peak posterior to the main peak for mespaa, but not for mespab (Figure 2Bi). We were able to confirm this predicted variation in expression domains between the two genes by traditional in situ hybridization (Figure 2Bii). This example clearly demonstrates the ability of the tomo-seq technique to resolve gene expression patterns with high sensitivity and great precision. To explore whether tomo-seq can be applied to different model organisms and isolated organs, we decided to investigate gene expression patterns in mouse forelimbs at E10.5. At this stage, expression of Shh in the posterior forelimb establishes a hedgehog signaling gradient along the AP axis (Litingtung et al., 2002Litingtung Y. Dahn R.D. Li Y. Fallon J.F. Chiang C. Shh and Gli3 are dispensable for limb skeleton formation but regulate digit number and identity.Nature. 2002; 418: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We found that tomo-seq correctly reproduced spatial expression patterns of hedgehog targets and pathway components (Figure 2C). Importantly, even relatively subtle expression changes in Gli3−/− forelimbs were detected reliably, suggesting that tomo-seq enables spatially resolved differential expression analysis. One important advantage of our approach is that spatially resolved data are immediately available in a quantitative format, without the need for additional processing steps. As a consequence, tomo-seq data can be easily searched for genes that satisfy any desired spatial expression criteria, such as for example all genes that are coexpressed with a known marker for a specific organ or cell type. To explore this feature, we ranked all genes at the 15 somites stage by similarity to mespab. As a measure for expression pattern similarity, we calculated the Euclidean distance of Z score transformed expression traces. Figure 3A shows the expression trace for mespab as well as the 10 genes with most similar expression patterns, demonstrating that our approach can correctly identify the most similar patterns in the data set. Importantly, we noticed that expression patterns were gradually becoming more dissimilar to mespab as we descended the ranked list of similar genes. dmrt2a, the tenth most similar gene, was already expressed in a clearly different pattern, its expression forming a gradient with highest levels found in the tailbud, in contrast to the single somite domain observed for mespab. Ranking all genes by similarity to dmrt2a, we found that the top ten most similar genes showed significantly broader expression patterns (Figure 3B), indicating that our measure for pattern similarity is sensitive even to minor differences in gene expression patterns. The lists of genes with expression most similar to mespab and dmrt2a consisted of genes with known and unknown expression patterns. We therefore decided to validate tomo-seq measurements for selected genes similar to mespab (Figure 3C) and dmrt2a (Figure S3) by in situ hybridization. In situ results agreed very well with the sequencing data and even minor features such as more posterior expansion of pcdh8 and tbx6 expression compared to mespab were distinguished correctly (Figure 3C). Expression patterns of the uncharacterized genes si:ch211-105d18.8, si:rp71-36n21.1 and CU633857.1 were also detected correctly (Figure S3), proving that tomo-seq allows identification of novel genes with spatially patterned expression. We next aimed to investigate global patterns of gene expression in our data set. To this purpose, we calculated the Pearson correlation across all genes for each pair of sections (Figure 4A). As expected, adjacent slices were generally more correlated than sections that are spaced far apart. Interestingly, however, we observed three blocks of contiguous sections that were positively correlated among each other. The spatial positions roughly corresponded to the head, the trunk and the tail of the zebrafish embryo. We also found that more genes exhibited expression peaks inside the blocks than in the transition zone (Figure 4A, left panel), suggesting that the three blocks are defined by a limited number of genes that exhibit maximal expression in either the head, the trunk or the tail. To further analyze the global spatial structure of gene expression in the zebrafish embryo, we computed a t-SNE map (“t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding”) for all genes that have an expression peak (Figure S4A). t-SNE maps project high-dimensional data onto a 2D surface while retaining distance information between individual objects (Amir et al., 2013Amir A.D. Davis K.L. Tadmor M.D. Simonds E.F. Levine J.H. Bendall S.C. Shenfeld D.K. Krishnaswamy S. Nolan G.P.

Res. 2008; 9: 2579-2605Google Scholar). We found that genes peaking at similar spatial positions were grouped closely together in the t-SNE map, validating relative peak position as a measure for expression pattern similarity.Figure S4Large Clusters of Genes with Similar Expression Patterns Reveal Complex Substructure, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Euclidean-distance based t-SNE map of all genes that pass expression threshold and peak calling criterion.

To further understand global gene expression patterns, we focused on all genes exhibiting an expression peak (∼20% of the genes that were detected at greater than four reads in greater than one section). K-means clustering of genes identified three main clusters with expression maxima in the head, the trunk, and the tail, respectively (Figure 4B). Gap statistics suggested that three clusters captured most of the expression patterns (Tibshirani and Walther, 2006Tibshirani R. Walther G. Estimating the number of clusters in a data set via the gap statistic.J. R. Statist. Soc B. 2006; 63 (1–1411–4233)Google Scholar) (Figure S4B). However, a continued increase of the gap value at higher cluster numbers suggested that the 3 main clusters might contain a finer substructure. Hierarchical clustering of the three main clusters indeed revealed considerable diversity of patterns within all three clusters, most notably in the head (Figure S4D). Based on assignment of marker genes to subclusters we were able to identify different anatomical structures such as forebrain, heart, somites and tail bud. The groups of genes that are specifically expressed in these organs are listed in"

Genetic deletion of VEGFR2 in neurons caused misdirected angiogenesis toward neurons, resulting in abnormally increased vascular density around neurons. Further genetic experiments revealed that this misdirected angiogenesis was attributable to an excessive amount of VEGF protein around neurons caused by insufficient engulfment of VEGF by VEGFR2-deficient neurons. Moreover, absence of neuronal VEGFR2 caused misdirected regenerative angiogenesis in ischemic retinopathy.

VEGFR2, a critical endothelial receptor for VEGF, was more abundantly expressed in retinal neurons than in endothelial cells, including endothelial tip cells. Genetic deletion of VEGFR2 in neurons caused misdirected angiogenesis toward neurons, resulting in abnormally increased vascular density around neurons. Further genetic experiments revealed that this misdirected angiogenesis was attributable to an excessive amount of VEGF protein around neurons caused by insufficient engulfment of VEGF by VEGFR2-deficient neurons. Moreover, absence of neuronal VEGFR2 caused misdirected regenerative angiogenesis in ischemic retinopathy. Thus, this study revealed neurovascular crosstalk and unprecedented cellular regulation of VEGF: retinal neurons titrate VEGF to limit neuronal vascularization. The vascular and nervous systems are two major networks that run throughout the bodies of mammalians. They are highly interactive in both physiological (Mukouyama et al., 2002Mukouyama Y.S. Shin D.

The retina, a part of the central nervous system, is postnatally vascularized basically through sprouting angiogenesis (Dorrell et al., 2002Dorrell M.I. Aguilar E. Friedlander M.

During the first week of life in rodents, the retinal vasculature grows along the ganglion cell layer (GCL), the innermost surface of the retina forming the superficial vascular plexus, but does not grow into the area where neurons and neuronal progenitors exist (i.e., neuroretina). Afterward, the deep and intermediate vascular plexuses are serially formed, and three vascular plexuses are completed ∼3 weeks after birth (Milde et al., 2013Milde F. Lauw S. Koumoutsakos P.

Within the GCL, astrocytes form a mesh before the vascular growth and guide angiogenic growth by providing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and extracellular matrices (Dorrell et al., 2002Dorrell M.I.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the astrocytic template holds the vasculature in the GCL and keeps it from growing into the neuroretina. However, pharmacological or genetic ablation of astrocytes does not cause abnormal growth of blood vessels into the neuroretina (Gerhardt et al., 2003Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C.

Here, we identified a noncanonical neurovascular interaction in eye development and disease; neurons titrate VEGF to determine the direction of angiogenesis, ensuring an appropriate level of vascular supply. Several reports have suggested that VEGFR2 is expressed in some neuronal cells in the retina (Yang and Cepko, 1996Yang X. Cepko C.L.

Med. 2011; 208: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but its details remain ambiguous. Therefore, we examined the expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 in retinas using recently developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mice (Ishitobi et al., 2010Ishitobi H. Matsumoto K. Azami T. Itoh F. Itoh S. Takahashi S. Ema M. Flk1-GFP BAC Tg mice: an animal model for the study of blood vessel development.Exp.

Study of normal and pathological blood vessel morphogenesis in Flt1-tdsRed BAC Tg mice.Genesis. 2012; 50: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although VEGFR1 was restricted to endothelial cells, VEGFR2 was abundantly expressed in the neuroretina, even more strongly than in endothelial cells including tip cells (Gerhardt et al., 2003Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. VEGF guides angiogenic sprouting utilizing endothelial tip cell filopodia.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) that lead angiogenic outgrowth (Figures 1A–1L). VEGFR2 expression was undetected in both astrocytes and macrophages (Figures S1A–S1F available online). This expression pattern was consistent with that observed in Vegfr2+/EGFP knockin mice (Ema et al., 2006Ema M. Yokomizo T. Wakamatsu A. Terunuma T. Yamamoto M. Takahashi S. Primitive erythropoiesis from mesodermal precursors expressing VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, Tie2, endoglin, and CD34 in the mouse embryo.Blood. 2006; 108: 4018-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although fewer neuronal cells were labeled in those mice (Figures S1G–S1J). In other tissues, both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were expressed only in endothelial cells, except for the unexpected VEGFR2 expression in lung Clara cells (Figure 1M). In this regard, Bellon et al., 2010Bellon A. Luchino J. Haigh K. Rougon G. Haigh J. Chauvet S. Mann F. VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk1) signaling mediates axon growth in response to semaphorin 3E in the developing brain.Neuron. 2010; 66: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar showed slight VEGFR2 expression in brain neurons by immunohistochemistry. It is likely that the VEGFR2 expression in brain neurons is under the level we could detect in VEGFR2-BAC-EGFP mice. Sectioned specimens showed that VEGFR2 was abundant throughout the neuroretina during the first week after birth, but gradually decreased as postnatal (P) development continued (Figures 1N–1U). Costaining with various markers indicated that the minor population of VEGFR2-positive cells at P13 was Müller cells (Figures S1K–S1N). This temporal transition of VEGFR2 expression in the neuroretina was similarly detected in Vegfr2+/LacZ knockin mice (Shalaby et al., 1997Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J. A requirement for Flk1 in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis.Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) (Figures 1V–1Y) as well as in the VEGFR2 immunohistochemical analysis (Figures S1O–S1R). Next, we explored the regulatory mechanism for the neuroretinal Vegfr2 expression that diminishes after the neonatal period. We recently reported an enhancer of Vegfr2, the distal-multipotent-mesodermal-enhancer (DMME), which contains Gata-, Cdx-, Tcf/Lef-, ER71/Etv2-, and Fox-binding sites (Ishitobi et al., 2011Ishitobi H. Wakamatsu A. Liu F. Azami T. Hamada M. Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Kobayashi M. Choi K. Nishikawa S. et al.Molecular basis for Flk1 expression in hemato-cardiovascular progenitors in the mouse.Development. 2011; 138: 5357-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The DMME is active in hemangioblasts and cardiovascular progenitors, but not in endothelial cells. In the DMME-GFP reporter mice, the DMME was active in the neuroretina of neonates (Figures 1Z and 1AA) but not in stages after P7 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that VEGFR2 is strongly expressed in the neuroretina when the neuronal area is avascular.Figure S1Expression Pattern of VEGFR2 in Developing Retina, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–F) Whole-mount staining of the retina from Vegfr2-BAC-EGFP+ mice at P6.

To determine the function of VEGFR2 in the neuroretina, we crossed Vegfr2-flox mice with Pax6α-Cre mice (Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F.

The resultant conditional knockout mice (Pax6α-Cre+Vegfr2flox/flox: Vegfr2Δneuro mice) showed ragged and caved edges in their vascular fronts, accompanied by persistent hyaloid vessels and a slight delay in the radial growth compared to that in control mice (Pax6α-Cre-Vegfr2flox/flox) (Figures 2A, 2E, and 2N ). A striking abnormality was observed in the 3D direction of the vascular growth. At P6, Vegfr2Δneuro mice showed abundant vertical branching into the neuroblastic layer, and this was absent in control mice (Figures 2A–2N and S2C–S2F). These vertical branches in Vegfr2Δneuro mice had a normal morphology similar to that observed in VEGF-guided sprouting vessels utilizing tip cell filopodia (Gerhardt et al., 2003Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. VEGF guides angiogenic sprouting utilizing endothelial tip cell filopodia.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) (Figures 2H and 2K) and different from the pathologically aberrant invaginations observed in adult mice with a very low density lipoprotein receptor deficiency (Dorrell et al., 2009Dorrell M.I.

Invest. 2009; 119: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Comparable numbers of total endothelial cells quantified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis suggested that the defect in Vegfr2Δneuro mice is misdirected vascular growth rather than additional angiogenesis (Figure S2G). In a later stage at P9, when control mice had just started to form vertical branches, deep and intermediate plexuses were already formed in Vegfr2Δneuro mice (Figures 2O–2T). At P28, vessel branching in intermediate and deep plexuses was remarkably increased in Vegfr2Δneuro mice (Figure S2H-P). Deletion of Vegfr2 in endothelial cells (VEcad-CreERT2+Vegfr2flox/lox; Vegfr2iΔEC) severely impaired the radial vascular growth but did not lead to sprouting misdirected into the neuroretina (Figures 2U–2X). In addition, a myeloid-specific Vegfr2 deletion (Vav1-iCre+Vegfr2flox/lox; Vegfr2Δmyeloid) using Vav1-iCre (de Boer et al., 2003de Boer J. Williams A. Skavdis G. Harker N. Coles M. Tolaini M.

VEGFR2 functions as a neurotrophic factor for brain neurons in pathologies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lambrechts et al., 2003Lambrechts D. Storkebaum E. Morimoto M. Del-Favero J.

Indeed, we detected phosphorylated VEGFR2 (pVEGFR2) proteins at P3 in the peripheral half of retinal tissues, which largely consist of neurons and completely lack vascular structure (Figure S3A). Considering these data, we hypothesized that the vascular phenotype in Vegfr2Δneuro mice is a secondary effect in degenerated retinal neurons. However, to our surprise, immunohistochemical analysis in the retinas of Vegfr2Δneuro mice indicated no detectable abnormalities in neuronal thickness, morphology, proliferation, or survival (Figures 3A–3I, 3N–3P , and S3B–S3L), suggesting that other neurotrophic factors masked the effect of VEGFR2 in vivo. Conversely, Vegfr2iΔEC showed decreased retinal thickness, particularly in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (Figures S3C, S3F, S3I, S3K, and S3L), likely due to an insufficient vascular supply to the neuroretina. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the vertical sprouts in Vegfr2Δneuro mice extended between normal ganglion cells (Figures 3J–3M). Retinal vascularization is guided by astrocytes (Gerhardt et al., 2003Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C.

https://openalex.org/W1971926341,"Recently, it was reported that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) was the long-sought ""betatrophin"" that could control pancreatic beta cell proliferation. However, studies of Angptl8(?/?) mice revealed profound reduction of triglyceride levels, but no abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. We now report that Angptl8(?/?) mice undergo entirely normal beta cell expansion in response to insulin resistance resulting from either a high-fat diet or from the administration of the insulin receptor antagonist S961. Furthermore, overexpression of ANGPTL8 in livers of mice doubles plasma triglyceride levels, but does not alter beta cell expansion nor glucose metabolism. These data indicate that ANGPTL8 does not play a role in controlling beta cell growth, nor can it be given to induce such expansion. The findings that plasma triglyceride levels are reduced by Angptl8 deletion and increased following ANGPTL8 overexpression support the possibility that inhibition of ANGPTL8 represents a therapeutic strategy for hypertriglyceridemia."
https://openalex.org/W2171819173,"During eukaryotic translation initiation, initiator tRNA does not insert fully into the P decoding site on the 40S ribosomal subunit. This conformation (POUT) is compatible with scanning mRNA for the AUG start codon. Base pairing with AUG is thought to promote isomerization to a more stable conformation (PIN) that arrests scanning and promotes dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit. Here, we present a cryoEM reconstruction of a yeast preinitiation complex at 4.0 Å resolution with initiator tRNA in the PIN state, prior to eIF1 release. The structure reveals stabilization of the codon-anticodon duplex by the N-terminal tail of eIF1A, changes in the structure of eIF1 likely instrumental in its subsequent release, and changes in the conformation of eIF2. The mRNA traverses the entire mRNA cleft and makes connections to the regulatory domain of eIF2?, eIF1A, and ribosomal elements that allow recognition of context nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon."
https://openalex.org/W2052588581,"The challenges which the large scale microalgal industry is facing are associated with the high cost of key operations such as harvesting, nutrient supply and oil extraction. The high-energy input for harvesting makes current commercial microalgal biodiesel production economically unfeasible and can account for up to 50% of the total cost of biofuel production. Co-cultivation of fungal and microalgal cells is getting increasing attention because of high efficiency of bio-flocculation of microalgal cells with no requirement for added chemicals and low energy inputs. Moreover, some fungal and microalgal strains are well known for their exceptional ability to purify wastewater, generating biomass that represents a renewable and sustainable feedstock for biofuel production. We have screened the flocculation efficiency of the filamentous fungus A. fumigatus against 11 microalgae representing freshwater, marine, small (5 µm), large (over 300 µm), heterotrophic, photoautotrophic, motile and non-motile strains. Some of the strains are commercially used for biofuel production. Lipid production and composition were analysed in fungal-algal pellets grown on media containing alternative carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources contained in wheat straw and swine wastewater, respectively. Co-cultivation of algae and A. fumigatus cells showed additive and synergistic effects on biomass production, lipid yield and wastewater bioremediation efficiency. Analysis of fungal-algal pellet's fatty acids composition suggested that it can be tailored and optimised through co-cultivating different algae and fungi without the need for genetic modification."

Much progress has been made in understanding the biology of aging, yet the mechanism that underlies many age-associated human diseases, such as cancer, remains poorly understood. While the majority of aging research focuses on cell/tissue autonomous mechanisms, chronic systemic inflammation in elderly humans, as revealed by elevated circulating proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), suggests that deterioration of one tissue could lead to disease manifestation in another (Ahmad et al., 2009Ahmad A.

Indeed aging of immune organs, immunosenescence, is suspected to cause systemic inflammation and age-associated diseases (Day, 2010Day M.J. Ageing, immunosenescence and inflammageing in the dog and cat.J. Comp. Pathol. 2010; 142: S60-S69Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Franceschi et al., 2000Franceschi C. Bonafè M. Valensin S.

Sci. 2000; 908: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3139) Google Scholar). However, the cell and molecular mechanisms that underlie the cause of immunosenescence upon aging and how immunosenescence leads to diseases are not understood. It is known that circulating inflammatory cytokines can lead to NF-κB activation in cells, but such activation may either promote or limit tumorigenesis, depending on specific tumors and their tissue environment (Chen and Castranova, 2007Chen F. Castranova V. Nuclear factor-kappaB, an unappreciated tumor suppressor.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11093-11098Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I.

Therefore, to define the mechanism by which aging promotes immunosenescence and disease, it is critical to identify which aging immune organs promote systemic inflammation and how the circulating inflammatory cytokines affect the homeostasis of other tissues in the body. However, due to the complexity of organs, immune systems, and cell types, it is very challenging to decipher the cause and consequence of immunosenescence using vertebrates as model organisms. Fortunately, simpler organisms such as Drosophila exhibit similar age-associated increase in tissue dysfunction and inflammation as those observed in mammals. Old Drosophila intestines exhibit increased proliferation and inappropriate differentiation of the intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which leads to gut hyperplasia, leakage, and animal death (Biteau et al., 2008Biteau B.

Although Drosophila lacks an adaptive immunity, it has two main innate immune response pathways, called Toll and IMD (De Gregorio et al., 2002De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M.

Regulators of the Toll and Imd pathways in the Drosophila innate immune response.Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), respectively. Upon microbial infection, both Toll and IMD pathways are strongly activated in the fat body, a major immune organ in Drosophila that is equivalent to mammalian fat and liver. This activation leads to enhanced secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and PGRPs into the hemolymph (De Gregorio et al., 2002De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, Hoffmann and Reichhart, 2002Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Drosophila innate immunity: an evolutionary perspective.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The circulating hemolymph (equivalent to human blood) and hemocytes (equivalent to human blood cells) in turn generates a systemic inflammatory response to aid in the killing of invading microbes. Therefore, the parallels of age-associated increase of immune response and tissue dysfunction make Drosophila an ideal model to investigate the cause and consequence of immunosenescence and systemic inflammation. The antimicrobial function of several secreted PGRPs, such as PGRP-SCs and PGRP-LB, is based on their amidase activities that degrade microbial peptidoglycans. The reduction of peptidoglycans not only limits microbial growth but also decreases the amount of bacterial surface ligands that can activate the membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors such as PGRP-LC. Since PGRP-LC activation leads to upregulation of IMD pathway and inflammation, these secreted PGRPs have been recognized as both positive antimicrobial effectors and negative regulators of IMD signaling pathway (Bischoff et al., 2006Bischoff V. Vignal C. Duvic B. Boneca I.G. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J.

Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the local intestinal IMD activity plays a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis in Drosophila. Gut IMD activity functions to inhibit excessive ISC proliferation and maintains gut homeostasis (Buchon et al., 2009bBuchon N. Broderick N.A. Poidevin M. Pradervand S. Lemaitre B.

We reasoned that increased systemic inflammation in old flies could alter the local IMD activity in the gut, thereby leading to the age-associated gut hyperplasia. By analyzing age-associated changes in Drosophila fat body and midgut, we demonstrate that lamin-B loss in fat body cells leads to chronic systemic inflammation. The fat body-secreted PGRPs contribute to the downregulation of intestinal IMD activity and hyperplasia. Our findings have important implications in deciphering immunosenescence and its role in systemic inflammation and age-associated diseases in mammals. To understand whether systemic inflammation affects local tissue immune response, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on dissected fat bodies and midguts (Figure 1A) from wild-type 5-day-old and 50-day-old flies. Compared to young flies, the expression of more than 2,000 genes was altered by ≥2-fold in the old organs (Tables S1 and S2; GEO, GSE62580). Many genes involved in immune response were strongly upregulated in old fat bodies, but these genes were significant downregulation in aged midguts (Figure 1B and Figures S1A, and S1B, and Table S3; GEO, GSE62580). Thus, old Drosophila may exhibit systemic inflammation, while the midgut local immune response becomes repressed. We confirmed that both IMD regulators (PGRP-LC, receptor for IMD signaling; kenny, KEY, equivalent to mammalian IKKγ; and Relish, REL, equivalent to mammalian NFκB) and IMD effectors were upregulated in aged fat bodies (Figures 1C, 1E, 1F, S1C and S1D). However, only the IMD downstream effectors were consistently downregulated in old midguts (Figures 1D, 1G, 1H, S1E and S1F). The up- and downregulation of the IMD signaling in aged fat body and midgut were further demonstrated by the increased or decreased nuclear REL accumulation, respectively, in the two organs compared to that of the young (Figures 1I–1L).Figure S1Age-Associated Fat Body Activation of IMD Signaling May Cause Repression of Local IMD Signaling in the Midgut, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Gene Ontology (GO, by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7) analyses of up- or downregulated (≥2-fold) genes upon aging (50-day versus 5-day-old flies) in fat body (A) or midgut (B), respectively.

Error bars, SEM, based on three independent experiments. ∧p > 0.05, Student’s t tests. To test whether the derepressed PGRPs in fat body could lead to IMD downregulation in the aged midgut, we used different tissue-specific Gal4 lines to drive the repression of PGRPs. Depletion of REL or codepletion of PGRP-LB plus PGRP-SC2 in fat bodies using Cg-Gal4 or r4-Gal4 (Figures S1G and S7D–S7I), but not in adult hemocytes using Hml.Δ-Gal4 or Pxn-Gal4 (Figures S1G and S7M–S7O), caused midgut IMD upregulation as revealed by the nuclear accumulation of REL (compare Figures 1M and 1N to 1L) and Dpt upregulation in the 50-day-old midguts (Figures S1H–S1J). Thus systemic inflammation of the old fat body can inhibit the midgut IMD activity via PGRPs. Previous studies show that age-associated midgut hyperplasia is caused by increased ISC proliferation and inappropriate differentiation as determined by the increased number of esg-GFP (escargot-GFP)+ cells that are ISCs, EBs, or misdifferentiated EBs (Biteau et al., 2008Biteau B.

Although inflammation is suspected as one of the culprits for hyperplasia in Drosophila midgut and human gastrointestinal system, whether it is the systemic or local inflammatory pathways that contribute to the disruption of tissue homeostasis remains unclear in either organism. Interestingly, reduction of midgut IMD activity has been shown to cause midgut hyperplasia (Buchon et al., 2009bBuchon N. Broderick N.A. Poidevin M. Pradervand S. Lemaitre B.

However, a recent study reports that it is the activation of gut IMD that leads to its hyperplasia in old flies (Guo et al., 2014aGuo L. Karpac J. Tran S.L. Jasper H.

The degree of midgut hyperplasia was determined using esg-GFP reporter (esgCB02017-GFP).

S-nitrosylases can use NO synthase (NOS)-derived NO to modify selected cysteines in target proteins. Despite proteomic identification of over a thousand S-nitrosylated proteins, few S-nitrosylases have been identified. Moreover, mechanisms underlying site-selective S-nitrosylation and the potential role of specific sequence motifs remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a stimulus-inducible, heterotrimeric S-nitrosylase complex consisting of inducible NOS (iNOS), S100A8, and S100A9. S100A9 exhibits transnitrosylase activity, shuttling NO from iNOS to the target protein, whereas S100A8 and S100A9 coordinately direct site selection. A family of proteins S-nitrosylated by iNOS-S100A8/A9 were revealed by proteomic analysis. A conserved I/L-X-C-X2-D/E motif was necessary and sufficient for iNOS-S100A8/A9-mediated S-nitrosylation. These results reveal an elusive parallel between protein S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation, namely, stimulus-dependent posttranslational modification of selected targets by primary sequence motif recognition."

Our studies illustrate how an interneuron in a simple organism encodes multiple behavioral outputs at the circuit, synaptic, and molecular levels. How the nervous system and genes generate behavior is one of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience. Unlike the human brain with billions of neurons, lower organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, crustaceans, mollusks, and zebrafish possess a much smaller nervous system and are therefore widely used as models to study the neural and genetic control of behavior. Although equipped with a small nervous system, these model organisms are capable of performing a diverse range of complex behaviors, many of which are analogous to those manifested by humans (Berkowitz et al., 2010Berkowitz A.

This suggests that neurons in these organisms may not all be specialized and some may regulate multiple behavioral outputs (Berkowitz et al., 2010Berkowitz A. Roberts A. Soffe S.R.

Interestingly, this phenomenon is not restricted to simple model organisms, as many neurons in the mammalian brain, especially in the cortex, also have multifunctional properties (Jankowska, 2001Jankowska E.

Brain Res. 1996; 76: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, how single neurons encode multiple behavioral outputs is not well understood. As the nematode C. elegans represents the only organism whose connectome has been reconstructed by electron microscopy, it has emerged as a popular model for dissecting the neural and genetic basis of behavior at the single neuron resolution (de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M. Maricq A.V. Neuronal substrates of complex behaviors in C. elegans.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 451-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). C. elegans has a very small nervous system with merely 302 neurons. Despite this simplicity, worms execute a broad spectrum of behaviors, ranging from motor and sensory behaviors to the more complex mating, social, sleep, and drug-dependent behaviors, as well as associative learning and memory (de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M.

This large repertoire of complex behaviors places a high demand on the functionality of the worm nervous system. As such, many worm neurons are thought to be multifunctional (Bargmann, 2012Bargmann C.I. Beyond the connectome: how neuromodulators shape neural circuits.BioEssays. 2012; 34: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, de Bono and Maricq, 2005de Bono M. Maricq A.V. Neuronal substrates of complex behaviors in C. elegans.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 451-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This notion, however, provokes some intriguing questions. First, what are the circuit and synaptic mechanisms by which single neurons encode multiple behavioral outputs? Additionally, similar to many types of synapses in mammalian sensory organs, most, if not all, C. elegans synapses are believed to be graded; yet some worm behavioral outputs are manifested in an all-or-none digital-like fashion (Bargmann and Marder, 2013Bargmann C.I. Marder E. From the connectome to brain function.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Goodman et al., 1998Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R.

USA. 2009; 106: 10823-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This raises the question: how could graded synapses encode digital-like behavioral outputs? Here, we investigated these questions in C. elegans using a multifaceted approach by integrating calcium imaging, optogenetics, molecular genetics, laser ablation, and electrophysiology at the single neuron resolution. By characterizing a model interneuron AIY that regulates both analog- and digital-like behavioral outputs, we show that at the circuit level, one strategy for a neuron to control multiple behavioral outputs is to recruit multiple downstream circuits with each regulating a specific behavioral output. At the synaptic level, we show that worm synapses display distinct dynamic ranges, which contributes to their ability to encode both analog- and digital-like behavioral outputs. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that the biophysical properties of postsynaptic receptors contribute to the distinct dynamic ranges of the synapses. These results reveal a mechanism by which graded C. elegans synapses encode both analog- and digital-like behavioral outputs. Our studies define the circuit, synaptic, and molecular mechanisms by which an interneuron encodes multiple behavioral outputs in a genetic model organism. We focused on locomotion behavior, one of the most prominent behaviors in C. elegans (Piggott et al., 2011Piggott B.J. Liu J. Feng Z. Wescott S.A. Xu X.Z.S.

Locomotion forms the foundation of most, if not all worm behaviors (e.g., motor, sensory, social, mating, sleep, etc.), as these behaviors are, to varying degrees, all manifested at the locomotion level. During locomotion, worms spend most of their time moving forward and occasionally change locomotion direction by switching to backward movement (reversal) (Piggott et al., 2011Piggott B.J. Liu J.

We recorded locomotion behavior using an automated worm tracking system (Feng et al., 2006Feng Z. Li W. Ward A. Piggott B.J. Larkspur E.R. Sternberg P.W. Xu X.Z.S. A C. elegans model of nicotine-dependent behavior: regulation by TRP-family channels.Cell. 2006; 127: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and quantified two simple parameters: speed and reversal initiation. These two parameters represent two distinct motor outputs, with the former reporting the overall activity of locomotion and the latter describing the direction-switch of locomotion. They also bear another distinction in that speed is intrinsically an analog-like parameter, whereas reversal occurs in an all-or-none fashion and thus represents a digital-like output. As a first step, we sought to identify a neuron that regulates these two behavioral outputs. This would offer us an opportunity to dissect the mechanisms underlying encoding of two distinct behavioral outputs by one neuron. Interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in controlling locomotion, particularly spontaneous locomotion (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M. Hill J.J. Bargmann C.I. A circuit for navigation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3184-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Based on the wiring diagram, they are organized in a hierarchy-like pattern and send outputs to motor neurons that drive locomotion (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M. Hill J.J. Bargmann C.I. A circuit for navigation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3184-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We focused our initial attention on the 1st layer interneurons (i.e., AIA, AIB, AIZ, and AIY), as they remain at the very top of the interneuron circuitry (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M. Hill J.J. Bargmann C.I. A circuit for navigation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3184-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Laser ablation of these four interneurons all affected reversal frequency (Figure 1B), consistent with previous reports (Chalasani et al., 2007Chalasani S.H. Chronis N. Tsunozaki M. Gray J.M.

Hobert O. Functional mapping of neurons that control locomotory behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 178-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Among them, AIY is particularly interesting, as loss of AIY led to a significant defect in both locomotion speed and reversal frequency (Figures 1B and 1C). Specifically, ablation of AIY reduced the speed of locomotion while increasing the frequency of reversals (Figures 1B and 1C). This suggests that while AIY promotes locomotion speed, it also suppresses the initiation of reversals. Thus, AIY likely regulates both locomotion speed and direction-switch. If AIY regulates both speed and direction-switch as suggested by laser ablation, acute interrogation of AIY activity should affect both behavioral outputs. To test this, we took an optogenetic approach by expressing ChR2 and NpHR specifically in AIY as a transgene (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Transient inhibition of AIY activity by NpHR triggered reversals and suppressed locomotion speed (Figure 1D and Figures S1A and S1B available online), while activation of AIY by ChR2 suppressed the initiation of spontaneous reversals and stimulated locomotion speed (Figures 1D–1F). Prolonged optogenetic inhibition and stimulation of AIY also promoted and suppressed the initiation of spontaneous reversals, respectively (Figure S1C). The optogenetic data are more robust than those from laser ablation, probably because optogenetics tests the acute effects while laser ablation reports the chronic outcome, in which case animals may develop compensatory and adaptive mechanisms. Nevertheless, these two types of data together strongly suggest that AIY regulates both locomotion speed and direction-switch. While the data from both laser ablation and optogenetic interrogation strongly support a role for AIY in regulating locomotion speed and direction-switch, both approaches relied on the manipulation of AIY function and thus may not necessarily reveal exactly how AIY acts under native conditions. If AIY truly modulates locomotion speed and direction-switch, then the activity of AIY should correlate with these two behavioral outputs during locomotion. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded the activity of AIY and locomotion behavior in freely behaving worms using our calcium ratiometric imaging of behaving nematodes (CARIBN) system (Piggott et al., 2011Piggott B.J. Liu J. Feng Z. Wescott S.A. Xu X.Z.S. The neural circuits and synaptic mechanisms underlying motor initiation in C. elegans.Cell. 2011; 147: 922-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Notably, the calcium transients in AIY paralleled the speed of forward locomotion of the animal (Figure 2A; Movie S1). In addition, when the animal switched to backward movement (reversal), we observed a sharp decrease in AIY calcium level (Figures 2A and S2; Movie S1). This suggests that the activity of AIY may correlate with both locomotion speed and direction-switch. Indeed, cross-correlation analysis revealed that AIY activity nicely correlated with forward locomotion speed (but not backward speed) (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, cross-correlogram detected a strong correlation between the activity of AIY and the initiation of reversals (Figure 2D). Thus, the activity pattern of AIY appears to correlate with both locomotion speed and direction-switch, further supporting that AIY regulates these two motor outputs.Figure S2AIY Calcium Level Begins to Decline before the Initiation of Reversals, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe segments in calcium and velocity traces surrounding reversal events were analyzed.

The dotted line in red marks the time point at which animals initiate reversals. The average calcium level in AIY begins to decline at ∼1 s before the initiation of reversals. Shades along the traces represent error bars (SEM). n = 36. Then how does AIY regulate locomotion speed and direction-switch? To approach this question, we set out to identify the neurons that act downstream of AIY to regulate these two behavioral outputs. Based on the wiring diagram, AIZ, RIA, and RIB are the primary downstream interneurons to which AIY sends synaptic outputs (Figure 3A). We thus ablated AIZ, RIA, and RIB and assayed whether and how this operation may affect the ability of AIY to regulate locomotion speed and direction-switch. We first examined direction-switch. Laser ablation of AIZ, but not RIA or RIB, abolished the ability of AIY (NpHR) to trigger reversals (Figure 3B). Thus, AIZ is required for AIY to regulate direction-switch, suggesting that AIZ acts downstream of AIY. Additional evidence came from spontaneous locomotion behavior: while ablation of AIY led to an increase in reversal frequency, simultaneous ablation of AIZ and AIY fully suppressed this hyperreversal phenotype (Figure 3C), further suggesting that AIZ acts downstream of AIY. If AIZ acts downstream of AIY, this neuron should also regulate direction-switch. The observation that laser ablation of AIZ reduced reversal frequency is consistent with this view (Figure 3C). This data also suggests that AIZ promotes direction-switch. To provide further evidence, we optogenetically interrogated the role of AIZ in direction-switch by expressing ChR2 and NpHR as a transgene specifically in AIZ. Stimulation of AIZ by ChR2 triggered reversals (Figure 3D), while inhibition of AIZ by NpHR did not and instead suppressed spontaneous reversal frequency (Figure 3E), suggesting that AIZ promotes direction-switch. Notably, inhibition of AIZ by NpHR did not affect locomotion speed (Figures 3F and 3G), revealing a specific role for AIZ in regulating direction-switch. Thus, both laser ablation and optogenetic studies support that AIZ promotes direction-switch. To obtain further evidence supporting a role for AIZ in direction-switch, we imaged the activity of AIZ in freely behaving worms using the CARIBN system. We found that AIZ increased its activity when worms initiated reversals (Figure 3H). Interestingly, though AIZ activity tightly correlated with reversal initiation (Figure 3I), no strong correlation was found between AIZ activity and locomotion speed (Figure 3J), providing further support for a specific role for AIZ in regulating direction-switch. Unlike AIY, AIZ did not display much activity beyond reversals (Figure 3H), suggesting that AIZ probably received inhibitory inputs and thereby remained at a rather inactive or low activity state during most time periods (also see below). This imaging data, together with those from laser ablation and optogenetics, strongly suggests that AIZ regulates direction-switch. The above results suggest a model in which AIY controls direction-switch by forming a circuit with the downstream interneuron AIZ. The fact that AIY suppresses direction-switch but AIZ promotes it suggests that AIY may regulate this behavioral output by inhibiting AIZ. In this case, the nature of the circuit formed by AIY and AIZ would be inhibitory. If so, inhibition of AIY should suppress AIY’s inhibitory output to AIZ, which would result in stimulation of AIZ, leading to reversal initiation. To test this model, we recorded the activity of AIZ in response to optogenetic inhibition of AIY in freely behaving worms using the CARIBN system. NpHR inhibition of AIY activated AIZ (Figures 3K and 3L), indicating that AIY inhibited AIZ and disinhibition of AIY promoted reversals. This also supports the prediction that the synaptic connection formed between AIY and AIZ is inhibitory. Interestingly, ChR2 stimulation of AIY did not elicit a notable effect on AIZ activity (Figures 3M and 3N), revealing a nonlinearity of the AIY-AIZ synapse (also see below). Together, our results support the model that AIY regulates direction-switch by forming an inhibitory circuit with the downstream interneuron AIZ (Figure 3O). We next sought to identify the neurons that act downstream of AIY to regulate locomotion speed. Laser ablation of RIB, but not AIZ or RIA, abolished the ability of AIY (ChR2) to promote locomotion speed (Figures 4A and 4B ), indicating that RIB is required for AIY to regulate locomotion speed. As was the case with AIY, ablation of RIB also reduced locomotion speed, and double ablation of AIY and RIB did not exhibit an additive effect (Figure 4C), consistent with the notion that AIY and RIB act in the same pathway to modulate locomotion speed. Notably, laser ablation of RIB does not have a major effect on reversal frequency (Gray et al., 2005Gray J.M. Hill J.J. Bargmann C.I. A circuit for navigation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3184-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RIB regulates locomotion speed by acting downstream of AIY. The observation that ablation of RIB reduced locomotion speed suggests that RIB acts to promote locomotion speed. To further test this, we optogenetically interrogated the role of RIB in locomotion speed by expressing ChR2 and NpHR as a transgene specifically in this neuron. ChR2 stimulation of RIB increased locomotion speed (Figures 4D and 4E), while NpHR inhibition of RIB reduced it (Figures 4F and 4G), providing additional evidence that RIB promotes locomotion speed. By contrast, neither NpHR inhibition nor ChR2 stimulation of RIB triggered reversals (Figure 4H), suggesting a specific role for RIB in modulating locomotion speed. Thus, both laser ablation and optogenetic data suggest that RIB promotes locomotion speed. To provide further evidence, we imaged the activity of RIB in freely behaving worms using the CARIBN system. RIB activity paralleled locomotion speed (Figure 4I). Cross-correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between RIB activity and forward locomotion speed (but not backward speed) (Figures 4J and 4K). Thus, data from calcium imaging, laser ablation and optogenetics all support a role for RIB in promoting locomotion speed. The above results point to a model that AIY regulates locomotion speed by forming a circuit with the downstream interneuron RIB. The fact that both AIY and RIB promote locomotion speed suggest that the AIY-RIB circuit is likely excitatory and that AIY may promote locomotion speed by stimulating RIB. To test this model, we recorded the activity of RIB in response to optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of AIY in freely behaving worms using the CARIBN system. ChR2 stimulation of AIY promoted RIB activity (Figures 4L and 4M), while NpHR inhibition of AIY suppressed it (Figures 4N and 4O). Thus, AIY promotes locomotion speed by forming an excitatory circuit with RIB (Figure 4P). Taken together, our data suggest a model in which AIY regulates direction-switch and locomotion speed by forming two separate downstream circuits: the AIY-AIZ circuit is inhibitory and regulates direction-switch, while the AIY-RIB circuit is excitatory and modulates locomotion speed (Figure 5K). Having identified a circuit mechanism by which AIY encodes two distinct behavioral outputs, we then set out to characterize the underlying synaptic mechanisms. We first explored the presynaptic side, asking what neurotransmitter in AIY is critical for controlling direction-switch and locomotion speed. AIY is a cholinergic neuron (Alfonso et al., 1993Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.P. Rand J.B. The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-17 gene: a putative vesicular acetylcholine transporter.Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether and how blockade of ACh release from AIY would affect these two behavioral outputs. cha-1 encodes the sole C. elegans choline acetyltransferase essential for ACh synthesis (Alfonso et al., 1993Alfonso A. Grundahl K. Duerr J.S. Han H.P. Rand J.B. The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-17 gene: a putative vesicular acetylcholine transporter.Science. 1993; 261: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As cha-1 is expressed in dozens of neurons and cha-1 mutant worms are severely paralyzed, we were unable to directly assay locomotion behavior in mutant worms. We thus took an RNAi approach by introducing a transgene expressing cha-1 RNAi specifically in AIY (Figures S3C and S3D). RNAi of cha-1 in AIY blunted the ability of AIY inhibition (by NpHR) to trigger reversals (Figure 5A) and also suppressed the effect of AIY stimulation (by ChR2) on promoting locomotion speed (Figures 5B and 5C). Furthermore, RNAi of cha-1 in AIY increased reversal frequency and also reduced locomotion speed (Figures S3A and S3B), an effect similar to that observed in AIY-ablated worms (Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, cha-1 appears to be required in AIY to control direction-switch and locomotion speed, supporting ACh as a key neurotransmitter in AIY for regulating these two behavioral outputs. To provide further evidence, we recorded AIY-evoked postsynaptic responses in AIZ and RIB by calcium imaging using the CARIBN system. RNAi of cha-1 in AIY greatly diminished the postsynaptic calcium response in RIB triggered by AIY (AIY::ChR2) (Figures 5F and 5G). A similar result was obtained with the postsynaptic calcium response in AIZ evoked by AIY (AIY::NpHR) (Figures 5I and 5J). Thus, both behavioral and functional imaging data support ACh as a key neurotransmitter in both the AIY-AIZ and AIY-RIB circuits. We next sought to identify the postsynaptic ACh receptors expressed in AIZ and RIB. We first searched for candidate receptors in RIB. Our observation that the AIY-RIB synapse is excitatory suggests that the postsynaptic ACh receptor in RIB is probably a cation channel such as nAChR. Two major groups of nAChRs were identified in C. elegans: the levamisole-type nAChRs represented by UNC-29 and UNC-38 and the nicotine-type nAChRs such as ACR-16 (Francis et al., 2005Francis M.M.

https://openalex.org/W1974126704,"Nuclear RNAi is an important regulator of transcription and epigenetic modification, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Using a genome-wide approach in the fission yeast S. pombe, we have found that Dcr1, but not other components of the canonical RNAi pathway, promotes the release of Pol II from the 3? end of highly transcribed genes, and, surprisingly, from antisense transcription of rRNA and tRNA genes, which are normally transcribed by Pol I and Pol III. These Dcr1-terminated loci correspond to sites of replication stress and DNA damage, likely resulting from transcription-replication collisions. At the rDNA loci, release of Pol II facilitates DNA replication and prevents homologous recombination, which would otherwise lead to loss of rDNA repeats especially during meiosis. Our results reveal a novel role for Dcr1-mediated transcription termination in genome maintenance and may account for widespread regulation of genome stability by nuclear RNAi in higher eukaryotes."

Here, we report X-ray and electron microscopy (EM) structures of yeast dynein bound to different ATP analogs, which collectively provide insight into the roles of dynein's two major ATPase sites, AAA1 and AAA3, in the conformational change mechanism. ATP binding to AAA1 triggers a cascade of conformational changes that propagate to all six AAA domains and cause a large movement of the ""linker,"" dynein's mechanical element. In contrast to the role of AAA1 in driving motility, nucleotide transitions in AAA3 gate the transmission of conformational changes between AAA1 and the linker, suggesting that AAA3 acts as a regulatory switch. Further structural and mutational studies also uncover a role for the linker in regulating the catalytic cycle of AAA1. Together, these results reveal how dynein's two major ATP-binding sites initiate and modulate conformational changes in the motor domain during motility."
https://openalex.org/W2091084179,"Many cancers express mutant p53 proteins that have lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and, in many cases, have acquired oncogenic functions that can contribute to tumor progression. These activities of mutant p53 reflect interactions with several other proteins, including the p53 family members p63 and p73. Mutations in p53 that affect protein conformation (such as R175H) show strong binding to p63 and p73, whereas p53 mutants that only mildly affect the conformation (such as R273H) bind less well. A previously described aggregation domain of mutant p53 is not required for p63 or p73 binding; indeed, mutations within this region lead to the acquisition of a mutant p53 phenotype-including a conformational shift, p63/p73 binding and the ability to promote invasion. The activity of wild-type p53 is regulated by an interaction with MDM2 and we have investigated the potential role of MDM2 in the mutant p53/p63/p73 interactions. Both mutant p53 and p73 bind MDM2 well, whereas p63 binds much more weakly. We found that MDM2 can inhibit p63 binding to p53R175H but enhances the weaker p53R273H/p73 interaction. These effects on the interactions are reflected in an ability of MDM2 to relieve the inhibition of p63 by p53R175H, but enhance the inhibition of p73 activity by p53R175H and R273H. We propose a model in which MDM2 competes with p63 for binding to p53R175H to restore p63 activity, but forms a trimeric complex with p73 and p53R273H to more strongly inhibit p73 function."
https://openalex.org/W1978174791,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are currently investigated for a variety of therapeutic applications. However, MSCs isolated from primary tissue cannot meet clinical grade needs and should be expanded in vitro for several passages. Although hMSCs show low possibility for undergoing oncogenic transformation, they do, similar to other somatic cells, undergo cellular senescence and their therapeutic potential is diminished when cultured in vitro. However, the role of senescent MSCs in tumor progression remains largely elusive. In the current study, by establishing senescent human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (s-UCMSCs) through the replicative senescence model and genotoxic stress induced premature senescence model, we show that s-UCMSCs significantly stimulate proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor progression in a co-transplant xenograft mouse model compared with 'young' counterparts (defined as MSCs at passage 5, in contrast to senescent MSCs at passage 45). In addition, we identified IL-6, a known pleiotropic cytokine, as a principal mediator for the tumor-promoting activity of s-UCMSCs by induction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Depletion of IL-6 from s-UCMSCs conditioned medium partially abrogated the stimulatory effect of s-UCMSCs on the proliferation and migration of breast tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984987102,"Summary The Ca 2+ -free form of calmodulin (apoCaM) often appears inert, modulating target molecules only upon conversion to its Ca 2+ -bound form. This schema has appeared to govern voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, where apoCaM has been considered a dormant Ca 2+ sensor, associated with channels but awaiting the binding of Ca 2+ ions before inhibiting channel opening to provide vital feedback inhibition. Using single-molecule measurements of channels and chemical dimerization to elevate apoCaM, we find that apoCaM binding on its own markedly upregulates opening, rivaling the strongest forms of modulation. Upon Ca 2+ binding to this CaM, inhibition may simply reverse the initial upregulation. As RNA-edited and -spliced channel variants show different affinities for apoCaM, the apoCaM-dependent control mechanisms may underlie the functional diversity of these variants and explain an elongation of neuronal action potentials by apoCaM. More broadly, voltage-gated Na channels adopt this same modulatory principle. ApoCaM thus imparts potent and pervasive ion-channel regulation. PaperClip"
https://openalex.org/W1988996356,"Protein loop modeling is a tool for predicting protein local structures of particular interest, providing opportunities for applications involving protein structure prediction and de novo protein design. Until recently, the majority of loop modeling methods have been developed and tested by reconstructing loops in frameworks of experimentally resolved structures. In many practical applications, however, the protein loops to be modeled are located in inaccurate structural environments. These include loops in model structures, low-resolution experimental structures, or experimental structures of different functional forms. Accordingly, discrepancies in the accuracy of the structural environment assumed in development of the method and that in practical applications present additional challenges to modern loop modeling methods. This study demonstrates a new strategy for employing a hybrid energy function combining physics-based and knowledge-based components to help tackle this challenge. The hybrid energy function is designed to combine the strengths of each energy component, simultaneously maintaining accurate loop structure prediction in a high-resolution framework structure and tolerating minor environmental errors in low-resolution structures. A loop modeling method based on global optimization of this new energy function is tested on loop targets situated in different levels of environmental errors, ranging from experimental structures to structures perturbed in backbone as well as side chains and template-based model structures. The new method performs comparably to force field-based approaches in loop reconstruction in crystal structures and better in loop prediction in inaccurate framework structures. This result suggests that higher-accuracy predictions would be possible for a broader range of applications. The web server for this method is available at http://galaxy.seoklab.org/loop with the PS2 option for the scoring function."

Therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for high blood pressure in children with NAFLD. Methods Cohort study performed by the NIDDK NASH Clinical Research Network. There were 484 children with NAFLD ages 2 to 17 at enrollment; 382 children were assessed both at enrollment and 48 weeks afterwards. The main outcomes were high blood pressure at baseline and persistent high blood pressure at both baseline and 48 weeks. Results Prevalence of high blood pressure at baseline was 35.8% and prevalence of persistent high blood pressure was 21.4%. Children with high blood pressure were significantly more likely to have worse steatosis than children without high blood pressure (mild 19.8% vs. 34.2%, moderate 35.0% vs. 30.7%, severe 45.2% vs. 35.1%; P = 0.003). Higher body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and uric acid were independent risk factors for high blood pressure (Odds Ratios: 1.10 per kg/m2, 1.09 per 10 mg/dL, 1.25 per mg/dL, respectively). Compared to boys, girls with NAFLD were significantly more likely to have persistent high blood pressure (28.4% vs.18.9%; P = 0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, NAFLD is a common clinical problem that places children at substantial risk for high blood pressure, which may often go undiagnosed. Thus blood pressure evaluation, control, and monitoring should be an integral component of the clinical management of children with NAFLD."

Similarly, cardiac muscle (CM)-specific Plin5 overexpression (CM-Plin5) leads to severe triglyceride (TG) accumulation in cardiomyocytes via impairing TG breakdown. Interestingly, cardiac steatosis due to overexpression of Plin5 is compatible with normal heart function and life span indicating a more moderate impact of Plin5 overexpression on cardiac lipolysis and energy metabolism. We hypothesized that cardiac Plin5 overexpression does not constantly impair cardiac lipolysis. In line with this assumption, TG levels decreased in CM of fasted compared with nonfasted CM-Plin5 mice indicating that fasting may lead to a diminished barrier function of Plin5. Recent studies demonstrated that Plin5 is phosphorylated, and activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to phosphorylation of Plin5, suggesting that Plin5 is a substrate for PKA. Furthermore, any significance of Plin5 phosphorylation by PKA in the regulation of TG mobilization from lipid droplets (LDs) is unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2057680108,"Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)-associated breast cancers are mostly basal-like high-grade ductal carcinomas that frequently overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Aberrant EGFR expression is correlated with disease progression, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and poor clinical prognosis. Although BRCA1 is involved in multiple cellular processes, its functional role in EGFR regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we report a previously unrecognized posttranscriptional mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates EGFR expression through the induction of miR-146a. We demonstrate that EGFR expression correlates negatively with BRCA1, whereas miR-146a levels increase with BRCA1. We show that BRCA1 binds to MIR146A promoter and activates transcription, which in turn attenuates EGFR expression. Knockdown of miR-146a in BRCA1-overexpressing cells negated this effect and suppressed its ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. In archived triple-negative breast cancer samples, we show a strong positive correlation between BRCA1 and miR-146a expression. We also show that low expression of miR-146a strongly predicts positive lymph node status and is associated with distinctively poor overall survival of patients. Together, these observations provide an insight into a novel BRCA1→miR-146a→EGFR paradigm by which BRCA1 carries out an aspect of tumor suppressor function that is potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2152230410,"In winter 2009/10, a sudden under-ice bloom of heterotrophic bacteria occurred in the seasonally ice-covered, temperate, deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany). Extraordinarily high bacterial abundance and biomass were fueled by the breakdown of a massive bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae after ice formation. A reduction in light resulting from snow coverage exerted a pronounced physiological stress on the cyanobacteria. Consequently, these were rapidly colonized, leading to a sudden proliferation of attached and subsequently of free-living heterotrophic bacteria. Total bacterial protein production reached 201 µg C L−1 d−1, ca. five times higher than spring-peak values that year. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at high temporal resolution showed pronounced changes in bacterial community structure coinciding with changes in the physiology of the cyanobacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that during breakdown of the cyanobacterial population, the diversity of attached and free-living bacterial communities were reduced to a few dominant families. Some of these were not detectable during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom indicating that only specific, well adapted bacterial communities can colonize senescent cyanobacteria. Our study suggests that in winter, unlike commonly postulated, carbon rather than temperature is the limiting factor for bacterial growth. Frequent phytoplankton blooms in ice-covered systems highlight the need for year-round studies of aquatic ecosystems including the winter season to correctly understand element and energy cycling through aquatic food webs, particularly the microbial loop. On a global scale, such knowledge is required to determine climate change induced alterations in carbon budgets in polar and temperate aquatic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2041837383,"ArcLight, a genetically encoded fluorescent protein voltage probe with a large ΔF/ΔV, is a fusion between the voltage sensing domain of the Ciona instestinalis voltage sensitive phosphatase and super ecliptic pHluorin carrying a single mutation (A227D in the fluorescent protein). Without this mutation the probe produces only a very small change in fluorescence in response to voltage deflections (∼1%). The large signal afforded by this mutation allows optical detection of action potentials and sub-threshold electrical events in single-trials in vitro and in vivo. However, it is unclear how this single mutation produces a probe with such a large modulation of its fluorescence output with changes in membrane potential. In this study, we identified which residues in super ecliptic pHluorin (vs eGFP) are critical for the ArcLight response, as a similarly constructed probe based on eGFP also exhibits large response amplitude if it carries these critical residues. We found that D147 is responsible for determining the pH sensitivity of the fluorescent protein used in these probes but by itself does not result in a voltage probe with a large signal. We also provide evidence that the voltage dependent signal of ArcLight is not simply sensing environmental pH changes. A two-photon polarization microscopy study showed that ArcLight's response to changes in membrane potential includes a reorientation of the super ecliptic pHluorin. We also explored different changes including modification of linker length, deletion of non-essential amino acids in the super ecliptic pHluorin, adding a farnesylation site, using tandem fluorescent proteins and other pH sensitive fluorescent proteins."

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, has a significant role in this process. Natural medicinal products such as Withaferin A (WA) and Celastrol (Cel) have shown anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties that can be attributed to multiple mechanisms including, but not limited to, apoptosis induction due to the inhibition of proteasomal activities. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TNF-α in combination with WA or Cel in vitro in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. TNF-α, when combined with WA or Cel, activated caspase-3 and -9 and downregulated XIAP in a dose-dependent manner, leading to induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can polarize to two distinct phenotypes. The M1 phenotype is activated by IFN-γ and bacterial products, and displays an inflammatory profile, while M2 macrophages are activated by IL-4 and tend to be anti-inflammatory or immunosupressive. It was observed that DnaK from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has immunosuppressive properties, inducing a tolerogenic phenotype in dendritic cells and MDSCs, contributing to graft acceptance and tumor growth. However, its role in macrophage polarization remains to be elucidated. We asked whether DnaK was able to modulate macrophage phenotype. Murine macrophages, derived from bone marrow, or from the peritoneum, were incubated with DnaK and their phenotype compared to M1 or M2 polarized macrophages. Treatment with DnaK leads macrophages to present higher arginase I activity, IL-10 production and FIZZ1 and Ym1 expression. Furthermore, DnaK increased surface levels of CD206. Importantly, DnaK-treated macrophages were able to promote tumor growth in an allogeneic melanoma model. Our results suggest that DnaK polarizes macrophages to the M2-like phenotype and could constitute a virulence factor and is an important immunomodulator of macrophage responses."
https://openalex.org/W2047332524,"The E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the E3 ubiquitin ligases Rad18 and Rnf8 promote homologous recombination (HR)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair by enhancing polymerization of the Rad51 recombinase at γ-ray-induced DSB sites. To analyze functional interactions between the three enzymes, we created RAD18(-/-), RNF8(-/-), RAD18(-/-)/RNF8(-/-) and UBC13(-/-)clones in chicken DT40 cells. To assess the capability of HR, we measured the cellular sensitivity to camptothecin (topoisomerase I poison) and olaparib (poly(ADP ribose)polymerase inhibitor) because these chemotherapeutic agents induce DSBs during DNA replication, which are repaired exclusively by HR. RAD18(-/-), RNF8(-/-) and RAD18(-/-)/RNF8(-/-) clones showed very similar levels of hypersensitivity, indicating that Rad18 and Rnf8 operate in the same pathway in the promotion of HR. Although these three mutants show less prominent defects in the formation of Rad51 foci than UBC13(-/-)cells, they are more sensitive to camptothecin and olaparib than UBC13(-/-)cells. Thus, Rad18 and Rnf8 promote HR-dependent repair in a manner distinct from Ubc13. Remarkably, deletion of Ku70, a protein essential for nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) significantly restored tolerance of RAD18(-/-) and RNF8(-/-) cells to camptothecin and olaparib without affecting Rad51 focus formation. Thus, in cellular tolerance to the chemotherapeutic agents, the two enzymes collaboratively promote DSB repair by HR by suppressing the toxic effect of NHEJ on HR rather than enhancing Rad51 focus formation. In contrast, following exposure to γ-rays, RAD18(-/-), RNF8(-/-), RAD18(-/-)/RNF8(-/-) and UBC13(-/-)cells showed close correlation between cellular survival and Rad51 focus formation at DSB sites. In summary, the current study reveals that Rad18 and Rnf8 facilitate HR by two distinct mechanisms: suppression of the toxic effect of NHEJ on HR during DNA replication and the promotion of Rad51 focus formation at radiotherapy-induced DSB sites."
https://openalex.org/W2044446688,"Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1), a negative regulator of deacetylase SIRT1, has been shown to act as an estrogen receptor α (ER) coactivator that has a key role in ER transcription complex assembly and estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation. However, little is known about its physiological role and mechanism of action in ER-negative breast cancer cells. Here we report that DBC1 functions as a coactivator for the oncogenic ETS transcription factor PEA3 to promote ER-negative breast cancer progression. DBC1 is required for the expression of PEA3 target genes and for recruitment of PEA3 and RNA polymerase II to PEA3 target promoters. We also demonstrated that acetylation of PEA3 stimulates its DNA binding and association with DBC1 by disrupting the intramolecular interaction of PEA3. The molecular mechanism underlying DBC1 function in PEA3-mediated transcription involves inhibition of SIRT1 interaction with PEA3 and of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of PEA3. Moreover, DBC1 depletion inhibited the tumorigenic properties of ER-negative breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, increased DBC1 expression correlated with shorter relapse-free survival of ER-negative breast cancer patients. Our results firmly established DBC1 as a critical coactivator of PEA3 and as a key player in PEA3-mediated breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2056785137,"Most studies that have evaluated the association between anti-diabetic medication and cancer risk have suffered from methodological drawbacks. To avoid time-related biases, we evaluated the effect of treatment duration on the cancer risk among naive users of anti-diabetic medication as compared to non-users. In addition, we addressed the influence of common risk factors such as smoking and BMI. The study population comprised 23,394 participants of FINRISK surveys. Data on cancer and anti-diabetic medication were linked with the study cohorts. We applied Lexis tabulation to the data and analyzed split records by using Poisson regression. Changes in cancer incidence in relation to treatment duration were examined by modeling the rate ratio (RR). After a median follow-up of 9 years, 53 cancer cases among users of anti-diabetic medication and 1,028 among non-users were diagnosed. No significant difference in cancer risk between users and non-users was observed after adjustment. The RR for all medication regardless of its duration was 1.01 [95% CI 0.75-1.33], and 1.37 [0.94-1.94] for period of 1-4 years. The results were similar for metformin, sulfonylurea, and insulin. This study demonstrates that evaluation of the variation in cancer risk in relation to treatment duration is of particular importance for enhancing the accuracy of conclusions on the link between exposure to anti-diabetic medication and cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2119496604,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a highly posttranslationally modified protein present in several tissues where it is implicated in numerous physiological processes. OPN primarily exerts its functions through interaction with integrins via the Arg-Gly-Asp and Ser-Val-Val-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg sequences located in the N-terminal part of the protein. OPN can be polymerized by the cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and polymerization has been shown to enhance the biological activity of OPN. However, little is known about the reactivity and location of the glutamine and lysine residues involved in the TG2-mediated modification of OPN. Here we show that TG2 catalyses the incorporation of 5-(Biotinamido)pentylamine at glutamines in both the N- and C-terminal parts of OPN, whereas TG2 primarily incorporated the glutamine-donor peptide biotinyl-TVQQEL-OH into the C-terminal part of OPN. By mass spectrometric analyses we identified Gln34, Gln42, Gln193 and Gln248 as the major TG2 reactive glutamines in OPN. The distribution of reactive Gln and Lys residues in OPN proved to be important, as the full-length protein but not the physiologically highly active integrin-binding N-terminal part of OPN were able to polymerize in a TG2-mediated reaction. Collectively, these data provide important new molecular knowledge about the mechanism of OPN polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2038829125,"Valerian is widely used as a traditional medicine to improve the quality of sleep due to interaction of several active components with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor (GABA(A)R) system. Recently, activation of GABA signaling in stem cells has been reported to suppress cell cycle progression in vivo. Furthermore, possible inhibitory effects of GABA(A)R agonists on hepatocarcinogenesis have been reported. The present study was performed to investigate modulating effects of Valerian on hepatocarcinogenesis using a medium-term rat liver bioassay. Male F344 rats were treated with one of the most powerful Valerian species (Valeriana sitchensis) at doses of 0, 50, 500 and 5000 ppm in their drinking water after initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis with diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Formation of glutathione S-transferase placental form positive (GST-P+) foci was significantly inhibited by Valerian at all applied doses compared with DEN initiation control rats. Generation of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in the rat liver was significantly suppressed by all doses of Valerian, likely due to suppression of Nrf2, CYP7A1 and induction of catalase expression. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited, while apoptosis was induced in areas of GST-P+ foci of Valerian groups associated with suppression of c-myc, Mafb, cyclin D1 and induction of p21Waf1/Cip1, p53 and Bax mRNA expression. Interestingly, expression of the GABA(A)R alpha 1 subunit was observed in GST-P+ foci of DEN control rats, with significant elevation associated with Valerian treatment. These results indicate that Valerian exhibits inhibitory effects on rat hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting oxidative DNA damage, suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in GST-P+ foci by activating GABA(A)R-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1987080119,"Cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 1 (Cks1) is a critical rate-limiting component of the Skp1-Cullin1-Skp2 (SCF(Skp2)) ubiquitin ligase that controls cell cycle inhibitor abundance. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors (CKIs) regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, regeneration after cytotoxic stress and tumor cell proliferation. We thus studied the role of Cks1 in HSC and in a prototypic stem cell disorder, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cks1 transcript was highly expressed in Lin-Sca-1+Kit+ (LSK) HSC, and the loss resulted in accumulation of the SCF(Skp2)/Cks1 substrates p21, p27, p57 and p130 particularly in CD150+ LSK cells. This accumulation correlated with decreased proliferation and accumulation of Cks1(-/-) HSC, slower regeneration after stress and prolonged HSC quiescence. At the hematopoietic progenitor (HPC) level, loss of Cks1 sensitized towards apoptosis. In CML, Cks1 expression was increased, and treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, reduced Cks1 expression. Also, we found that Cks1 is critical for Bcr-Abl-induced cytokine-independent clonogenic activity. In conclusion, our study presents a novel function of Cks1 in maintaining HSC/HPC homeostasis and shows that Cks1 is a possible target in therapies aimed at the SCF(Skp2)/Cks1 complex that controls CKI abundance and cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1969429773,"Rationale The family of natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), exert important and diverse actions for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B). As the ligands and receptors each contain disulfide bonds, a regulatory role for the cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was investigated. Objective We utilized complementary in vitro and in vivo models to determine the potential role of PDI in regulating the ability of the NPs to generate its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Methods and Results Inhibition of PDI attenuated the ability of ANP, BNP and CNP to generate cGMP in human mesangial cells (HMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), each of which were shown to express PDI. In LLC-PK1 cells, where PDI expression was undetectable by immunoblotting, PDI inhibition had a minimal effect on cGMP generation. Addition of PDI to cultured LLC-PK1 cells increased intracellular cGMP generation mediated by ANP. Inhibition of PDI in vivo attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP by ANP. Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated modest and differential binding of the natriuretic peptides with immobilized PDI in a cell free system. However, PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion These data demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP through interaction with their receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2070908883,"The social identity approach makes a distinction between behavior motivated by intergroup versus interpersonal identities, which may be relevant to victim blaming in the case of rape. Using a mock jury paradigm, we examined the impact of defining rape as an act of interpersonal violence (personal assault) versus intergroup violence (a ""hate crime""), crossed with a manipulation describing the attacker as either an acquaintance or stranger. Defining rape in intergroup terms led to less victim blame than when it was defined in interpersonal terms, and participants blamed the victim more when she was assaulted by an acquaintance than a stranger."
https://openalex.org/W2165915252,"Intratumor heterogeneity caused by genetic, phenotypic or functional differences between cancer cell subpopulations is a considerable clinical challenge. Understanding subpopulation dynamics is therefore central for both optimization of existing therapy and for development of new treatment. The aim of this study was to isolate subpopulations from a primary tumor and by comparing molecular characteristics of these subpopulations, find explanations to their differing tumorigenicity. Cell subpopulations from two patient derived in vivo models of primary breast cancer, ER+ and ER-, were identified. EpCAM+ cells from the ER+ model gave rise to tumors independently of stroma cell support. The tumorigenic fraction was further divided based on SSEA-4 and CD24 expression. Both markers were expressed in ER+ breast cancer biopsies. FAC-sorted cells based on EpCAM, SSEA-4 and CD24 expression were subsequently tested for differences in functionality by in vivo tumorigenicity assay. Three out of four subpopulations of cells were tumorigenic and showed variable ability to recapitulate the marker expression of the original tumor. Whole genome expression analysis of the sorted populations disclosed high similarity in the transcriptional profiles between the tumorigenic populations. Comparing the non-tumorigenic vs the tumorigenic populations, 44 transcripts were, however, significantly differentially expressed. A subset of these, 26 identified and named genes, highly expressed in the non-tumorigenic population, predicted longer overall survival (N = 737, p<0.0001) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) (N = 1379, p<0.0001) when performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the GOBO online database. The 26 gene set correlated with longer DMFS in multiple breast cancer subgroups. Copy number profiling revealed no aberrations that could explain the observed differences in tumorigenicity. This study emphasizes the functional variability among cell populations that are otherwise genomically similar, and that the risk of breast cancer recurrence can only be eliminated if the tumorigenic abilities in multiple cancer cell subpopulations are inhibited."
