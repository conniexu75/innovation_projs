https://openalex.org/W1979610917,"Nonstoichiometric grains with depletions of magnesium and silicon (relative to oxygen) and inclusions of iron-nickel metal and iron-rich sulfides have been identified in interplanetary dust particles from comets. These chemical anomalies accumulate in grains exposed to ionizing radiation. The grains, known as GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides), were irradiated before the accretion of comets, and their inferred exposure ages, submicrometer sizes, and ""amorphous"" silicate structures are consistent with those of interstellar silicate grains. The measured compositional trends suggest that chemical (as well as isotopic) anomalies can be used to identify presolar interstellar components in primitive meteoritic materials."
https://openalex.org/W2073517977,"Some of the recently developed fast summation methods that have arisen in scientific computing are described. These methods require an amount of work proportional to N or N log N to evaluate all pairwise interactions in an ensemble of N particles. Traditional methods, by contrast, require an amount of work proportional to N(2). As a result, largescale simulations can be carried out using only modest computer resources. In combination with supercomputers, it is possible to address questions that were previously out of reach. Problems from diffusion, gravitation, and wave propagation are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2041663921,One-dimensional microcavities are optical resonators with coplanar reflectors separated by a distance on the order of the optical wavelength. Such structures quantize the energy of photons propagating along the optical axis of the cavity and thereby strongly modify the spontaneous emission properties of a photon-emitting medium inside a microcavity. This report concerns semiconductor light-emitting diodes with the photon-emitting active region of the light-emitting diodes placed inside a microcavity. These devices are shown to have strongly modified emission properties including experimental emission efficiencies that are higher by more than a factor of 5 and theoretical emission efficiencies that are higher by more than a factor of 10 than the emission efficiencies in conventional light-emitting diodes.
https://openalex.org/W2078878584,"The dating of landforms is crucial to understanding the evolution, history, and stability of landscapes. Cosmogenic isotope analysis has recently been used to determine quantitative exposure ages for previously undatable landform surfaces. A pioneering application of this technique to date moraines illustrated its considerable potential but suggested a chronology partially inconsistent with existing geological data. Consideration of the dynamic nature of landforms and of the ever-present processes of erosion, deposition, and weathering leads to a resolution of this inconsistency and, more generally, offers guidance for realistic interpretation of exposure ages."
https://openalex.org/W2064637804,"Network information systems reached the public consciousness this year as a result of the phenomenal growth in the use of the Internet. In particular, the software constituting NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) Mosaic and the World Wide Web have made global hypermedia a widespread reality for the first time. The technology underlying this software is described to explain the protocols behind information spaces. These include the historical predecessors, the current protocols with examples, future directions for the software, and discussion of research systems with different architectures. Reasons for its popularity are given, with the goal of illuminating successful services for the National Information Infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W2062282432,"The density of impact craters on large volcanoes on Venus is half the average crater density for the planet. The crater density on some classes of coronae is not significantly different from the global average density, but coronae with extensive associated volcanic deposits have lower crater densities. These results are inconsistent with both single-age and steady-state models for global resurfacing and suggest that volcanoes and coronae with associated volcanism have been active on Venus over the last 500 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2082133001,"The interplay of molecular weight, layer thickness, and thermal annealing in controlling molecular order in ultrathin Langmuir-Blodgett films is characterized with the use of polarization-modulation laser-scanning microscopy. The degree and direction of molecular alignment can be imaged rapidly and sensitively through the magnitude and orientation of linear dichroism in Langmuir-Blodgett films of rodlike poly(phthalocyaninatosiloxane) (PcPS). Images are presented for films as thin as two molecular layers ( approximately 44 angstroms). Molecular alignment along the transfer direction is much stronger for films of PcPS with approximately 25 repeat units ( approximately 10 nanometers long) than for those with approximately 50 repeat units ( approximately 20 nanometers long). Enhancement of alignment by thermal annealing is also much greater for PcPS-25 than PcPS-50. Intimate interaction with the substrate suppresses improvement in alignment by annealing, evident by an anomalously small increase in anisotropic absorption of the first two layers."

https://openalex.org/W2036953200,"Radio waves from the sun were detected 50 years ago, but the microwave detection of other single solar-type stars has remained a challenge. Here, the discovery of four solar-type radio stars is reported. These ""solar twin"" G stars are radio sources up to 3000 times stronger than the quiet sun. The microwaves most likely originate from a large number of relativistic electrons, possibly produced along with coronal heating, a process that is not understood. Two of the stars are younger than the sun and rotate more rapidly; the dynamo process in the stellar interior is therefore presumably more vigorous, resulting in enhanced coronal activity. One of the detections, however, is an old, metal-deficient G dwarf."
https://openalex.org/W2070494710,"This article describes experiments being performed to establish the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Described especially are experiments designed to establish the validity of one of two types of theories, phonon-based theories or spin-fluctuation theories. Evidence so far points to spin-fluctuation theories, but is not yet conclusive."

https://openalex.org/W2000832939,"Some scientists, among them cosmologist Stephen Hawking, argue that computer viruses are alive. A better case might be made for many of the self-replicating silicon-based creatures featured at the fourth Conference on Artificial Life, held on 5 to 8 July in Boston. Researchers from computer science, biology, and other disciplines presented computer programs that, among other things, evolved cooperative strategies in a selfish world and recreated themselves in ever more complex forms."
