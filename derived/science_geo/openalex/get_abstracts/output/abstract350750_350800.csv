https://openalex.org/W2035855774,"IN two instances, the distribution of isotopic carbon in the product of a metabolic process has been used to infer that a symmetrical intermediate compound is not involved. Wood et al.1 showed that isotopic carbon, introduced as carbon dioxide together with pyruvate, led to the formation of ketoglutarate which contained isotopic carbon only in the carboxy group next to the keto group; on these grounds, they excluded citrate as an intermediate. Sbemin2 found that when glycine is formed from serine, containing isotopic nitrogen and isotopic carbon in its carboxy group, the relative abundance of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 in the glycine was the same as in the serine; he argued that amino-malonic acid is therefore not an intermediate in this process."

Diabetes significantly impairs this process. Because hyperglycemia increases reactive oxygen species in a number of cell types, and because many of the defects responsible for impaired vasculogenesis involve HIF1-regulated genes, we hypothesized that HIF1 function is impaired in diabetes because of reactive oxygen species-induced modification of HIF1alpha by the glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) substrate methylglyoxal. Decreasing superoxide in diabetic mice by either transgenic expression of manganese superoxide dismutase or by administration of an superoxide dismutase mimetic corrected post-ischemic defects in neovascularization, oxygen delivery, and chemokine expression, and normalized tissue survival. In hypoxic fibroblasts cultured in high glucose, overexpression of GLO1 prevented reduced expression of both the EPC mobilizing chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and of vascular epidermal growth factor, which modulates growth and differentiation of recruited EPCs. In hypoxic EPCs cultured in high glucose, overexpression of GLO1 prevented reduced expression of both the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, an enzyme essential for EPC mobilization. HIF1alpha modification by methylglyoxal reduced heterodimer formation and HIF1alpha binding to all relevant promoters. These results provide a basis for the rational design of new therapeutics to normalize impaired ischemia-induced vasculogenesis in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2136131823,"Anandamide (AEA) is an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors and a well characterized mediator of many physiological processes including inflammation, pain, and appetite. The biosynthetic pathway(s) for anandamide and its N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE) congeners remain enigmatic. Previously, we proposed an enzymatic route for producing NAEs that involves the double-O-deacylation of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) by α/β-hydrolase 4 (ABDH4 or Abh4) to form glycerophospho (GP)-NAEs, followed by conversion of these intermediates to NAEs by an unidentified phosphodiesterase. Here, we report the detection and measurement of GP-NAEs, including the anandamide precursor glycerophospho-N-arachidonoylethanolamine (GP-NArE), as endogenous constituents of mouse brain tissue. Inhibition of the phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation of GP-NAEs ex vivo resulted in a striking accumulation of these lipids in brain extracts, suggesting a rapid endogenous flux through this pathway. Furthermore, we identify the glycerophosphodiesterase GDE1, also known as MIR16, as a broadly expressed membrane enzyme with robust GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity. Together, these data provide evidence for a multistep pathway for the production of anandamide in the nervous system by the sequential actions of Abh4 and GDE1.

In the ensuing decades, NAEs have been found in nearly all mammalian tissues and ascribed a number of bioactivities (2Bachur N.R. Masek K. Melmon K.L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1019-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies by Schmid and colleagues (3Natarajan V. Reddy P.V. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) first identified N-acylated phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) as markers of ischemic shock in brain and heart tissues and postulated that these lipids were the metabolic precursors of NAEs. In 1992, anandamide (N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine, NArE, AEA), was identified as an endogenous ligand for the brain (type I) cannabinoid receptor (4Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G.

The discovery of AEA as an endocannabinoid sparked renewed interest in NAE biochemistry and a search for pathways responsible for NAE biosynthesis and degradation. The integral membrane protein fatty acid amide hydrolase has been identified as the primary enzyme responsible for NAE degradation in most tissues, including brain (5Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K.

Despite these advances, a detailed understanding of the biosynthetic pathway(s) for NAEs has proven more elusive.

Substantial evidence implicates NAPEs as the key metabolic precursor for NAEs. NAPEs are formed by the calcium-dependent transfer of an acyl chain from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to the amine of phosphatidylethanolamine by an as-of-yet unidentified enzyme (8Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Arachidonoyl NAPE, which serves as the AEA precursor, is found at very low levels in brain tissue, consistent with the low abundance of arachidonate in the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (9Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently, a calcium-independent transacylase capable of generating NAPE from phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine was cloned, however, this protein displays markedly different properties from the brain enzyme that generates NAPEs (10Jin X.H. Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3614-3623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Release of NAEs from NAPEs was originally postulated to occur via a calcium-stimulated D-type phospholipase (PLD). In 2004, Ueda and colleagues isolated and identified an NAPE-selective PLD (NAPE-PLD) (11Okamoto Y. Morishita J. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Ueda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5298-5305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Mice with a disrupted NAPE-PLD gene (NAPE-PLD-/- mice) were found to exhibit dramatically reduced brain levels of long chain, saturated NAEs. In contrast, polyunsaturated NAEs, including AEA, were unaltered in these animals (12Leung A. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These results indicate that enzymes distinct from NAPE-PLD are involved in the biosynthesis of AEA in vivo. Consistent with this premise, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NAPE-PLD in RAW264.7 macrophages failed to alter AEA levels in these cells (13Liu J. Wang L. Harvey-White J. Osei-Hyiaman D. Razdan R. Gong Q. Chan A.C. Zhou Z. Huang B.X. Kim H.Y. Kunos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13345-13350Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). That NAPE-PLD does not appear to contribute to AEA biosynthesis, at least in certain cell and tissue types, necessitates the existence of alternative biosynthetic enzymes. Consistent with this premise, substantial rates of conversion of NAPE to NAE were observed in tissue extracts from NAPE-PLD-/- mice (12Leung A. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this residual activity was not due to another D-type phospholipase, but rather to a multienzyme cascade that involves the initial A/B-type phospholipase-catalyzed double O-deacylation of NAPEs to generate glycerophospho-(GP)-NAEs, followed by phosphodiesterase-catalyzed conversion of these intermediates to NAEs (Fig. 1). This pathway was further found to be inhibited by millimolar concentrations of calcium, which may explain why it had previously gone undetected in assays for NAPE-PLD activity that included high (2-10 mm) levels of exogenous calcium. Conventional protein chromatography coupled with activity-based proteomic analysis identified the hitherto unannotated enzyme α/β-hydrolase 4 (Abh4 or ABHD4) as a B-type NAPE lipase capable of removing both O-acyl chains from NAPE to yield GP-NAE (14Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26465-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that glycerophospho-N-arachidonoylethanolamine (GP-NArE) may be a physiologically relevant precursor of AEA and pointed to the GP-NAE phosphodiesterase as a critical final step leading to AEA release. However, to our knowledge, GP-NAEs have not previously been identified as natural brain constituents, nor has a phosphodiesterase capable of converting these lipids to NAEs been characterized. Herein, we describe the detection and measurement of GP-NAEs, including the AEA precursor GP-NArE, as endogenous brain constituents. We observe the enzymatic formation of endogenous GP-NAEs in ex vivo brain preparations and, moreover, we identify the integral membrane enzyme glycerophosphodiesterase 1 (GDE1) as a GP-NAE phosphodiesterase enriched in brain that is capable of generating NAEs, including AEA, in vitro. Materials—1-Oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Pentadecenoyl chloride, palmitoyl chloride, oleoyl chloride, arachidonoyl chloride, eicosanoyl chloride, and docosahexaenoyl chloride were purchased from NuCheck Prep (Elysian, MN). [1′-14C]Palmitic acid was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Methoxy arachidonoylfluorophosphonate (MAFP) was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Synthesis of GP-NAE standards and substrates was performed essentially as described (14Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26465-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, acid chlorides were reacted with an excess of 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and allowed to react for 1 h in CH2Cl2 with a catalytic amount of triethylamine. N-Acylated lipids were then purified by silica gel flash column chromatography. The resulting lyso-NAPE was stirred vigorously in CHCl3, MeOH, 2 n LiOH (2:1:1) for 4 h before acidification and purification via silica gel flash column chromatography. Brain-Lipid Preparation and Tandem MS Analysis of GP-NAE—8-Week-old male C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with 50% CO2 and killed by decapitation. Brains were removed within 30 s of decapitation and immediately frozen in liquid N2. Frozen brains were placed in a Dounce homogenizer with 8 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (2:1:1), and 200 pmol of 1,2-dihydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N-pentadecenoyl)ethanolamine was added as an internal standard. Mild basification of the aqueous layer was required to prevent the artifactual accumulation of GP-NAEs due to the non-enzymatic (acid-catalyzed) breakdown of sn-1 alkenyl lyso-NAPEs. Brains were immediately homogenized with 8-10 strokes of the pestle and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,400 × g to separate phases. The organic phase was extracted and an additional 4 ml of CHCl3 added to the remaining homogenate, which was vortexed, recentrifuged, and extracted again. The pooled organic phases were evaporated to dryness under N2 yielding ∼20-25 mg of lipid per brain. For the ex vivo analysis of GP-NAEs, brains were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm EDTA. 1.4 μl of 28 mm MAFP in Me2SO (for 20 μm final concentration) or Me2SO alone was added to homogenates immediately after homogenization. Samples were either extracted immediately or incubated at room temperature for 4 h with rotation prior to extraction and GP-NAE quantitation as described above. Lipid extracts were resuspended in 120 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) and 30 μl of the solution was injected into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with an Agilent 1100 autosampler. Samples were chromatographed on a Gemini 5-μm C18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a 50-min gradient from 0 to 100% buffer B followed by 7 min of isocratic flow with 100% buffer B. Buffer A consisted of MeOH:H2O (5:95) with 0.1% of 28% NH4OH and buffer B consisted of H2O:MeOH:iPrOH (5:35:60) with 0.1% of 28% NH4OH. Analysis was performed with an ESI source in the negative ionization mode with a source voltage of -3.5 kV, flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and capillary temperature of 325 °C. Care was taken to avoid carryover by running “blank” samples prior to all endogenous measurements. The method included a high-resolution full scan in the Orbitrap (operated at 30,000 resolution) followed by six fragmentation events in which fragment ions were analyzed in the ion trap and/or sent to the Orbitrap for high-resolution mass analysis depending on the experiment. Fragmentation events were chosen to detect palmitoyl-, oleoyl-, arachidonoyl-, eicosanoyl-, docosahexaenoyl-, and pentadecenoyl-GP-NAEs by targeting m/z values of 452, 478, 500, 508, 524, and 436, for MS/MS analysis, respectively. For quantitation, extracted ion chromatograms of the phospho-NAE peaks ([M - H-74]-) were integrated and compared with the internal N-C15:1 GP-NAE standard. Extractions using synthetic standards revealed extraction efficiencies of 3, 25, 45, 8, 18, and 77% for N-C15:1, C20:4, C22:6, C16:0, C18:1, and C20:0 GP-NAEs, respectively, and measurements of endogenous GP-NAEs were corrected accordingly. Subcloning and Recombinant Expression of GDE Domain Containing Enzymes—The following expressed sequence tags were purchased from OpenBioSystems (Huntsville, AL) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-myc/His using conventional techniques: GDE1/MIR16, IMAGE 3601420; GDE2, IMAGE 4224574; GDE3, IMAGE 4457335; GDE4, IMAGE 3602449; and GDE7, IMAGE 3486726. COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to ∼70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and sonicated to lyse. The lysates were then spun at 145,000 × g for 45 min to isolate the insoluble (membrane) fraction, which was sonicated to resuspend in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Cell membranes thus prepared were stored as single-use aliquots at 0.01 mg/ml for enzyme assays or 2 mg/ml for Western blots at -80 °C. For Western blots the cell membranes were treated with (or without) PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. GP-NAE Phosphodiesterase Activity Assay—Enzyme assays were performed in 4-ml glass vials in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 2 mm MgCl2 except for the following experiments. pH rate profiles were performed in buffers containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm HEPES, and 50 mm glycine that was adjusted with HCl to the desired pH. The cation-sensitivity assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the indicated cation (or EDTA) at 2 mm final concentration. For all assays, 10 μl of protein (100 μg for cell-membranes or 500 μg for brain samples) was added to 85 μl of the specified buffer and 5 μl of GP-NAE substrate (2 mm in Me2SO or EtOH, 100 μm final concentration). Vials were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then quenched with 1.5 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) and 400 μl of 1% formic acid. For LC-MS assays, d4-N-oleoylethanolamine (10 μl of 100 μm stock in EtOH; 1 nmol total) was added as an internal standard. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 3 min and the organic phase transferred to a new vial and evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2. For LC-MS assays the dried reactions were resuspended in 500 μl of MeOH and 50 μl injected into an Agilent 1100 series LC-MS for analysis using an 8-min gradient from 30 to 100% buffer B. Buffer A consisted of MeOH:H2O (5:95) with 0.1% formic acid and buffer B consisted of H2O: MeOH:iPrOH (5:35:60) with 0.1% formic acid. NAE formation was quantified by comparison with the internal d4-N-oleoylethanolamine standard. For radiochromatographic assays, the dried reactions were dissolved in 20 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1), spotted on thin layer silica plates, and developed in CHCl3, MeOH, 28% NH4OH (40:10:1). Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was quantified by a phosphorimaging device (Packard), and products were identified by comparison with 14C radiolabled synthetic standards. NAE formation was calculated from percentage values of the total radioactivity on the TLC plates. All of the assays were conducted with n = 2 or 3, and error bars represent the mean ± S.E. Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies against mGDE1 and Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibodies that recognize GDE1 were prepared by expressing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion of the C-terminal 163 amino acids of GDE1 prepared using traditional subcloning techniques. This fusion protein was expressed in BL21-DE3 cells by growing at 37 °C to A600 = 0.4 and inducing expression with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested and sonicated. Lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and visualized by SDS-PAGE and protein staining. The fusion protein was excised from the gel, homogenized, mixed 1:1 with RIBI adjuvant, and injected three times into rabbits at 2-week intervals. One week after the final injection, blood was taken and antibodies affinity purified with the original antigen immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. These polyclonal antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 1:5000 in TBST prior to developing with chemiluminescent ECL substrate (Pierce) and exposing to x-ray film. Specificity of antibodies was tested via immunoblots of mock- and GDE1-transfected COS-7 cell membranes (supplemental Fig. S1). Reverse Transcription-PCR—cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using 30 cycles with cycling times of 30 s of melting at 95 °C, 30 s of annealing at 58 °C, and 30 s of extension at 72 °C with Taq DNA polymerase using the following primers: GDE1 oligonucleotides, 5′-CCGACTATGTGATCTGACATTTGAACAAGTTAGG-3′ and 5′-CCATACTGTTATTGTACAGCTGTGGAAATTCCG-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotides, 5′-TGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGTGATGGCATGGAACTGTGG-3′. The products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel. Measurement of Endogenous GP-NAE—Initial attempts to detect endogenous GP-NAE in mouse brain were frustrated by the presence of abundant and isobaric lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine lipids that displayed overlapping chromatographic behavior. To accurately detect and measure GP-NAEs, we employed LC-MS/MS to identify characteristic fragment ion peaks (Fig. 2) (15Hansen H.H. Hansen S.H. Schousboe A. Hansen H.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). First, synthetic GP-NAEs were prepared and their chromatographic behavior and fragmentation studied. Fragmentation of GP-NAEs in the negative mode results in three dominant ions: a phospho-NAE peak at [M - H - 74]- and two peaks corresponding to glycer-phosphate and its dehydrate at 171 and 153, respectively (Fig. 2, A and D). The phospho-NAE peak was selected for identification and quantification by multiple reaction monitoring, as this peak also verified the N-acyl chain of the parent GP-NAE species. Thus, by scanning for the [M - H]- > [M - H - 74]- transition, several endogenous GP-NAEs, including C16:0, C18:1, and C20:4 GP-NAEs, could be detected that displayed identical retention and fragmentation to synthetic standards (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Parent and fragment mass signals were strongest for the more abundant GP-NAEs (C16:0, C18:1) (Fig. 2), but could be detected for all GP-NAEs listed in Table 1. Furthermore, we employed a hybrid ion trap/Orbitrap instrument, which enabled high-resolution mass measurements of parent and fragment ions. This instrument yielded measurements of endogenous GP-NAEs and key fragments that were within ∼2 ppm of predicted masses thereby confirming the identity of these NAE precursors (supplemental Table 1). Quantification of endogenous GP-NAEs was performed by comparison to an internal unnatural (N-C15:1) GP-NAE standard. Endogenous GP-NAEs were present at levels somewhat lower than endogenous NAEs (Table 1) (12Leung A. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4720-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Endogenous levels of GP-NAEs in mouse brain as measured by LC-MS/MSWet tissuepmol/gC16:0 GP-NAE13.17 ± 4.02C18:1 GP-NAE3.18 ± 1.09C20:0 GP-NAE0.07 ± 0.03C20:4 GP-NAE0.16 ± 0.07C22:6 GP-NAE0.54 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab Due to the low levels of endogenous GP-NAEs, we sought additional evidence that these lipids represented potential intermediates in the enzymatic biosynthesis of NAE. To measure enzymatic turnover of GP-NAEs we employed an ex vivo assay. Previous studies had determined that brain GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by EDTA (14Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26465-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here, we found that treatment of brain extracts with EDTA resulted in dramatic accumulation of endogenous GP-NAEs in brain homogenates over time (Fig. 3A). MAFP is a general inhibitor of serine hydrolases including the NAPE-lipase Abh4 (14Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26465-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The accumulation of GP-NAEs was completely blocked by addition of MAFP thereby confirming that these lipids originated from the enzymatic sn-1/sn-2-deacylation of NAPE precursors. Notably, long chain saturated GP-NAEs (e.g. C20:0) did not accumulate suggesting that this pathway may only be active on GP-NAEs bearing select N-acyl chains (see “Discussion”). The rapid enzymatic turnover of GP-NAEs in brain extracts, combined with the low endogenous levels of these precursors, suggests that they represent transient intermediates in the biosynthesis of NAEs. The significant accumulation of the AEA precursor C20:4 GP-NAE in EDTA-treated brain extracts permitted acquisition of much cleaner MS profiles for this lipid, which matched precisely those observed with a synthetic standard (Fig. 3, C and D). Identification of GDE1 as the GP-NAE Phosphodiesterase—Having confirmed that GP-NAEs are endogenous constituents of mouse brain, we next attempted to identify the enzyme(s) that catalyze hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of these lipids to release NAEs. One candidate enzyme class is the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDEs), which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of glycerophosphodiesters to yield glycerol phosphate and an alcohol (16Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Enzymes containing this GDE domain have been shown to play roles in glycerophospholipid metabolism in yeast and bacteria (17Patton-Vogt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Searches of mammalian genomes revealed 7 genes encoding proteins containing GDE domains. The GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity in brain tissue was found exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5B) and treatment with NaCl or Na2CO3 did not solubilize the activity (not shown), indicating that it derives from an integral membrane protein. Of the seven genes encoding mammalian GDE domain containing proteins, six are predicted to have transmembrane domains and of these, only five are expressed in brain, as determined by expressed sequence tag counts from the UniGene data base and reports from the literature (18Nogusa Y. Fujioka Y. Komatsu R. Kato N. Yanaka N. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 337: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These five predicted GDEs were heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells as epitope-tagged proteins. Following confirmation of expression by Western blotting, membrane fractions from these cells were tested for GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity using an LC-MS-based substrate assay with synthetic N-C16:0 GP-NAE. One enzyme, GDE1, displayed robust GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity, whereas the other four GDEs were indistinguishable from a mock-transfected control (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4Expression and GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity of GDE domain containing enzymes.

Membrane fractions were treated with PNGase F and visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling). B, GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity of membrane fractions of COS-7 cells expressing GDE domain-containing proteins was measured by monitoring release of N-C16:0 NAE via LC-MS with 100 μm N-C16:0 GP-NAE as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Brain GP-NAE Phosphodiesterase and Recombinant GDE1 Exhibit Similar Biochemical Properties—We next compared the activity of GDE1 to the GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity detected in mouse brain. First, we confirmed by Western blotting that GDE1 (Fig. 5A), like the GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity, resides in brain membrane fractions (Fig. 5B). Treatment with the glycosidase PNGase F reduced the apparent molecular mass of GDE1 by ∼5 kDa, indicating that, as previously reported, the enzyme is an N-linked glycoprotein (19Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with hydropathy plot analyses that predict the enzyme is an integral membrane protein with the majority of the protein sequence, including the catalytic domain, facing the luminal/extracellular compartments of the cell. We next compared the sensitivity of GDE1 and brain GP-NAE phosphodiesterase to various divalent cations and found that both activities were inhibited by EDTA, calcium chloride, and zinc chloride, and markedly enhanced by magnesium chloride (Fig. 6B). Recombinant GDE1 and brain GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity also displayed equivalent pH rate profiles, showing a slightly alkaline pH optimum (Fig. 6A). Finally, GDE1 and GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity were found to exhibit nearly identical tissue distributions, with highest levels being observed in the brain and spinal cord, followed by kidney, liver, and testis (Fig. 7). In contrast, little or no GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity or GDE1 expression was detected in the heart or spleen. Interestingly, this tissue distribution resembles that of other enzymes that participate in NAE metabolism, including fatty acid amide hydrolase (5Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L.

These data collectively suggest that GDE1 is a principal GP-NAE phosphodiesterase in mammalian tissues.FIGURE 7Tissue distribution of GP-NAE phosphodiesterase activity and GDE1.

https://openalex.org/W2075400482,"Biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins in eukaryotes is an essential process involving the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly and export machineries and the cytosolic iron/sulfur protein assembly (CIA) apparatus. To define the integration of Fe/S protein biogenesis into cellular homeostasis, we compared the global transcriptional responses to defects in the three biogenesis systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using DNA microarrays. Depletion of a member of the CIA machinery elicited only weak (up to 2-fold) alterations in gene expression with no clear preference for any specific cellular process. In contrast, depletion of components of the mitochondrial ISC assembly and export systems induced strong and largely overlapping transcriptional responses of more than 200 genes (2–100-fold changes). These alterations were strikingly similar, yet not identical, to the transcriptional profiles developed upon iron starvation. Hence, mitochondria and their ISC systems serve as primary physiological regulators exerting a global control of numerous iron-dependent processes. First, ISC depletion activates the iron-responsive transcription factors Aft1/2p leading to increased cellular iron acquisition. Second, respiration and heme metabolism are repressed ensuring the balanced utilization of iron by the two major iron-consuming processes, iron-sulfur protein and heme biosynthesis. Third, the decreased respiratory activity is compensated by induction of genes involved in glucose acquisition. Finally, transcriptional remodeling of the citric acid cycle and the biosyntheses of ergosterol and biotin reflect the iron dependence of these pathways. Together, our data suggest a model in which mitochondria perform a global regulatory role in numerous cellular processes linked to iron homeostasis.

Proteins with iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cofactors play important roles in fundamental cellular processes such as redox reactions, metabolic catalysis, and the regulation of gene expression (1Beinert H.

The mitochondrial matrix harbors the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) 2The abbreviations used are:ISCiron-sulfur clusterCIAcytosolic iron/sulfur protein assemblyWTwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are:ISCiron-sulfur clusterCIAcytosolic iron/sulfur protein assemblyWTwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent protein. assembly machinery that is essential for biosynthesis of all cellular Fe/S proteins. The functional core of this system consists of the scaffold proteins Isu1p/Isu2p for the de novo synthesis of a transiently bound Fe/S cluster. In yeast, Fe/S cluster synthesis on Isu1p involves the cysteine desulfurase complex Nfs1p/Isd11p as the sulfur donor, Yfh1p (frataxin), and an electron transfer chain consisting of the ferredoxin Yah1p and its cognate reductase, Arh1p. The specialized Hsp70 chaperone Ssq1p, its cognate J-type cochaperone Jac1p, the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1p, and the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx5p are involved in subsequent steps following Fe/S cluster synthesis on Isu1p. The ISC system has been inherited from bacteria that encode proteins of similar structure and function in the isc operon (3Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). In yeast, several of the ISC members are essential for cell viability underscoring the fundamental role of Fe/S protein maturation for the eukaryotic cell.The mitochondrial ISC assembly system is also required for biosynthesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins (8Kispal G.

Their maturation further depends on the mitochondrial “ISC export machinery” that consists of the mitochondrial inner membrane ABC transporter Atm1p, the mitochondrial intermembrane space sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1p, and glutathione (8Kispal G.

This export system is responsible for sequestering an unknown component from mitochondria to the cytosol to facilitate maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins, a step carried out by the members of the cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly (CIA) system. The CIA machinery includes the cytosolic iron-only hydrogenase-like protein Nar1p, the soluble P-loop NTPases Cfd1p and Nbp35p, and the WD40 repeat protein Cia1p, which catalyze the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins in an ordered pathway (13Roy A.

Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and the constitutive expression of a set of iron-regulated genes that are referred to as the iron regulon (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Gene expression of the iron regulon is under control of the iron-responsive transcription factors Aft1p and Aft2p (20Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

Under iron-limiting conditions, Aft1p shuttles from the cytosol into the nucleus where it acts as transcriptional activator (24Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the impairment of mitochondrial Fe/S cluster formation is not associated with the depletion of cytosolic iron pools, it has been proposed that Aft1p requires a signal molecule produced and exported by the mitochondrial ISC machineries for proper sensing of iron (25Chen O.S. Crisp R.J. Valachovic M. Bard M. Winge D.R. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29513-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J.

Furthermore, defects in the ISC machinery are associated with heme deficiency (27Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Santos R. Buisson N. Knight S.A. Dancis A. Camadro J.M. Lesuisse E. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29101-29108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses indicate that the inhibition of ferrochelatase, the last step of heme biosynthesis, by an unknown low molecular mass substance may be responsible for this inhibition (29Lange H. Muhlenhoff U. Denzel M. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29101-29108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).To systematically understand the importance of Fe/S protein biogenesis for cellular homeostasis, we have carried out genome-wide comparative analyses of the transcriptional responses to defects in cellular Fe/S protein maturation in S. cerevisiae. In particular, we were interested in gaining insights into the regulatory cross-talks between cellular Fe/S protein maturation, respiration, heme biosynthesis, and the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis. We further sought to identify additional pathways affected by defects in cellular Fe/S protein maturation. We report on a dramatic remodeling of mitochondrial and cytosolic biochemical pathways as a result of defects in the mitochondrial ISC machineries. Most but not all of these processes are directly or indirectly connected to cellular iron and/or heme metabolism thus intimately linking the two major iron-dependent processes. In contrast, only mild transcriptional changes with no clear preference for any particular functional pathway were observed when the CIA machinery was compromised. These data indicate that the remodeling upon defects in the mitochondrial ISC machineries is not related to the biogenesis of a canonical cytosolic or nuclear Fe/S protein but rather to a signal emanating from mitochondria. Together, our data identify mitochondria in general and the mitochondrial ISC machineries in particular as a major regulatory device for multiple cellular processes, which show a tight connection to cellular iron and/or heme homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Cell Growth—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table SIV. Cells were cultivated in rich (YP), minimal (SC), “iron-poor” minimal medium lacking added iron chloride (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Carbon sources were added at a concentration of 2% (w/v). Prior to microarray experiments, strains were cultivated in SC medium supplemented with 2% glucose (SD) for 40 h (WT, Gal-ATM1, Gal-NBP35) or 48 h (Gal-YAH1). To deplete Hem15p or Ssq1p to physiologically critical levels, Gal-HEM15 and Gal-SSQ1 cells were pre-cultivated for 3 days on SD plates.Microarray Analysis—Strains were cultivated in parallel in SD medium supplemented with the minimal set of amino acids required for growth of the wild type strain (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from cells that were diluted from overnight cultures to an A600 nm of 0.2 and cultivated in parallel to an A600 nm of 0.5–0.6 using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). An optional on-column DNase digestion was performed (Qiagen). RNA quality was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. RNA (12–15 μg) was transcribed into Cy3- or Cy5-labeled cDNA using the CyScribe post-labeling kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's protocol. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration using MicroSpin G-50 columns (GE Healthcare). Efficiency of cDNA synthesis and Cy-Dye incorporation were monitored by measuring the absorption at 260 nm (cDNA), 550 nm (Cy3), and 650 nm (Cy5). For each Gal mutant, microarray experiments were performed twice with RNA isolated from independent cultures grown on different days. Cell viability at the point of RNA extraction was analyzed by incubation of serial dilutions on SD minimal plates and was found not to be compromised.Yeast microarrays (Y6.4k6; University Health Network Microarray Centre, Toronto, Canada) were pre-hybridized for 2 h at 37 °C in 5× SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1% bovine serum albumin and rinsed twice with water and once in isopropyl alcohol. Labeled probes were concentrated to a final volume of ∼3 μl, pooled, added to 54 μl of DIG Easy Hyb solution buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 3 μl of yeast tRNA (10 mg/ml) and 3 μl of denatured salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml), and incubated at 62 °C for 5 min. Hybridizations were carried out for 18 h at 37 °C in a hybridization chamber (Corning Glass). Hybridized arrays were removed from the coverslip by immersing in 1× SSC buffer. Slides were washed three times with 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS buffer for 15 min at 50 °C in a hybridization oven with agitation. Arrays were rinsed at room temperature in 1× SSC buffer, 4–5 times in 0.1× SSC buffer, and dried by spinning in 50-ml Falcon tubes for 5 min by 1500 rpm. A detailed protocol for hybridization can be obtained from the University Health Network webside.Fluorescence intensities were captured by using the scanner ScanArray Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Spot intensities were extracted from a scanned image with ImaGene 3.0 (BioDiscovery, Inc.). To account for spot differences, the background-corrected ratio of the two channels were calculated, and log2 was transformed. To standardize the raw data we used a spatial- and intensity-dependent standardization (the lowess scatter plot) to correct for inherent bias on each chip (similar to Ref. 31Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2826) Google Scholar). As each gene was spotted twice on the array, mean log ratios were calculated for each slide and also for replicate slides. Differentially expressed genes were selected by the fold change.Northern Blot Analysis—20 μg of total RNA was separated on a denaturing agarose gel and blotted to nylon membrane (32Sambrook J. Russel D.W. 3rd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled DNA probes were generated by random priming of DNA fragments containing the entire open reading frames of HEM15, HMX1, and ACT1, respectively. Hybridization was carried out in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion).Promoter Assays—The promoter strength of the FET3 promoter was determined as described previously (26Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the promoter strength of the CYC1 promoter was determined using vector pCYC1-GFP, which harbors region –1 to –900 bp upstream of the CYC1 open reading frame in front of the GFP gene of vector pHK12, a URA3 derivative of pPS1372 (33Taura T. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7427-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Promoter analyses based on luciferase were carried out with vector p416MET-hRluc that harbored the Renilla reniformis hRluc gene from vector pGL4.70 (Promega) between the HindIII and SalI sites. The upstream regions of BIO2 (1 kb), ERG3 (1 kb), GLT1 (700 bp), and YHB1 (1 kb) were inserted into SacI and HindIII restriction sites replacing the MET25 promoter. Cells were grown in SD medium and diluted to A600 nm = 0.2. and promoter analyses were carried out with cells grown to mid-log phase. For iron starvation, the medium was supplemented with 50 μm bathophenanthroline. For the analysis of GFP expression, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to A600 nm = 1 in water, and the fluorescence emission at 513 nm was recorded. The excitation wavelength was 485 nm. For luciferase assays, cells were diluted to A600 nm = 0.1 in water; fractions (5–10 μl) were diluted in 100 μl of water supplemented with 2 μl of a 1:500 dilution of ViviRen substrate (Promega), and the cellular luminescence was recorded in a scintillation counter. The background signal obtained with cells lacking the respective reporter was subtracted. Values are averages of duplicate measurements of at least four independent cultures.Miscellaneous Methods—For determination of the cellular heme content, cells were grown for 16 h in iron-free SD medium supplemented with 10 μCi of 55FeCl3 and 1 mm ascorbate at 30 °C. Subsequently, radiolabeled 55Fe-heme was extracted by n-butyl acetate and quantified by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (34Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The following published methods were used: manipulation of DNA and PCR (32Sambrook J. Russel D.W. 3rd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar); transformation of yeast cells (35Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar); isolation of yeast mitochondria and post-mitochondrial supernatant (36Diekert K. de Kroon A.I. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); immunostaining (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar); and determination of enzyme activities and iron contents (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), ferrochelatase (38Camadro J.M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and catalase (39Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Error bars represent the standard deviation.RESULTSTo analyze the global consequences of defects in cellular Fe/S protein maturation in S. cerevisiae, we carried out DNA microarray analyses with regulatable yeast mutants that carry the respective gene representatives of each of the three biosynthetic systems under the control of the galactose-inducible, glucose-repressible GAL1–10 promoter. In particular, we used the mitochondrial ISC assembly mutant Gal-YAH1 (40Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the ISC export mutant Gal-ATM1 (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the CIA mutant Gal-NBP35 (15Hausmann A. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Pierik A.J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3266-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To define the set of genes that were responsive to depletion of Yah1p, Atm1p, or Nbp35p, wild type and the corresponding mutants were cultivated in parallel in minimal medium supplemented with glucose and a minimal set of amino acids. RNA was isolated, and genes showing an altered expression level with respect to the wild type control cells were identified by DNA microarray analyses.Weak Transcriptional Response upon Depletion of Nbp35p—The transcriptional response of cells depleted of the CIA member Nbp35p was rather weak with a maximum change of only 2.6-fold. A total number of 117 genes were identified that displayed at least a 1.5-fold transcriptional change in comparison with wild type cells (Fig. 1, Table 1, and supplemental Table SI). Preliminary microarray analyses of cells depleted of two other CIA members, Nar1p and Cia1p, gave similar results (data not shown). The transcriptional response showed hardly any overlap with cells depleted of Yah1p or Atm1p (see below). The most prominent sets of genes induced upon depletion of Nbp35 were members of the so called Y′ elements (Table 1). These are sub-telomerically encoded genes, some of which encode proteins with potential helicase activity (41Pennaneach V. Putnam C.D. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1357-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These components are suggested to play a role in telomerase-independent telomere maintenance. These telomerase-responsive genes are induced upon nitrogen depletion, in stationary phase, and in aging cells (42Lesur I. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1297-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Their induction in Gal-NBP35 and also Gal-YAH1 cells may thus reflect a response to the depletion of an essential gene in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the expression profile of Nbp35-depleted cells included several genes that are known to be regulated in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Several genes of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and of the F1F0-ATP synthase were slightly repressed. A similar repression is observed during a diauxic shift (43DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). In parallel, hexose transporters were induced to some extent. Furthermore, the CIT2 gene encoding the peroxisomal citrate synthase was weakly induced. This may indicate an induction of the so-called retrograde response, which is activated upon mitochondrial perturbations (44Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mol.

However, the response was rather weak, and its reason is unclear, because the depletion of Nbp35p does not significantly affect mitochondrial function (15Hausmann A. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J.

ISU2 was the only gene encoding an Fe/S assembly factor, which showed a slightly enhanced expression. SUL1 encoding the sulfate permease of the plasma membrane was induced, most likely in response to a sulfur assimilation deficiency of the NBP35 mutant caused by the loss of function of sulfite reductase, a cytosolic Fe/S protein (supplemental Table SI). In addition, a weak induction of the BAP2/3 genes was observed. These encode permeases for branched chain amino acids, and their induction may reflect a leucine deficiency because of loss of the activity of the Fe/S protein Leu1p in Nbp35p-depleted cells. In conclusion, only slight changes with no obvious preference for a specific pathway or functional category were detectable upon repression of NBP35. It appears that this gene, and possibly other CIA components, is not a major trigger to alter gene expression in yeast. This observation was surprising as NBP35 is essential for viability of S. cerevisiae (15Hausmann A. Aguilar Netz D.J. Balk J. Pierik A.J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Pr"

https://openalex.org/W2074307869,"Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is a member of the family of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs). Unlike the other ACADs, which are soluble homotetramers, VLCAD is a homodimer associated with the mitochondrial membrane. VLCAD also possesses an additional 180 residues in the C terminus that are not present in the other ACADs. We have determined the crystal structure of VLCAD complexed with myristoyl-CoA, obtained by co-crystallization, to 1.91-Å resolution. The overall fold of the N-terminal ∼400 residues of VLCAD is similar to that of the soluble ACADs including medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). The novel C-terminal domain forms an α-helical bundle that is positioned perpendicular to the two N-terminal helical domains. The fatty acyl moiety of the bound substrate/product is deeply imbedded inside the protein; however, the adenosine pyrophosphate portion of the C14-CoA ligand is disordered because of partial hydrolysis of the thioester bond and high mobility of the CoA moiety. The location of Glu-422 with respect to the C2-C3 of the bound ligand and FAD confirms Glu-422 to be the catalytic base. In MCAD, Gln-95 and Glu-99 form the base of the substrate binding cavity. In VLCAD, these residues are glycines (Gly-175 and Gly-178), allowing the binding channel to extend for an additional 12Å and permitting substrate acyl chain lengths as long as 24 carbons to bind. VLCAD deficiency is among the more common defects of mitochondrial β-oxidation and, if left undiagnosed, can be fatal.

Hashimoto T. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2465-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to VLCAD, which has optimal chain length specificity for fatty acyl-CoAs having 16 carbons in length, there are long-, medium-, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (LCAD, MCAD, and SCAD), which are most active with 14, 8, and 4 carbon substrates, respectively (3Ikeda Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1027-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 (ACAD-9) is most active with unsaturated long-chain acyl-CoAs (5Ensenauer R. He M. Willard J.M. Goetzman E.S. Corydon T.J. Vandahl B.B. Mohsen A.W. Isaya G. Vockley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32309-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ACAD family also includes four members involved in amino acid metabolic pathways: isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) in valine metabolism, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) in leucine metabolism, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCAD) in lysine and tryptophan metabolism, and short-branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) in isoleucine metabolism. Fatty acyl-CoAs are oxidized to the corresponding trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA products with a concurrent reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD cofactor (6Crane F.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 717-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) reoxidizes the reduced flavin and transfers reducing equivalents to the main mitochondrial respiratory chain through the enzyme ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (7Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8440-8445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other ACADs, which are soluble homotetramers with 45-kDa subunits, mature VLCAD and ACAD-9 are homodimers of 67-kDa subunits bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane (8Souri M. Aoyama T. Hoganson G. Hashimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Zhang W. Zou D. Chen G. Wan T. Zhang M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whereas the tetrameric ACADs share a 30% identity with the first ∼400 amino acids of the two enzymes, VLCAD and ACAD-9 possess an additional 180 residues on the C-terminal end. Mutations in this domain have been shown to affect binding to mitochondrial membranes, implicating it in the normal interaction of VLCAD with the inner mitochondrial membrane (10Goetzman E.S. Wang Y.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The subunits of the tetrameric ACADs are arranged as a dimer of dimers. These ACADs have the same polypeptide fold, composed of an N-terminal α-helical domain (α-dom1), a middle β-sheet domain, and a C-terminal α-helical domain (α-dom2). The catalytic base of all known ACADs is a glutamate. In MCAD, this residue is Glu-376 (11Kim J.J. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Bross P. Engst S. Strauss A.W. Kelly D.P. Rasched I. Ghisla S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In LCAD and IVD, however, this residue is not conserved. Instead, Glu-261 (Glu-254 in IVD) in helix G acts as the catalytic residue (15Tiffany K.A. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Paschke R. Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8455-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Djordjevic S. Dong Y. Paschke R. Frerman F.E. Strauss A.W. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4258-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of VLCAD and ACAD-9 with the other ACADs indicates that both VLCAD and ACAD-9 possess an MCAD-like catalytic glutamate. In the peroxisome, β-oxidation is initiated by acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOs). ACOs are flavooxidases with one FAD per subunit and belong to the same superfamily as ACADs (21Matsubara Y. Indo Y. Naito E. Ozasa H. Glassberg R. Vockley J. Ikeda Y. Kraus J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16321-16331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the oxidative half-reaction, however, molecular oxygen rather than ETF reoxidizes the flavin, producing hydrogen peroxide. Like VLCAD and ACAD-9, ACO is a homodimeric protein, which possesses an additional C-terminal domain that is not present in the tetrameric ACADs (22Nakajima Y. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Tamaoki H. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, ACOs are soluble enzymes. The N-terminal structure of ACO differs slightly from tetrameric ACADs. The FAD of ACO is more solvent-accessible, allowing for its oxygen reactivity. The study of VLCAD has been limited because of difficulties with prokaryotic expression. An N-terminally truncated variant of VLCAD was recently reported in GenBank™ (NM_001033859); it lacks exon 3 because of alternative splicing (ΔEx3) (23Aoyama T. Uchida Y. Kelley R.I. Marble M. Hofman K. Tonsgard J.H. Rhead W.J. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This ΔEx3 VLCAD variant is missing 22 amino acids (residues 7-28 of the mature sequence) resulting in an N terminus that more closely resembles that of ACAD-9. Recombinant ΔEx3 VLCAD was shown to be stable with very high specific activity and a substrate specificity profile similar to that previously reported for VLCAD purified from tissue or expressed in mammalian systems (4Izai K. Uchida Y. Orii T. Yamamoto S. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1027-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goetzman E.S. Wang Y. He M. Mohsen A.W. Ninness B.K. Vockley J. Mol.

Acta. 2000; 1485: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was shown that recombinant ΔEx3 VLCAD (hereafter referred to as simply VLCAD) can bind to isolated mitochondrial membranes that have been washed to remove all peripherally associated membrane proteins. Boiling the membranes, which should denature the remaining integral membrane proteins, did not reduce VLCAD binding, suggesting that membrane binding of VLCAD does not require an additional protein (10Goetzman E.S. Wang Y. He M. Mohsen A.W. Ninness B.K. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 91: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal domain of VLCAD (∼400 amino acids) has a high sequence homology, and therefore likely structural homology to the other ACADs, no information on the structure of the C-terminal domain (∼180 amino acids) is available. Here we describe the x-ray crystallographic analysis of human VLCAD. Strikingly, the novel C-terminal domain mimics the other dimer in the tetrameric ACADs. Preliminary reports of this work were presented at the 2007 Meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (26McAndrew R.P. Wang Y. Mohsen A.-W. He M. Vockley J. Kim J.-J. FASEB J. 2007; 21 (c.3): 649Crossref Google Scholar) and at the American Crystallographic Association 2007 meeting (27McAndrew R.P. Wang Y. Mohsen A.-W. He M. Vockley J. Kim J.-J. American Crystallographic Association. American Crystallographic Association, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT2007: 01.04.05Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Protein was expressed and purified as previously described (10Goetzman E.S. Wang Y. He M. Mohsen A.W. Ninness B.K. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 91: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pET-21a expression plasmid containing ΔEx3 VLCAD was transformed into Escherichia coli C43 (DE3) (Avidis, Saint Beauzire, France). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.8-1.0 at 600 nm and induced overnight by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with Complete™ protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science, Manheim, Germany), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was precipitated with 55% saturated ammonium sulfate and re-centrifuged. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% soy lecithin, and 0.2% Tween-20 and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 and 0.2% Tween-20. Following dialysis, 0.3 mg/ml (final concentration) dodecylmaltoside was added. The sample was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted with a 0-500 mm potassium phosphate gradient. Fractions with VLCAD activity were pooled, diluted 2:1 (water/sample), and loaded again onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column. This was eluted with a 0-380 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions with activity were again combined, dialyzed in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.3, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The sample was eluted with a 0-500 mm KPO4, pH 8.0 gradient. Tween-20 (0.2%) was added to all chromatography buffers. Fractions containing VLCAD were combined, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. VLCAD enzyme activity was assayed as previously described (10Goetzman E.S. Wang Y. He M. Mohsen A.W. Ninness B.K. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 91: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Frerman F.E. Goodman S.I. Biochem. Med. 1985; 33: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, activity was measured with the anaerobic ETF fluorescence reduction assay, using a LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was started with the addition of the CoA ester substrate to give a final concentration of 25 μm. Crystallization—Purified protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop or sitting drop methods (29McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, , Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). VLCAD (5 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 5% glycerol, with 3 molar equivalents (per FAD) of myristoyl-CoA, was added in a 1.5:1 ratio with a buffer solution (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 17.6% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.047 m MgCl2, and 5% glycerol) and equilibrated against the same buffer solution. When myristoyl-CoA was added, the yellow enzyme solution turned colorless, indicating that the enzyme flavin was reduced by the substrate. Within 1 week, rod-like yellow crystals were obtained (0.25 × 0.08 × 0.04 mm), suggesting that the enzyme was reoxidized during the crystallization. For data collection, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 2000, and 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Two heavy atom derivatives of VLCAD crystals were used for phasing. A mercury derivative was obtained by crystallizing the protein in the presence of 0.6 mm thimerosal. An osmium derivative was obtained by soaking preformed crystals with 6 mm K2OsCl6 dissolved in cryo-protectant for 30 min prior to data collection. Data Collection and Structure Determination—A complete native dataset was collected in-house using a Rigaku Micro-Max-007 x-ray generator equipped with an R-AXIS IV2+ image plate system and an MSC X-stream cooling system set at -180 °C. All high resolution and anomalous data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories. Single wavelength anomalous data were collected with a VLCAD/mercury (thimerosal) co-crystal at the mercury absorbance peak wavelength (1.0083 Å) at the SBC-CAT beamline 19-ID. Diffraction data for osmium (K2OsCl6)-soaked VLCAD crystals were collected at the osmium absorbance peak (1.1405 Å) at the DND-CAT beamline 5-ID. Processing of image data was done using the HKL2000 suite of programs (30Otwinowski Z. Minor A. Carter J. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) for the native and mercury datasets and X-GEN (31Howard A.J. Bourne P.E. Watenpaugh K.D. Crystallographic Computing. 7. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar) for the osmium data. Phasing was calculated by MIRAS with the program SOLVE at 50-3.00-Å resolution (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and phases were extended to 1.91 Å by DM (33Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM, Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), which is a part of the CCP4 program suite (34Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Initial, automated model building was done with the program RESOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Manual density fitting and model building was done with the program Coot (36Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Refmac5, also from CCP4, was used for multiple cycles of reciprocal space refinement (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The program ARP/wARP (38Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was used for the addition of waters, with manual adjustment using the program Coot. At a later stage of refinement, water molecules were added or removed on the basis of peak height (3.0σ in the Fo-Fc map) and distance from a potential hydrogen bonding partner (<3.5 Å). The structural model was refined to a final Rwork = 15.9% and Rfree = 21.6%.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsVLCAD + C14-CoAVLCAD + C14-CoA + Hg co-crystalVLCAD + C14-CoA + Os crystal soakData collectionResolution (Å)30 (2.06)aNumbers in parentheses are values for the highest resolution shells. -1.9130 (2.31)-2.2030 (2.21)-2.10Space groupC2221C2221C2221a, b, c (Å)74.7, 107.9, 149.974.6, 108.1, 150.074.6, 108.2, 150.1Total reflections354462169028145187Unique reflections467764448143731Completeness (%)98.8 (98.4)91.9 (98.3)91.5 (97.9)I/σ(I)35.5 (3.9)16.7 (4.4)14.6 (5.1)Rsym (%)7.9 (53.2)9.9 (37.2)6.11 (13.3)Mosaicity (°)0.550.850.52X-ray sourceIn-houseAPS: 19-IDAPS: 5-IDWavelength (Å)1.54191.00831.1405Phasing methodMIRASMIRASResolution (Å)50.0-3.050.0-3.0Number of sites21Figure of merit0.52 (combined)RefinementResolution range (Å)30-1.91Number of reflections47377Rwork/Rfree (%)15.9/21.6R.m.s.d from idealityBond lengths (Å)/Angles (°)0.014/1.35Ramachandran plotMost favored95.4%Additional allowed4.4%Generously allowed0.2%Num. of atoms/avg.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of VLCAD—VLCAD forms a dimer of identical monomers along a crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 1A), confirming previous gel filtration analysis (8Souri M. Aoyama T. Hoganson G. Hashimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the presence of myristoyl-CoA, the enzyme crystallized in the space group C2221 with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The electron density map is generally well ordered for the entire polypeptide chain with the exception of the first seven N-terminal amino acids and residues 446-478 (using the full-length mature VLCAD numbering scheme), which, therefore, were not included in the structural model. The N-terminal 400 residues of VLCAD have the same overall fold as MCAD and the other tetrameric ACADs (17Kim J.J. Miura R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There is an N-terminal α-helical domain (α-dom1), followed by a β-sheet domain and another α-helical domain (α-dom2). The C-terminal 180 amino acids of VLCAD form an α-helical bundle (α-dom3) that is positioned perpendicular to the N-terminal helical domains. Fig. 1B presents the secondary structure labeling convention used for MCAD and extended for VLCAD that will be used in the present description. When the monomer structure was compared with the dimer structure, it is immediately noticeable that the final helix (Helix O) in one monomer is swapped with the same helix from the other monomer. It is unclear what function, if any, there is for this helix swapping. The swapped helices may simply function to stabilize the dimer. Fig. 2A shows an MCAD dimer (PDB 3MDE) overlaid onto the VLCAD dimer. The two structures align well throughout most of the MCAD structure with an r.m.s.d. of 1.4 Å over 346 α-carbons. VLCAD has the same dimer interface as MCAD. Surprisingly, when the VLCAD monomer is aligned with one monomer of an MCAD tetramer (PDB 3MDE), both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the VLCAD align with portions of all four monomers of the MCAD tetramer (2.0 Å r.m.s.d. over 428 α-carbons; Fig. 2B). Thus, the C-terminal 180 residues of VLCAD interact with the N-terminal residues in a similar manner as the dimer-dimer interaction of the tetrameric ACADs. Furthermore, residues in the α-dom3 domain of VLCAD must then correspond structurally to those in the N terminus (α-dom2). A structural alignment of the C-terminal 180 residues with the N terminus shows that this is the case (1.7 Å r.m.s.d. over 114 α-carbons). The C-terminal residues show a 14% sequence identity with those residues in the N terminus with which they align structurally. Thus, the C-terminal amino acids most likely originated from a partial gene duplication. When aligned with VLCAD (Fig. 2C) and with the exception of the first ∼30 residues and the last ∼30 residues, ACO (PDB 2DDH) (22Nakajima Y. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Setoyama C. Tamaoki H. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) shows a structural similarity with both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains (2.7 Å r.m.s.d. over 413 α-carbons). One notable difference, however, is that the ACO monomers do not swap helices during dimer formation.FIGURE 2Superposition of: A, VLCAD dimer (blue and cyan) on an MCAD dimer (red and orange; PDB 3MDE); B, VLCAD monomer (blue) on an MCAD tetramer (shades of brown and red; PDB 3MDE) with a close-up of the overlay of the C-terminal domain with the other monomers; C, VLCAD monomer (blue) on an ACO monomer (magenta; PDB 2DDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Active Site—When myristoyl-CoA was added to the enzyme for crystallization set-up, the solution became colorless, indicating that the enzyme was completely reduced, and that the substrate was oxidized to form the product. However, after a few days, pale yellow crystals started to grow, suggesting that the enzyme was slowly re-oxidized by the molecular oxygen to either fully oxidized or semiquinone form. Because the stoichiometry of the enzyme (active site) (substrate was 1:3, and the flavin was nearly completely reduced upon addition of the substrate) it is reasonable to assume that the fatty acyl ligand in the crystalline protein is primarily the product, trans(2)-tetradecenoyl-CoA. However, the exact proportions of the different enzyme and the bound-ligand species in each crystal could not be determined. Therefore, we refer to the bound fatty acyl ligand as C14-CoA, even though the predominant form is the product. The Fo-Fc difference Fourier map near the isoalloxazine ring of the bound FAD exhibits a residual electron density, which could be fitted with a partial model of C14-CoA (Fig. 3A). Although the electron density for the myristate portion was very clear, the density in the area near where the CoA moiety is expected to bind was weak. Therefore, a partial CoA model showing a truncation in the pantothenic acid region was modeled into the binding cavity. The weak density in this region is most likely caused by a combination of a non-enzymatic partial hydrolysis of substrate/product at the thioester bond and high mobility of the CoA moiety. Although the crystallization medium contained substrate (myristoyl-CoA), at the relatively high pH of the solution (pH 7.5) and long crystallization period, it is not unusual to find the thioester hydrolysis product in the active site of a crystalline protein. To further support this contention, diffraction data were collected for co-crystals soaked for 24 h in the well buffer that did not contain substrate. Strong density was still observed for the acyl chain, but no interpretable density was observed for the entire CoA moiety (data not shown). These observations are a further indication: 1) that substrate was bound to and catalyzed by the enzyme to form the product, and 2) that after product was formed, non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the thioester bond has occurred. As a result, the acyl moiety was retained because of tight binding to the active site through two hydrogen bonds provided by the carbonyl group of the acyl moiety and the extensive hydrophobic interactions of the hydrocarbon chain with the polypeptide. The loosely bound CoA portion of the thioester substrate must have then dissociated from the active site after the hydrolysis. Thus, the binding mode of the partial C14-CoA modeled into the substrate cavity is the same as that of the acyl chain of the full C14-CoA bound to the enzyme. A similar situation was observed in the structure of the complex of ACO with dodecenoic acid (39Tokuoka K. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. Miyahara I. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Tamaoki H. Setoyama C. Tojo H. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When crystals of the binary complex were obtained by co-crystallization with dodecanoyl-CoA, only dodecenoic acid was observed in the crystal structure. Alternatively, weak electron density in the region expected to bind the CoA moiety may be explained by a combination of partial hydrolysis of the thioester bond and higher mobility of the CoA moiety as compared with other ACAD structures. In support of this possibility, some residual electron density is observed beyond the substrate thioester bond. In VLCAD, the acyl moiety is buried deep inside the molecule at the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. Glu-422 is located in a position analogous to the catalytic residues of MCAD and SCAD, near the C2-C3 atoms of the acyl-CoA substrate. Thus, the structure of VLCAD confirms the results of mutagenesis studies that indicate Glu-422 as the catalytic base (40Souri M. Aoyama T. Cox G.F. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4227-4231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As in the other ACAD structures, the arrangement of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, the C-2 and C-3 atoms of substrate, and the carboxylate of Glu-422 (Fig. 3A) is ideally suited for"

However, the significance of accumulation and interaction of low molecular weight crystallin fragments in aging and cataract development is not clearly understood. In this study, 23 low molecular mass (<3.5-kDa) peptides in the urea-soluble fractions of young, aged, and aged cataract human lenses were identified by mass spectroscopy. Two peptides, αB-(1–18) (MDIAIHHPWIRRPFFPFH) and βA3/A1-(59–74) (SD(N)AYHIERLMSFRPIC), present in aged and cataract lens but not young lens, and a third peptide, γS-(167–178) (SPAVQSFRRIVE) present in all three lens groups were synthesized to study the effects of interaction of these peptides with intact α-, β-, and γ-crystallins and alcohol dehydrogenase, a protein used in aggregation studies. Interaction of αB-(1–18) and βA3/A1-(59–74) peptides increased the scattering of light by β- and γ-crystallin and alcohol dehydrogenase. The ability of α-crystallin subunits to function as molecular chaperones was significantly reduced by interaction with αB-(1–18) and βA3/A1-(59–74) peptides, whereas γS peptide had no effect on chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin. The βA3/A1-(59–74 peptide caused a 5.64-fold increase in αB-crystallin oligomeric mass and partial precipitation. Replacing hydrophobic residues in αB-(1–18) and βA3/A1-(59–74) peptides abolished their ability to induce crystallin aggregation and light scattering.

Our study suggests that interaction of crystallin-derived peptides with intact crystallins could be a key event in age-related protein aggregation in lens and cataractogenesis. Lens proteins undergo very little turnover after synthesis, but they undergo various changes during aging and cataractogenesis (1Harding J.J. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Certain post-translational modifications appear to be part of the normal maturation process (2Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Yang Z.

Klose J. Jungblut P.R. Amino Acids. 2006; 30: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Changes in the structure and solubility of lens proteins depend on the extent and nature of the modification. Lens opacification is primarily due to the insolubilization of crystallins, proteins that are essential for maintaining the optical properties of the lens.Crystallin proteolysis is significantly increased in aged and cataract human lenses as compared with young human lenses (5Srivastava O.P.

Increased crystallin fragmentation in aged and cataract lenses has also been reported in nonhuman species (3Werten P.J. Vos E. De Jong W.W. Exp.

Unregulated proteolysis of crystallins is suggested to be one of the cause for crystallin insolubilization (13David L.L. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 90-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Degradation of lens crystallins by proteolytic enzymes can damage their highly ordered arrangements. An age-related decrease in the levels or activities of proteases could result in the accumulation of modified proteins (21Stadtman E.R.

Although a protein oxidation reaction may convert proteins to forms that are more susceptible to proteolytic degradation, the oxidized forms of some proteins not only are resistant to proteolytic degradation but also may inhibit the ability of some proteases to degrade the oxidized forms of other proteins. The protein-protein cross-linked derivatives have been found to resist proteolytic degradation and to inhibit the ability of the 20 S proteosome to degrade the oxidized forms of other proteins (23Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).Crystallin fragments are present in water-soluble and water-insoluble factions of the lens, with more prevalence in the water-insoluble fractions (6Srivastava O.P.

As many as 13 crystallin fragments with molecular masses between 3 and 17 kDa originating from α-, β-, and γ-crystallins have been isolated from the water-soluble high molecular weight aggregates of 60–80-year-old human lens (26Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Understanding the interaction between the lens proteins and the crystallin fragments is the key to assessing the consequence of incomplete proteolytic degradation. Protein aggregation in the lens increases with age, leading to the accumulation of high molecular weight aggregates that scatter light. Although it is hypothesized that cataract develops as a result of the improper interaction of crystallin fragments generated by proteolysis (17David L.L. Shearer T.R. Lens Eye Toxic Res. 1989; 6: 725-747PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which crystallin fragments initiate or influence the process of lens protein aggregation to form high molecular weight aggregates is not clear. Earlier, we showed that in vitro oxidized crystallin peptides enhance the aggregation of βL-crystallin and γ-crystallin and also exhibit an anti-chaperone-like property (27Senthilkumar R. Chaerkady R. Sharma K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39136-39143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Udupa E.G. Sharma K.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Peptide interactions with lens proteins and the aggregation-facilitating nature of lens peptides may be important in age-related cataract formation, where lens proteins undergo incomplete proteolysis and peptide fragments tend to accumulate.The present study was performed to identify crystallin fragments in young, aged, and cataract human lenses and investigate their possible role in crystallin aggregation and light scattering. Our data show that peptides generated in the lens interact with crystallins and increase their aggregation and precipitation. The results also demonstrate that crystallin peptides generated in vivo exhibit anti-chaperone-like activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—αB-crystallin peptide (1MDIAIHHPWIRRPFFPFH18) (peptide A), βA3/A1-crystallin peptide (59SD(N)AYHIERLMSFRPIC74) (peptide B), and γS-crystallin peptide (167SPAVQSFRRIVE178) (peptide G) and the mutant peptides were synthesized at the University of Missouri-Columbia core facility. The protease inhibitor mixture was obtained from Calbiochem. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 2The abbreviations used are:ADHalcohol dehydrogenaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flightMSmass spectrometryLMWlow molecular weightHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. was obtained from Biozyme Laboratories (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and from Sigma unless otherwise noted.Lenses—Human donor lenses were obtained from the Lions Eye Tissue Bank (Columbia, MO) and kept at -70 °C until use. Lenses were separated based on their age and color. Four lenses were analyzed from each group: young lenses (18–32 years), aged lenses (75–95 years), and aged cataract lenses. Young (2 years old) bovine lenses were obtained from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers, AR) and stored at -70 °C until use.Isolation and Identification of Peptides from Human Lens—Lenses were homogenized in 1 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 6 m urea, and 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) and in the presence of 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture. The sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The urea-soluble fraction was collected and filtered through a 10 kDa Centriplus filter (Millipore). The low molecular weight (LMW) peptides that were present in the filtrate were desalted using PepClean C-18 spin columns (Pierce). The bound peptides were eluted by 70% acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid. The eluted peptides were analyzed by ABI Voyager DE PRO matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nanoelectrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to identify and sequence the peptide ions.The low molecular weight fractions prepared from young, old, and cataract human lenses as above was dialyzed extensively using 1-kDa cut-off dialysis tubing, concentrated, and used in quantifying the relative light scattering activity in an aggregation assay.Preparation of Peptides—The synthetic peptides obtained from the core facility were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 column. The peptide mass and sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis at the University of Missouri-Columbia Proteomics Center. The purified peptides were dissolved in a small volume of Me2SO and equilibrated with 0.05 m phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4) using 1-kDa dialysis membrane. The peptide concentration in the dialyzed sample was measured using a micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Regional Distribution of LMW Peptides—A pair of 75-year-old lenses was used to measure the peptide concentration in the cortex and nucleus of aged human lens. The lens was thawed, and the capsule was carefully removed using a forceps. The outer cortex and inner nucleus were separated using the microstir bar in a glass vial using 0.05 m phosphate buffer containing 6 m urea, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and protease inhibitor mixture (20 μl/5 ml of buffer), pH 7.4. The lenses were stirred for about 3 min in 0.5 ml of buffer to solubilize the cortex. The nucleus was homogenized using a micro-tissue homogenizer using the same buffer. The sample volume was adjusted to 1.5 ml with homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 × g to remove the urea-insoluble fraction. 0.5 ml of the supernatant from the cortex and nucleus fraction was passed through 10 kDa cut-off filter to obtain the LMW peptides. 30 μl of the filtrate containing LMW peptides was desalted using PepClean spin column and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.Purification of Crystallins—α-Crystallin, β-crystallin, and γ-crystallin were separated from the water-soluble fractions of young bovine lens cortex by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column (30Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin was further purified on a trimethyl-aminoethyl fractogel ion exchange column, as described previously (29Udupa P.E. Sharma K.K. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). βL-Crystallin peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and used without further purification. γ-Crystallin was isolated from bovine lens extract by means of Sephadex G-200 and Biogel P-30 chromatography, as described previously (31Kumar R.S. Sharma K.K. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit. Recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Invitrogen) and purified using gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography, as described previously (32Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Interaction between Crystallin Peptides and Intact Crystallins—Interactions between intact α-, β-, and γ-crystallins and crystallin peptides A, B, and G were verified using HPLC and SDS-PAGE analysis.Recombinant αA-crystallin (250 μg) was incubated with 100 μg of peptide A, B, or G, in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Samples that contained αA-crystallin or peptide alone served as control. After 4 h of incubation, the samples were briefly centrifuged to separate any visible precipitate. Supernatant (350 μl) was injected into a TSK G5000PWXL (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) size exclusion column fitted to an HPLC system with a UV detector and equilibrated with phosphate buffer. The peak containing the αA-crystallin-peptide complex was pooled, concentrated, and analyzed on 4–20% Tris-HCl SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) electrophoresis.The interactions of βL- and γ-crystallin with each peptide were assessed by incubating 250 μg of the crystallin with 100 μg of the peptide at 55 °C for 1 h. Crystallin by itself was used as a control. At the end of incubation, the aggregated protein was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The precipitated protein was washed with deionized water and centrifuged to remove any soluble proteins or peptides. The procedure was repeated twice. The collected precipitate was solubilized in 200 μl of freshly prepared 6 m urea and diluted with water until the sample measured 1 ml. The sample was injected onto a reverse-phase analytical C-18 column (Vydac) equilibrated with water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The βL-crystallin subunits and the peptides were separated using acetonitrile gradient (5–80%).Light Scattering Measurements—The effects of peptide interaction on the molecular mass and the hydrodynamic radius of αB-crystallin were studied using static and dynamic light scattering. Recombinant αB-crystallin (300 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with an equal amount (weight) of the peptide in 0.5 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 m NaCl. At the end of incubation, the samples were centrifuged to remove visible precipitates. Supernatant (150 μl) was injected into a TSK G5000PWXL (Tosoh Bioscience) size exclusion column fitted to a high pressure liquid chromatograph with a refractive index detector (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) and equilibrated with the incubation buffer. The HPLC was coupled to multiangle light scattering and quasielastic light scattering detectors (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). Data were analyzed using ASTRA (5.1.9) software developed by Wyatt Technology.Thermal Denaturation and Light Scattering Assay—Thermal aggregation assay of βL-crystallin, γ-crystallin, and ADH and chaperone assay of α-crystallin were performed according to the method described previously (29Udupa P.E. Sharma K.K. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Santhoshkumar P. Sharma K.K. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrate protein βL-crystallin (100 μg) or γ-crystallin (100 μg) was heat-denatured at 55 °C in 1 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Aggregation and light scattering were monitored at 360 nm. Different concentrations of peptide A, peptide B, and peptide G were included in the assay mixture to determine their effect on substrate protein aggregation. A similar experiment was performed following incubation at 37 °C for 10 h to study the effect of each peptide on βL-crystallin aggregation at physiological temperature. To study the anti-chaperone activity of low molecular weight peptides, known concentrations of peptides A, B, and G were included in the assay mixture along with chaperone protein, α-crystallin, and substrate protein. Aggregation and light scattering were monitored as described above. To determine the specificity of these peptides in influencing protein aggregation, a few mutants of peptide A and peptide B were used to study their effects on protein aggregation and light scattering. ADH (250 μg) was chosen as a noncrystallin substrate protein to study the interaction with crystallin fragments.RESULTSWater-soluble protein fractions from young and aged human lenses were subjected to size exclusion chromatography coupled with dynamic light scattering analysis. We observed that, compared with the water-soluble fraction of young lens, the protein concentration in the water-soluble fraction of aged lens was decreased, whereas the mass distribution was increased (Fig. 1). The aged lens had soluble aggregates as large as 3500 kDa in contrast to soluble aggregates of 2000 kDa in the young lens.Low Molecular Weight Crystallin from Lenses Enhances Light Scattering by Denaturing Protein—We measured the light scattering ability of low molecular weight fractions (1–10-kDa fractions) isolated from young, adult, aged, and cataract human lenses using an ADH aggregation assay. As shown in the Table 1, the crystallin fragments present in 1–10-kDa fractions from young lenses showed the lowest light scattering activity compared with aged and cataract lens fractions. The cataract and aged lenses (≥70 years) showed 4.4–4.6-fold greater light scattering activity in them compared with young (14- and 16-year) lenses.TABLE 1Effect of whole lens low molecular weight fraction on protein aggregationGroup (age in years)Increase in light scatteringRelative light scattering activity%I (14 and 16)51.0II (41 and 42)91.8III (70)234.6IV (70, 75, 79, and 89)224.4 Open table in a new tab Identification of Crystallin Peptides from Human Lenses—The low molecular weight peptide profiles of young, aged, and cataract lenses analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS are shown in Fig. 2, A–C, respectively. Within each lens group, the MALDI-TOF peptide profiles were comparable. The number of peptides in young lenses was less than that in aged lenses. Peptide signals were prominent in aged and cataract lenses but not in young lenses, suggesting that the total peptide concentration is higher in aged and cataract lenses than in young lenses. Peptide concentrations, determined in a single lens from each group, were 0.29, 0.9, and 1.1 mg/lens in young, aged, and cataract lenses, respectively. Peptides that were common to each group of lenses and smaller than 3500 Da were analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry to determine the sequence and origin of peptides. The peptides that were found in the young, aged, and aged cataract lenses and sequenced from MS/MS analysis are listed in Table 2. The GenBank™ accession numbers used to match the sequence of crystallin peptides are given in Table 2. The βA3/A1 peptide sequence was numbered based on a truncated βA3/A1 sequence submitted to GenBank™. The data indicate that crystallin fragments are generated from all major lens crystallins. Sequences could not be assigned to less abundant peptides identified by MALDI-TOF MS, and these peptides were excluded from the Table 2. Analysis of a 75-year-old lens showed that the concentration of LMW peptides is higher in the nucleus (931 μg) than in the outer cortex (338 μg). We also observed a differential distribution of individual peptides in the cortex and nucleus based on the MALDI-TOF MS signal intensity (data not shown). The signal intensity of αA-(43–56) and αB-(45–57) peptides was highest and quite prominent in the cortex. However, in the nucleus, these peptides had a weak signal (<4% of their signal intensity in the cortex). The peptides A, B, and αA-(66–80) were found only in the nucleus. Other peptides, including peptide G, were present in both regions, but their signal intensities were 5–10-fold higher in the nucleus.FIGURE 2MALDI-TOF-MS of low molecular weight peptides isolated from young (32 years) (A), aged (94 years) (B), and cataract (87 years) (C) human lenses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Low molecular weight peptides identified in the young, aged, and cataract human lenses using MALDI-TOF MS and quadrupole time-of-flight MS/MSPeptide massSourceAccession numberFound inPeptide sequence from MS/MS analysisYoungAgedCataract922.43αB-(59–66)NP_001876NoYesYesPSWFDTGL1152.64αA-(67–75)NP_000385YesNoNoDRDKFVIFL1239.67αA-(66–75)NP_000385NoYesYesSDRDKFVIFL1381.64αB-(24–34)NP_001876NoNoYesFDQFFGEHLLE1388.77γS-(167–178)NP_060011YesYesYesSPAVQSFRRIVE1426.75αA-(2–12)NP_000385NoYesYesDVTIQHPWFKR1527.81αA-(2–13)NP_000385NoYesYesDVTIQHPWFKRT1550.84αB-(45–57)NP_001876YesYesNoSPFYLRPPSFLRA1730.96αA-(43–56)NP_000385YesYesYesTISPYYRQSLFRTV1778.91αA-(67–80)NP_000385NoYesYesDRDKFVIFLDVKHF1835.01αA-(51–65)NP_000385NoNoYesSrLFRTVLDSGISEVRaMS/MS reported an extra Arg residue, which is shown as a lowercase letter1847.99αA-(66–80)NP_000385NoYesYesSDRDKFVIFLDVKHF-H201865.94αA-(66–80)NP_000385NoYesYesSDRDKFVIFLDVKHF1938.43βA3/A1-(59–74)AAC50971NoYesYesSD(N)AYHIERLMSFRPIC1963.07αA-(50–65)NP_000385NoNoYesQSrLFRTVLDSGISEVRaMS/MS reported an extra Arg residue, which is shown as a lowercase letter2064.09βB2-(181–196)AAB25691YesNoYesPQVQSVRRIRDMQWHQ2187.16αB-(2–18)NP_001876NoYesYesDIAIHHPWIRRPFFPFH2359.18αB-(1–18)NP_001876NoYesYesAce-MDIAIHHPWIRRPFFPFH2598.35β(γ)S-(2–22)P22914NoYesYesAce-SKTGTKITFYEDKNFQGRRYD2930.62βB2-(181–204)AAB25691YesNoYesPQVQSVRRIRDMQWHQRGAFHPSN3196.99βA3-(190–215)NP_005199YesYesYesGDYKHWREWGSHAQTSQIQSIRRIQQ3252.65βA3-(189–215)NP_005199YesYesYesGGDYKHWREWGSHAQTSQIQSIRRIQQ3389.74βA3-(188–215)NP_005199YesYesYesHGGDYKHWREWGSHAQTSQIQSIRRIQQa MS/MS reported an extra Arg residue, which is shown as a lowercase letter Open table in a new tab In vitro oxidized crystallin peptides were shown in our previous studies to interact with lens crystallins and to influence their aggregation and light scattering (27Senthilkumar R.

The present study investigated whether in vivo found crystallin fragments interact with lens crystallins and produce similar effects on aggregation and light scattering. We selected the following three peptides for further study: αB-crystallin peptide (1MDIAIHHPWIRRPFFPFH18), βA3/A1-crystallin peptide (59SD(N)AYHIERLMSFRPIC74), and γS-crystallin peptide (167SPAVQSFRRIVE178), named peptide A, peptide B, and peptide G, respectively, based on the crystallin protein from which they were derived. A deamidated form of βA3/A1-(59–74) was used as peptide B. Peptides A and B are found only in the aged and cataract lenses, and peptide G is present in young, aged, and cataract lenses.Crystallin Peptides Can Alter the Oligomerization of αB- and αA-crystallins—Incubation with peptide A or peptide B increased the mass distribution of αB-crystallin (Fig. 3, A and B). However, incubation with peptide G had no effect on the oligomeric mass of αB-crystallin (data not shown). Peptide A and peptide B increased the average oligomeric mass of αB-crystallin by 1.23- and 5.64-fold, respectively (Table 3). During incubation with peptide B, slight precipitation of αB-crystallin occurred. Elimination of the precipitate by centrifugation caused a decrease in the peak intensity of αB-crystallin-peptide B complex (Fig. 3B). The polydispersity of αB-crystallin increased in response to interaction with peptide A or B (Table 3). The hydrodynamic radius of αB-crystallin nearly doubled upon interacting with peptide B. αA-crystallin also exhibited an increase in the oligomeric mass but to a lesser extent upon interaction with peptide A or peptide B (data not shown). Unlike with αB-crystallin, αA-crystallin did not aggregate on interaction with peptide B. Analysis of the αA-peptide complex recovered during gel filtration studies by SDS-PAGE confirmed that only peptides A and B bind to αA-crystallin (Fig. 4). The results show that peptides A and B interact with αA- and αB-crystallin and alter their structure and dynamics, whereas peptide G has no effect.FIGURE 3Increased oligomerization of αB-crystallin in response to interaction with peptides A and B.

https://openalex.org/W2009266031,"Myoblast fusion is fundamental to the development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. To fuse, myoblasts undergo cell-cell recognition and adhesion and merger of membranes between apposing cells. Cell migration must occur in advance of these events to bring myoblasts into proximity, but the factors that regulate myoblast motility are not fully understood. CD164 is a cell surface sialomucin that is targeted to endosomes and lysosomes via its intracellular region. In hematopoietic progenitor cells, CD164 forms complexes with the motility-stimulating chemokine receptor, CXCR4, in response to the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12/SDF-1 (Forde, S., Tye, B. J., Newey, S. E., Roubelakis, M., Smythe, J., McGuckin, C. P., Pettengell, R., and Watt, S. M. (2007) Blood 109, 1825–1833). We have previously shown that CD164 stimulates myotube formation in vitro. We report here that CD164 is associated with CXCR4 in C2C12 myoblasts. Cells in which CD164 levels are increased or decreased via overexpression or RNA interference-mediated knockdown, respectively, show enhanced or reduced myotube formation and cell migration, the latter both basally and in response to CXCL12/SDF-1. Furthermore, expression of CD164 cytoplasmic tail mutants that alter the endosome/lysosome targeting sequence and, consequently, the subcellular localization in myoblasts, reveals a similar correlation between cell motility and myotube formation. Finally, Cd164 mRNA is expressed in the dorsal somite (the early myogenic compartment of the mouse embryo) and in premuscle masses. Taken together, these results suggest that CD164 is a regulator of myoblast motility and that this property contributes to its ability to promote myoblast fusion into myotubes.

During vertebrate embryogenesis, skeletal muscle precursor cells originate in somites and undergo a multistep process of lineage commitment, migration, and differentiation into myofibers (1Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2000; 48: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Differentiation is itself a complex process, in which committed myoblasts exit the cell cycle, express muscle-specific genes, alter their morphology, and fuse to form elongated, multinucleated syncytia (2Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. Cells Tissues Organs. 2004; 176: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3Perry R.L.S. Rudnicki M.A. Front.

Individual steps in myogenesis, including cell migration and differentiation, are promoted by cell surface proteins, including specific cadherins, integrins, and Ig superfamily members (5Krauss R.S.

CXCR4, a chemokine receptor that regulates migration and survival of hematopoietic and neuronal precursor cells, has recently been shown to play a role in skeletal muscle development (8Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, 9Odemis V. Lamp E.

Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). CXCR4 is expressed in migrating muscle progenitor cells of the vertebrate embryo, whereas the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (aka SDF-1), is expressed in the mesenchyme of the limb, functioning as an attractant for CXCR4+ muscle precursors (9Odemis V. Lamp E. Pezeshki G. Moepps B. Schilling K. Gierschik P. Littman D.R. Engele J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Vasyutina E. Stebler J. Brand-Saberi B. Schulz S. Raz E. Birchmeier C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, CXCR4–/– mouse embryos show defects in migration of these cells and have reduced musculature (9Odemis V. Lamp E. Pezeshki G. Moepps B. Schilling K. Gierschik P. Littman D.R. Engele J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Vasyutina E. Stebler J. Brand-Saberi B. Schulz S. Raz E. Birchmeier C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another cell surface protein, the mannose receptor, is also important for myofiber growth in vivo and functions in vitro to promote fusion with nascent myotubes (12Jansen K.M. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mannose receptor stimulates motility and directed migration of myogenic cells, and this was suggested to be a mechanism by which it promoted cell-cell fusion and myotube growth. It is logical that muscle precursor cells must “find” each other while in a motile state and then adhere to one another for differentiation, including fusion, to ensue. Regulation of cell motility might therefore be an important general mechanism in the formation of myofibers in vivo and myotubes in vitro. In a screen for cell surface proteins that promote myogenesis, we identified CD164 (aka endolyn), a widely expressed sialomucin implicated in adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Watt S.M. Chan J. Y.-H. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2000; 37: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cd164 mRNA is expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and increases during differentiation of these cells. Stable overexpression of CD164 in myoblasts enhanced myogenesis, whereas expression of a soluble CD164 ectodomain reduced it. Interestingly, alteration of CD164 level or function had a greater effect on formation of multinucleated myotubes than on expression of muscle-specific proteins, suggesting that it might be more involved with regulating myoblast fusion than in coordinating the entire myogenic program (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CD164 has an extracellular region with two heavily glycosylated mucin domains, a transmembrane domain, and a 13-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail that terminates with the sequence YHTL (15Ihrke G. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Zannettino A.C.W. Buhring H.-J. Niutta S. Watt S.M. Benton M.A. Simmons P.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2613-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence conforms to the YXXΦ motif (X being any amino acid and Φ being a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) that targets proteins to endosomes and lysosomes via the trans-Golgi network (15Ihrke G. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Ihrke G. Bruns J.R. Luzio J.P. Weisz O.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6256-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A glycine residue preceding the tyrosine in YXXΦ motifs is necessary for efficient “direct” transport from the Golgi to endosomes, bypassing the cell surface (18Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Ihrke G. Kyttälä A. Russell M.R.G. Rous B.A. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 946-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Proteins with YXXΦ motifs that lack glycine at the “Y – 1” position are transported to the plasma membrane prior to entering the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, defining an “indirect” route (18Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Ihrke G. Kyttälä A. Russell M.R.G. Rous B.A. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 946-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CD164 has an asparagine residue at the Y – 1 position, and consistent with lack of glycine at this position, in epithelial and hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, CD164 is located primarily in endosomes and lysosomes. However, in a minority of cells, CD164 is prominently expressed at the cell surface (19Chan J. Y.-H. Lee-Prudhoe J.E. Jorgensen B. Ihrke G. Doyonnas R. Zannettino A.C.W. Buckle V.J. Ward C.J.

As specific lysosomal proteins are required for efficient myoblast fusion (20Gogos J.A. Thompson R. Lowry W. Sloane B.F. Weintraub H. Horwitz M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether CD164 exerts its effects on myotube formation from a vesicular or plasma membrane location. Furthermore, it was recently shown that CD164 associates with CXCR4 in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and RNAi-mediated 5The abbreviations used are:RNAiRNA interferenceDMdifferentiation mediumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMHCmyosin heavy chainRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCREembryonic day. 5The abbreviations used are:RNAiRNA interferenceDMdifferentiation mediumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMHCmyosin heavy chainRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCREembryonic day. knockdown of CD164 inhibited migration of these cells toward the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (21Forde S.

We report here that: 1) CD164 associates with CXCR4 in C2C12 cells; 2) RNAi-mediated knockdown of CD164 inhibits both migration of C2C12 cells toward CXCL12 and myotube formation; and 3) the ability of CD164 cytoplasmic tail mutants to promote myotube formation correlates with cell surface location and ability to promote motility in response to CXCL12. Taken together, these results suggest that CD164 promotes myogenesis by enhancing CXCR4-dependent cell motility.

Expression Vectors—All expression vectors were constructed with a combination of conventional cloning and PCR techniques; complete details are available on request. To construct a GFP-tagged CD164 expression vector, a sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted between codons 24 and 25 of a complete mouse Cd164 open reading frame in the expression vector pMV7 (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This GFP-Cd164 cDNA was then inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector, and cytoplasmic tail mutants were constructed from this. The N193G, Y194A, and ΔC mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described by Makarova et al. (22Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For RNAi studies, oligonucleotides corresponding to five different mouse Cd164 sequences were cloned into the pSilencer 2.0-U6 vector (Ambion). Two effective sequences were chosen for further use and correspond to nucleotides 205–223 (RNAi-3) and 473–491 (RNAi-4) of murine CD164 (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. NM_016898); the sequences are: RNAi-3, 5′-CCTGTGCGAGCTTCAACAG-3′ and RNAi-4, 5′-TACCACACTGACTCCAACC-3′. For rescue experiments with RNAi-4 and GFP-CD164 and cytoplasmic tail mutants, seven silent mutations were introduced into each GFP-CD164 construct at the RNAi-sequence (mutations indicated in bold: 5′-TACGACTT-TAACACCGACG-3′), again by the technique of Makarova et al. (22Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), so as to render them impervious to RNAi-mediated knockdown. All site-directed mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture—C2C12 and 293T cells were cultured as described previously (23Kang J.-S. Yi M.-J. Zhang W. Feinleib J.L. Cole F. Krauss R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To induce differentiation, C2C12 cells were transferred from medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum into medium containing 2% horse serum (differentiation medium, DM). Quantification of myotube formation, by counting the number of nuclei in myosin heavy chain (MHC)+ cells, was performed as described previously (23Kang J.-S. Yi M.-J. Zhang W. Feinleib J.L. Cole F. Krauss R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For transient and stable expression of CD164 variants, C2C12 cells were transfected with the appropriate pcDNA3.1-based vector and FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science); stable expressors were selected as G418-resistant colonies and pooled for analysis. For stable RNAi expression studies, C2C12 cells were transfected with pSilencer 2.0-U6 vector containing the RNAi sequences described above or, as a control, an irrelevant sequence, and FuGENE 6, and hygromycin-resistant colonies were selected and pooled for analysis. For experiments in which CD164 variants were assessed for their ability to rescue the effects of Cd164 RNAi, a transient co-expression approach was employed as described in Kang et al. (23Kang J.-S. Yi M.-J. Zhang W. Feinleib J.L. Cole F. Krauss R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 cells were cotransfected with pSilencer 2.0 U6/RNAi-4, the appropriate pcDNA3.1/GFP-CD164 vectors, and pQ-lacZ, a vector driving expression of nuclear-localized β-galactosidase. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were transferred into medium plus 2% horse serum, and 48 h after that, fixed and stained for both MHC and β-galactosidase activity. Transfection efficiencies for these experiments were ∼10% to minimize fusion of independent β-galactosidase+ transfectants (23Kang J.-S. Yi M.-J. Zhang W. Feinleib J.L. Cole F. Krauss R.S. J.

Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR analyses—Western blot and immunoprecipitation analyses were done as described previously (25Kang J.-S. Mulieri P.J. Hu Y. Taliana L. Krauss R.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were anti-CD164 (R&D Systems), anti-MHC (MF20; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-cadherin (AbCam), anti-GFP (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-CXCR4 (AbCam), and anti-EEA1 (AbCam). For immunofluorescence, C2C12 cells cultured in six-well plates were transfected with 500 ng of control pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1/GFP-CD164 constructs. Thirty-six to 48 h later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 5% goat serum, and probed with anti-cadherin antibodies (1:200; visualized with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes)) and also visualized for direct GFP fluorescence on a ZEISS LSM-510 Meta confocal microscope. For RT-PCR analyses of CXCL12 and Gapdh mRNA expression, the following primers were used with total RNA and 30 cycles of amplification: CXCL12 forward primer, 5′-TGCATCAGTGACGGTAAAC-3′, CXCL12 reverse primer, 5′-TATGCTATGGCGGAGTGTC-3′; Gapdh forward primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; and Gapdh reverse primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (26Fernando R.N. Luff S.E. Albiston A.L. Chai S.Y. J.

Briefly, cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and fractionated by sequential centrifugation steps. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate a vesicle-containing soluble fraction and membrane-containing pellet fraction. The membrane-containing pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The vesicle-containing soluble fraction was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting vesicle-containing pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The vesicle and membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Motility Assays—C2C12 cells expressing GFP-CD164 constructs, Cd164 RNAi contructs, or appropriate control vectors were analyzed using a 96-well Boyden chamber assay with a polycarbonate filter (8-μm pores; NeuroProbe, K.U. Leuven, Belgium). Cell migration is measured as the number of cells that migrate from the top of the filter through the pores to the bottom in response to medium in the lower chamber. Briefly, the lower wells of each chamber were loaded with 395 μl of control medium (to evaluate basal migration) or medium containing 200 ng/ml CXCL12. Cells (7.5 × 104) in 200 μl of control medium were loaded into each upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C. After 5 h, the filter was wiped clean of cells that had not migrated, fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min, and incubated in Gill-2 hematoxylin (Thermo Electron Corp., Pittsburgh, PA) for 6–12 h to stain cells that had migrated. The total number of cells in 20 fields (on a phase contrast microscope) per well was determined. All conditions were tested in triplicate wells, and the experiment was repeated three times. Whole Mount RNA in Situ Hybridization—CD1 mice were allowed to mate, and noon of the plug date was designated embryonic day (E) 0.5. Embryos collected at E9.5 and E10.5 were prepared for whole mount RNA in situ hybridization essentially as described (28Mulieri P.J. Okada A. Sassoon D.A. McConnell S.K. Krauss R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A mouse Cd164 cDNA (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Bluescript vector pSK+, and digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase using the Roche Applied Science DIG RNA labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Embryos were allowed to hybridize with the riboprobe as described in detail in Mulieri et al. (28Mulieri P.J. Okada A. Sassoon D.A. McConnell S.K. Krauss R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); they were subsequently washed, blocked, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and developed with color was BM purple AP substrate, precipitating (Roche Applied Science) (28Mulieri P.J. Okada A. Sassoon D.A. McConnell S.K. Krauss R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cd164 Is Expressed in Somites during Mouse Development—CD164 is expressed in myoblast cell lines (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but little is known of its expression pattern during myogenesis in vivo. To determine whether Cd164 is expressed during early stages of skeletal muscle development, whole mount in situ hybridization was performed on mouse embryos at E9.5 and E10.5. At both stages, Cd164 was expressed strongly in the dorsal somite, the structure of origin for skeletal muscle precursors (Fig. 1). Cd164 is also expressed at later stages of muscle development; thin section in situ hybridization analysis of E14.5 embryos performed by GenePaint revealed strong expression of Cd164 in premuscle masses of the limb and trunk (29Visel A. Thaller C. Eichele G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D552-D556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CD164 Mutants Modulates Myotube Formation—In epithelial and hematopoietic precursor cell lines, CD164 is present in both vesicular and cell surface locations, with targeting regulated by glycosylation and by its C-terminal YHTL sequence (15Ihrke G. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Ihrke G. Bruns J.R. Luzio J.P. Weisz O.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6256-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Potter B.A. Weixel K.M. Bruns J.R. Ihrke G. Weisz O.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the YHTL sequence in the promyogenic activity of CD164, we initially constructed a GFP-tagged version of CD164. A GFP-encoding sequence was inserted in-frame between residues Gln-24 and Pro-25, placing it downstream of the signal sequence but upstream of the first predicted oligosaccharide attachment site (19Chan J. Y.-H. Lee-Prudhoe J.E. Jorgensen B. Ihrke G. Doyonnas R. Zannettino A.C.W. Buckle V.J. Ward C.J. Simmons P.J. Watt S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2139-2152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting construct, GFP-CD164, was transiently expressed in 293T cells, and lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies to CD164 or GFP; wild-type CD164 was also expressed as a control. 293 cells express CD164 endogenously (31Jorgensen-Tye B. Levesque J.P. Royle L. Doyonnas R. Chan J.Y. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Harvey D.J. Simmons P.J. Watt S.M. Tissue Antigens. 2005; 65: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as an ∼85-kDa species, and overexpression of wild-type CD164 increased the signal intensity of this band (Fig. 2A). Expression of GFP-CD164 resulted in a band of similar size that was immunoreactive with antibodies to both CD164 and GFP (Fig. 2A). GFP-CD164 therefore migrates with an apparent molecular mass that is smaller than expected by about the amount contributed by GFP itself (∼26 kDa). Because GFP is in the extreme N terminus of GFP-CD164, GFP-CD164 is cell-associated (see below), and the CD164 cytoplasmic tail is only 13 amino acids long; the most likely explanation for this aberrant migration is that the presence of GFP in the ectodomain resulted in an altered glycosylation pattern, likely producing a protein with lower oligosaccharide content than wild-type CD164. Transient overexpression of GFP-CD164 in 293T cells also resulted in variable amounts of a much higher molecular weight immunoreactive band (Fig. 2A). This band was not seen in C2C12 cell transfectants (supplemental Fig. S1A), and inclusion of 0.1% SDS in the lysis buffer converted this high molecular mass band to the ∼85-kDa band (supplemental Fig. S1B). This high molecular mass band is therefore very likely to represent protein aggregates formed by high level overexpression in 293T cells. To assess the activity of GFP-CD164, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with a vector designed to drive expression of this protein and a puromycin resistance gene. Transfected cultures were selected and analyzed for total immunoreactive CD164 levels and production of muscle-specific proteins and myotubes when stimulated to differentiate. GFP-CD164 transfectants produced approximately twice the amount of immunoreactive CD164 protein as control cultures transfected with an expression vector lacking a cDNA insert (Fig. 2B; the GFP-CD164 protein was also detectable with antibodies to GFP (see Fig. 4A)). Similar to our published findings with wild-type CD164 (13Lee Y.-N. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7696-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), stable expression of GFP-CD164 significantly enhanced myotube formation (as assessed by the size of MHC+ myotubes produced and by the increased percentage of myotubes with more than five nuclei; Fig. 2, C and D) but had little or no effect on expression of MyoD, myogenin, and MHC (supplemental Fig. S2A). These results suggest that the putative altered glycosylation pattern present in GFP-CD164 did not significantly change its function in this assay and that GFP-CD164 is therefore a useful construct for further analysis of the C-terminal YHTL sequence. Functional analyses of the YXXΦ motif of several different proteins allows construction of site-directed mutants that are expected to have a greater or lesser fraction at the cell surface (18Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Ihrke G. Kyttälä A. Russell M.R.G. Rous B.A. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 946-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutation of the tyrosine in the terminal YHTL sequence of CD164 to alanine should result in production of a protein (designated Y194A) that is inefficiently targeted to the endosomal/lysosomal (vesicular) compartment and thus would be predicted to have a greater fraction of the total residing at the cell surface. Conversely, mutation of the Y – 1 position from asparagine to glycine should produce a protein (designated N193G) that is directly transported to endosomes/lysosomes and would be predicted to have a smaller fraction at the cell surface. These mutants were constructed in the context of GFP-CD164, as was a mutant that deleted all but two amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (designated ΔC; Fig. 3A). Vectors encoding each mutant, as well as GFP-CD164 itself, were transiently expressed in C2C12 myoblasts, and their localization was examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy in proliferating mononucleated cells and in nascent myotubes produced by incubation of the cells in DM for 2 days. In mononucleated myoblasts, GFP-CD164 was expressed largely in a vesicular pattern that was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, the N193G mutant was strongly concentrated in a perinuclear location, and the Y194A mutant was much less punctate than wild type, with substantial cell surface expression (Fig. 3B). The ΔC mutant displayed a localization that appeared intermediate between wild type and N193G, with the punctate signal in larger structures (Fig. 3B). In nascent myotubes, these differences were not as pronounced, with GFP-CD164 and each mutant showing mainly localization to a vesicular compartment (Fig. 3C). The distribution of these proteins in mononucleated C2C12 myoblasts was also analyzed by fractionation of cell lysates into vesicle and membrane preparations. Approximately twice the amount of GFP-CD164 was present in the vesicular fraction as in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3D). This ratio is reversed from that observed with endogenous CD164 (Fig. 3E), likely because of overexpression. However, the N193G and Y194A mutants were expressed at the same overall level as GFP-CD164 (Fig. 3D), and their distribution was altered as predicted. As compared with GFP-CD164, a greater percentage of N193G was found in the vesicle fraction, and a lower percentage was found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3D). Conversely, a much higher percentage of Y194A was present in the membrane fraction than seen with GFP-CD164, with cor"

The SALM family is comprised of five homologous molecules that are expressed largely in the central nervous system. SALMs 1-3 contain PDZ-binding domains, whereas SALMs 4 and 5 do not. We are interested in characterizing the interactions of the SALMs both among the individual members and with other binding partners. In the present study, we focused on the interactions formed by the five SALM members in rat brain and heterologous cells. In brain, we found that SALMs 1-3 strongly co-immunoprecipitated with each other, whereas SALMs 4 and 5 did not, suggesting that SALMs 4 and 5 mainly form homomeric complexes. In heterologous cells transfected with SALMs, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that all five SALMs form heteromeric and homomeric complexes. We also determined if SALMs could form trans-cellular associations between transfected heterologous cells. Both SALMs 4 and 5 formed homophilic, but not heterophilic associations, whereas no trans associations were formed by the other SALMs. The ability of SALM4 to form trans interactions is due to its extracellular N terminus because chimeras of SALM4 N terminus and SALM2 C terminus can form trans interactions, whereas chimeras of SALM2 N terminus and SALM4 C terminus cannot. Co-culture experiments using HeLa cells and rat hippocampal neurons expressing the SALMs showed that SALM4 is recruited to points of contact between the cells. In neurons, these points of contact were seen in both axons and dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2056767067,"In search of alpha-galactosidases with improved kinetic properties for removal of the immunodominant alpha1,3-linked galactose residues of blood group B antigens, we recently identified a novel prokaryotic family of alpha-galactosidases (CAZy GH110) with highly restricted substrate specificity and neutral pH optimum (Liu, Q. P., Sulzenbacher, G., Yuan, H., Bennett, E. P., Pietz, G., Saunders, K., Spence, J., Nudelman, E., Levery, S. B., White, T., Neveu, J. M., Lane, W. S., Bourne, Y., Olsson, M. L., Henrissat, B., and Clausen, H. (2007) Nat. Biotechnol. 25, 454-464). One member of this family from Bacteroides fragilis had exquisite substrate specificity for the branched blood group B structure Galalpha1-3(Fucalpha1-2)Gal, whereas linear oligosaccharides terminated by alpha1,3-linked galactose such as the immunodominant xenotransplantation epitope Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc did not serve as substrates. Here we demonstrate the existence of two distinct subfamilies of GH110 in B. fragilis and thetaiotaomicron strains. Members of one subfamily have exclusive specificity for the branched blood group B structures, whereas members of a newly identified subfamily represent linkage specific alpha1,3-galactosidases that act equally well on both branched blood group B and linear alpha1,3Gal structures. We determined by one-dimensional (1)H NMR spectroscopy that GH110 enzymes function with an inverting mechanism, which is in striking contrast to all other known alpha-galactosidases that use a retaining mechanism. The novel GH110 subfamily offers enzymes with highly improved performance in enzymatic removal of the immunodominant alpha3Gal xenotransplantation epitope."

To identify residues mediating cation symport, Escherichia coli proton-dependent manganese transporter (MntH) was mutated at five SLC11-specific transmembrane (TM) sites; each mutant activity was compared with wild-type MntH, and the biochemical results were tested by homology threading.

MntH TM topology was established and selected mutations resulted in similar phenotypes in MntH and Nramp2 variants (6Courville P. Chaloupka R. Cellier M.F. Biochem.

In addition, E. coli MntH wild-type (WT) lacks cysteine residues, and site-directed introduction of Cys moieties combined to thiol modifications allows for detailed structural and functional mapping (16Kaback H.R.

SLC11-dependent transport is typified by broad selectivity (e.g. Mn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) and Me2+-specific interactions, including a range of Me2+/H+ stoichiometries depending on external conditions (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Chen X. Peng J. Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. Hediger M.A. J.

The H+-dependent Me2+ transport mechanism of eukaryotic Nramp homologs was deduced from studies of Me2+ uptake and Me2+-evoked currents, the external pH altering the transporter affinity for Me2+ and the stoichiometry of H+ and Me2+ fluxes (2Mackenzie B. Hediger M.A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5Nevo Y. Nelson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Kinetic models for H+-coupled transport usually imply that H+ binding or uptake depends at least partly on the membrane potential (Δψ, and at high proton concentration (pH 5.5), large Me2+-induced currents are mainly due to H+ charge transfer across the membrane (17Chen X.

Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 451: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To identify features defining the mechanism of transport of the SLC11 family, sites representing evolutionary type II rate shifts were targeted because they represent a radical shift in amino acid properties, which can contribute to functional divergence among homologous proteins including membrane proteins (20Gaucher E.A. Gu X. Miyamoto M.M. Benner S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Gu X. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses distinguished the SLC11 family from a group of distantly related sequences (outgroup <30% amino acid identity). Four type II rate shifts were identified at TM sites displaying polar or charged SLC11-specific amino acids matched by distinct outgroup-specific residues (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reciprocal residue exchange and additional mutations at each of these sites in TMS1, TMS6, and TMS11 were characterized, showing individual roles of each site in the Me2+ and/or H+ symport (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); among them residue Asp34 appeared crucial for transport activity but its functional role remains undefined (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Haemig H.A. Brooker R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 201: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to elucidate the individual roles of the TM residues identified as evolutionary type II rate shift sites by analyzing the impact of the SLC11/outgroup reciprocal mutations on Me2+ and H+ uptake kinetics and thermodynamics in vivo and in vitro, by probing the in situ accessibility of targeted sites, and by selecting a tridimensional structural fold obtained by threading that fits our experimental results. Site-directed Mutagenesis of E. coli MntH—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used to generate novel mutants are listed in supplemental Table 1. Mutant clones were selected by profiling in vivo Me2+ sensitivity conferred upon expression in a metallo-dependent E. coli background (12Makui H. Roig E. Cole S.T. Helmann J.D. Gros P. Cellier M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Full-length DNA sequence was determined for one clone of several that were functionally tested (CEQ 2000XL, Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, ON). The 12TMS-His10 construct was generated by adding the 12th TMS of the Lactobacillus casei MntH Cβ1 homolog (23Richer E. Courville P. Bergevin I. Cellier M.F. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a His10 tag. A StuI restriction site was introduced prior to the mntH stop codon to enable swapping of a StuI-XbaI flanked fragment of mntH Cβ1 (residues 469–530, followed by a poly-His coding sequence). Fluorescent Measurements of H+ Transport in Vivo—Metal-induced intracellular acidification was measured using a pH-dependent ratiometric green fluorescent protein, pHluorin, and cells resuspended at an A600 of 0.2 in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.7–5.7) (14Courville P. Chaloupka R. Veyrier F. Cellier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3318-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission (wave-length 520 nm) was measured on a Fluoromax-2 spectrophotometer (Jobin-Yvon, SPEX) after dual excitation at 410 and 470 nm. MntH-dependent intracellular acidification was deduced from [H+] changes post-metal addition and monitored for 1000 s. Energy of activation (Ea) values were deduced from [H+] changes 250 s after addition of 10 μm Cd2+ at temperatures varying from 15 to 37 °C. Preparation of Right-side Out and Inside Out Membrane Vesicles—E. coli strain G536 (24Grass G. Franke S. Taudte N. Nies D.H. Kucharski L.M. Maguire M.E. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) lacking several Fe2+ and Mn2+ transport systems (W3110 ΔfecABCDE::kan ΔzupT::cat ΔmntH ΔentC ΔfeoABC) was transformed with derivatives of pBAD24 expressing native or mutant MntH. Individual clones were cultured in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C and 250 rpm until an A600 of 0.6 was reached. MntH expression was induced for 1 h using 0.1% arabinose. Right-side out vesicles (RSOV) were prepared by osmotic lysis (25Quick M. Tomasevic J. Wright E.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9147-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except that spheroplasts were lysed in 0.1 m potassium Pi, pH 7.5, washed, and resuspended in 0.1 m Pipes-Mes, pH 7.5. Inside out vesicles (ISOV) were prepared by one passage of the cells (2.5 mg wet weight/ml) through an Aminco French Press at 16,000 p.s.i. in 0.1 m potassium Pi, pH 7.5, buffer (26Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). RSOV and ISOV were resuspended in 0.1 m Pipes-Mes, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 10–15 mg of protein/ml. The polarity of these preparations was tested by fluorescence spectrophotometry (supplemental Fig. S3) using indicators of (i) changes in Δψ or ΔpH resulting from respiration (negative/alkaline or positive/acidic inside, respectively, for RSOV or ISOV), or (ii) topological accessibility of single Cys residues introduced in MntH extramembranous loops formerly assigned to either side of the membrane (14Courville P. Chaloupka R. Veyrier F. Cellier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3318-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These Cys mutants (MntH 12TMS-His10) catalyzed Cd2+-induced intracellular H+ uptake (supplemental Fig. 3, E and F). 109Cd2+ Transport Assays—We used Cd2+ as substrate for MntH because it triggers larger intracellular acidification compared with Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 109Cd (specific activity 60 mCi/μmol; GE Healthcare, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada) uptake was performed by a quick filtration assay in 0.1 (vesicles preparations) or 0.05 m Pipes-Mes (intact cells), pH 6.5 or 7.5, at 24 °C unless otherwise specified. Samples (0.1 ml) were removed at the indicated times and immediately filtered through 0.45-μm Metricel GN-6 filters (PALL, East Hills, NY; whole cells), 0.75-μm borosilicate GF75 microfiber filters (Advantec MFS Inc., Dublin, CA; RSOV), and 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ; ISOV). Filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer containing 1 mm CdCl2. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, using protein concentrations of 50 (RSOV), 200 (ISOV), and ∼700 μg/ml (whole cells, corresponding to an OD420 of 10) as determined by protein assay using a modified Lowry procedure (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). Vesicles were energized by adding 2 mm l-ascorbate and 0.02 mm N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (PMS/Asc), 10 mm d-lactate, or 5 mm NADH, for 3.5 min prior to the addition of Cd2+. Ionophores (1 μm valinomycin, 0.1 μm nigericin, and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, CCCP) were added 1 min prior to PMS/Asc addition. Ea (28Zhang W. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14538-14542Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was measured using whole cells at pH 6.5 during the initial, linear phase of Cd2+ uptake (after 10 s or 1 min) at temperatures varying from 24 to 37 °C. MntH specificity for Mn2+ was verified using varying concentrations of Mn2+ to compete Cd2+ uptake. By fitting data to the Cheng-Prusoff equation, an apparent inhibitory constant, KiMn = 1.2 ± 0.2 μm at pH 6.5, and [S] ∼ K0.5Cd = 2.6 ± 0.5 μm Cd2+, was obtained (29Cheng H.C. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2001; 46: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A), consistent with previous studies using 54Mn2+ (13Kehres D.G. Zaharik M.L. Finlay B.B. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1085-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements of Membrane Potential (Δψ) in RSOV and ISOV—Fluorescent probes, 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (1 μm) and bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) pentamethine oxonol (1 μm), were used to monitor Δψ changes in energized vesicles as described (30Matsushita K. Inoue T. Adachi O. Toyama H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4346-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were, respectively, 622 and 670 nm for 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide, and 588 and 614 nm for bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)pentamethine oxonol. Measurements were performed either in 100 mm Pipes-Mes, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5 (and 10 mm CaCl2 or MgSO4 in some cases), or 100 mm potassium Pi, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.5. MntH electrogenicity was evaluated using RSOV (50 μg/ml proteins) energized with PMS/Asc (2/0.02 mm) and in the presence of 0.1 μm nigericin. Fluorescence changes indicating relative membrane depolarization were recorded for 5 min post-addition of Cd2+. 0.1 μm valinomycin was added finally as internal control. Site-directed Thiol Fluorescence Labeling—Each MntH 12TMS-His10 Cys derivative conferred in vivo Me2+ sensitivity (supplemental Fig. 4B), consistent with respective data from prior mutagenesis (supplemental Fig. 2) (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), implying that Cys accessibility will reflect the functional structure of native MntH. RSOV (0.5 mg of protein) were labeled by incubation with 0.1 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (F5M, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 23 °C for 10 min, prior to or after solubilization in detergent. When indicated RSOV were pretreated for 10 min with 0.5 mm 4-acetomido-4′-maleimidylstilbene 2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and then washed and resuspended or solubilized before labeling with F5M. ISOV (0.5 mg of proteins) were incubated for 5 min in the presence of 2.5 μm F5M; labeling was stopped by a 15-min incubation in 20 mm NEM. Membranes were solubilized, and the constructs purified as described under supplemental methods before SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Coomassie or silver nitrate staining (32Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Prior to gel staining, F5M fluorescence was measured under a UV lamp equipped with a green filter using an Alpha Imager 3400 (Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Western Blot Analyses—C-terminal tagged (-c-Myc or -12TMS-His10) MntH variants were immunodetected in membrane preparations or in purified form as described (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using anti-c-Myc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or anti-His (GE Healthcare) monoclonal antibodies. Homology Modeling—Several approaches that use an alignment to map residues in a query sequence to sites in candidate template crystals structures were tested using the parameters specified by the developers, including Modeler (33Pieper U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3375-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Four sequences representative of the SLC11 family (two prokaryotic MntH and two eukaryotic Nramp) were tested and the results compiled to produce a consensus prediction. The PDB coordinates calculated were used visualize three-dimensional models using the freeware viewer PyMol (60DeLano W.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation and Z-score of the LeuT models were verified using Combinatorial Extension (36Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar), DaliLite (37Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), and MArkovian TRAnsition of Structure evolution (38Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Targeting Five Type II Evolutionary Rate Sites to Study the Mechanism of Me2+ and H+ Symport—The functional impact of mutating four SLC11-specific TM sites (MntH Asp34, Asn37, His211, and Asn401; Ref. 10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested that further kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of mutants at these sites would inform understanding of structure-function relationships. We thus studied mutants in which the SLC11 residues were exchanged for the matching outgroup moiety. The presence of two Asn residues at selected sites suggested also include MntH TMS7 Asn250, which is invariant in the SLC11 family and substituted for Thr or Ser in the outgroup. Because replacement of MntH Asn401 with Thr produces a phenotype similar to the exchange for the matching outgroup moiety (Gly) (10Chaloupka R. Courville P. Veyrier F. Knudsen B. Tompkins T.A. Cellier M.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we analyzed MntH mutants N37T, N250T, and N401T. The TM location of the targeted sites is schematized (Fig. 1A) based on previous predictions and experimental determinations (11Haemig H.A. Brooker R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 201: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Courville P. Chaloupka R. Veyrier F. Cellier M.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 24: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins displayed membrane expression levels similar to MntH-WT, indicating that the substitutions were structurally well tolerated (Fig. 1B). Characterization of E. coli MntH Cd2+ and H+ Transport in Vivo—To study the effects of the external pH on the kinetics of MntH, we measured 109Cd2+ uptake and Cd2+-dependent intracellular acidification in intact E. coli cells. Cd2+ uptake by MntH-WT (Fig. 1C) revealed K0.5Cd values at 37 °C of 2.6 ± 0.5 μm at pH 6.5 and 9.1 ± 2.9 μm at pH 7.5 (data fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, Table 1). The maximal velocity (Vmax) of Cd2+ transport was lower at pH 6.5 compared with pH 7.5. MntH-catalyzed Cd2+-induced H+ uptake was activated by increasing amounts of Cd2+, with K0.5 values at 23 °C ranging from 0.78 to 1.4 μm Cd2+ (pH 4.7–5.7, respectively, Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). In both systems, lowering the external pH increased MntH affinity for Cd2+.TABLE 1Kinetics of MntH Cd2+ transport in whole cells at pH 6.5 and 7.5MntHK0.5CdVmaxpH 6.5pH 7.5pH 6.5pH 7.5μmnmol/minWild-type2.6 ± 0.59.1 ± 2.913.4 ± 2.131.2 ± 4.6D34GaData collected 1 min, pH 6.5, and 2 min, pH 7.5, after addition of 109Cd2+.21.1 ± 3.632.0 ± 910.4 ± 0.78.1 ± 0.3N37TaData collected 1 min, pH 6.5, and 2 min, pH 7.5, after addition of 109Cd2+.15.0 ± 2.543.0 ± 159.7 ± 0.310.0 ± 3.0H211YaData collected 1 min, pH 6.5, and 2 min, pH 7.5, after addition of 109Cd2+.4.4 ± 1.1NAbNA, not applicable (similar to ΔmntH cells).4.3 ± 0.3NAN250TaData collected 1 min, pH 6.5, and 2 min, pH 7.5, after addition of 109Cd2+.4.3 ± 0.112.5 ± 0.83.7 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.4N401T2.1 ± 0.610.4 ± 0.87.7 ± 0.728.2 ± 0.9a Data collected 1 min, pH 6.5, and 2 min, pH 7.5, after addition of 109Cd2+.b NA, not applicable (similar to ΔmntH cells).

Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for Cd2+ uptake and Cd2+-induced intracellular acidification. Ea values (Fig. 1, D and E) were in the range of those obtained for carriers (10.7–26.3 kcal/mol, versus channels, 4.3–8.1 kcal/mol) supporting the notion of MntH transport cycle and intramolecular structural rearrangement. This could involve for instance, an external open conformation loading Me2+ and H+ to translocate them to the inner face of the membrane, before unloading and then rapidly back-translocating to reload (16Kaback H.R. Dunten R. Frillingos S. Venkatesan P. Kwaw I. Zhang W. Ermolova N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). MntH Cd2+ uptake activity was drastically reduced for four of the mutants studied (Fig. 1C). Further analyses of MntH Cd2+/H+ symport kinetics and thermodynamics revealed various types of effects (Tables 1 and 2), which can be summarized as: (i) low affinity Me2+ uptake and little H+ transport (Asp34 and Asn37), (ii) reduced Me2+ uptake but significant residual H+ uptake (Asn250, His211), or (iii) slight opposite variations in Cd2+ and H+ uptake (Asn401), and (iv) impaired transporter cycling (Asn37, Asn250, and His211). Individual phenotypes are detailed below. MntH TMS1 Asp34 Is Essential for Coupling H+ and Cd2+ Uptake—Kinetic analyses of the MntH-D34G mutant revealed dose-dependent Cd2+ uptake, and K0.5Cd values that were increased about 2- and 10-fold compared with MntH-WT at pH 7.5 and 6.5, respectively, but Cd2+-induced H+ uptake was not detected even when using 1 mm Cd2+ (supplemental Fig. 2D). The unique properties of the MntH-D34G mutant, such as K0.5Cd values little affected by the external pH and lack of H+ transport, suggested that exchange of Asp34 uncoupled Cd2+ uptake from H+ influx. To determine whether a conformational rearrangement was involved we tested the Ea of Cd2+ uptake by MntH-D34G, which was similar to MntH-WT (Fig. 1D). The Ea of H+ uptake could not be measured because no significant activity was detected for any Asp34 variant (supplemental Fig. 2D). This indicated that mutation of Asp34 could directly affect H+ binding versus transporter cycling, which was confirmed in vitro by lack of a Cd2+-induced MntH-dependent variation of Δψ in right-side out vesicles (see below “Electrogenicity of MntH-dependent Forward Cd2+ Transport” and Fig. 3E). MntH TMS6 His211 Role in Cd2+ Transport is pH-dependent—The exchange of TMS6 His211 for Tyr had pH-dependent effects on MntH Cd2+ uptake. Compared with MntH-WT, the K0.5Cd valu"

During interphase, the lamins form an intranuclear intermediate filament network that must be disassembled and reassembled when cells divide. Little is known about factors regulating this assembly/disassembly cycle. Using in vitro nuclear assembly and lamin assembly assays, we have identified a role for the nuclear transport factor importin α in the regulation of lamin assembly. Exogenous importin α inhibited nuclear lamin assembly in Xenopus interphase egg nuclear assembly assays. Fractionation of the egg extract used for nuclear assembly identified a high molecular weight complex containing the major egg lamin, XLB3, importin α, and importin β. This complex could be dissociated by RanGTP or a competing nuclear localization sequence, indicating that lamin assembly is Ran- and importin α-dependent in the egg extract. We show that the addition of importin α to purified lamin B3 prevents the assembly of lamins in solution. Lamin assembly assays show that importin α prevents the self-association of lamins required to assemble lamin filaments into the typical paracrystals formed in vitro. These results suggest a role for importin α in regulating lamin assembly and possibly modulating the interactions of lamins with lamin-binding proteins.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NE is an asymmetric organelle composed of a double bilayer membrane and two major protein complexes, the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and the nuclear lamina. NPCs punctuate the membranes at points of membrane fusion, forming the channels through which regulated macromolecular traffic occurs. The NPCs and membranes are associated with and supported by the lamina, which is composed mainly of a filamentous meshwork of type V intermediate filament proteins, the nuclear lamins, and dozens of associated proteins (2Mattout A. Dechat T. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Gruenbaum Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Lamins are also found in lesser amounts throughout the nucleoplasm (3Dorner D. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Shumaker D.K.

Nuclear lamins are the products of three genes: one gene encoding two A-type lamins and two genes encoding B-type lamins. The two A-type lamins, lamins A and C, are the result of alternative splicing of a single transcript of the LMNA gene (5Nakajima N. Abe K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two B-type lamins, lamins B1 and B2, and lamin A are farnesylated at their C termini. Although lamins B1 and B2 retain this modification for their lifetimes, mature lamin A is formed following a proteolytic cleavage to remove the lipid moiety and the C-terminal 15 amino acid residues (6Sinensky M. Fantle K. Trujillo M. McLain T. Kupfer A. Dalton M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 61-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both A- and B-type lamins are developmentally regulated, with B-type lamins expressed in all cells from the egg to terminally differentiated adult cells, whereas A-type lamins are expressed only at or after gastrulation (7Rober R.A. Weber K. Osborn M. Development (Camb.). 1989; 105: 365-378PubMed Google Scholar) and then only in a subset of cell types. Both A- and B-type lamins are involved in the regulation of transcription and replication and in the maintenance of the shape, size, and mechanical stability of the nucleus (2Mattout A. Dechat T. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Gruenbaum Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Lamins are unique among the intermediate filament protein family in that they are exclusively nuclear in their localization throughout interphase but are exposed to the cytoplasmic environment of the cell during mitosis. All lamins have classical nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and are predicted to be transported into the nucleus by importin α/β (8Loewinger L. McKeon F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2301-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, the NE breaks down, the membranes are redistributed into the endoplasmic reticulum, and the lamina and NPCs are disassembled by a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation (9Dessev G. Iovcheva-Dessev C. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Gerace L. Blobel G. Cell. 1980; 19: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). At late anaphase, lamins begin to reassemble on the surface of the segregated chromosomes with membranes and NPCs (11Foisner R. Sci. World J. 2003; 3: 1-20Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Methods. 1999; 19: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Moir R.D. Yoon M. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1155-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). After enclosure of the chromatin by the nuclear envelope at telophase, newly synthesized lamins are transported through NPCs and continue to be incorporated into the NE as the interphase nucleus grows (13Moir R.D. Yoon M. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1155-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although the lamins are incorporated into higher order structures in the nucleus and interact with many other proteins, little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating their assembly in cells or the regulation of their interactions with other proteins. A single Xenopus laevis egg contains all of the components required for the assembly of ∼4000 nuclei dispersed in its cytoplasm. Extracts of these eggs have been used extensively to determine the temporal order of nuclear assembly. In recent years, some mechanistic details of nuclear membrane and NPC assembly have been delineated (14Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 2004; 56: 193-204Google Scholar). However, the role of nuclear lamin assembly in NE formation has remained somewhat controversial. Amphibian eggs express a unique lamin, lamin B3 (XLB3), with expression restricted to eggs and early embryos (22Stick R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3189-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Early experiments suggested that assembly of the NE in egg extracts did not require co-assembly of lamins into a lamina structure (15Newport J.W. Wilson K.L. Dunphy W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2247-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Jenkins H. Holman T. Lyon C. Lane B. Stick R. Hutchison C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 275-285PubMed Google Scholar). In such a mechanism lamins would only be incorporated late in the process after the formation of functional NPCs and the initiation of nuclear protein import. However, other studies have shown that fragments of XLB3 that inhibit lamin polymerization block NE assembly at the early membrane fusion events, suggesting that lamin assembly is required early in the process of NE formation (17Shumaker D.K. Lopez-Soler R.I. Adam S.A. Herrmann H. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Lopez-Soler R.I. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Stick R. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, little is known about the physical state of the XLB3 that is stored in the egg for nuclear assembly during early embryogenesis. The assembly of a NE in egg extracts is regulated by the small nuclear GTPase Ran (14Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 2004; 56: 193-204Google Scholar). Nucleoporins and membranes in the egg extract are bound by importin β or α, which prevents their assembly into NPCs or nuclear membranes. RanGTP acts as a molecular switch by binding to importin β and releasing the bound components in a spatially and temporally regulated process. Because RanGTP is generated at the surface of chromatin by the chromatin-bound Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, NE assembly can only occur at the chromatin surface. We initiated a series of experiments to determine whether nuclear lamin assembly in egg extracts is also regulated by Ran and the importins. The experiments described here demonstrate that importin α is involved not only in lamina assembly but also in maintaining the solubility of the lamins prior to assembly. Expression and Purification of Protein—Full-length lamin B3 (XLB3) expressed in NovaBlue (DE3) cells (Novagen, San Diego, CA) was purified from inclusion bodies as described (19Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar). The partially purified lamins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column in 8 m urea. XLB3 with a mutated NLS (413KKRK to 413ASSK), XLB3ΔNLS, was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Xenopus importin α (20Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) was expressed as either an S-peptide fusion protein from pET30a (Novagen) or a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion from pMal-c2X (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 15 °C for 16 h in 2XYT medium supplemented with 25 mm phosphate buffer and 2 mm MgSO4. Bacteria expressing S-tagged importin α were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 200 mm NaCl; 5% glycerol; 10 μm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were brought to 0.5 m NaCl and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in a Type 35 rotor for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckman L-90K ultracentrifuge. The S-tagged protein was purified on a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ and eluted in the loading buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was further purified on a Mono Q column with a 50–600 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. MBP-expressing or MBP-importin α expressing cells were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 200 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin in four freeze/thaw cycles in a dry ice/methanol bath. This was followed by ultracentrifugation of the lysates as per the preparation of S-importin α. The supernatant was loaded on a 10-ml column of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and washed with lysis buffer. The bound MBP or MBP-importin α was eluted with 10 mm maltose in MBP lysis buffer. The eluted protein was further purified on a Mono Q column as described above for S-importin α. Purified MBP or importin α was dialyzed into egg buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), aliquoted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80 °C. RanQ69L (21Dickmanns A. Bischoff F.R. Marshallsay C. Luhrmann R. Ponstingl H. Fanning E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1449-1457PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type Ran cDNA in pQE31 (Qiagen) using a QuikChange XL II site-directed mutagenesis kit. RanQ69L was expressed in NovaBlue (DE3) cells grown in 2XYT medium with 4 mm MgSO4 and purified on a HiTrap chelating column charged with Zn2+. The column was eluted with 250 mm histidine in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The purified Ran was charged with GTP or GDP as described elsewhere (43Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). RanGDP and RanGTP were separated by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR5/5 column (GE Healthcare) at pH 6.5 in 50 mm MES buffer. GST-SV40NLS-EGFP was prepared as described (17Shumaker D.K. Lopez-Soler R.I. Adam S.A. Herrmann H. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclear Assembly Assays in Xenopus Egg Extract—Nuclear assembly assays were performed using Xenopus interphase egg extracts under standard conditions as described (17Shumaker D.K. Lopez-Soler R.I. Adam S.A. Herrmann H. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Lopez-Soler R.I. Moir R.D. Spann T.P.

The centrifugal disruption of dejellied and washed eggs at 10,000 × g yields an extract containing all of the components, including membranes and cytosolic factors, necessary to form a complete NE around demembranated sperm chromatin. Twenty microliters of this egg extract was first incubated on ice for 30 min with purified MBP or MBP-importin α added to a final concentration of 10 μm. After incubation, an ATP-regenerating system mix was added along with 40,000 demembranated sperm heads for a final reaction volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 75 min, and nuclear assembly was stopped by dilution with 500 μl of egg buffer (see above). The diluted assembly assay was overlaid on a cushion of 30% sucrose in egg buffer and centrifuged onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were removed, and the coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in egg buffer for 10 min. The coverslips were washed three times with egg buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked for 10 min in egg buffer containing 2% normal goat serum. To detect lamins and nucleoporins, the coverslips were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to full-length purified XLB3 (Cocalico) and MAb414 (Covance, Princeton, NJ) to nucleoporins. The primary antibodies used were detected with Alexa488 anti-rabbit and Alexa568 anti-mouse. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovision microscope equipped with a 100× 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective. XLB3 Polymerization Assays—The methods employed to assess polymerization of lamins in vitro were as described previously. XLB3 paracrystal formation was assessed by negative stain electron microscopy as published elsewhere (19Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of importin α on paracrystal formation, purified MBP-importin α was added to the purified XLB3 at a 5-fold molar excess in high pH buffer and immediately dialyzed against low pH buffer. After dialysis for 2 h, the assembled paracrystals were absorbed to Formvar/carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The paracrystals were observed using a Jeol JEM-1200EX electron microscope. The XLB3 pelleting assay was performed as described (19Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the assembly buffer was maintained at pH 7.3, rather than pH 6.6, as the binding of importin α to XLB3 is greatly reduced at the lower pH (data not shown). Supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Fisher). The densities of the stained XLB3 bands were measured using a Kodak IS440CF Image Station and Kodak molecular imaging software. The linearity of protein detection on immunoblots was determined from a standard curve prepared from serial dilutions of purified recombinant XLB3. Gel Filtration Chromatography of Egg Cytosol—Aliquots of Xenopus egg interphase extract were separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0.2-μm Nanosep microfiltration spin filter (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Five hundred microliters of the demembranated cytosol was separated on a Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in egg buffer (see above) at 4 °C. One-milliliter fractions were collected, and 50 μl of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Replicate immunoblots were probed with a monoclonal anti-XLB3 antibody (L6-5D5 provided by Reimer Stick, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany) (22Stick R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3189-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-importin β antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared against Xenopus importin α and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Pierce). The proteins were detected with SuperSignal West-Pico chemiluminescence detection reagent (Pierce) and Kodak XAR-5 film. The developed films were imaged with a Kodak IS440CF Image Station. Size standards for the Superose 6 column were separated under conditions identical to fractionation of the egg cytosol. Immunoadsorption of Importin α-XLB3 Complexes—Rabbit antiserum directed against importin α or pre-immune serum was adsorbed to protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound antibodies were cross-linked to the beads with 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 30 min. The antibody-coupled beads were washed consecutively in 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 3.0, and finally phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of the Superose 6 column fractions identified as containing XLB3 by immunoblotting were diluted into egg buffer (see above) containing 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated with antibody beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with egg buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with the polyclonal anti-XLB3 antibody and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG TrueBlot secondary antibody (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) as described above. The amount of input XLB3 adsorbed by the anti-importin α antibodies was determined by comparison of the band intensities from the immunoblot with a standard curve prepared from dilutions of the input material. RanGTP Release Assay—Aliquots of the fractions from the Superose 6 column identified as containing XLB3 by immunoblotting were incubated with 5 μm RanQ69L-GTP, RanQ69L-GDP, or GST-SV40NLS-EGFP for 90 min on ice. After centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were carefully removed, and the pellets were washed with egg buffer and centrifuged as before. The resulting pellets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and equivalent amounts of soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. The XLB3 in each fraction was detected by immunoblotting with anti-XLB3 polyclonal antiserum. Image collection and band quantification were performed on a Kodak IS440CF Image Station. Importin α Inhibits Lamina Assembly in Vitro—Earlier studies describing the effect of the depletion of importin α from Caenorhabditis elegans embryos by RNA interference demonstrated a requirement for the germ line-intrinsic importin α IMA-2 in NE assembly during embryogenesis (23Geles K.G. Johnson J.J. Jong S. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3138-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Askjaer P. Galy V. Hannak E. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4355-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was also shown that NE assembly could be inhibited in Xenopus egg extract nuclear assembly assays either by the depletion of importin α or by the addition of an excess of importin α or bovine serum albumin-NLS (25Hachet V. Kocher T. Wilm M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1526-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using dominant negative fragments of XLB3, we have shown that lamin incorporation into the nascent NE is an essential step in nuclear assembly (17Shumaker D.K. Lopez-Soler R.I. Adam S.A. Herrmann H. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Lopez-Soler R.I. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Stick R. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because XLB3 contains a classical NLS that binds importin α (26Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Heidinger J.M. Shumaker D.K. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Zheng Y. Science. 2006; 311: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we have determined whether importin α also regulates lamin assembly in egg extracts. When demembranated sperm chromatin was added to an egg extract supplemented with an energy-regenerating system, a complete NE formed around the decondensed chromatin within 75 min (Fig. 1, a–c). In control assays, purified MBP was added to 10 μm and incubated for 30 min prior to the addition of sperm chromatin and an ATP-regenerating system. Under these conditions, XLB3 is concentrated at the nuclear periphery and is also present throughout the nucleoplasm in assembled nuclei. The NEs assembled under these conditions contain NPCs as detected with an antibody to a family of glycosylated nucleoporins, MAb414. To test the effect of exogenous importin α on lamin assembly, we added an MBP fusion of importin α to 10 μm in egg extract for 30 min prior to the addition of the sperm chromatin. Following an additional 75-min incubation at 23 °C, the preparations were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence. The addition of excess importin α to the egg extract had dramatic effects on nuclear assembly. In the presence of importin α, the sperm chromatin did not decondense, and a NE did not form around the sperm chromatin (Fig. 1, d–f). Instead, distinct patches of XLB3, nucleoporins, and membranes (data not shown) were seen on the surface of the chromatin with little overlap of the XLB3 and nucleoporin staining patterns, suggesting that lamin assembly and nuclear membrane/NPC assembly take place simultaneously on the chromatin surface during nuclear assembly. Therefore, exogenous importin α inhibits both nuclear membrane formation and assembly of the lamina. Lamin B3 and Importin α Form a High Molecular Weight Complex in Xenopus Egg Cytosol—Although nuclear assembly in Xenopus egg extracts and in live cells has been well studied, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for regulating the assembly of the nuclear lamins during the formation of the lamina. Although phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of lamins are important for lamina assembly and disassembly (27Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), little is known about the physical form of disassembled lamins in cells. In Xenopus egg extracts, ∼95% of XLB3 is not associated with membranes and cannot be pelleted by high speed centrifugation (28Lourim D. Krohne G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3675-3686PubMed Google Scholar). 4S. A. Adam, K. Sengupta, and R. D. Goldman, unpublished results. We analyzed the physical state of this unassembled XLB3 by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column and immunoblotting to detect XLB3 and importins (Fig. 2A). All of the detectable XLB3 in egg cytosol was found in a discrete peak with an estimated molecular weight of >700,000. The majority of both soluble importin α and importin β also separated on the column as high molecular weight species, including in the fractions containing XLB3. As XLB3 has a classical NLS that binds to importin α, we wanted to determine whether XLB3 was in a complex with importins in the high molecular weight fraction obtained from egg cytosol. Therefore, we carried out immunoadsorptions from the high molecular weight gel filtration fractions with immobilized anti-importin α followed by immunoblotting with anti-XLB3 (Fig. 2B). Approximately 40% of the XLB3 in the fraction was co-adsorbed with importin α (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that both proteins are components of a high molecular weight complex in egg cytosol. The inability to co-adsorb all of the XLB3 with importin α may be evidence that other large complexes of XLB3, such as lamin oligomers, are also present in the egg cytosol. Alternatively, some of the importin α-XLB3 complexes may not be accessible to the antibody used to immunoadsorb the complex. Given the large number of potential cargoes for importin α in egg cytosol, it is likely that the high molecular weight fractions containing XLB3 and importin α also contain other importin-cargo complexes. Effect of Importin α on XLB3 Assembly in Vitro—The inhibition of lamin assembly in the nuclear assembly assay and the presence of a high molecular weight complex containing XLB3 and importins in egg cytosol suggested to us that importins may negatively regulate lamin polymerization. Complexes between importins α and β can be dissociated by the binding of RanGTP to importin β, resulting in a decreased affinity of importin α for the NLS by an autoinhibitory mechanism (29Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In vivo, this mechanism is responsible for the release of transported proteins into the nuclear interior. Because XLB3 is in a complex with the importins, the addition of RanGTP to the fractions containing XLB3 and importins should release some of the bound XLB3 if the assembly of lamins is regulated by Ran. XLB3 is only moderately soluble under conditions of neutral pH and physiological salt concentration (19Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar), so we expected to observe an increase in insoluble XLB3 upon the addition of RanGTP to the complex. Aliquots of the Superose 6 column fractions containing the XLB3-importin complex were incubated with RanGDP or RanGTP (Fig. 3). Following a 90-min incubation, ∼10–20% of the XLB3 could be pelleted at 16,000 × g when RanGTP, but not RanGDP, was mixed with the XLB3 complex (compare P lanes). This demonstrates that the solubility of XLB3 in egg cytoplasm is at least partially Ran-dependent and that importin α binding to XLB3 maintains lamin solubility. If the solubility of XLB3 is maintained by the binding of importin α to its NLS, the addition of a synthetic protein import substrate containing the SV40 large T antigen NLS should act as a competitive inhibitor of XLB3 binding. This inhibition should result in an increase in the amount of insoluble XLB3. Addition of a fusion protein containing a single NLS was sufficient to displace ∼10–20% of the XLB3 from importin α and increase the pelletable fraction of XLB3 (Fig. 3, NLS lanes). Purified lamins have limited solubility under physiological conditions, spontaneously forming aggregates or more ordered structures such as head-to-tail dimers or paracrystals (19Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar, 30Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Lamin solubility in the presence of importin α was measured in a pelleting assay using bacterially expressed and purified XLB3 and importin α (18Lopez-Soler R.I. Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Stick R.

https://openalex.org/W2093343807,"Solubilization of mineralized bone by osteoclasts is largely dependent on the acidification of the extracellular resorption lacuna driven by the vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) polarized within the ruffled border membranes. V-ATPases consist of two functionally and structurally distinct domains, V(1) and V(0). The peripheral cytoplasmically oriented V(1) domain drives ATP hydrolysis, which necessitates the translocation of protons across the integral membrane bound V(0) domain. Here, we demonstrate that an accessory subunit, Ac45, interacts with the V(0) domain and contributes to the vacuolar type proton pump-mediated function in osteoclasts. Consistent with its role in intracellular acidification, Ac45 was found to be localized to the ruffled border region of polarized resorbing osteoclasts and enriched in pH-dependent endosomal compartments that polarized to the ruffled border region of actively resorbing osteoclasts. Interestingly, truncation of the 26-amino acid residue cytoplasmic tail of Ac45, which encodes an autonomous internalization signal, was found to impair bone resorption in vitro. Furthermore, biochemical analysis revealed that although both wild type Ac45 and mutant were capable of associating with subunits a3, c, c'', and d, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail altered its binding proximity with a3, c'', and d. In all, our data suggest that the cytoplasmic terminus of Ac45 contains elements necessary for its proper interaction with V(0) domain and efficient osteoclastic bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W2094915640,"The role of positively charged arginines in the fourth transmembrane domain (S4) and a single negatively charged amino acid in the third transmembrane domain (S3) on channel biogenesis and gating of voltage-gated K(+) channels (Kv) has been well established. Both intermediate (KCa3.1) and small (KCa2.x) conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels have two conserved arginines in S4 and a single conserved glutamic acid in S3, although these channels are voltage-independent. We demonstrate that mutation of any of these charged amino acids in KCa3.1 or KCa2.3 to alanine, glutamine, or charge reversal mutations results in a rapid degradation (<30 min) of total protein, confirming the critical role of these amino acids in channel biogenesis. Mutation of the S4 arginine closest to the cytosolic side of KCa3.1 to histidine resulted in expression at the cell surface. Excised patch clamp experiments revealed that this Arg/His mutation had a dramatically reduced open probability (P(o)), relative to wild type channels. Additionally, we demonstrate, using a combination of short hairpin RNA, dominant negative, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, that both KCa3.1 and KCa2.3 are translocated out of the endoplasmic reticulum associated with Derlin-1. These misfolded channels are poly-ubiquitylated, recognized by p97, and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Our results suggest that S3 and S4 charged amino acids play an evolutionarily conserved role in the biogenesis and gating of KCa channels. Furthermore, these improperly folded K(+) channels are translocated out of the endoplasmic reticulum in a Derlin-1- and p97-dependent fashion, poly-ubiquitylated, and targeted for proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1979568773,"In eukaryotes and many bacteria, tyrosine is degraded to produce energy via a five-step tyrosine degradation pathway. Mutations affecting the tyrosine degradation pathway are also of medical importance as mutations affecting enzymes in the pathway are responsible for type I, type II, and type III tyrosinemia. The most severe of these is type I tyrosinemia, which is caused by mutations affecting the last enzyme in the pathway, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). So far, tyrosine degradation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has not been studied; however, genes predicted to encode enzymes in this pathway have been identified in several microarray, proteomic, and RNA interference (RNAi) screens as perhaps being involved in aging and the control of protein folding. We sought to identify and characterize the genes in the worm tyrosine degradation pathway as an initial step in understanding these findings. Here we describe the characterization of the K10C2.4, which encodes a homolog of FAH. RNAi directed against K10C2.4 produces a lethal phenotype consisting of death in young adulthood, extensive damage to the intestine, impaired fertility, and activation of oxidative stress and endoplasmic stress response pathways. This phenotype is due to alterations in tyrosine metabolism as increases in dietary tyrosine enhance it, and inhibition of upstream enzymes in tyrosine degradation with RNAi or genetic mutations reduces the phenotype. We also use our model to identify genes that suppress the damage produced by K10C2.4 RNAi in a pilot genetic screen. Our results establish worms as a model for the study of type I tyrosinemia."

https://openalex.org/W2039123232,"BcrR has been identified as a novel regulatory protein of high level bacitracin resistance encoded by the bcrABD operon in Enterococcus faecalis. The N-terminal domain of BcrR has similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins, and topological modeling predicts that the C-terminal domain contains four transmembrane α-helices. These data have led to the hypothesis that BcrR functions as both a membrane-bound sensor and transducer of bacitracin availability to regulate bcrABD expression. To characterize the bcrABD promoter and identify the promoter elements to which BcrR binds, a series of bcrA-lacZ fusions were constructed. A 69-bp region was identified that was essential for bacitracin-dependent bcrA-lacZ expression. Mutations that targeted this region were used to identify two inverted repeat sequences, each with the sequence 5′-GACA(N)7TGTC-3′, on the bcrABD promoter that were required for bcrA-lacZ expression. To study BcrR binding to this region, we over-produced BcrR with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in Escherichia coli membranes, extracted the protein with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and subsequently purified it via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Purified BcrR was reconstituted into liposomes, and BcrR binding to bcrABD promoter DNA was analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Both inverted repeat sequences were required for BcrR binding, both in the presence and absence of bacitracin. These data demonstrate that membrane-bound BcrR binds specifically to the bcrABD promoter, irrespective of bacitracin concentration. We therefore propose that bacitracin-dependent induction of bcrABD expression by BcrR occurs after DNA binding.

Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic that functions by binding to and sequestering undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) 4The abbreviations used are:UPPundecaprenyl pyrophosphateDTTdithiothreitolDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. 4The abbreviations used are:UPPundecaprenyl pyrophosphateDTTdithiothreitolDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay. (1Stone K.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because UPP acts as a carrier of peptidoglycan monomeric units across the cell membrane (2Anderson J.S. Matsuhashi M. Haskin M.A. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the antibacterial nature of bacitracin results from its ability to block cell wall synthesis. High level bacitracin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis is encoded by the bcrABD operon that is under the control of a putative membrane-bound DNA-binding protein, BcrR (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of bacitracin, transcription of the bcrABD operon leads to the production of BcrA and BcrB, which are proposed to act as an ABC exporter of bacitracin, thus conferring high level bacitracin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥ 256 μg/ml) to the cell (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BcrD is proposed to function as an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase that functions to increase the amount of undecaprenyl available to the cell (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that bcrR, which is transcribed constitutively, is essential for high level bacitracin resistance in E. faecalis and that transcription of bcrABD is abolished in the absence of bcrR (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression of bcrABD was found to be inducible with increasing concentrations of bacitracin (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 5-61) of BcrR has homology to the Xre family of helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins and, based on topological modeling, the C-terminal domain is predicted to contain four membrane-spanning α-helices. These data combined have led to the proposal that BcrR is a transmembrane regulatory protein that functions both as a sensor and signal transducer of bacitracin availability in the environment (3Manson J.M. Keis S. Smith J.M. Cook G.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3743-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Regulation of bacitracin resistance in other bacterial genera has been exclusively shown to be via two-component regulatory systems. These two-component systems regulate genes that encode putative ABC transporters, which, although not yet experimentally demonstrated, are hypothesized to function by pumping bacitracin from the cell. In the bacitracin producer, Bacillus licheniformis, regulation of the ABC transporter (BcrABC) is via the BacRS two-component system (4Neumüller A.M. Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3180-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar systems exist in Bacillus subtilis (5Ohki R. Giyanto, Tateno K. Masuyama W. Moriya S. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and in Streptococcus mutans (6Tsuda H. Yamashita Y. Shibata Y. Nakano Y. Koga T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3756-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that the presence of both the putative bacitracin transporter, BceAB, and the two-component signal transduction pathway, BceRS, are required for activation of bceAB expression in the presence of bacitracin in B. subtilis (7Bernard R. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Foglino M. Denizot F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 198: 8636-8642Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the BceAB transporter interacts with the BceRS two-component signal transduction system in some manner that is necessary for bceAB expression (7Bernard R. Guiseppi A. Chippaux M. Foglino M. Denizot F. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 198: 8636-8642Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar).A recent survey of prokaryotic genomes has revealed that one-component signal transduction systems, in which an input and output domain are fused in a single protein molecule, are more numerous than classic two-component systems (8Ulrich L.E. Koonin E.V. Zhulin I.B. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This is the case in the genome of E. faecalis V583 that encodes 17 two-component systems and 158 one-component systems (9Kristich C.J. Wells C.L. Dunny G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3508-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One such system is that of PrkC, which contains a cytoplasmic kinase output domain fused to an extracellular input domain via a transmembrane region. This protein has been shown to modulate antimicrobial resistance and intestinal persistence, presumably in response to the perturbation of the cell wall by bile salts as detected by the extracellular domain (9Kristich C.J. Wells C.L. Dunny G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3508-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The majority of one-component systems are thought to be cytoplasmic, because 97% of those containing a helix-turn-helix output domain lack transmembrane regions. It has been hypothesized that, although membrane-bound DNA-binding proteins may represent a more simplistic method of signal transduction than the classic two-component system, their use may be limited by restrictions in the ability of the protein to locate its target DNA (8Ulrich L.E. Koonin E.V. Zhulin I.B. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).Examples of transmembrane regulators are rare and include the ToxR family in Vibrio cholerae (10Miller V.L. Taylor R.K. Mekalanos J.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 271-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and close relatives (11Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ToxR contains a single transmembrane α-helix separating a cytoplasmic DNA-binding domain from a short C-terminal periplasmic domain (10Miller V.L. Taylor R.K. Mekalanos J.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 271-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). A role in signal transduction by ToxR may be likely in the presence of bile salts, where it regulates cholera toxin production (12Hung D.T. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and expression of the outer membrane porins OmpU and OmpT (13Provenzano D. Schuhmacher D.A. Barker J.L. Klose K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Although transmembrane regulators are rare, the Xre family of transcriptional regulators is a large family, comprising to date of 6002 proteins across all branches of life (available on the simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) data base) (14Letunic I. Copley R.R. Pils B. Pinkert S. Schultz J. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D257-D260Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The Xre family has been incorrectly annotated as the “xenobiotic response element family of transcriptional regulators” by the conserved domain data base (15Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hao L. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Ke Z. Krylov D. Lanczycki C.J. Liebert C.A. Liu C. Lu F. Lu S. Marchler G.H. Mullokandov M. Song J.S. Thanki N. Yamashita R.A. Yin J.J. Zhang D. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D237-D240Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) in NCBI. Rather, the Xre-like family of helix-turn-helix proteins is named after the family member Xre, a repressor in the B. subtilis prophage PBSX (16Wood H.E. Devine K.M. McConnell D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although most members of the family remain uncharacterized, a few have been well characterized, including the phage 434 (17Aggarwal A.K. Rodgers D.W. Drottar M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Science. 1988; 242: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and lambda phage (18Jordan S.R. Pabo C.O. Science. 1988; 242: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) repressors. Two members of the family in E. faecalis are CylR2, which functions as a repressor of cytolysin exotoxin production (19Haas W. Shepard B.D. Gilmore M.S. Nature. 2002; 415: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and PrgX, which regulates conjugation in response to a pheromone signal (20Shi K. Brown C.K. Gu Z.-Y. Kozlowicz B.K. Dunny G.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Earhart C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18596-18601Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The aim of this study was to study the interaction of membrane-bound BcrR with the bacitracin resistance operon bcr-ABD in E. faecalis using an in vitro system. We show that membrane-bound BcrR binds to two inverted repeats, each with the sequence 5′-GACA(N)7TGTC-3′, on the bcrABD promoter. Both repeats are required for bacitracin-dependent bcrA-lacZ expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.

All PCR were carried out with the Phusion™ high fidelity PCR kit (Finnzymes) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Construction of Vectors for Complementation—To introduce wild-type and hexa-histidine-tagged bcrR into JH2-2, the constructs pAMBcrR and pAMBcrRHis were constructed, respectively. To construct plasmid pAMBcrR, containing bcrR under the control of its own promoter, primers BcrRpAMf (5′-AAATTTCCATGGTCATACAGAATTTCCTGCAC-3′) and BcrRpAMr (5′-AAATTTGAATTCTTATTTCATTCCCATCTGCTT-3′) containing NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, were used to amplify bcrR by PCR using AR01/DGVS genomic DNA as a template. The amplicon was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and cloned into pAM401 digested with the same restriction enzymes. To construct plasmid pAMBcrRHis, containing C-terminal hexa-histidine-tagged bcrR under the control of its own promoter, primers BcrRpAMf and BcrRpAMHisr (5′-AAATTTGAATTCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTCATTCCCATCTGCTT-3′) containing NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, and histidine codons (underlined) were used to amplify bcrR by PCR using AR01/DGVS genomic DNA as a template. The amplicon was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and cloned into pAM401 digested with the same restriction enzymes. These constructs were introduced into E. faecalis strain JH2-2 to create JH2-2pAMBcrR and JH2-2pAMBcrRHis, respectively.Construction of bcrA-lacZ Transcriptional Fusions—To construct a series of bcrA-lacZ reporter fusions, primers listed in Table 2 were used to amplify bcrABD promoter DNA using plasmid pAMbcr1, unless otherwise stated, as a template. Amplified DNA was digested with the corresponding enzymes as indicated in Table 2 and ligated into pTCVlac digested with the same enzymes. All promoter regions amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To map the bcrABD promoter, a series of promoter-lacZ fusions were created as shown in Fig. 2. To create plasmids pTCVA, pTCVB, pTCVC, pTCVD, and pTCVE the forward primers EfbcrAP2F, EfbcrAP7F, EfbcrAP6F, EfbcrAP5F, and EfbcrAP3F were used, respectively, with the reverse primer EfbcrAP2R.TABLE 2Primers used for bcrA-lacZ transcriptional fusionsNameSequence 5′-3′Restriction siteUsed to create mutant constructEfbcrAP2FGTACTTCCCGGGTTGCTGTTAATCGGCAAGATSmaIEfbcrAP2EcoFGTACTTGAATTCTTGCTGTTAATCGGCAAGATEcoRIEfbcrAP2RATCCGTGGATCCAGCAAGCTGCAACATCATTTBamHIEfbcrAP3FTTGTGTCCCGGGTGTGACGGTAGGTTTCTTGGSmaIEfbcrAP5FGTCGGAGAATTCTTCATGCTGACATCTATTGTEcoRIEfbcrAP6FATAGGCGAATTCACGATAAGTGTCGGAGCTTTEcoRIEfbcrAP7FAACATCGAATTCCCTTGAAAATAGGCTCTGACEcoRIEfbcrAP7RCACATAGGATCCGCCAAGAAACCTACCGTCACBamHIBcrAareal/3FCATCTATTGAAAAAGCATTGTGACGGTAGGTTTpTCVA4, pTCVA2+4BcrAareal/3RCACAATGCTTTTTCAATAGATGTCAGCATGAAApTCVA4BcrAarea3FTTTTCATGCCCCCATCTATTGTGTCAGCATTGpTCVA3BcrAarea3RCAATAGATGGGGGCATGAAAAAAGCTCCGACApTCVA3BcrAarea4FAATAGGCTCCCCCACGATAAGTGTCGGAGCTTpTCVA1, pTCVA1+3BcrAarea4RCTTATCGTGGGGGAGCCTATTTTCAAGGTTTTpTCVA1BcrAarea2/4FCACGATAAGAAAAGGAGCTTTTTTCATGCTGACpTCVA2BcrAarea2/4RAAAAGCTCCTTTTCTTATCGTGTCAGAGCCTATpTCVA2 Open table in a new tab To identify DNA motifs important for BcrR binding in the bcrABD promoter, a series of nucleotide substitutions were introduced by PCR overlap extension (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) into the same 389-bp bcrABD promoter sequence used to create plasmid pTCVA. The mutated PCR product was then cloned into pTCVlac and sequenced to ensure fidelity of the PCR reaction. To create pTCVA1, two pairs of primers (namely EfbcrAP2EcoF with BcrAarea4R and BcrAarea4F with EfbcrAP2R) and pAMbcr1 template were used to generate mutated DNA fragments. These overlapping fragments were then used for overlap extension PCR with the external primers EfbcrAP2EcoF and EfbcrAP2R (Table 2). To create pTCVA2, pTCVA3, pTCVA4, pTCVA1+3, and pTCVA2+4 the same procedure as above was followed using the internal primers given in Table 2, with the exception of pTCVA1+3 and pTCVA2+4 where plasmids pTCVA3 and pTCVA2 served as template, respectively.Bacitracin Challenge and β-Galactosidase Assays—E. faecalis containing bcrABD-promoter reporter constructs in pTCVlac were grown to an A600 of ∼0.5. Cells were separated into 10-ml aliquots, and 256 μg/ml bacitracin was added unless otherwise stated. Following 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested, rapidly frozen, and stored at -20 °C. The β-galactosidase activity of cells was determined as described previously (32Gebhard S. Tran S.L. Cook G.M. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3453-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Mapping of the Transcriptional Start Site of bcrABD—The transcriptional start site of bcrABD was mapped by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using the components of the 3′/5′-RACE kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA was isolated from E. faecalis AR01/DGVS grown in the presence of 256 μg/ml bacitracin. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 4.8 μg of total RNA with the bcrA-specific primer bcrA-RACE1 (5′-GAGTAATCGGAAAAGACCT-3′). The resulting cDNA was purified and dA-tailed following the kit instructions. Purified dA-tailed cDNA was then used as a template for PCR using the Oligo dT-anchor primer and bcrA-specific primer bcrA-RACE2 (5′-CTACTCCACTTTTAGATAC-3′). The resulting PCR product was gel-purified and used as template for a second PCR using the PCR anchor primer and nested bcrA-specific primer bcrA-RACE3 (5′-CTCATACCCTGTTAAATTACTG-3′). This PCR product was then sequenced using primer bcrA-RACE3.Construction of Vectors for Overexpression of BcrR—Two constructs for the expression of recombinant BcrR were created using the expression vector pTrc99A. To construct plasmid pTrcBcrR, for the expression of BcrR, primers BcrRFwd (5′-AAATTTCCATGGAATTTAATGAAAAGCTACAA-3′) and BcrRRev (5′-AAATTTGTCGACTTATTTCATTCCCATCTGCTT-3′) containing NcoI and SalI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, were used to amplify bcrR by PCR using AR01/DGVS genomic DNA as a template. The amplicon was digested with NcoI and SalI and cloned into pTrc99A digested with the same restriction enzymes. To construct plasmid pTrcBcrRHis, for the expression of BcrR containing a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus (corresponding to underlined nucleotides), primers BcrRFwd and HisBcrRRev (5′-AATTTGTCGACTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTTCATTCCCATCTGCTT-3′), containing a SalI site (underlined), were used to amplify bcrR by PCR. The amplicon was digested with NcoI and SalI and cloned into pTrc99A digested with the same restriction enzymes. All regions amplified by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Hexa-histidine-tagged BcrR—Plasmid pTrcBcrRHis was electroporated into E. coli C41(DE3) prior to expression trials. Following inoculation with an overnight culture (0.1%), a 15-liter culture was grown in 2 × YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a fermenter (Bioflo 410, New Brunswick Scientific) with agitation (200 rpm) and aeration (12 liters/min) at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.7, the culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for a further 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9,220 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed once in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by three passages through a French pressure cell (American Instrument Co.) at 20,000 p.s.i. DNaseI was added (0.1 mg/ml), and the suspension was incubated on ice for 1 h. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the membranes were collected from the cell-free supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 180,000 × g for 50 min. The membranes were washed once in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mmdl-dithiothreitol (DTT), and stored at -70 °C until use. Prior to solubilization, membranes were washed in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 1% sodium cholate. The membranes were then solubilized in buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) with gentle stirring at room temperature for 1 h at a membrane protein concentration of ∼5 mg/ml. The mixture was ultracentrifuged at 180,000 × g for 50 min. The supernatant (solubilized BcrR) was then loaded in two batches onto a 1-ml HisTrap™ HP Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.05% DDM. The protein was eluted with a stepwise gradient of buffer B (buffer A with 500 mm imidazole and 0.05% DDM). Fractions containing BcrR were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon®centrifugal filter with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff. Concentrated protein (∼2 mg) was loaded in 0.5-ml fractions onto a Superose 6 (10/300) GL column (Amersham Biosciences) for further purification by gel filtration and eluted in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.025% DDM) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.General Biochemical Techniques—Protein concentrations of membrane fractions were determined by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein concentrations of purified BcrR and proteoliposomes were estimated by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards separated by SDS-PAGE or by Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Protein samples (15-20 μg, unless otherwise stated) were routinely separated by 14% SDS-PAGE using the buffer system described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein was visualized by staining with Simply Blue S"

On cellulose–dextrin agar, prepared from water-insoluble or water-soluble cellulose dextrin according to Fuller and Norman1, this organism (provisionally named type c) forms small distinct, disk-shaped colonies, surrounded by circular, well-developed decomposition zones (visible also when water-soluble dextrin is used)."

https://openalex.org/W1967202381,"UP to the present, experimental methods have yielded very little information concerning vestibular toxicity due to streptomycin ; in medical practice these accidents are very frequent (80–90 per cent of cases treated). Indeed, the fundamental work of Molitor and his collaborators leads to the conclusion that most of the animals used in laboratory work show no recognizable vestibular disturbance, whether as the result of a single heavy dose of streptomycin or of several fractional doses administered over a period of time. According to Molitor1, dogs are the only animals which show any evidence of cerebellar or vestibular damage comparable to that which has been observed in human beings, whereas mice, frogs, rats and guinea pigs are unaffected. Although Molitor kept under observation a considerable number of animals, we believe that his conclusions should not be accepted as final."

Seven plants per pot were grown, and six replicate pots per treatment were provided. Two top soils from North Auckland Province, both very poor in available phosphate, were used. The Maunu loam derived from basalt is akin to a lateritic type; the Wharekohe silt loam, derived from an early tertiary claystone, is a mature podsol. They are classified respectively as ""immature red brown loam"" and ""strongly podsolized yellow earth"" by the New Zealand Soil Survey. Primary calcium phosphate labelled with radioactive phosphorus was used as fertilizer in amounts equivalent to 100 mgm. P2O5 per pot, this being roughly equal to a rate of 100 kgm. P2O5 per hectare, calculated on an area basis. Dry-matter yields, total phosphorus and radioactivity were determined in the harvested plants."

Recently, Clinch and Loughnane have published a paper2 on this disease with the title Seed Transmission of Virus Yellows of Sugar Beet and the Existence of Strains of this Virus in Eire. This title is, in our opinion, misleading, for it suggests that sugar beet yellows virus is transmitted by seed. There is, on the contrary, much evidence that it is not, and though the yellowing of family 41 may be transmitted through the seed, there is nothing to show that the condition is caused by beet yellows virus."

https://openalex.org/W2000324724,"IN discussing the application of Drude's 'complex indicatrix' for reflected light, M. Berek1,2 originally extended the use of this term to include the two sheets representing the separate values for n and Thus he says, [cubic] complex indicatrix consists of concentric spheres with radii n and k. Strictly, the cubic complex indicatrix is, as he states elsewhere, a sphere with the complex radius n-ik, and is not itself geometrically representable. The n and k surfaces are representable for the more symmetrical crystals though not for the general case, and in some ways these surfaces take the place of the indicatrix of a transparent crystal. Nevertheless, this use of the term 'complex indicatrix' seems too wide, and I think this is Berek's opinion, for on looking through his later summary (1937)3, I have not been able to find the term so used, though there is no direct reference to the question. No special designation is used for the curves there plotted (pp. 59, 60) and I have recently cited these under Berek's former nomenclature4. A term such as 'representative surfaces' for n, k, R, etc. would, however, appear to be more satisfactory."
