https://openalex.org/W2010135111,"Objective Despite improving healthcare, the gap in mortality between people with serious mental illness (SMI) and general population persists, especially for younger age groups. The electronic database from a large and comprehensive secondary mental healthcare provider in London was utilized to assess the impact of SMI diagnoses on life expectancy at birth. Method People who were diagnosed with SMI (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder), substance use disorder, and depressive episode/disorder before the end of 2009 and under active review by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) in southeast London during 2007–09 comprised the sample, retrieved by the SLAM Case Register Interactive Search (CRIS) system. We estimated life expectancy at birth for people with SMI and each diagnosis, from national mortality returns between 2007–09, using a life table method. Results A total of 31,719 eligible people, aged 15 years or older, with SMI were analyzed. Among them, 1,370 died during 2007–09. Compared to national figures, all disorders were associated with substantially lower life expectancy: 8.0 to 14.6 life years lost for men and 9.8 to 17.5 life years lost for women. Highest reductions were found for men with schizophrenia (14.6 years lost) and women with schizoaffective disorders (17.5 years lost). Conclusion The impact of serious mental illness on life expectancy is marked and generally higher than similarly calculated impacts of well-recognised adverse exposures such as smoking, diabetes and obesity. Strategies to identify and prevent causes of premature death are urgently required."
https://openalex.org/W2158038259,"For an animal invading a novel region, the ability to develop new behaviors should facilitate the use of novel food resources and hence increase its survival in the new environment. However, the need to explore new resources may entail costs such as exposing the animal to unfamiliar predators. These two opposing forces result in an exploration-avoidance conflict, which can be expected to interfere with the acquisition of new resources. However, its consequences should be less dramatic in highly urbanized environments where new food opportunities are common and predation risk is low. We tested this hypothesis experimentally by presenting three foraging tasks to introduced common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) from environments with low and high urbanization levels from Australia. Individuals from the highly urbanized environments, where mynas are both more opportunistic when foraging and less fearful to predators, resolved a technical task faster than those from less urbanized environments. These differences did not reflect innovative 'personalities' and were not confounded by sex, morphology or motivational state. Rather, the principal factors underlying differences in mynas' problem-solving ability were neophobic-neophilic responses, which varied across habitats. Thus, mynas seem to modulate their problem-solving ability according to the benefits and costs of innovating in their particular habitat, which may help us understand the great success of the species in highly urbanized environments."

Analysis of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is confounded, as these modifications are indistinguishable by traditional sequencing methods even when supplemented by bisulfite conversion. Here we demonstrate a simple enzymatic approach that involves cloning, identification, and quantification of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in various CCGG loci within murine and human genomes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was prevalent in human and murine brain and heart genomic DNAs at several regions. The cultured cell lines NIH3T3 and HeLa both displayed very low or undetectable amounts of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at the examined loci. Interestingly, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels in mouse embryonic stem cell DNA first increased then slowly decreased upon differentiation to embryoid bodies, whereas 5-methylcytosine levels increased gradually over time. Finally, using a quantitative PCR approach, we established that a portion of VANGL1 and EGFR gene body methylation in human tissue DNA samples is indeed hydroxymethylation.

https://openalex.org/W2004442803,"Primary tumor growth induces host tissue responses that are believed to support and promote tumor progression. Identification of the molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and elucidation of its crosstalk with tumor cells may therefore be crucial for improving our understanding of the processes implicated in cancer progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets, and uncovering stromal gene expression signatures that may predict clinical outcome. A key issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the stromal response to tumor growth is largely a generic phenomenon, irrespective of the tumor type or whether the response reflects tumor-specific properties. To address similarity or distinction of stromal gene expression changes during cancer progression, oligonucleotide-based Affymetrix microarray technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stromal cells derived from invasive human breast and prostate carcinoma. Invasive breast and prostate cancer-associated stroma was observed to display distinct transcriptomes, with a limited number of shared genes. Interestingly, both breast and prostate tumor-specific dysregulated stromal genes were observed to cluster breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively, into two distinct groups with statistically different clinical outcomes. By contrast, a gene signature that was common to the reactive stroma of both tumor types did not have survival predictive value. Univariate Cox analysis identified genes whose expression level was most strongly associated with patient survival. Taken together, these observations suggest that the tumor microenvironment displays distinct features according to the tumor type that provides survival-predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2031675835,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a potent Ca2+-mobilizing messenger that in many cells releases Ca2+ from the endolysosomal system. Recent studies have shown that NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization is mediated by the two-pore channels (TPCs). Whether NAADP acts as a messenger in astrocytes is unclear, and downstream functional consequences have yet to be defined. Here, we show that intracellular delivery of NAADP evokes Ca2+ signals from acidic organelles in rat astrocytes and that these signals are potentiated upon overexpression of TPCs. We also show that NAADP increases acidic vesicular organelle formation and levels of the autophagic markers, LC3II and beclin-1. NAADP-mediated increases in LC3II levels were reduced in cells expressing a dominant-negative TPC2 construct. Our data provide evidence that NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals mediated by TPCs regulate autophagy.

https://openalex.org/W1963938604,"The complex physiopathological events occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI) make this devastating trauma still incurable. Self-assembling peptides (SAPs) are nanomaterials displaying some appealing properties for application in regenerative medicine because they mimic the structure of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), are reabsorbable, allow biofunctionalizations and can be injected directly into the lesion. In this study we evaluated the putative neurorigenerative properties of RADA16-4G-BMHP1 SAP, proved to enhance in vitro neural stem cells survival and differentiation. This SAP (RADA16-I) has been functionalized with a bone marrow homing motif (BMHP1) and optimized via the insertion of a 4-glycine-spacer that ameliorates scaffold stability and exposure of the biomotifs. We injected the scaffold immediately after contusion in the rat spinal cord, then we evaluated the early effects by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the late effects by histological analysis. Locomotor recovery over 8 weeks was assessed using Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) test. Gene expression analysis showed that at 7 days after lesion the functionalized SAP induced a general upregulation of GAP-43, trophic factors and ECM remodelling proteins, whereas 3 days after SCI no remarkable changes were observed. Hystological analysis revealed that 8 weeks after SCI our scaffold increased cellular infiltration, basement membrane deposition and axon regeneration/sprouting within the cyst. Moreover the functionalized SAP showed to be compatible with the surrounding nervous tissue and to at least partially fill the cavities. Finally SAP injection resulted in a statistically significant improvement of both hindlimbs' motor performance and forelimbs-hindlimbs coordination. Altogether, these results indicate that RADA16-4G-BMHP1 induced favourable reparative processes, such as matrix remodelling, and provided a physical and trophic support to nervous tissue ingrowth. Thus this biomaterial, eventually combined with cells and growth factors, may constitute a promising biomimetic scaffold for regenerative applications in the injured central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1972192702,"Asthma is associated with airway narrowing in response to bronchoconstricting stimuli and increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. In addition, some studies have suggested impaired β-agonist induced ASM relaxation in asthmatics, but the mechanism is not known.To characterize the potential defect in β-agonist induced cAMP in ASM derived from asthmatic in comparison to non-asthmatic subjects and to investigate its mechanism.We examined β(2)-adrenergic (β(2)AR) receptor expression and basal β-agonist and forskolin (direct activator of adenylyl cyclase) stimulated cAMP production in asthmatic cultured ASM (n = 15) and non-asthmatic ASM (n = 22). Based on these results, PDE activity, PDE4D expression and cell proliferation were determined.In the presence of IBMX, a pan PDE inhibitor, asthmatic ASM had ∼50% lower cAMP production in response to isoproterenol, albuterol, formoterol, and forskolin compared to non-asthmatic ASM. However when PDE4 was specifically inhibited, cAMP production by the agonists and forskolin was normalized in asthmatic ASM. We then measured the amount and activity of PDE4, and found ∼2-fold greater expression and activity in asthmatic ASM compared to non-asthmatic ASM. Furthermore, inhibition of PDE4 reduced asthmatic ASM proliferation but not that of non-asthmatic ASM.Decreased β-agonist induced cAMP in ASM from asthmatics results from enhanced degradation due to increased PDE4D expression. Clinical manifestations of this dysregulation would be suboptimal β-agonist-mediated bronchodilation and possibly reduced control over increasing ASM mass. These phenotypes appear to be ""hard-wired"" into ASM from asthmatics, as they do not require an inflammatory environment in culture to be observed."
https://openalex.org/W2063143055,"One of the most popular damage accumulation theories of ageing is the mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing (mFRTA). The mFRTA proposes that ageing is due to the accumulation of unrepaired oxidative damage, in particular damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Within the mFRTA, the ""vicious cycle"" theory further proposes that reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote mtDNA mutations, which then lead to a further increase in ROS production. Recently, data have been published on Caenorhabditis elegans mutants deficient in one or both forms of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD). Surprisingly, even double mutants, lacking both mitochondrial forms of SOD, show no reduction in lifespan. This has been interpreted as evidence against the mFRTA because it is assumed that these mutants suffer from significantly elevated oxidative damage to their mitochondria. Here, using a novel mtDNA damage assay in conjunction with related, well established damage and metabolic markers, we first investigate the age-dependent mitochondrial decline in a cohort of ageing wild-type nematodes, in particular testing the plausibility of the ""vicious cycle"" theory. We then apply the methods and insights gained from this investigation to a mutant strain for C. elegans that lacks both forms of mitochondrial SOD. While we show a clear age-dependent, linear increase in oxidative damage in WT nematodes, we find no evidence for autocatalytic damage amplification as proposed by the ""vicious cycle"" theory. Comparing the SOD mutants with wild-type animals, we further show that oxidative damage levels in the mtDNA of SOD mutants are not significantly different from those in wild-type animals, i.e. even the total loss of mitochondrial SOD did not significantly increase oxidative damage to mtDNA. Possible reasons for this unexpected result and some implications for the mFRTA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1989544518,"Deep sea scleractinian corals will be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, facing loss of up to 70% of their habitat as the Aragonite Saturation Horizon (below which corals are unable to form calcium carbonate skeletons) rises. Persistence of deep sea scleractinian corals will therefore rely on the ability of larvae to disperse to, and colonise, suitable shallow-water habitat. We used DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (16S) and mitochondrial control region (MtC) to determine levels of gene flow both within and among populations of the deep sea coral Desmophyllum dianthus in SE Australia, New Zealand and Chile to assess the ability of corals to disperse into different regions and habitats. We found significant genetic subdivision among the three widely separated geographic regions consistent with isolation and limited contemporary gene flow. Furthermore, corals from different depth strata (shallow <600 m, mid 1000-1500 m, deep >1500 m) even on the same or nearby seamounts were strongly differentiated, indicating limited vertical larval dispersal. Genetic differentiation with depth is consistent with the stratification of the Subantarctic Mode Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, the Circumpolar Deep and North Pacific Deep Waters in the Southern Ocean, and we propose that coral larvae will be retained within, and rarely migrate among, these water masses. The apparent absence of vertical larval dispersal suggests deep populations of D. dianthus are unlikely to colonise shallow water as the aragonite saturation horizon rises and deep waters become uninhabitable. Similarly, assumptions that deep populations will act as refuges for shallow populations that are impacted by activities such as fishing or mining are also unlikely to hold true. Clearly future environmental management strategies must consider both regional and depth-related isolation of deep-sea coral populations."
https://openalex.org/W1996802863,"During infection, pneumococci exist mainly in sessile biofilms rather than in planktonic form, except during sepsis. However, relatively little is known about how biofilms contribute to pneumococcal pathogenesis. Here, we carried out a biofilm assay on opaque and transparent variants of a clinical serotype 19F strain WCH159. After 4 days incubation, scanning electron microscopy revealed that opaque biofilm bacteria produced an extracellular matrix, whereas the transparent variant did not. The opaque biofilm-derived bacteria translocated from the nasopharynx to the lungs and brain of mice, and showed 100-fold greater in vitro adherence to A549 cells than transparent bacteria. Microarray analysis of planktonic and sessile bacteria from transparent and opaque variants showed differential gene expression in two operons: the lic operon, which is involved in choline uptake, and in the two-component system, ciaRH. Mutants of these genes did not form an extracellular matrix, could not translocate from the nasopharynx to the lungs or the brain, and adhered poorly to A549 cells. We conclude that only the opaque phenotype is able to form extracellular matrix, and that the lic operon and ciaRH contribute to this process. We propose that during infection, extracellular matrix formation enhances the ability of pneumococci to cause invasive disease."
https://openalex.org/W1993474489,"Yersinia pestis is a Gram negative zoonotic pathogen responsible for causing bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans. The pathogen uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence factors directly from bacterium into host mammalian cells. The system contains a single ATPase, YscN, necessary for delivery of virulence factors. In this work, we show that deletion of the catalytic domain of the yscN gene in Y. pestis CO92 attenuated the strain over three million-fold in the Swiss-Webster mouse model of bubonic plague. The result validates the YscN protein as a therapeutic target for plague. The catalytic domain of the YscN protein was made using recombinant methods and its ATPase activity was characterized in vitro. To identify candidate therapeutics, we tested computationally selected small molecules for inhibition of YscN ATPase activity. The best inhibitors had measured IC50 values below 20 µM in an in vitro ATPase assay and were also found to inhibit the homologous BsaS protein from Burkholderia mallei animal-like T3SS at similar concentrations. Moreover, the compounds fully inhibited YopE secretion by attenuated Y. pestis in a bacterial cell culture and mammalian cells at µM concentrations. The data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting and inhibiting a critical protein transport ATPase of a bacterial virulence system. It is likely the same strategy could be applied to many other common human pathogens using type III secretion system, including enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, and Burkholderia mallei/pseudomallei species."
https://openalex.org/W2034919235,"Background Many quadrupedal species stand bipedally on their hindlimbs to fight. This posture may provide a performance advantage by allowing the forelimbs to strike an opponent with the range of motion that is intrinsic to high-speed running, jumping, rapid braking and turning; the range of motion over which peak force and power can be produced. Methodology/Principal Findings To test the hypothesis that bipedal (i.e., orthograde) posture provides a performance advantage when striking with the forelimbs, I measured the force and energy produced when human subjects struck from “quadrupedal” (i.e., pronograde) and bipedal postures. Downward and upward directed striking energy was measured with a custom designed pendulum transducer. Side and forward strikes were measured with a punching bag instrumented with an accelerometer. When subjects struck downward from a bipedal posture the work was 43.70±12.59% (mean ± S.E.) greater than when they struck from a quadrupedal posture. Similarly, 47.49±17.95% more work was produced when subjects struck upward from a bipedal stance compared to a quadrupedal stance. Importantly, subjects did 229.69±44.19% more work in downward than upward directed strikes. During side and forward strikes the force impulses were 30.12±3.68 and 43.04±9.00% greater from a bipedal posture than a quadrupedal posture, respectively. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that bipedal posture does provide a performance advantage for striking with the forelimbs. The mating systems of great apes are characterized by intense male-male competition in which conflict is resolved through force or the threat of force. Great apes often fight from bipedal posture, striking with both the fore- and hindlimbs. These observations, plus the findings of this study, suggest that sexual selection contributed to the evolution of habitual bipedalism in hominins."
https://openalex.org/W1998052953,"Background Cellular metabolism plays a critical role in regulating T cell responses and the development of memory T cells with long-term protections. However, the metabolic phenotype of antigen-activated T cells that are responsible for the generation of long-lived memory cells has not been characterized. Design and Methods Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide gp33-specific CD8+ T cells derived from T cell receptor transgenic mice, we characterized the metabolic phenotype of proliferating T cells that were activated and expanded in vitro in the presence or absence of rapamycin, and determined the capability of these rapamycin-treated T cells to generate long-lived memory cells in vivo. Results Antigen-activated CD8+ T cells treated with rapamycin gave rise to 5-fold more long-lived memory T cells in vivo than untreated control T cells. In contrast to that control T cells only increased glycolysis, rapamycin-treated T cells upregulated both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). These rapamycin-treated T cells had greater ability than control T cells to survive withdrawal of either glucose or growth factors. Inhibition of OXPHOS by oligomycin significantly reduced the ability of rapamycin-treated T cells to survive growth factor withdrawal. This effect of OXPHOS inhibition was accompanied with mitochondrial hyperpolarization and elevation of reactive oxygen species that are known to be toxic to cells. Conclusions Our findings indicate that these rapamycin-treated T cells may represent a unique cell model for identifying nutrients and signals critical to regulating metabolism in both effector and memory T cells, and for the development of new methods to improve the efficacy of adoptive T cell cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2047976285,"In ecological systems, indirect interactions between plant pathogens and phytophagous arthropods can arise when infestation by a first attacker alters the common host plant so that although a second attacker could be spatially or temporally separated from the first one, the former could be affected. The induction of plant defense reactions leading to the production of secondary metabolites is thought to have an important role since it involves antagonistic and/or synergistic cross-talks that may determine the outcome of such interactions. We carried out experiments under controlled conditions on young rose plants in order to assess the impact of these indirect interactions on life history traits of three pests: the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. (Helotiales: Sclerotiniaceae), the aphid Rhodobium porosum Sanderson (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Our results indicated (i) a bi-directional negative interaction between B. cinerea and R. porosum, which is conveyed by decreased aphid growth rate and reduced fungal lesion area, as well as (ii) an indirect negative effect of B. cinerea on insect behavior. No indirect effect was observed between thrips and aphids. This research highlights several complex interactions that may be involved in structuring herbivore and plant pathogen communities within natural and managed ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1976677888,"Several research fields frequently deal with the analysis of diverse classification results of the same entities. This should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed clusters. The congruence between classifications can be quantified by clustering agreement measures, including pairwise agreement measures. Several measures have been proposed and the importance of obtaining confidence intervals for the point estimate in the comparison of these measures has been highlighted. A broad range of methods can be used for the estimation of confidence intervals. However, evidence is lacking about what are the appropriate methods for the calculation of confidence intervals for most clustering agreement measures. Here we evaluate the resampling techniques of bootstrap and jackknife for the calculation of the confidence intervals for clustering agreement measures. Contrary to what has been shown for some statistics, simulations showed that the jackknife performs better than the bootstrap at accurately estimating confidence intervals for pairwise agreement measures, especially when the agreement between partitions is low. The coverage of the jackknife confidence interval is robust to changes in cluster number and cluster size distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2080016346,"Background The scavenging ability of sufficient divalent metal ions is pivotal for pathogenic bacteria to survive in the host. ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type metal transporters provide a considerable amount of different transition metals for bacterial growth. TroA is a substrate binding protein for uptake of multiple metal ions. However, the function and structure of the TroA homologue from the epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates (SsTroA) have not been characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we determined the crystal structure of SsTroA from a highly pathogenic streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis in complex with zinc. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn2+ and Mn2+. Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn2+ and Mn2+ induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn2+/Mn2+ bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein. Conclusions/Significance Our findings reveal a mechanism for uptake of metal ions in S. suis and this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation as to how SsTroA operates in metal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2026886026,"Synaptotagmin 1 (syt1) functions as the Ca(2+) sensor in neuronal exocytosis, and it has been proposed to act by modulating lipid bilayer curvature. Here we examine the effect of the two C2 domains (C2A and C2B) of syt1 on membrane lipid order and lateral organization. In mixtures of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PS), attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that a fragment containing both domains (C2AB) or C2B alone disorders the lipid acyl chains, whereas the C2A domain has little effect upon chain order. Two observations suggest that these changes reflect a demixing of PS. First, the changes in acyl chain order are reversed at higher protein concentration; second, selective lipid deuteration demonstrates that the changes in lipid order are associated only with the PS component of the bilayer. Independent evidence for lipid demixing is obtained from fluorescence self-quenching of labeled lipid and from natural abundance (13)C NMR, where heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra reveal Ca(2+)-dependent chemical shift changes for PS, but not for phosphatidylcholine, in the presence of the syt1 C2 domains. The ability of syt1 to demix PS is observed in a range of lipid mixtures that includes cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and varied PS content. These data suggest that syt1 might facilitate SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors)-mediated membrane fusion by phase separating PS, a process that is expected to locally buckle bilayers and disorder lipids due to the curvature tendencies of PS."
https://openalex.org/W2037752797,"The multiple transferable resistance (mTR) pump from Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrCDE multidrug pump is assembled from the inner and outer membrane proteins MtrD and MtrE and the periplasmic membrane fusion protein MtrC. Previously we established that while there is a weak interaction of MtrD and MtrE, MtrC binds with relatively high affinity to both MtrD and MtrE. MtrD conferred antibiotic resistance only when it was expressed with MtrE and MtrC, suggesting that these proteins form a functional tripartite complex in which MtrC bridges MtrD and MtrE. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MtrC interacts with an intraprotomer groove on the surface of MtrE, inducing channel opening. However, a second groove is apparent at the interface of the MtrE subunits, which might also be capable of engaging MtrC. We have now established that MtrC can be cross-linked to cysteines placed in this interprotomer groove and that mutation of residues in the groove impair the ability of the pump to confer antibiotic resistance by locking MtrE in the closed channel conformation. Moreover, MtrE K390C forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with MtrC E149C locking MtrE in the open channel conformation, suggesting that a functional salt bridge forms between these residues during the transition from closed to open channel conformations. MtrC forms dimers that assemble into hexamers, and electron microscopy studies of single particles revealed that these hexamers are arranged into ring-like structures with an internal aperture sufficiently large to accommodate the MtrE trimer. Cross-linking of single cysteine mutants of MtrC to stabilize the dimer interface in the presence of MtrE, trapped an MtrC-MtrE complex with a molecular mass consistent with a stoichiometry of 3:6 (MtrE(3)MtrC(6)), suggesting that dimers of MtrC interact with MtrE, presumably by binding to the two grooves. As both MtrE and MtrD are trimeric, our studies suggest that the functional pump is assembled with a stoichiometry of 3:6:3."
https://openalex.org/W1976436133,"Movement of individuals is a critical factor determining the effectiveness of reserve networks. Marine reserves have historically been used for the management of species that are sedentary as adults, and, therefore, larval dispersal has been a major focus of marine-reserve research. The push to use marine reserves for managing pelagic and demersal species poses significant questions regarding their utility for highly-mobile species. Here, a simple conceptual metapopulation model is developed to provide a rigorous comparison of the functioning of reserve networks for populations with different admixtures of larval dispersal and adult movement in a home range. We find that adult movement produces significantly lower persistence than larval dispersal, all other factors being equal. Furthermore, redistribution of harvest effort previously in reserves to remaining fished areas (‘fishery squeeze’) and fishing along reserve borders (‘fishing-the-line’) considerably reduce persistence and harvests for populations mobile as adults, while they only marginally changes results for populations with dispersing larvae. Our results also indicate that adult home-range movement and larval dispersal are not simply additive processes, but rather that populations possessing both modes of movement have lower persistence than equivalent populations having the same amount of ‘total movement’ (sum of larval and adult movement spatial scales) in either larval dispersal or adult movement alone."
https://openalex.org/W2151094395,"Structural, neurochemical, and functional abnormalities have been identified in the brains of individuals with bipolar disorder, including in key brain structures implicated in postural control, i.e. the cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia. Given these findings, we tested the hypothesis that postural control deficits are present in individuals with bipolar disorder. Sixteen participants with bipolar disorder (BD) and 16 age-matched non-psychiatric healthy controls were asked to stand as still as possible on a force platform for 2 minutes under 4 conditions: (1) eyes open-open base; (2) eyes closed-open base; (3) eyes open-closed base; and (4) eyes closed-closed base. Postural sway data were submitted to conventional quantitative analyses of the magnitude of sway area using the center of pressure measurement. In addition, data were submitted to detrended fluctuation analysis, a nonlinear dynamical systems analytic technique that measures complexity of a time-series, on both the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions. The bipolar disorder group had increased sway area, indicative of reduced postural control. Decreased complexity in the medio-lateral direction was also observed for the bipolar disorder group, suggesting both a reduction in dynamic range available to them for postural control, and that their postural corrections were primarily dominated by longer time-scales. On both of these measures, significant interactions between diagnostic group and visual condition were also observed, suggesting that the BD participants were impaired in their ability to make corrections to their sway pattern when no visual information was available. Greater sway magnitude and reduced complexity suggest that individuals with bipolar disorder have deficits in sensorimotor integration and a reduced range of timescales available on which to make postural corrections."
https://openalex.org/W1996504868,"Background After ischemia of the CNS, extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) can reach high concentrations due to cell damage and subsequent increase of membrane permeability. ATP may cause cellular degeneration and death, mediated by P2X and P2Y receptors. Methodology/Principal Findings The effects of inhibition of P2 receptors by pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid (PPADS) on electrophysiological, functional and morphological alterations in an ischemia model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were investigated up to day 28. Spontaneously hypertensive rats received PPADS or vehicle intracerebroventricularly 15 minutes prior MCAO for up to 7 days. The functional recovery monitored by qEEG was improved by PPADS indicated by an accelerated recovery of ischemia-induced qEEG changes in the delta and alpha frequency bands along with a faster and sustained recovery of motor impairments. Whereas the functional improvements by PPADS were persistent at day 28, the infarct volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging and the amount of TUNEL-positive cells were significantly reduced by PPADS only until day 7. Further, by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we identified both neurons and astrocytes as TUNEL-positive after MCAO. Conclusion The persistent beneficial effect of PPADS on the functional parameters without differences in the late (day 28) infarct size and apoptosis suggests that the early inhibition of P2 receptors might be favourable for the maintenance or early reconstruction of neuronal connectivity in the periinfarct area after ischemic incidents."
https://openalex.org/W2024416030,"Tuberculosis (TB) and TB-human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) coinfection is a major public health concern in resource-limited settings. Although TB treatment is challenging in HIV-infected patients because of treatment interactions, immunopathological reactions, and concurrent infections, few prospective studies have addressed this in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study we aimed to determine incidence, causes of, and risk factors for serious adverse events among patients on first-line antituberculous treatment, as well as its impact on antituberculous treatment outcome.Prospective observational cohort study of adults treated for TB at the Internal Medicine department of the Kigali University Hospital from May 2008 through August 2009. Of 263 patients enrolled, 253 were retained for analysis: median age 35 (Interquartile range, IQR 28-40), 55% male, 66% HIV-positive with a median CD4 count 104 cells/mm(3) (IQR 44-248 cells/mm(3)). Forty percent had pulmonary TB, 43% extrapulmonary TB and 17% a mixed form. Sixty-four (26%) developed a serious adverse event; 58/167 (35%) HIV-infected vs. 6/86 (7%) HIV-uninfected individuals. Commonest events were concurrent infection (n = 32), drug-induced hepatitis (n = 24) and paradoxical reactions/TB-IRIS (n = 23). HIV-infection (adjusted Hazard Ratio, aHR 3.4, 95% Confidence Interval, CI 1.4-8.7) and extrapulmonary TB (aHR 2, 95%CI 1.1-3.7) were associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. For TB/HIV co-infected patients, extrapulmonary TB (aHR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1-3.9) and CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 at TB diagnosis (aHR 1.7, 95%CI 1.0-2.9) were independent predictors. Adverse events were associated with an almost two-fold higher risk of unsuccessful treatment outcome at 6 months (HR 1.89, 95%CI 1.3-3.0).Adverse events frequently complicate the course of antituberculous treatment and worsen treatment outcome, particularly in patients with extrapulmonary TB and advanced immunodeficiency. Concurrent infection accounts for most events. Our data suggest that deterioration in a patient already receiving antituberculous treatment should prompt an aggressive search for additional infections."

While basic molecular studies have implicated persisting fetal cells in the mother in some AID, supportive epidemiological evidence is limited. We investigated the effect of vaginal delivery, caesarean section (CS) and induced abortion on the risk of subsequent maternal AID. Using the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) we identified women who were born between 1960 and1992. We performed data linkage between the CRS other Danish national registers to identify women who had a pregnancy and those who developed AID. Women were categorised into 4 groups; nulligravida (control group), women who had 1st child by vaginal delivery, whose 1st delivery was by CS and who had abortions. Log-linear Poisson regression with person-years was used for data analysis adjusting for several potential confounders. There were 1,035,639 women aged >14 years and 25,570 developed AID: 43.4% nulligravida, 44.3% had their first pregnancy delivered vaginally, 7.6% CS and 4.1% abortions. The risk of AID was significantly higher in the 1st year after vaginal delivery (RR = 1.1[1.0, 1.2]) and CS (RR = 1.3[1.1, 1.5]) but significantly lower in the 1st year following abortion (RR = 0.7[0.6, 0.9]). These results suggest an association between pregnancy and the risk of subsequent maternal AID. Increased risks of AID after CS may be explained by amplified fetal cell traffic at delivery, while decreased risks after abortion may be due to the transfer of more primitive fetal stem cells. The increased risk of AID in the first year after delivery may also be related to greater testing during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2061959584,"Meningothelial cells (MECs) are the cellular components of the meninges enveloping the brain. Although MECs are not fully understood, several functions of these cells have been described. The presence of desmosomes and tight junctions between MECs hints towards a barrier function protecting the brain. In addition, MECs perform endocytosis and, by the secretion of cytokines, are involved in immunological processes in the brain. However, little is known about the influence of pathological conditions on MEC function; e.g., during diseases associated with elevated intracranial pressure, hypoxia or increased oxidative stress.We studied the effect of elevated pressure, hypoxia, and oxidative stress on immortalized human as well as primary porcine MECs. We used MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) bioreduction assays to assess the proliferation of MECs in response to treatment and compared to untreated control cells. To assess endocytotic activity, the uptake of fluorescently labeled latex beads was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.We found that exposure of MECs to elevated pressure caused significant cellular proliferation and a dramatic decrease in endocytotic activity. In addition, mild oxidative stress severely inhibited endocytosis.Elevated pressure and oxidative stress impact MEC physiology and might therefore influence the microenvironment of the subarachnoid space and thus the cerebrospinal fluid within this compartment with potential negative impact on neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2000304259,"Determining the sub-cellular localization of a protein within a cell is often an essential step towards understanding its function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the relatively large size of the body wall muscle cells and the exquisite organization of their sarcomeres offer an opportunity to identify the precise position of proteins within cell substructures. Our goal in this study is to generate a comprehensive “localizome” for C. elegans body wall muscle by GFP-tagging proteins expressed in muscle and determining their location within the cell. For this project, we focused on proteins that we know are expressed in muscle and are orthologs or at least homologs of human proteins. To date we have analyzed the expression of about 227 GFP-tagged proteins that show localized expression in the body wall muscle of this nematode (e.g. dense bodies, M-lines, myofilaments, mitochondria, cell membrane, nucleus or nucleolus). For most proteins analyzed in this study no prior data on sub-cellular localization was available. In addition to discrete sub-cellular localization we observe overlapping patterns of localization including the presence of a protein in the dense body and the nucleus, or the dense body and the M-lines. In total we discern more than 14 sub-cellular localization patterns within nematode body wall muscle. The localization of this large set of proteins within a muscle cell will serve as an invaluable resource in our investigation of muscle sarcomere assembly and function."

KLF1 (erythroid Krüppel-like factor) plays essential roles in embryonic and adult erythropoiesis. KLF2 is a positive regulator of the mouse and human embryonic β-globin genes. KLF1 and KLF2 have highly homologous zinc finger DNA-binding domains. They have overlapping roles in embryonic erythropoiesis, as demonstrated using single and double KO mouse models. Ablation of the KLF1 or KLF2 gene causes embryonic lethality, but double KO embryos are more anemic and die sooner than either single KO. In this work, a dual human β-globin locus transgenic and KLF knockout mouse model was used. The results demonstrate that the human ∈- (embryonic) and γ-globin (fetal) genes are positively regulated by KLF1 and KLF2 in embryos. Conditional KO mouse experiments indicate that the effect of KLF2 on embryonic globin gene regulation is at least partly erythroid cell-autonomous. KLF1 and KLF2 bind directly to the promoters of the human ∈- and γ-globin genes, the mouse embryonic Ey- and βh1-globin genes, and also to the β-globin locus control region, as demonstrated by ChIP assays with mouse embryonic blood cells. H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 marks indicate open chromatin and active transcription, respectively. These marks are diminished at the Ey-, βh1-, ∈- and γ-globin genes and locus control region in KLF1−/− embryos, correlating with reduced gene expression. Therefore, KLF1 and KLF2 positively regulate the embryonic and fetal β-globin genes through direct promoter binding.

The human β-globins are encoded by four major genes, ∈ (embryonic), Gγ and Aγ (fetal), and β (adult), located on chromosome 11. The mouse β-globin locus contains four genes, two embryonic (Ey and βh1), and two adult (βmaj and βmin).The expression of the β-globin genes is jointly regulated by elements in the promoter regions and an upstream enhancer region, the locus control region (LCR). The human β-globin LCR, located 6–22 kb upstream of the ∈-globin gene, contains multiple erythroid-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) and plays a crucial role in maintaining β-globin gene expression (5Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Examples of regulatory elements within the promoters of all β-globin genes are TATA, CAAT, and CACCC (7Lloyd J.A. Lee R.F. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4339-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of transcription factors that bind GC-rich sequences such as CACCC elements. The KLFs bind DNA via three carboxyl-terminal Cys-2/His-2 zinc fingers (8Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Seventeen mammalian proteins have been identified in this family and are designated KLF1 to KLF17. KLFs are implicated in many cellular functions, such as erythropoiesis, cell differentiation, proliferation, and tissue development (9McConnell B.B. Yang V.W. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1337-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The human and mouse KLF proteins are highly conserved. For example, KLF1 is 73% similar in the two species (although 90% similar within the zinc finger domain), and KLF2 is 90% similar in mouse and man.KLF1, also known as erythroid Krüppel-like factor or EKLF, is expressed only in erythroid cells and plays essential roles in embryonic and adult β-globin gene expression (10Perkins A.C.

Semiquantitative ChIP assays revealed that HA-tagged KLF1 binds to the promoters of the embryonic β-like globin genes (Ey and βh1), to HS1, HS2, HS3, and HS5 in mouse primitive erythroid cells, and to the promoter of the mouse adult βmaj-globin gene in primitive and definitive cells (13Zhou D. Pawlik K.M. Ren J. Sun C.W. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16052-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). KLF1 interacts with CBP, p300, and PCAF, which have histone acetyltransferase activity (14Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). KLF1 is also implicated in erythroid processes other than β-globin gene regulation, such as cell maturation and cell membrane integrity (15Hodge D. Coghill E. Keys J. Maguire T. Hartmann B.

Yang V.W. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1337-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). KLF2 is a positive regulator of the mouse and human embryonic β-globin genes (17Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). KLF1 and KLF2 have high homology within their DNA-binding domains and reside close to each other on the same chromosome in human and mouse, suggesting that they originated from a gene duplication event (17Basu P.

KLF1 and KLF2 can partially functionally compensate for each other in regulating the mouse embryonic β-globin genes. When both KLF1 and KLF2 are simultaneously ablated in mice, the amounts of Ey- and βh1-globin mRNA are reduced more than in KLF1 or KLF2 single knockouts (12Basu P. Lung T.K. Lemsaddek W.

Like KLF1, KLF2 recruits proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity such as CBP, p300 and PCAF (18SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I.

In this study, we wished to determine whether KLF1 and KLF2 also control the human embryonic and fetal β-globin genes. This knowledge could facilitate therapeutic strategies to express these genes in adults with β-hemoglobinopathies. A second goal was to further establish the mechanistic roles of KLF1 and KLF2 in globin gene regulation. In this work, it was determined that KLF1 and KLF2 mRNA are expressed in similar amounts in mouse primitive erythroid cells. The expression of KLF1 but not KLF2 mRNA is greatly increased in definitive erythroid cells. Transgenic mice that harbor the complete human β-globin locus (19Gaensler K.M. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Strouboulis J. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), in conjunction with gene knockouts, were used to determine that KLF1 and KLF2 positively regulate human ∈- and γ-globin gene expression in the embryo. KLF2 has an erythroid cell autonomous role in embryonic globin gene regulation, although it may also have non-cell-autonomous functions. In quantitative ChIP assays, KLF1 and KLF2 bind to the promoters of the mouse embryonic Ey- and βh1-globin and the human ∈- and γ-globin genes in mouse primitive erythroid cells. KLF1, but not KLF2, is required to establish the normal histone modification status in the mouse and human β-globin loci in mouse primitive erythroid cells. Although both KLF1 and KLF2 directly affect globin gene regulation through the same DNA binding sites, their mechanisms of action appear to be somewhat different.DISCUSSIONIt was originally believed that KLF1 is required only for adult β-globin gene expression because KLF1 KO mice die just after the embryonic to adult β-globin gene switch (10Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 11Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, more quantitative mRNA analyses in KLF1 KO mouse embryos established that KLF1 regulates mouse Ey- and βh1-globin gene expression in primitive erythroid cells (12Basu P. Lung T.K. Lemsaddek W. Sargent T.G. Williams Jr., D.C. Basu M. Redmond L.C. Lingrel J.B. Haar J.L. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2007; 110: 3417-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). KLF2 also has a role in mouse Ey- and βh1-globin gene regulation (17Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in transgenic mouse models, KLF2 regulates the human ∈- and γ-globin genes in the E10.5 yolk sac (17Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we established that KLF1 is also required for normal expression of the human embryonic ∈- and fetal γ-globin genes during mouse primitive erythropoiesis.It is shown here that KLF2 has an erythroid cell autonomous role in mouse embryonic βh1-globin gene expression, as would be expected if it directly regulates the globin genes. Furthermore, KLF1 and KLF2 occupy the promoters of the mouse Ey- and βh1-globin and human ∈- and γ-globin genes, supporting their direct roles in globin gene regulation. The ChIP data provides the first quantitative evidence that KLF1 binds to the β-globin promoters during primitive erythropoiesis. We did not detect KLF1 at the promoter of the βmaj-globin gene, as was reported in semiquantitative assays using a tagged KLF1 knockin in primitive erythroid cells (13Zhou D. Pawlik K.M. Ren J. Sun C.W. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16052-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). KLF2 directly binds to the promoters/enhancers of key regulators of stem cell pluripotency in ES cells (25Jiang J. Chan Y.S. Loh Y.H. Cai J. Tong G.Q. Lim C.A. Robson P. Zhong S. Ng H.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Our data shows that KLF2 is directly recruited to the promoters of the murine and human embryonic and fetal β-globin genes in native primitive erythroid cells.Our work indicates that KLF1 acts directly as a positive regulator of the human ∈- and γ-globin and mouse Ey- and βh1-globin genes during embryonic erythropoiesis. This is in contrast to increasing evidence that has recently emerged, supporting an indirect negative role for KLF1 in γ-globin gene regulation during adult erythropoiesis.

A heterozygous K288X mutation is found in a Maltese family with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The mutation eliminates the KLF1 zinc fingers and hence abrogates DNA binding (38Borg J.

Interestingly, an S270X mutation in a Sardinian family does not cause an increase in HbF even though it eliminates the zinc fingers (39Satta S. Perseu L. Moi P. Asunis I. Cabriolu A. Maccioni L.

The mechanism for the negative effect of KLF1 on γ-globin gene regulation in the adult is most probably indirect via up-regulation of BCL11A (38Borg J. Papadopoulos P. Georgitsi M. Gutiérrez L. Grech G. Fanis P. Phylactides M. Verkerk A.J. van der Spek P.J. Scerri C.A. Cassar W. Galdies R. van Ijcken W. Ozgür Z. Gillemans N. Hou J. Bugeja M. Grosveld F.G. von Lindern M. Felice A.E.

Genet. 2010; 42: 742-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Apparently, KLF1 can positively or negatively affect γ-globin gene regulation, depending on the erythroid cell milieu.The expression patterns of KLF1 and KLF2 in primitive and definitive erythroid cells were analyzed and reveal a possible explanation for the different milieu at the two stages. The ratio of KLF1 to KLF2 mRNA increases dramatically as erythroid cells switch from the primitive to the definitive stage. KLF1 acts as a repressor of megakaryocytic differentiation genes and therefore drives megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells toward erythroid differentiation (41Isern J. Fraser S.T. He Z. Zhang H. Baron M.H. Blood. 2010; 116: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that KLF1 is also involved in the switch from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis. It is plausible that KLF2 drives erythroid cells toward embryonic globin gene expression, opposing the role of KLF1.KLF1 and KLF2 have a high degree of homology in their zinc finger domains and can partially compensate for each other in embryonic erythroid cells, probably because they regulate common target genes (12Basu P.

Functional overlap between family members of transcription factors is common. GATA1 and GATA2, for example, can compensate fully or partially for each other during erythropoiesis (42Fujiwara Y.

Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primitive erythroid cells are present in GATA1 KO embryos. GATA2 KO embryos show a modest reduction in the number of primitive erythroid precursors. However, when both GATA1 and GATA2 are ablated, no primitive erythroid cells are detected (42Fujiwara Y. Chang A.N. Williams A.M. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When expressed under the control of the GATA1 hematopoietic regulatory domain, GATA2 can rescue the GATA1 KO phenotype (44Hosoya-Ohmura S. Mochizuki N. Suzuki M. Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32820-32830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, cross-regulation can occur between transcription factor family members. KLF2, for example, positively regulates KLF1 in primitive erythroid cells (12Basu P. Lung T.K. Lemsaddek W. Sargent T.G. Williams Jr., D.C. Basu M. Redmond L.C. Lingrel J.B. Haar J.L. Lloyd J.A.

Our work provides the first demonstration in native embryonic erythroid cells that H3K9Ac is associated only with the actively transcribed globin genes. In contrast, in a previous study of mouse embryonic erythropoiesis using an antibody that detects both H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac (i.e. H3Ac), H3Ac and H3K4me2 enrichment was found at both the embryonic and adult β-globin genes (50Fromm G. Bulger M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the human β-globin locus, H3Ac and H3K4me2 are detected within the LCR, and only at the active β-globin genes (50Fromm G. Bulger M. Biochem.

In K562, a human cell line that expresses the fetal γ- but not the adult β-globin gene, H3Ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 are enriched specifically at the γ-globin gene (52Kim A. Kiefer C.M. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). H3K4me3 is enriched only in the actively transcribed fetal and adult β-globin genes in human and mouse tissue culture cell models, respectively (52Kim A. Kiefer C.M. Dean A. Mol. Cell.

Our results in native embryonic erythroid cells differ in that H3K4me3 is somewhat enriched at the mouse adult βmaj-globin gene at E10.5 prior to its activation.KLF1 binds to histone-modifying proteins such as CBP, p300, and PCAF (14Zhang W.

Our data indicate for the first time that H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 are reduced at the mouse Ey- and βh1-globin and human ∈- and γ-globin genes in primitive erythroid cells lacking KLF1. Transcription factors have been implicated previously in affecting histone modifications. The presence of GATA1 correlates with histone acetylation, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 at the murine β-globin locus (55Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Kim S.I. Boyer M.E. Imbalzano A.N. Bieker J.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17065-17070Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation and H3K4me3 are significantly reduced in the adult β-globin gene by the absence of KLF1 in E13.5 fetal liver cells (56Bottardi S. Ross J. Pierre-Charles N. Blank V. Milot E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is difficult to dissect cause and effect in these cases. It is not known whether reduced transcription because of the absence of the transcription factor leads to decreased H3Ac and H3K4me3 or vice versa. However, there is a strong correlation between the presence of KLF1 and the occurrence of histone marks found in actively transcribed genes.A simple model incorporating the available data is that KLF1 and KLF2 interchangeably (but not simultaneously) bind to the same CACCC elements in the LCR and promoters in the β-globin locus and promote gene expression in the embryo. This model is supported by the fact that KLF1 and KLF2 have very similar DNA binding domains, that there is no evidence that they can form dimers, and that they are likely to be present in similar amounts in embryonic blood cells. Individually, the effect of KLF1 on globin gene regulation tends to be greater than that of KLF2, based on qRT-PCR in the mouse KO models. Interestingly, this draws a parallel with our results studying histone marks in KLF1−/− and KLF2−/− embryonic blood cells. In these experiments, KLF1 binding correlates with histone marks that are associated with transcription, whereas KLF2 does not appear to dictate histone modifications in the β-globin locus. Yet, both KLF1 and KLF2 positively regulate globin gene transcription through direct binding to CACCC elements in the locus. Therefore, there are distinct yet overlapping mechanistic roles for KLF1 and KLF2 in embryonic red blood cells. IntroductionErythroid cells are one of the first differentiated cell types in embryos (1Baron M.H. Fraser S.T. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2005; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There are two unique processes in development: primitive and definitive erythropoiesis.

Gauldie J. Patterson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The human β-globins are encoded by four major genes, ∈ (embryonic), Gγ and Aγ (fetal), and β (adult), located on chromosome 11. The mouse β-globin locus contains four genes, two embryonic (Ey and βh1), and two adult (βmaj and βmin).The expression of the β-globin genes is jointly regulated by elements in the promoter regions and an upstream enhancer region, the locus control region (LCR). The human β-globin LCR, located 6–22 kb upstream of the ∈-globin gene, contains multiple erythroid-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) and plays a crucial role in maintaining β-globin gene expression (5Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 6Fraser P. Hurst J. Collis P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Examples of regulatory elements within the promoters of all β-globin genes are TATA, CAAT, and CACCC (7Lloyd J.A. Lee R.F. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4339-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are a family of transcription factors that bind GC-rich sequences such as CACCC elements. The KLFs bind DNA via three carboxyl-terminal Cys-2/His-2 zinc fingers (8Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Seventeen mammalian proteins have been identified in this family and are designated KLF1 to KLF17. KLFs are implicated in many cellular functions, such as erythropoiesis, cell differentiation, proliferation, and tissue development (9McConnell B.B. Yang V.W. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1337-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The human and mouse KLF proteins are highly conserved. For example, KLF1 is 73% similar in the two species (although 90% similar within the zinc finger domain), and KLF2 is 90% similar in mouse and man.KLF1, also known as erythroid Krüppel-like factor or EKLF, is expressed only in erythroid cells and plays essential roles in embryonic and adult β-globin gene expression (10Perkins A.C.

Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative ChIP assays revealed that HA-tagged KLF1 binds to the promoters of the embryonic β-like globin genes (Ey and βh1), to HS1, HS2, HS3, and HS5 in mouse primitive erythroid cells, and to the promoter of the mouse adult βmaj-globin gene in primitive and definitive cells (13Zhou D. Pawlik K.M. Ren J. Sun C.W. Townes T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16052-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). KLF1 interacts with CBP, p300, and PCAF, which have histone acetyltransferase activity (14Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). KLF1 is also implicated in erythroid processes other than β-globin gene regulation, such as cell maturation and cell membrane integrity (15Hodge D. Coghill E. Keys J. Maguire T. Hartmann B.

Yang V.W. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1337-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). KLF2 is a positive regulator of the mouse and human embryonic β-globin genes (17Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). KLF1 and KLF2 have high homology within their DNA-binding domains and reside close to each other on the same chromosome in human and mouse, suggesting that they originated from a gene duplication event (17Basu P. Morris P.E. Haar J.L. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Gaensler K.M. Lloyd J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2566-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). KLF1 and KLF2 can partially functionally compensate for each other in regulating the mouse embryonic β-globin genes. When both KLF1 and KLF2 are simultaneously ablated in mice, the amounts of Ey- and βh1-globin mRNA are reduced more than in KLF1 or KLF2 single knockouts (12Basu P. Lung T.K. Lemsaddek W.

Like KLF1, KLF2 recruits proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity such as CBP, p300 and PCAF (18SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I.

In this study, we wished to determine whether KLF1 and KLF2 also control the human embryonic and fetal β-globin genes. This knowledge could facilitate therapeutic strategies to express these genes in adults with β-hemoglobinopathies. A second goal was to further establish the mechanistic roles of KLF1 and KLF2 in globin gene regulation. In this work, it was determined that KLF1 and KLF2 mRNA are expressed in similar amounts in mouse primitive erythroid cells. The expression of KLF1 but not KLF2 mRNA is greatly increased in definitive erythroid cells. Transgenic mice that harbor the complete human β-globin locus (19Gaensler K.M. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Strouboulis J. Dillon N. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), in conjunction with gene knockouts, were used to determine that KLF1 and KLF2 positively regulate human ∈- and γ-globin gene expression in the embryo. KLF2 has an erythroid cell autonomous role in embryonic globin gene regulation, although it may also have non-cell-autonomous functions. In quantitative ChIP assays, KLF1 and KLF2 bind to the promoters of the mouse embryonic Ey- and βh1-globin and the human ∈- and γ-globin genes in mouse primitive erythroid cells. KLF1, but not KLF2, is required to establish the normal histone modification status in the mouse and human β-globin loci in mouse primitive erythroid cells. Although both KLF1 and KLF2 directly affect globin gene regulation through the same DNA binding sites, their mechanisms of action appear to be somewhat different."
https://openalex.org/W2076212201,"The region of Churchill, Manitoba, contains a wide variety of habitats representative of both the boreal forest and arctic tundra and has been used as a model site for biodiversity studies for nearly seven decades within Canada. Much previous work has been done in Churchill to study the Daphnia pulex species complex in particular, but no study has completed a wide-scale survey on the crustacean species that inhabit Churchill's aquatic ecosystems using molecular markers. We have employed DNA barcoding to study the diversity of the Branchiopoda (Crustacea) in a wide variety of freshwater habitats and to determine the likely origins of the Churchill fauna following the last glaciation. The standard animal barcode marker (COI) was sequenced for 327 specimens, and a 3% divergence threshold was used to delineate potential species. We found 42 provisional and valid branchiopod species from this survey alone, including several cryptic lineages, in comparison with the 25 previously recorded from previous ecological works. Using published sequence data, we explored the phylogeographic affinities of Churchill's branchiopods, finding that the Churchill fauna apparently originated from all directions from multiple glacial refugia (including southern, Beringian, and high arctic regions). Overall, these microcrustaceans are very diverse in Churchill and contain multiple species complexes. The present study introduces among the first sequences for some understudied genera, for which further work is required to delineate species boundaries and develop a more complete understanding of branchiopod diversity over a larger spatial scale."
https://openalex.org/W2155163444,"Several studies suggest that speech understanding can sometimes benefit from the presence of filled pauses (uh, um, and the like), and that words following such filled pauses are recognised more quickly. Three experiments examined whether this is because filled pauses serve to delay the onset of upcoming words and these delays facilitate auditory word recognition, or whether the fillers themselves serve to signal upcoming delays in a way which informs listeners' reactions. Participants viewed pairs of images on a computer screen, and followed recorded instructions to press buttons corresponding to either an easy (unmanipulated, with a high-frequency name) or a difficult (visually blurred, low-frequency) image. In all three experiments, participants were faster to respond to easy images. In 50% of trials in each experiment, the name of the image was directly preceded by a delay; in the remaining trials an equivalent delay was included earlier in the instruction. Participants were quicker to respond when a name was directly preceded by a delay, regardless of whether this delay was filled with a spoken um, was silent, or contained an artificial tone. This effect did not interact with the effect of image difficulty, nor did it change over the course of each experiment. Taken together, our consistent finding that delays of any kind help word recognition indicates that natural delays such as fillers need not be seen as ‘signals’ to explain the benefits they have to listeners' ability to recognise and respond to the words which follow them."
https://openalex.org/W2058590353,"Plexin receptors regulate cell adhesion, migration, and guidance. The Rho GTPase binding domain (RBD) of plexin-A1 and -B1 can bind GTPases, including Rnd1. By contrast, plexin-C1 and -D1 reportedly bind Rnd2 but associate with Rnd1 only weakly. The structural basis of this differential Rnd1 GTPase binding to plexin RBDs remains unclear. Here, we solved the structure of the plexin-A2 RBD in complex with Rnd1 and the structures of the plexin-C1 and plexin-D1 RBDs alone, also compared with the previously determined plexin-B1 RBD.Rnd1 complex structure. The plexin-A2 RBD·Rnd1 complex is a heterodimer, whereas plexin-B1 and -A2 RBDs homodimerize at high concentration in solution, consistent with a proposed model for plexin activation. Plexin-C1 and -D1 RBDs are monomeric, consistent with major residue changes in the homodimerization loop. In plexin-A2 and -B1, the RBD β3-β4 loop adjusts its conformation to allow Rnd1 binding, whereas minimal structural changes occur in Rnd1. The plexin-C1 and -D1 RBDs lack several key non-polar residues at the corresponding GTPase binding surface and do not significantly interact with Rnd1. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements on plexin-C1 and -D1 mutants reveal that the introduction of non-polar residues in this loop generates affinity for Rnd1. Structure and sequence comparisons suggest a similar mode of Rnd1 binding to the RBDs, whereas mutagenesis suggests that the interface with the highly homologous Rnd2 GTPase is different in detail. Our results confirm, from a structural perspective, that Rnd1 does not play a role in the activation of plexin-C1 and -D1. Plexin functions appear to be regulated by subfamily-specific mechanisms, some of which involve different Rho family GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2080867613,"The densin C-terminal domain can target Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) in cells. Although the C-terminal domain selectively binds CaMKIIα in vitro, full-length densin associates with CaMKIIα or CaMKIIβ in brain extracts and in transfected HEK293 cells. This interaction requires a second central CaMKII binding site, the densin-IN domain, and an ""open"" activated CaMKII conformation caused by Ca(2+)/calmodulin binding, autophosphorylation at Thr-286/287, or mutation of Thr-286/287 to Asp. Mutations in the densin-IN domain (L815E) or in the CaMKIIα/β catalytic domain (I205/206K) disrupt the interaction. The amino acid sequence of the densin-IN domain is similar to the CaMKII inhibitor protein, CaMKIIN, and a CaMKIIN peptide competitively blocks CaMKII binding to densin. CaMKII is inhibited by both CaMKIIN and the densin-IN domain, but the inhibition by densin is substrate-selective. Phosphorylation of a model peptide substrate, syntide-2, or of Ser-831 in AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits is fully inhibited by densin. However, CaMKII phosphorylation of Ser-1303 in NMDA receptor GluN2B subunits is not effectively inhibited by densin in vitro or in intact cells. Thus, densin can target multiple CaMKII isoforms to differentially modulate phosphorylation of physiologically relevant downstream targets."
https://openalex.org/W1652565242,"The γ and ε subunits of F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase from photosynthetic organisms display unique properties not found in other organisms. Although the γ subunit of both chloroplast and cyanobacterial F(0)F(1) contains an extra amino acid segment whose deletion results in a high ATP hydrolysis activity (Sunamura, E., Konno, H., Imashimizu-Kobayashi, M., Sugano, Y., and Hisabori, T. (2010) Plant Cell Physiol. 51, 855-865), its ε subunit strongly inhibits ATP hydrolysis activity. To understand the physiological significance of these phenomena, we studied mutant strains with (i) a C-terminally truncated ε (ε(ΔC)), (ii) γ lacking the inserted sequence (γ(Δ198-222)), and (iii) a double mutation of (i) and (ii) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Although thylakoid membranes from the ε(ΔC) strain showed higher ATP hydrolysis and lower ATP synthesis activities than those of the wild type, no significant difference was observed in growth rate and in intracellular ATP level both under light conditions and during light-dark cycles. However, both the ε(ΔC) and γ(Δ198-222) and the double mutant strains showed a lower intracellular ATP level and lower cell viability under prolonged dark incubation compared with the wild type. These data suggest that internal inhibition of ATP hydrolysis activity is very important for cyanobacteria that are exposed to prolonged dark adaptation and, in general, for the survival of photosynthetic organisms in an ever-changing environment."
https://openalex.org/W1987244512,"Previous effective connectivity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed dynamic causal streams along the dorsal attention network (DAN) during voluntary attentional control in the human brain. During resting state, however, fMRI has shown that the DAN is also intrinsically configured by functional connectivity, even in the absence of explicit task demands, and that may conflict with effective connectivity studies. To resolve this contradiction, we performed an effective connectivity analysis based on partial Granger causality (pGC) on event-related fMRI data during Posner's cueing paradigm while optimizing experimental and imaging parameters for pGC analysis. Analysis by pGC can factor out exogenous or latent influences due to unmeasured variables. Typical regions along the DAN with greater activation during orienting than withholding of attention were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). pGC analysis on fMRI data from the ROIs showed that frontal-to-parietal top-down causal streams along the DAN appeared during (voluntary) orienting, but not during other, less-attentive and/or resting-like conditions. These results demonstrate that these causal streams along the DAN exclusively mediate voluntary covert orienting. These findings suggest that neural representations of attention in frontal regions are at the top of the hierarchy of the DAN for embodying voluntary attentional control."

It has been hypothesized that neurodegeneration may share common mechanisms with oncogenesis. We tested whether α-Syn expression affects tumorigenesis of three types of tumors. Specifically, B16 melanoma, E0771 mammary gland adenocarcinoma and D122 Lewis lung carcinoma. For this aim, we utilized transgenic mice expression the human A53T α-Syn form. We found that the in vivo growth of B16 and E0771 but not D122 was enhanced in the A53T α-Syn mice. The effect on tumorigenesis was not detected in age-matched APP/PS1 mice, modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a specific effect for α-Syn- dependent neurodegeneration. Importantly, transgenic α-Syn expression was detected within the three tumor types. We further show uptake of exogenously added, purified α-Syn, by the cultured tumor cells. In accord, with the affected tumorigenesis in the young A53T α-Syn mice, over- expression of α-Syn in cultured B16 and E0771 cells enhanced proliferation, however, had no effect on the proliferation of D122 cells. Based on these results, we suggest that certain forms of α-Syn may selectively accelerate cellular mechanisms leading to cancer."

We aimed to determine whether a PEGylated LIF inhibitor (PEGLA) was an effective contraceptive following vaginal delivery and to identify non-uterine targets of PEGLA in mice.Vaginally-applied (125)I-PEGLA accumulated in blood more slowly (30 min vs 10 min) and showed reduced tissue and blood retention (24 h vs 96 h) compared to intraperitoneal injection in mice. Vaginally-applied PEGLA blocked implantation. PEGLA administered by intraperitoneal injection inhibited bone remodelling whereas vaginally-applied PEGLA had no effect on bone. Further, PEGLA had no effect in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, suggesting PEGLA cannot target the central nervous system.Vaginally-administered PEGLA is a promising non-hormonal contraceptive, one which could be delivered alone, or in tandem with a microbicide. Vaginal application reduced the total dose of PEGLA required to block implantation and eliminated the systemic effect on bone, showing the vagina is a promising site of administration for larger drugs which target organs within the reproductive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2138880839,"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by the accumulation of the misfolded isoform (PrPSc) of the prion protein (PrPC). Cell-based screens have identified several compounds that induce a reduction in PrPSc levels in infected cultured cells. However, the molecular targets of most antiprion compounds remain unknown. We undertook a large-scale, unbiased, cell-based screen for antiprion compounds and then investigated whether a representative subset of the active molecules had measurable affinity for PrP, increased the susceptibility of PrPSc to proteolysis, or altered the cellular localization or expression level of PrPC. None of the antiprion compounds showed in vitro affinity for PrP or had the ability to disaggregate PrPSc in infected brain homogenates. These observations suggest that most antiprion compounds identified in cell-based screens deploy their activity via non-PrP targets in the cell. Our findings indicate that in comparison to PrP conformers themselves, proteins that play auxiliary roles in prion propagation may be more effective targets for future drug discovery efforts.

Misfolding and aggregation of endogenously expressed proteins cause several neurodegenerative disorders (1Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem.

Prion diseases belong to this class of proteinopathies and result from the misfolding of the α-helix-rich, cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a β-sheet-rich, disease-causing, infectious isoform termed PrPSc (3Prusiner S.B.

Unlike other neurodegenerative disorders, prion diseases are readily transmissible to laboratory animals and cultured cells. The availability of laboratory models harboring the infectious aggregate has enabled the development of an empirical drug discovery strategy against prion diseases. Typically, prion-infected, neuronally derived cell lines that accumulate and stably propagate PrPSc (7Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are used as a primary screen for the identification of compounds that reduce prion levels in culture. Subsequently, the in vivo efficacy of putative antiprion compounds is assessed by analyzing their ability to prolong disease incubation periods in prion-infected rodents. Using this approach, numerous antiprion compounds have been identified, including pentosan polysulfate, dextran sulfate, HPA-23, Congo red, suramin, dendritic polyamines, 2-aminothiazoles, and quinacrine (9Trevitt C.R. Collinge J. Brain. 2006; 129: 2241-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, none of these compounds have been shown to be effective against a variety of prion strains in animal models when administered at a late, post-symptomatic stage, and none have been shown to have significant disease-modifying properties in human clinical studies. Although measuring PrPSc levels in infected cultured cells can be used to assess antiprion activity, this method does not elucidate the molecular targets of active compounds. As a result, the mechanisms of action of most antiprion compounds remain unknown. In principle, a compound can reduce the prion load in a cell by interacting with a number of molecular targets. The most direct mechanism is through direct binding to PrPC and stabilization of its native conformation (10Nicoll A.J. Trevitt C.R. Tattum M.H. Risse E. Quarterman E. Ibarra A.A. Wright C. Jackson G.S. Sessions R.B. Farrow M. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17610-17615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a drug may directly interact with PrPSc, leading to its disaggregation (12Supattapone S. Nguyen H.O. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14529-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), or may target auxiliary factors or proteins that play a role in PrPC expression, localization, or conversion to PrPSc (13Perrier V. Wallace A.C. Kaneko K. Safar J. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6073-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To investigate whether antiprion compounds identified in prion-infected neuronal cell lines have a tendency to interact with PrPC, PrPSc, or other targets, we screened a library of 2,160 known drugs and natural products and identified 206 compounds that cleared PrPSc in neuroblastoma (N2a) cell lines at a concentration of less than 1 μm. Of these initial hits, we validated the activity of 16 compounds and assessed their ability to bind to recombinant PrP, directly disaggregate PrPSc, reduce the expression level of PrPC, and alter the localization of PrPC. Taken together, the results suggest that the antiprion activity of these compounds is mainly mediated by non-PrP targets. The chemical library of 2,160 compounds screened in both cell-based and direct-binding assays was obtained from the MicroSource Discovery System (MSDI, Gaylordsville, CT), and includes known drugs, bioactives, and natural products. Compounds were solubilized at 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 2The abbreviations used are: DMSOdimethyl sulfoxideITCisothermal titration calorimetryDSFdifferential scanning fluorimetryTMAOtrimethylamine N-oxideGdnHClguanidine hydrochloride. and stored in a 96-well format by the Small Molecule Discovery Center at the University of California San Francisco. dimethyl sulfoxide isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning fluorimetry trimethylamine N-oxide guanidine hydrochloride. A mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line was infected with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) strain of scrapie prions to produce ScN2a cells (14Bosque P.J. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4377-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Screening the chemical library for antiprion activity was performed in a high-throughput ELISA. Briefly, 4 × 104 ScN2a cells were treated with the compound of interest for 5 days at 1 μm final concentration. Untreated ScN2a cells were used as negative controls; ScN2a cells treated with quinacrine (1 μm) were used as positive controls (15Korth C. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9836-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 16May B.C. Fafarman A.T. Hong S.B. Rogers M. Deady L.W. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A toxicity screen was conducted in parallel at the same compound concentration and time of exposure in a 96-well format using an acetomethoxy derivative of calcein (calcein-AM) assay. Untreated ScN2a cells were used as negative controls. Both of these methods have been described previously (17Ghaemmaghami S. Phuan P.W. Perkins B. Ullman J. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17971-17976Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Ghaemmaghami S. May B.C. Renslo A.R. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). ScN2a cells (5 × 105) were propagated in a 10-cm plate and treated for 5 days with the compound of interest at 50, 20, 10, or 1 μm, depending on cellular toxicity. Negative controls were performed by treating cells with DMSO alone. As a positive control, cells were treated with 1 μm quinacrine. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) and protein concentration was normalized to 1 mg/ml using the BCA assay. Samples were incubated with 20 μg/ml of proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Digestions were stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. PrP was detected by using D13 antibody Fab fragment conjugated (19Williamson R.A. Peretz D. Pinilla C. Ball H. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. Houghten R.A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9413-9418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.). Truncated recombinant mouse (Mo) PrP(89–230) and full-length recombinant MoPrP(23–230) were overexpressed and purified as previously described (20Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stöckel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E. Vandlen R. Henner D. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Lyophilized pellets were dissolved in a denaturation buffer (6.4 m GdnHCl, room temperature, 30 min) at 1 or 5 mg/ml for truncated or full-length proteins, respectively. The protein was then diluted 4-fold with cold refolding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA) and dialyzed 2 times against the screening buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.1, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. ITC measurements were performed at 37 °C using the ITC200 Microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare). To counteract the backlash effect observed during the first injection (22Mizoue L.S. Tellinghuisen J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), ITC titrations were carried out with one 0.2-μl injection of ligand (compound), followed by 10 consecutive injections of 3.8 μl of the compound with injection durations of 4- and 150-s intervals between injections. The amount of energy released was measured following each injection. Prior to each measurement, DMSO was added to the protein sample to reach a final concentration of 1%. The sample chamber was filled with 15 μm recombinant MoPrP(89–230), which had been dialyzed previously in the screening buffer (see protein preparation). Solution stocks of compounds were prepared at 20 mm in 100% DMSO. Solutions of titrants were freshly prepared by diluting them with the dialyzed buffer to reach a 200 μm final concentration (1% final DMSO). Titrant solutions were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were loaded into the syringe. The final molar ratio of ligand:protein exceeded 2.5. Isotherm data were analyzed with Origin7 software (MicroCal) supplied by the manufacturer. CD spectra of both truncated and full-length recombinant MoPrP were recorded at 10 μm, with a 0.1-cm cuvette using a Jasco J-715 spectrometer with a Jasco PTC-348WI Peltier-effect temperature control device, where the temperature reported reflects that of the heating block. Scans were acquired at 50 nm/min, with a bandwidth of 2 nm and data spacing of 0.1 nm. Thermal unfolding curves were measured at 10 μm recombinant MoPrP(89–230) and MoPrP(23–230). All compound solutions were made fresh from 100 mm DMSO stock solutions. Prior to each run, samples were equilibrated with the compound of interest for 15 min at 20 °C, then a temperature ramp rate of 2 °C/min was applied from 20 to 90 °C. To attenuate DMSO noise background, a wavelength of 230 nm was used to monitor protein unfolding. The melting point was determined from the thermal unfolding curve fit by the two-state folding EXAM algorithm (23Morton A. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8564-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Beadle B.M. Shoichet B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A Δu Cp value of 4.76 kJ mol−1 K−1 was set in the fitting of the van't Hoff equation to determine the melting temperature (Tm) and the ΔH of the transition. A significant thermal upshift was defined as ΔTm exceeding the standard deviation of the technique (σ = 0.4 °C) by a factor of three. The standard deviation was calculated based on three Tm measurements of native PrP. Protein stability was assessed in a 96-well format using an MxPro3005P qRT-PCR Detection System (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies). Sypro-Orange dye (Invitrogen) was used to monitor the fluorescence by applying ROX filter for the fluorescence emission (610 nm) and FAM filter for the fluorescence excitation (492 nm). Optimal conditions to perform the assay were determined by varying protein concentrations, Sypro-Orange dilutions, buffers, and thermal ramp parameters. To experimentally screen compounds, recombinant MoPrP(89–230) and Sypro-Orange dye were plated manually. Stock solutions of 10 mm compounds (100% DMSO) were freshly diluted in the screening buffer (1:10 ratio), then added to the protein by using a 96/384 pipettors robot (Apricot Designs) to achieve a final compound concentration of 1 mm (1% final DMSO). DSF spectra of 10 μm recombinant MoPrP(89–230) with a 1:2000 Sypro-Orange dilution in the screening buffer were recorded. Samples (150 μl final) were heated at 2 °C/min, from 40 to 90 °C, and the fluorescence values were recorded after every 1 °C increase. Approximations of the melting temperature (Tm) were assessed by using the maximum value of the first derivative generated by the qPCR software (MxPro QPCR software, Stratagene, Agilent Technologies). To evaluate changes in Tm, for each run, first derivatives of the melting curves were generated from the MxPro software, exported as a text file and imported in Mathematica software. The first derivative of the curves was fitted with a polynomial function. Tm was approximated by determining the maximum value of the fitted first derivative plot. To analyze the effects of the compounds on PrPC expression, uninfected N2a cells were incubated with the selected molecules for 5 days. Negative control cells were incubated with DMSO (0.5% final concentration). After treatment and cell lysis, normalized crude extracts were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using conjugated D13-HRP antibody to detect PrP. PrPC expression levels were normalized with respect to actin controls (Fig. 6). For dose-response analysis of amcinonide, N2a cells were treated for 3 days and quantified by Western immunoblotting as described above. Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software. PrPSc and PrPC levels in compound-treated cells were normalized against the levels in untreated control cells. Brain homogenates (10% w/v) were prepared from terminal CD-1 mice infected with RML prions, then diluted 10-fold using an acidic sodium acetate buffer supplemented by detergents (5 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, 1% Nonidet P-40). Ninety μl of 1% brain homogenates (0.6 mg/ml) were incubated with 10 μl of test compounds or polyamidoamine (PAMAM) generation 4.0 and 4.5 to reach final concentrations of 100 μm or 100 μg/ml, respectively. Samples were incubated for 2 h with constant shaking at 37 °C. After neutralization with 100 μl of a freshly prepared buffer containing 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 4% Sarkosyl, samples were subjected to PK digestion (20 μl/ml, 1 h of incubation at 37 °C). Proteolytic digestions were stopped by the addition of PMSF (2 mm final concentration), and samples were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using conjugated D13-HRP antibody to detect PrP. For lipid raft isolation, N2a cells were treated with the compounds for 3 days in 6-well plates. Plates were placed on ice, cells were rinsed twice with chilled PBS and incubated for 20 min with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer made with Mes-buffered saline (25 mm Mes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The lysates were then homogenized by passing through a Luer 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cell debris. Cold supernatants were harvested, normalized to 0.5 mg/ml, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% (v/v) sucrose to obtain a 40% (v/v) sucrose solution. A 1-ml aliquot of the sample was then transferred to the bottom of a SW-60 centrifuge tube. Two ml of 30% sucrose was then added to the top, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 5% sucrose to create a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Tubes were centrifuged at 4 °C for 18 h at 140,000 × g in a SW-60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Fractions (1–8; 500 μl) were collected from the top and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using D13-HRP antibody (see the immunoblotting section). Flotillin-1 (Sigma) was probed by immunoblot and used as a marker for detergent-resistant membranes. N2a cells (2.5 × 105) were plated on a coverslip (Fisher Scientific, Circles No. 1.5) placed in a 24-well plate format, and treated for 3 days with the selected compounds. Cells were washed with warm (37 °C) PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed 3 times for 5 min with room temperature PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and then rinsed 3 times with PBS buffer. Cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated with primary D18 antibody (5 μg/ml) in 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed successively 3 times with PBS for 10 min, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H&L) polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml diluted in 10% normal goat serum, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Samples were rinsed 3 times with PBS for 10 min in the dark. Coverslips were rinsed briefly with water, then mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) with Vectashield with the counterstain DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with Cytoseal. Slides were analyzed at the QB3-UCSF Nikon Imaging Center on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E Motorized Inverted Microscope. Images represent individual Z-slices taken from the middle of the cell. Uninfected N2a cells were incubated with amcinonide at 50 μm or 0.5% DMSO (untreated control cells) for 6, 24, 48, or 72 h. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using the SuperScript II First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR at 42 °C for 60 min (Invitrogen), and then diluted 10-fold in water. Two microliters were used in duplicate for quantitative PCR amplification of Prnp, and actin as an internal control, using the MxPro3005P qRT-PCR apparatus (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies). The following program was used: denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of PCR (denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 8 s, elongation at 72 °C for 15 s). Primers were as follows: Actin, forward, gatcattgctcctcctgagc-5′; reverse, ctcatcgtactcctgcttgc-3′; Prnp: forward, cgagaccgatgtgaagatga-5′; reverse, atcccacgatcaggaagatg-3′. The curves of amplification were read with MxPro 3005P software using the comparative cycle threshold method. Relative quantifications of the target mRNAs were calculated after normalization of cycle thresholds with respect to actin levels. Values are expressed as fold-change compared with untreated cells (0.5% DMSO). N2a cells were preincubated with amcinonide at 20 μm or 0.5% DMSO (untreated control cells) for 3 days. Subsequently, 30 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the culture to inhibit protein synthesis, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for various durations. Cells were then lysed and residual PrPC levels were evaluated by Western immunoblotting. We screened a chemical library of 2,160 compounds containing known drugs and natural products (Microsource) for antiprion activity in ScN2a cells. The cell-based assay was carried out in a multiwell format and PrPSc levels were measured using an ELISA-based assay (18Ghaemmaghami S. May B.C. Renslo A.R. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells treated with DMSO (carrier) and quinacrine (a known antiprion drug (15Korth C. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9836-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar)) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. These measurements were used as reference to calculate the normalized percentage change in PrPSc levels following treatment with experimental compounds. ScN2a cells were treated with compounds for 5 days at a concentration of 1 μm. In parallel, we analyzed the cytotoxicity of all compounds at this concentration by employing the calcein AM assay for membrane integrity (25Lichtenfels R. Biddison W.E. Schulz H. Vogt A.B. Martin R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The level of cytotoxicity was normalized with respect to untreated cells. Based on the distribution of activity and cytotoxicity measurements (Fig. 1, A and B), we defined a “hit” as a compound that reduced PrPSc load by 40% with less than 20% cytotoxicity as measured by the calcein AM assay (Fig. 1C). Using these criteria, we identified 206 nontoxic compounds with antiprion activity. A previous screen of the MicroSource compound library also identified active compounds (26Kocisko D.A. Baron G.S. Rubenstein R. Chen J. Kuizon S. Caughey B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), most of which were included in our hit set as well (Fig. 1C, red dots). We randomly selected 40 hits for secondary validation. Initially, compounds were added to ScN2a cells at a concentration of 50 μm. For compounds that proved toxic at this concentration, the experiments were repeated at 20, 10, and 1 μm to assess the antiprion activity of the compound at the highest possible nontoxic concentration. Changes in PK-resistant PrPSc levels were analyzed by Western blots. We were able to confirm the antiprion activity of 16 of 40 compounds (Fig. 1D). Some of these 16 compounds belonged to chemical classes previously known to have antiprion properties (statins, flavones, resveratrol, chalcone, quercetin, phenothiazine, and corticosteroid (26Kocisko D.A. Baron G.S. Rubenstein R. Chen J. Kuizon S. Caughey B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 27Kocisko D.A. Engel A.L. Harbuck K. Arnold K.M. Olsen E.A. Raymond L.D. Vilette D. Caughey B. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 388: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Several were, as far as we are aware, novel: these include dehydrovariabilin, 3-deoxy-3β-hydroangolensic acid methyl ester, and glycosides (Table 1). Experiments conducted on prion-infected N2a cells in the presence of the 16 compounds revealed a proportional decrease of all three glycoforms (unglycosylated, monoglycosylated, and diglycosylated) of digested PrPSc (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the compounds neither alter PrP glycosylation nor depend on PrP glycosylation for their antiprion activity.TABLE 1Validated antiprion compoundsFor each compound, the reduction in PrPC and PrPSc levels in culture, interaction with recPrP detected by ITC, induced ΔTm in recPrP measured by CD, induced disaggregation of PrPSc in vitro, and the ability to disrupt lipid rafts are reported. Open table in a new tab For each compound, the reduction in PrPC and PrPSc levels in culture, interaction with recPrP detected by ITC, induced ΔTm in recPrP measured by CD, induced disaggregation of PrPSc in vitro, and the ability to disrupt lipid rafts are reported. Next, we assessed the ability of these 16 antiprion compounds to interact directly with recombinant MoPrP(89–230) containing the structured domain of PrP found in the proteinase-resistant core of PrPSc (28Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). ITC was used to measure direct binding between the compounds and recombinant PrP. We first sought to establish the ITC protocol with a control compound that is known to interact with PrP. We used suramin as a positive control as it has been shown to interact nonspecifically with PrP, inducing its aggregation (29Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Nunziante M. Kehler C. Maas E. Kassack M.U. Groschup M. Schätzl H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4959-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used ITC to analyze the interaction between suramin and PrP at concentrations of 200 and 15 μm, respectively. In the presence of suramin, we observed a substantial release of energy for the first injections (approximately −6.0 Kcal/mol of injectant), demonstrating an interaction between the partners (Fig. 2A). Using the same experimental parameters, we performed ITC with the 16 confirmed antiprion compounds to detect any significant release of energy upon injection. No substantial release of energy was detected for any of the 16 compounds (Fig. 2B), suggesting that none interacted with recombinant MoPrP(89–230). We next sought to measure the binding of compounds to PrP by a thermal-denaturation upshift assay. Ligand binding and protein folding are thermodynamically linked, and the binding of a ligand stabilizes proteins against denaturation (31Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We therefore used thermal denaturation to quantify potential binding of antiprion compounds by detecting induced upshifts in the melting temperature of PrP. We initially assessed the reversibility of the thermal unfolding of recombinant truncated MoPrP(89–230). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of truncated PrP were measured successively at 20 and 90 °C (supplemental Fig. S1A). As expected, CD spectra indicated a loss of secondary structure at 90 °C. On subsequent cooling, MoPrP(89–230) regained its α-helical signal, indicating that the thermal unfolding of MoPrP(89–230) is reversible. We then determined the melting temperature (Tm) of truncated recombinant PrP by monitoring the change in α-helical content of the protein as a function of temperature. The resulting melting curve was well fit by a two-state unfolding model. The Tm for MoPrP(89–230) was 65.3 ± 0.4 °C and the van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation was 270.4 ± 15.7 kJ/mol. We investigated whether changes in protein stability could be robustly detected by this approach. The melting point of PrP was measured in the presence of stabilizing and destabilizing agents. In the presence of 1 m trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a chemical chaperone (11Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), protein stability increased substantially (Tm = 70.5 ± 0.2 °C; ΔTm = +5.2 °C). Conversely, addition of 1 m of the denaturant GdnHCl decreased the melting temperature (Tm = 62.3 ± 0.4 °C; ΔTm = −3.0 °C) (supplemental Fig. S1B). Having validated the assay with known stabilizing and destabilizing agents, we proceeded to analyze the potential binding interactions of the 16 cell-active antiprion compounds with the structured domain of PrP. The compounds (100 μm) were added to 10 μm recombinant MoPrP(89–230). Denaturation of truncated PrP in the presence of DMSO alone was used as a negative control. In accordance with the ITC results, none of the 16 compounds significantly increased the Tm of MoPrP(89–230), suggesting that they neither stabilized nor interacted with the folded domain of the protein (Fig. 3, A and B). To discount the possibility of compounds binding to the N-terminal unstructured region of PrP, we repeated the thermal-denaturation upshift assays using recombinant full-length MoPrP(23–230). The unfolding of MoPrP(23–230) was reversible (supplemental Fig. S1C) and changes in protein stability in the presence of TMAO or GdnHCl could be detected (supplemental Fi"

We hypothesize that there is a differential regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) determined by the alterations in the functions of plasma membrane Ca(L) channels and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cerebral and small mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of simulated microgravity rats, respectively.Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 28-day hindlimb unweighting to simulate microgravity. In addition, tail-suspended rats were submitted to a recovery period of 3 or 7 days after removal of suspension. The function of Ca(L) channels was evaluated by patch clamp and Western blotting. The function of ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases in response to caffeine were assessed by a laser confocal microscope. Our results indicated that simulated microgravity increased the functions of Ca(L) channels and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases in cerebral VSMCs, whereas, simulated microgravity decreased the functions of Ca(L) channels and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases in small mesenteric VSMCs. In addition, 3- or 7-day recovery after removal of suspension could restore the functions of Ca(L) channels and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases to their control levels in cerebral and small mesenteric VSMCs, respectively.The differential regulation of Ca(L) channels and ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) releases in cerebral and small mesenteric VSMCs may be responsible for the differential regulation of intracellular Ca(2+), which leads to the altered autoregulation of cerebral vasculature and the inability to adequately elevate peripheral vascular resistance in postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2036853843,"The ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins make up a large superfamily with members coming from all kingdoms. The functional form of the ABC protein nucleotide binding domain (NBD) is dimeric with ATP binding sites shared between subunits. The NBD is defined by six motifs: the Walker A, Q-loop, Signature, Walker-B, D-loop, and H-loop. The D-loop contains a conserved aspartate whose function is not clear but has been proposed to be involved in cross-talk between ATP binding sites. Structures of various ABC proteins suggest an interaction between the D-loop aspartate and an asparagine residue located in Walker A loop of the opposing subunit. Here, we evaluate the functional role of the D-loop using a bacteriophage T4 ABC protein, Rad50 (gp46). Mutation of either the D-loop aspartate or the Walker A asparagine results in dramatic reductions in ATP affinity, hydrolysis rate, and cooperativity. The mutant proteins bind Mre11 (gp47) and DNA normally, but no longer support the ATP-dependent nuclease activities of Mre11. We propose that the D-loop aspartate functions to stabilize the Walker A asparagine in a position favorable for catalysis. We find that the asparagine is crucially important to the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by increasing the affinity for ATP and positioning the γ-phosphate of ATP for catalysis. Additionally, we propose that the asparagine acts as a γ-phosphate sensor and, through its interaction with the conserved D-loop aspartate, transmits conformational changes across the dimer interface to the second ATP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2157362017,"The rotavirus (RV) genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. Sometimes, partial sequence duplication of an RNA segment leads to a rearranged RNA segment. To specify the impact of rearrangement, the replication efficiencies of human RV with rearranged segments 7, 11 or both were compared to these of the homologous human wild-type RV (wt-RV) and of the bovine wt-RV strain RF. As judged by viral growth curves, rotaviruses with a rearranged genome (r-RV) had no selective growth advantage over the homologous wt-RV. In contrast, r-RV were selected over wt-RV during competitive experiments (i.e mixed infections between r-RV and wt-RV followed by serial passages in cell culture). Moreover, when competitive experiments were performed between a human r-RV and the bovine wt-RV strain RF, which had a clear growth advantage, rearranged segments 7, 11 or both always segregated in viral progenies even when performing mixed infections at an MOI ratio of 1 r-RV to 100 wt-RV. Lastly, bovine reassortant viruses that had inherited a rearranged segment 7 from human r-RV were generated. Although substitution of wt by rearranged segment 7 did not result in any growth advantage, the rearranged segment was selected in the viral progenies resulting from mixed infections by bovine reassortant r-RV and wt-RV, even for an MOI ratio of 1 r-RV to 107 wt-RV. Lack of selective growth advantage of r-RV over wt-RV in cell culture suggests a mechanism of preferential packaging of the rearranged segments over their standard counterparts in the viral progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2094239595,"Binding of a neurotransmitter to its membrane receptor opens an integral ion conducting pore. However, prolonged exposure to the neurotransmitter drives the receptor to a refractory state termed desensitization, which plays an important role in shaping synaptic transmission. Despite intensive research in the past, the structural mechanism of desensitization is still elusive. Using mutagenesis and voltage clamp in an oocyte expression system, we provide several lines of evidence supporting a novel hypothesis that uncoupling between binding and gating machinery is the underlying mechanism for α7 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) desensitization. First, the decrease in gate tightness was highly correlated to the reduced desensitization. Second, nonfunctional mutants in three important coupling loops (loop 2, loop 7, and the M2-M3 linker) could be rescued by a gating mutant. Furthermore, the decrease in coupling strength in these rescued coupling loop mutants reversed the gating effect on desensitization. Finally, coupling between M1 and hinge region of the M2-M3 linker also influenced the receptor desensitization. Thus, the uncoupling between N-terminal domain and transmembrane domain, governed by the balance of coupling strength and gate tightness, underlies the mechanism of desensitization for the α7 nAChR.

https://openalex.org/W2149226648,"Endothelial cells represent an important barrier between the intravascular compartment and extravascular tissues, and therefore serve as key sensors, communicators, and amplifiers of danger signals in innate immunity and inflammation. Double stranded DNA (dsDNA) released from damaged host cells during injury or introduced by pathogens during infection, has emerged as a potent danger signal. While the dsDNA-mediated immune response has been extensively studied in immune cells, little is known about the direct and indirect effects of dsDNA on the vascular endothelium. In this study we show that direct dsDNA stimulation of endothelial cells induces a potent proinflammatory response as demonstrated by increased expression of ICAM1, E-selectin and VCAM1, and enhanced leukocyte adhesion. This response was dependent on the stress kinases JNK and p38 MAPK, required the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors NFκB and IRF3, and triggered the robust secretion of TNFα for sustained secondary activation of the endothelium. DNA-induced TNFα secretion proved to be essential in vivo, as mice deficient in the TNF receptor were unable to mount an acute inflammatory response to dsDNA. Our findings suggest that the endothelium plays an active role in mediating dsDNA-induced inflammatory responses, and implicate its importance in establishing an acute inflammatory response to sterile injury or systemic infection, where host or pathogen derived dsDNA may serve as a danger signal."
https://openalex.org/W2036074724,"Most eukaryotes have at least some genes interrupted by introns. While it is well accepted that introns were already present at moderate density in the last eukaryote common ancestor, the conspicuous diversity of intron density among genomes suggests a complex evolutionary history, with marked differences between phyla. The question of the rates of intron gains and loss in the course of evolution and factors influencing them remains controversial. We have investigated a single gene family, alpha-amylase, in 55 species covering a variety of animal phyla. Comparison of intron positions across phyla suggests a complex history, with a likely ancestral intronless gene undergoing frequent intron loss and gain, leading to extant intron/exon structures that are highly variable, even among species from the same phylum. Because introns are known to play no regulatory role in this gene and there is no alternative splicing, the structural differences may be interpreted more easily: intron positions, sizes, losses or gains may be more likely related to factors linked to splicing mechanisms and requirements, and to recognition of introns and exons, or to more extrinsic factors, such as life cycle and population size. We have shown that intron losses outnumbered gains in recent periods, but that “resets” of intron positions occurred at the origin of several phyla, including vertebrates. Rates of gain and loss appear to be positively correlated. No phase preference was found. We also found evidence for parallel gains and for intron sliding. Presence of introns at given positions was correlated to a strong protosplice consensus sequence AG/G, which was much weaker in the absence of intron. In contrast, recent intron insertions were not associated with a specific sequence. In animal Amy genes, population size and generation time seem to have played only minor roles in shaping gene structures."
https://openalex.org/W2009106818,"Glyphosate is a non-selective broad-spectrum herbicide that inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS, also designated as AroA), a key enzyme in the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway in microorganisms and plants. Previously, we reported that a novel AroA (PpAroA1) from Pseudomonas putida had high tolerance to glyphosate, with little homology to class I or class II glyphosate-tolerant AroA. In this study, the coding sequence of PpAroA1 was optimized for tobacco. For maturation of the enzyme in chloroplast, a chloroplast transit peptide coding sequence was fused in frame with the optimized aroA gene (PparoA1(optimized)) at the 5' end. The PparoA1(optimized) gene was introduced into the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. W38) genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transformed explants were first screened in shoot induction medium containing kanamycin. Then glyphosate tolerance was assayed in putative transgenic plants and its T(1) progeny. Our results show that the PpAroA1 from Pseudomonas putida can efficiently confer tobacco plants with high glyphosate tolerance. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing the PparoA1(optimized) gene exhibit high tolerance to glyphosate, which suggest that the novel PpAroA1 is a new and good candidate applied in transgenic crops with glyphosate tolerance in future."
https://openalex.org/W1973353742,"Background Prion protein (PrP) level plays the central role in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) susceptibility. Increasing the level of PrP decreases incubation period for this disease. Therefore, studying the expression of the cellular PrP or at least the messenger RNA might be used in selection for preventing the propagation of BSE and other prion diseases. Two insertion/deletion (indel) variations have been tentatively associated with susceptibility/resistance of cattle to classical BSE. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the expression of each genotype at the two indel sites in Japanese Black (JB) and Japanese Brown (JBr) cattle breeds by a standard curve method of real-time PCR. Five diplotypes subdivided into two categories were selected from each breed. The two cattle breeds were considered differently. Expression of PRNP was significantly (p<0.0001) greater in the homozygous deletion genotype at the 23-bp locus in JB breed. Compared to the homozygous genotypes, the expression of PRNP was significantly greater in the heterozygous genotype at the 12-bp locus in JB (p<0.0001) and in JBr (p = 0.0394) breeds. In addition, there was a statistical significance in the PRNP levels between the insertion and the deletion alleles of the 23-bp locus in JB (p = 0.0003) as well as in JBr (p = 0.0032). There was no significance in relation to sex, age, geographical location or due to their interactions (p>0.05). Conclusion Our results suggest that the del/del genotype or at least its del allele may modulate the expression of PRNP at the 23-bp locus in the medulla oblongata of these cattle breeds."
https://openalex.org/W1993023410,"The Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 2 subtype 2c (HCV-2c) is detected as a low prevalence subtype in many countries, except in Southern Europe and Western Africa. The current epidemiology of HCV in Argentina, a low-prevalence country, shows the expected low prevalence for this subtype. However, this subtype is the most prevalent in the central province of Córdoba. Cruz del Eje (CdE), a small rural city of this province, shows a prevalence for HCV infections of 5%, being 90% of the samples classified as HCV-2c. In other locations of Córdoba Province (OLC) with lower prevalence for HCV, HCV-2c was recorded in about 50% of the samples. The phylogenetic analysis of samples from Córdoba Province consistently conformed a monophyletic group with HCV-2c sequences from all the countries where HCV-2c has been sequenced. The phylogeographic analysis showed an overall association between geographical traits and phylogeny, being these associations significant (α = 0.05) for Italy, France, Argentina (places other than Córdoba), Martinique, CdE and OLC. The coalescence analysis for samples from CdE, OLC and France yielded a Time for the Most Common Recent Ancestor of about 140 years, whereas its demographic reconstruction showed a “lag” phase in the viral population until 1880 and then an exponential growth until 1940. These results were also obtained when each geographical area was analyzed separately, suggesting that HCV-2c came into Córdoba province during the migration process, mainly from Europe, which is compatible with the history of Argentina of the early 20th century. This also suggests that the spread of HCV-2c occurred in Europe and South America almost simultaneously, possibly as a result of the advances in medicine technology of the first half of the 20th century."
https://openalex.org/W2009271720,"Obesity and obesity co-morbidities are associated with a low grade inflammation and elevated serum levels of acute phase proteins, including serum amyloid A (SAA). In the non-acute phase in humans, adipocytes are major producers of SAA but the function of adipocyte-derived SAA is unknown. To clarify the role of adipocyte-derived SAA, a transgenic mouse model expressing human SAA1 (hSAA) in adipocytes was established. hSAA expression was analysed using real-time PCR analysis. Male animals were challenged with a high fat (HF) diet. Plasma samples were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation. hSAA, cholesterol and triglyceride content were measured in plasma and in FPLC fractions. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed an adipose tissue-specific hSAA gene expression. Moreover, the hSAA gene expression was not influenced by HF diet. However, hSAA plasma levels in HF fed animals (37.7±4.0 µg/mL, n = 7) were increased compared to those in normal chow fed animals (4.8±0.5 µg/mL, n = 10; p<0.001), and plasma levels in the two groups were in the same ranges as in obese and lean human subjects, respectively. In FPLC separated plasma samples, the concentration of hSAA peaked in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) containing fractions. In addition, cholesterol distribution over the different lipoprotein subfractions as assessed by FPLC analysis was similar within the two experimental groups. The established transgenic mouse model demonstrates that adipose tissue produced hSAA enters the circulation, resulting in elevated plasma levels of hSAA. This new model will enable further studies of metabolic effects of adipose tissue-derived SAA."
https://openalex.org/W1978521317,"Novel pathways in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are being identified in gene expression studies in PCOS tissues; such pathways may contain key genes in disease etiology. Previous expression studies identified both dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) and DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1 (DNAJB1) as differentially expressed in PCOS tissue, implicating them as candidates for PCOS susceptibility. To test this, we genotyped a discovery cohort of 335 PCOS cases and 198 healthy controls for three DKK1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and four DNAJB1 SNPs and a replication cohort of 396 PCOS cases and 306 healthy controls for 1 DKK1 SNP and 1 DNAJB1 SNP. SNPs and haplotypes were determined and tested for association with PCOS and component phenotypes. We found that no single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with PCOS risk; however, the major allele of rs1569198 from DKK1 was associated with increased total testosterone (discovery cohort P = 0.0035) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (replication cohort P = 0.05). Minor allele carriers at rs3962158 from DNAJB1 had increased fasting insulin (discovery cohort P = 0.003), increased HOMA-IR (discovery cohort P = 0.006; replication cohort P = 0.036), and increased HOMA-%B (discovery cohort P = 0.004). Carriers of haplotype 2 at DNAJB1 also had increased fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-%B. These findings suggest that genetic variation in DKK1 and DNAJB1 may have a role in the hyperandrogenic and metabolic dysfunction of PCOS, respectively. Our results also demonstrate the utility of gene expression data as a source of novel candidate genes in PCOS, a complex and still incompletely defined disease, for which alternative methods of gene identification are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2090450952,"The acquisition of mitochondria was a key event in eukaryote evolution. The aim of this study was to identify homologues of the components of the mitochondrial protein import machinery in the brown alga Ectocarpus and to use this information to investigate the evolutionary history of this fundamental cellular process. Detailed searches were carried out both for components of the protein import system and for related peptidases. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses were used to investigate the evolution of mitochondrial proteins during eukaryote diversification. Key observations include phylogenetic evidence for very ancient origins for many protein import components (Tim21, Tim50, for example) and indications of differences between the outer membrane receptors that recognize the mitochondrial targeting signals, suggesting replacement, rearrangement and/or emergence of new components across the major eukaryotic lineages. Overall, the mitochondrial protein import components analysed in this study confirmed a high level of conservation during evolution, indicating that most are derived from very ancient, ancestral proteins. Several of the protein import components identified in Ectocarpus, such as Tim21, Tim50 and metaxin, have also been found in other stramenopiles and this study suggests an early origin during the evolution of the eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2001955872,"We have previously described a new family of mutant adenoviruses carrying different combinations of attB/attP sequences from bacteriophage PhiC31 flanking the Ad5 packaging domain. These novel helper viruses have a significantly delayed viral life cycle and a severe packaging impairment, regardless of the presence of PhiC31 recombinase. Their infectious viral titers are significantly lower (100–1000 fold) than those of control adenovirus at 36 hours post-infection, but allow for efficient packaging of helper-dependent adenovirus. In the present work, we have analyzed which steps of the adenovirus life cycle are altered in attB-helper adenoviruses and investigated whether these viruses can provide the necessary viral proteins in trans. The entry of attB-adenoviral genomes into the cell nucleus early at early timepoints post-infection was not impaired and viral protein expression levels were found to be similar to those of control adenovirus. However, electron microscopy and capsid protein composition analyses revealed that attB-adenoviruses remain at an intermediate state of maturation 36 hours post-infection in comparison to control adenovirus which were fully mature and infective at this time point. Therefore, an additional 20–24 hours were found to be required for the appearance of mature attB-adenovirus. Interestingly, attB-adenovirus assembly and infectivity was restored by inserting a second packaging signal close to the right-end ITR, thus discarding the possibility that the attB-adenovirus genome was retained in a nuclear compartment deleterious for virus assembly. The present study may have substantive implications for helper-dependent adenovirus technology since helper attB-adenovirus allows for preferential packaging of helper-dependent adenovirus genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2063846972,"The pivotal role of the hippocampus for spatial memory is well-established. However, while neurophysiological and imaging studies suggest a specialization of the hippocampus for viewpoint-independent or allocentric memory, results from human lesion studies have been less conclusive. It is currently unclear whether disproportionate impairment in allocentric memory tasks reflects impairment of cognitive functions that are not sufficiently supported by regions outside the medial temporal lobe or whether the deficits observed in some studies are due to experimental factors. Here, we have investigated whether hippocampal contributions to spatial memory depend on the spatial references that are available in a certain behavioral context. Patients with medial temporal lobe lesions affecting systematically the right hippocampal formation performed a series of three oculomotor tasks that required memory of a spatial cue either in retinal coordinates or relative to a single environmental reference across a delay of 5000 ms. Stimulus displays varied the availability of spatial references and contained no complex visuo-spatial associations. Patients showed a selective impairment in a condition that critically depended on memory of the geometric relationship between spatial cue and environmental reference. We infer that regions of the medial temporal lobe, most likely the hippocampal formation, contribute to behavior in conditions that exceed the potential of viewpoint-dependent or egocentric representations. Apparently, this already applies to short-term memory of simple geometric relationships and does not necessarily depend on task difficulty or integration of landmarks into more complex representations. Deficient memory of basic geometric relationships may represent a core deficit that contributes to impaired performance in allocentric spatial memory tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2016710805,"Background Clinical practice guidelines are important for guiding practice, but it is unclear if they are commensurate with the available evidence. Methods We examined guidelines produced by cancer and gynecological societies and organizations and evaluated their coverage of and stance towards chemotherapy for advanced stage disease among 4 gynecological malignancies (breast, ovarian, cervical, endometrial cancer) where the evidence for the use of chemotherapy is very different (substantial and conclusive for breast and ovarian cancer, limited and suggesting no major benefit for cervical and endometrial cancer). Eligible societies and organizations were identified through systematic internet searches (last update June 2009). Pertinent websites were scrutinized for presence of clinical practice guidelines, and relative guidelines were analyzed. Results Among 224 identified eligible societies and organizations, 69 (31%) provided any sort of guidelines, while recommendations for chemotherapy on advanced stage gynecological malignancies were available in 20 of them. Only 14 had developed their own guideline, and only 5 had developed guidelines for all 4 malignancies. Use of levels of evidence and grades of recommendations, and aspects of the production, implementation, and timeliness of the guidelines did not differ significantly across malignancies. Guidelines on breast and ovarian cancer utilized significantly more randomized trials and meta-analyses. Guidelines differed across malignancies on their coverage of disease-free survival (p = 0.033), response rates (p = 0.024), symptoms relief (p = 0.005), quality of life (p = 0.001) and toxicity (p = 0.039), with breast and ovarian cancer guidelines typically covering more frequently these outcomes. All guidelines explicitly or implicitly endorsed the use of chemotherapy. Conclusions Clinical practice guidelines are provided by the minority of professional societies and organizations. Available guidelines tend to recommend chemotherapy even for diseases where the effect of chemotherapy is controversial and recommendations are based on scant evidence."
