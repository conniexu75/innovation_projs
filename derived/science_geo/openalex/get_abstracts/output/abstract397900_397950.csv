A new optical frequency comb generation principle has emerged that uses parametric frequency conversion in high resonance quality factor ( Q ) microresonators. This approach provides access to high repetition rates in the range of 10 to 1000 gigahertz through compact, chip-scale integration, permitting an increased number of comb applications, such as in astronomy, microwave photonics, or telecommunications. We review this emerging area and discuss opportunities that it presents for novel technologies as well as for fundamental science."
https://openalex.org/W2057666228,"Condensed matter physicists have long sought a realistic two-dimensional (2D) magnetic system whose ground state is a {\it spin liquid}---a zero temperature state in which quantum fluctuations have melted away any form of magnetic order. The nearest-neighbor $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice has seemed an ideal candidate, but in recent years some approximate numerical approaches to it have yielded instead a valence bond crystal. We have used the density matrix renormalization group to perform very accurate simulations on numerous cylinders with circumferences up to 12 lattice spacings, finding instead of the valence bond crystal a singlet-gapped spin liquid with substantially lower energy that appears to have $Z_2$ topological order. Our results, through a combination of very low energy, short correlation lengths and corresponding small finite size effects, a new rigorous energy bound, and consistent behavior on many cylinders, provide strong evidence that the 2D ground state of this model is a gapped spin liquid."

The molecular basis for replication perturbation in this context is currently unknown. We studied the replication dynamics in cells in which a regulator of S phase entry and cell proliferation, the Rb-E2F pathway, is aberrantly activated. Aberrant activation of this pathway by HPV-16 E6/E7 or cyclin E oncogenes significantly decreased the cellular nucleotide levels in the newly transformed cells. Exogenously supplied nucleosides rescued the replication stress and DNA damage and dramatically decreased oncogene-induced transformation. Increased transcription of nucleotide biosynthesis genes, mediated by expressing the transcription factor c-myc, increased the nucleotide pool and also rescued the replication-induced DNA damage. Our results suggest a model for early oncogenesis in which uncoordinated activation of factors regulating cell proliferation leads to insufficient nucleotides that fail to support normal replication and genome stability.

Rb-E2F activation leads to replication stress, DNA damage, and transformation Cells with activated Rb-E2F proliferate without sufficient nucleotide levels Exogenous nucleosides rescue replication stress, DNA damage, and transformation c-Myc expression increases the nucleotide pool and rescues the replication stress Oncogenesis drives cell proliferation by interfering with various cellular pathways. One such pathway is the retinoblastoma (Rb) E2F pathway (Rb-E2F), an important regulator of cell proliferation. Rb is a key player in cell-cycle regulation, restricting cell proliferation by direct inhibition of the E2F family of transcription factors (van den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008van den Heuvel S. Dyson N.J. Conserved functions of the pRB and E2F families.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). One oncogene deregulating the Rb-E2F pathway is the human papillomavirus (HPV) E7, which binds and degrades Rb. This degradation leads to aberrant activation of the E2F family of proteins, which promotes cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. HPV infection is the major cause of cervical cancer in women. Another oncogene that aberrantly activates the Rb-E2F pathway is cyclin E, which is overexpressed in many cancers, including carcinomas, lymphomas, leukemias, and sarcomas (Akli and Keyomarsi, 2003Akli S. Keyomarsi K. Cyclin E and its low molecular weight forms in human cancer and as targets for cancer therapy.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: S38-S47PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin E regulates S phase entry by Rb phosphorylation and inactivation, facilitating E2F release. Overexpression of cyclin E greatly accelerates S phase entry in cultured cells (Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Cyclin-dependent regulation of G1 in mammalian fibroblasts.Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Aberrant activation of the Rb-E2F pathway leads to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosomal instability (Frame et al., 2006Frame F.M. Rogoff H.A. Pickering M.T. Cress W.D. Kowalik T.F. E2F1 induces MRN foci formation and a cell cycle checkpoint response in human fibroblasts.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3258-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Pickering and Kowalik, 2006Pickering M.T. Kowalik T.F. Rb inactivation leads to E2F1-mediated DNA double-strand break accumulation.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This leads to senescence or apoptosis, providing a barrier to cancer progression. In order to overcome this barrier, the high-risk HPV expresses the E6 oncoprotein, which induces proteasomal degradation of p53, thus avoiding cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Hence, together, E6 and E7 enable proliferative activity of HPV-infected cells (Duensing and Münger, 2004Duensing S. Münger K. Mechanisms of genomic instability in human cancer: insights from studies with human papillomavirus oncoproteins.Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In cancers involving cyclin E overexpression, additional mutations abrogating the DNA damage response are required to overcome the apoptosis/senescence barrier (Gorgoulis et al., 2005Gorgoulis V.G.

Chromosomal instability is a hallmark feature of nearly all solid tumors and adult onset leukemias. This instability develops at early stages of cancer neoplasia and can be detected even in premalignant lesions (Duensing and Münger, 2003Duensing S. Münger K.

Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain this genome instability, including shortening of telomeres (Plug-DeMaggio et al., 2004Plug-DeMaggio A.W. Sundsvold T. Wurscher M.A. Koop J.I.

Lee L.Y. Duensing A. Basile J. Piboonniyom S. Gonzalez S. Crum C.P. Munger K. The human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins cooperate to induce mitotic defects and genomic instability by uncoupling centrosome duplication from the cell division cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 10002-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These mechanisms contribute mainly to chromosomal changes, which appear in more advanced stages of cancer development (Gorgoulis et al., 2005Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.V. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. et al.Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and genomic instability in human precancerous lesions.Nature. 2005; 434: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). In early stages, the instability was found preferentially at fragile sites, genomic regions sensitive to replication perturbation (Gorgoulis et al., 2005Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.V. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. et al.Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and genomic instability in human precancerous lesions.Nature. 2005; 434: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). More recently, genomic instability in early cancer stages was shown to be caused by stress on the DNA replication, conferred by oncogene expression (Bartkova et al., 2006Bartkova J. Rezaei N. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Kletsas D. Issaeva N. Vassiliou L.V. Kolettas E. Niforou K.

Fumagalli M. Cicalese A. Piccinin S. Gasparini P. Luise C. Schurra C. Garre' M. Nuciforo P.G. Bensimon A. et al.Oncogene-induced senescence is a DNA damage response triggered by DNA hyper-replication.Nature. 2006; 444: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events leading to the formation of replication stress, DSBs, and chromosomal instability shortly after oncogene expression are still unclear. Here, we show that viral (HPV-16 E6/E7) or cellular (cyclin E) oncogenes, leading to abnormal activation of the Rb-E2F pathway, enforce cell proliferation with an insufficient pool of nucleotides to support normal DNA replication. This leads to replication perturbation, DNA damage, and genome instability. Importantly, an exogenous supply of nucleosides rescues the replication stress, decreases the replication-induced DNA damage, and reduces transformation of the cells expressing the oncogenes. We suggest that the low-nucleotide pool is a result of an unbalanced activation of nucleotide biosynthesis genes. We further show that activation of the cellular nucleotide biosynthesis pathways increases the nucleotide pool and rescues the replication-induced DNA damage. Altogether, our study reveals that nucleotide insufficiency plays an important role in the replication stress and genomic instability caused by aberrant activation of the Rb-E2F pathway. As a first step in investigating the early events leading to DNA damage and genomic instability in cancer development, we studied the effect of aberrant activation of the Rb-E2F pathway by HPV-16 E6/E7 oncoproteins. For this, we used primary keratinocytes derived from adult skin biopsies, which have a very poor proliferation capacity ex vivo. The cells were infected with a LXSN-based retroviral vector, which did not affect cell proliferation or DNA replication (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Keratinocytes from the same donor were infected with the LXSN vector containing the HPV-16 E6 and E7 viral genes. We verified the expression of E6/E7 by RT-qPCR using primers for each of these viral genes. Using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), we found that the expression level of E6 and E7 in these keratinocyte cells was ∼2 times lower, compared to the level in a cell line originating from HPV16-induced cervical cancer (CaSki) (Figure S1C), showing that the E6/E7 expression in keratinocytes is at physiological levels. As expected, E6 and E7 transcripts were detected only in keratinocytes infected with the E6/E7 vector and not in the primary keratinocytes of the same donor (data not shown). Importantly, the E6/E7-expressing cells continued to proliferate at least 100 days, indicating their successful immortalization. These results show that E6/E7 genes were expressed and enforced continuous proliferation of the infected keratinocytes. In order to investigate early events induced by E6/E7 expression, the experiments were performed in newly transformed cells 2–6 weeks following E6/E7 infection and before anaphase bridges and micronuclei are visible. In order to investigate the effect of HPV on the cellular DNA replication, we took advantage of the DNA combing approach, which enables replication analysis on single DNA molecules. The newly synthesized DNA labeled with IdU and CldU was detected by fluorescent antibodies (green and red, respectively) (Figure 1A ). The replication dynamics were studied in normal primary keratinocytes obtained from adult skin samples of two individuals and in keratinocytes from the same donors expressing E6/E7 proteins for 2–6 weeks. First, we analyzed the effect of E6/E7 expression on the cellular DNA replication fork rate (Figure 1B). The results show a dramatic decrease in the mean replication rate, from 1.3 ± 0.06 Kb/min (n = 130) in human primary keratinocytes to 0.75 ± 0.05 Kb/min (n = 144) in cells expressing E6/E7 (p < 1.5 × 10−14). Importantly, a dramatic increase in the percentage of very slow forks was observed following E6/E7 expression (Figure 1B). Similar results were obtained in the analysis of keratinocytes from another donor (Figure S2A ). These results indicate that, shortly following expression of the viral E6/E7 proteins, there is a significant decrease in DNA fork progression rate. The two replication forks emerging from the same origin tend to exhibit the same replication rate (Conti et al., 2007Conti C. Saccà B. Herrick J. Lalou C. Pommier Y. Bensimon A. Replication fork velocities at adjacent replication origins are coordinately modified during DNA replication in human cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3059-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, under replication stress conditions, perturbed fork progression might lead to asymmetric progression of the outgoing forks (Di Micco et al., 2006Di Micco R. Fumagalli M. Cicalese A. Piccinin S. Gasparini P. Luise C. Schurra C. Garre' M. Nuciforo P.G. Bensimon A. et al.Oncogene-induced senescence is a DNA damage response triggered by DNA hyper-replication.Nature. 2006; 444: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Hence, we compared the progression of the left and right forks emerging from the same origin in primary and E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes from the same donor. As previously suggested (Conti et al., 2007Conti C. Saccà B. Herrick J. Lalou C. Pommier Y. Bensimon A. Replication fork velocities at adjacent replication origins are coordinately modified during DNA replication in human cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3059-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a symmetric progression of the two forks was considered when the ratio of left and right forks was > 0.75. The analysis revealed a significantly decreased symmetry between the right and left fork progression in the E6/E7-expressing cells compared to the primary cells (p < 3 × 10−6). In the primary replicating cells, the mean ratio was 0.81 ± 0.01 (n = 156), and only 23% of the replication bubbles showed asymmetric dynamics. In contrast, in the E6/E7-expressing cells, a poor symmetry was found with a mean ratio of 0.71 ± 0.01 (n = 194), and 47% of the origins showed asymmetric replication progression (Figure 1C and Figure S2C). This indicates that, a short time following E6/E7 expression, the processivity of the DNA replication machinery is perturbed. Previous studies indicate that slow fork progression correlates with increased number of active origins (Anglana et al., 2003Anglana M. Apiou F. Bensimon A. Debatisse M.

Blow J.J. Dormant origins licensed by excess Mcm2-7 are required for human cells to survive replicative stress.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Hence, we studied the effect of E6/E7 proteins on the origin density by measuring the distance between two adjacent origins. The results showed that the mean origin distance in the primary keratinocytes was 187 ± 26 Kb (n = 67), whereas in the E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes, it was significantly shorter, only 121 ± 24 Kb (n = 93) (p < 5 × 10−5). Furthermore, a dramatic increase in the fraction of molecules with very short origin distance was observed following E6/E7 expression (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained from other donors (Figure S2B and data not shown). These results indicate that E6/E7 expression leads to activation of an increased number of origins. Altogether, the replication dynamic results show that, in newly transformed E6/E7-expressing cells, the host cell DNA replication is dramatically perturbed. Dormant origins activation could occur in S phase to enable completion of DNA synthesis in perturbed replicons (Ge et al., 2007Ge X.Q. Jackson D.A. Blow J.J. Dormant origins licensed by excess Mcm2-7 are required for human cells to survive replicative stress.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3331-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this case, a difference in the firing time of adjacent origins is expected. Alternatively, dormant origins could already be licensed in G1 as a cellular response to chronic replication stress (Courbet et al., 2008Courbet S. Gay S. Arnoult N. Wronka G. Anglana M. Brison O. Debatisse M. Replication fork movement sets chromatin loop size and origin choice in mammalian cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this case, a synchronic replication time between adjacent origins is expected. In order to study the dynamics of origin firing as a result of the viral E6/E7 expression, we estimated the relative firing time of every two adjacent origins in the analyzed fibers (Figure S2D). In primary keratinocytes, the mean difference in firing time between two adjacent origins was 26 ± 3.1 min (n = 50). No significant difference (p > 0.95) in firing time was observed in primary keratinocytes expressing E6/E7 (mean of 26 ± 3.8 min [n = 89]) (Figure 1E). These results support the possibility of programmed activation of dormant origins in G1 prior to the replication initiation in S phase. Chromosomal instability can lead to loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Previous studies have demonstrated that, in early stages of cancer development, the instability occurs preferentially in genomic regions that are sensitive to replication stress, defined as fragile sites (Bartkova et al., 2005Bartkova J.

A genome-wide study.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Later in cancer development, the instability is found along the entire genome (Gorgoulis et al., 2005Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.V. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. et al.Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and genomic instability in human precancerous lesions.Nature. 2005; 434: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). LOH analysis was performed using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. The heterozygosity in primary keratinocytes was compared to that in keratinocytes expressing E6/E7 for 100 or 250 days. The results showed that, 100 days following expression of E6/E7, 1.4% of the informative SNPs in the entire genome revealed LOH, indicating that E6/E7 expression leads to genome instability. The instability is dramatically increased with time, and after 250 days, 17% of the informative SNPs showed LOH. In the fragile sites, the most replication-sensitive sites (FRA3B, FRA16D, and FRA7G) revealed 4.1% LOH after 100 days, which is significantly higher than found in the entire genome (p < 0.0024). After 250 days, even less-sensitive fragile sites showed significantly higher LOH frequency (p < 9 × 10−4) (Table S1), indicating a preferential instability along common fragile sites. In several fragile sites, a dramatic LOH of 31% (FRA11E) and 50% (FRA9G) was found. These results indicate that, in early stages of cancer development, the replication stress caused by E6/E7 expression leads to increased genomic instability at the most sensitive fragile sites, followed by instability at other fragile regions. As previously shown, in later stages of cancer development, a massive genomic instability is found in fragile and nonfragile regions in the genome (Gorgoulis et al., 2005Gorgoulis V.G. Vassiliou L.V. Karakaidos P. Zacharatos P. Kotsinas A. Liloglou T. Venere M. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Kastrinakis N.G. Levy B. et al.Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and genomic instability in human precancerous lesions.Nature. 2005; 434: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Copy number variation (CNV) analysis of the same experiment revealed after 100 days a loss of chromosome 8p and a gain of the entire chromosome 20 in the E6/E7-expressing cells. Interestingly, chromosome 20q amplification is recurrently observed in cervical carcinoma cells (Tsantoulis et al., 2008Tsantoulis P.K. Kotsinas A. Sfikakis P.P. Evangelou K. Sideridou M. Levy B. Mo L. Kittas C. Wu X.R. Papavassiliou A.G. Gorgoulis V.G. Oncogene-induced replication stress preferentially targets common fragile sites in preneoplastic lesions. A genome-wide study.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Analysis of cells expressing E6/E7 for 250 days revealed additional amplifications, which frequently appear in cervical cancer (Table S2), mainly in chromosomes 8q, 7p, and 11q (Harris et al., 2003Harris C.P. Lu X.Y. Narayan G. Singh B. Murty V.V. Rao P.H. Comprehensive molecular cytogenetic characterization of cervical cancer cell lines.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003; 36: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Overall, the LOH and CNV results indicate that similar instability events are found in ex vivo and in vivo cell proliferation and transformation processes. The replication dynamics is largely determined by the size and balance of the nucleotide pool (Anglana et al., 2003Anglana M. Apiou F. Bensimon A. Debatisse M.

Hence, we studied the effect of E6/E7 on the nucleotide pool using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Our results show a 2- to 5-fold decrease in the level of the four dNTPs following E6/E7 expression for 2–4 weeks (Figure 2A and Table S3A). Interestingly, a 2-fold decrease was also found in the level of all ribonucleotides (rNTPs) (Figure S3A and Table S3B), indicating that the nucleotide biosynthesis is disturbed upstream in the pathway. These results suggest that the replication perturbation and genomic instability found in the E6/E7-expressing cells result from an insufficient nucleotide pool required to support extensive proliferation.Figure S3The Effect of Exogenous Supply of Nucleosides on the Replication Dynamics, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) rNTP levels of keratinocyte cells expressing HPV-16 E6/E7, normalized to primary keratinocytes.

In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether exogenous supply of nucleosides can modulate the replication dynamics in E6/E7-expressing cells. For this, primary keratinocytes and keratinocytes expressing E6/E7 for 2–4 weeks were grown for 48 hr in a medium supplemented with the four nucleosides (A, U, C, and G). Evaluating the replication dynamics using DNA combing revealed that exogenous supply of nucleosides to keratinocytes expressing E6/E7 led to a dramatic increase in the replication rate to an average of 1.1 ± 0.06 Kb/min (n = 155), as compared to 0.75 ± 0.05 Kb/min (n = 150) (p = 8 × 10−7) in the same cells grown in a normal medium (Figure 2B). Moreover, the average replication rate after supply of exogenous nucleosides reached 90% of the mean fork rate in primary keratinocytes. Similar results were obtained using cells from another donor (Figure S3B). It is important to note that exogenous supply of nucleosides had no effect on the replication rate and interorigin distances of normal primary keratinocyte cells (1.2 ± 0.04 Kb/min [n = 83]; 129 ± 11 Kb [n = 42]) (Figures S3D and S3E). Subsequently, we studied the effect of exogenous nucleosides supply on the interorigin distances. In accordance with the replication rate, E6/E7-expressing cells supplied with nucleosides showed a dramatic increase in the average interorigin distance compared to that of E6/E7 cells grown in a normal medium, 165 ± 12 Kb (n = 89) and 120 ± 10 Kb (n = 93) (p = 8 × 10−7), respectively. Whereas E6/E7-expressing keratinocytes exhibited in 45% of the cases an origin distance < 80 Kb, after supply of exogenous nucleosides, the fraction of these distances was only 22% (Figure 2C). Similar results were obtained using cells from another donor (Figure S3C). Our LOH results revealed that replication-induced DSBs are generated following E6/E7 expression. Hence, we further investigated whether exogenous supply of nucleosides can decrease these replication-induced DSBs. For this, we analyzed the formation of γH2AX foci, known to localize at DSBs (Rogakou et al., 1998Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against γH2AX was performed in cells expressing E6/E7 for 2–6 weeks, grown in a normal medium and in a medium supplemented with exogenous nucleosides. The analysis showed a significant decrease in the number of γH2AX foci following exogenous nucleoside supply compared to cells grown in a normal growth medium, 4 ± 1 (n = 70) and 9 ± 1.1 (n = 52) foci per nucleus, respectively (Figure 2D) (p < 7 × 10−4). Importantly, a high level of γH2AX foci (>10"

Decades of research has demonstrated numerous layers of regulation, at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, that coordinate this process. Our current understanding of translational regulation has been guided, to a large extent, by studies of early invertebrate development where decisive events occur prior to the initiation of zygotic transcription and are solely directed by translational control of pre-existing maternal mRNAs (Kuersten and Goodwin, 2003Kuersten S.

In contrast, early mammalian development relies on almost immediate zygotic transcription, and hence the requirement for translational control during development and pattern formation has been less certain. The eukaryotic ribosome is a molecular machine composed of 4 RNA molecules and 79 distinct ribosomal proteins (RPs) (Laboratory, 2002Laboratory C.S.H. 1edn. The Ribosome. Volume LXVI. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002Google Scholar). To date, the ribosome—although an immensely complex and amazing machine—has largely been thought to exert a constitutive rather than regulatory function in translating mRNAs. This is, however, surprising given the fact that almost every major molecular machinery involved in gene regulation, including the splicesome (Nilsen and Graveley, 2010Nilsen T.W. Graveley B.R. Expansion of the eukaryotic proteome by alternative splicing.Nature. 2010; 463: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and chromatin-associated histones (Campos and Reinberg, 2009Campos E.I. Reinberg D. Histones: annotating chromatin.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), confer more specialized functions in gene expression. Despite the constitutive nature of the ribosome, several layers of specificity may exist. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the 79 RPs are both extensively modified (Chow et al., 2007Chow C.S. Lamichhane T.N. Mahto S.K. Expanding the nucleotide repertoire of the ribosome with post-transcriptional modifications.ACS Chem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ribosome heterogeneity, including differences in RP composition and/or modifications, has been well documented in Dictyostelium discoideum, in which ribosomes of vegetative amoebae differ from those of spores and cells at different stages of development (Ramagopal, 1992Ramagopal S. The Dictyostelium ribosome: biochemistry, molecular biology, and developmental regulation.Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 738-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, modifications in rRNA confer more specialized functions in internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation control, and defects in this process underlie the human X-linked Dyskeratosis Congenita syndrome (Bellodi et al., 2010aBellodi C.

Impaired control of IRES-mediated translation in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita.Science. 2006; 312: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain many duplicated genes encoding RPs, and these RP paralogs appear to be functionally distinct (Komili et al., 2007Komili S. Farny N.G. Roth F.P. Silver P.A. Functional specificity among ribosomal proteins regulates gene expression.Cell. 2007; 131: 557-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, unexpected tissue-specific phenotypes are associated with RP loss of function in many organisms. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in RPs perturb various developmental processes (Byrne, 2009Byrne M.E. A role for the ribosome in development.Trends Plant Sci. 2009; 14: 512-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, knockdown or mutation of multiple distinct RPs leads to a remarkable range of phenotypes associated with specific defects in brain, body trunk, eye, and ear development and an increase in the incidence of peripheral nervous system tumors (Amsterdam et al., 2004Amsterdam A. Sadler K.C. Lai K. Farrington S. Bronson R.T. Lees J.A. Hopkins N. Many ribosomal protein genes are cancer genes in zebrafish.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E139Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Uechi et al., 2006Uechi T. Nakajima Y. Nakao A. Torihara H. Chakraborty A. Inoue K. Kenmochi N. Ribosomal protein gene knockdown causes developmental defects in zebrafish.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e37Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the mechanism(s) that would account for these specific phenotypes remains poorly understood or has been attributed to extraribosomal protein functions, such as activation of p53 (Warner and McIntosh, 2009Warner J.R. McIntosh K.B. How common are extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins?.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). One important consideration is whether these phenotypes could be attributed to inherent differences in the rate of protein synthesis in one cell type or tissue versus another. For example, highly proliferating tissues may be more sensitive to changes in protein synthesis, and when these thresholds are lowered, indirect effects on cell proliferation or programmed cell death may manifest as tissue-specific morphological abnormalities. It has therefore remained ambiguous whether these morphological abnormalities reflect a direct role for RPs in control of embryonic development. In the present study, we unexpectedly show that a component of the ribosome is required to establish the mammalian body plan. Our data reveal that the phenotypes associated with Rpl38 loss of function, in particular homeotic transformations (i.e., the replacement of one skeletal structure with another), are consistent with a very specific and regulatory role for ribosomes during tissue patterning. Indeed, by optimizing genetic and molecular approaches to study translational regulation within the vertebrate embryo, we uncover an important role for RPL38 in transcript-specific translational control. Moreover, our data reveal surprising heterogeneity in expression profiles between individual RPs in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner. These findings highlight an unexpected role for RPs as regulators of key patterning events during embryonic development and strongly suggest that RPs may be highly regulated to impart a new level of specificity in control of gene expression. Tail short (Ts) is a spontaneous, dominant mouse mutation discovered 60 years ago that exhibits pronounced skeletal patterning defects, including homeotic transformations, for which the causative mutation is unknown (Deol, 1961Deol M.S. Genetical studies on the skeleton of the mouse XXVIII. Tail-short.Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B. 1961; 155: 78-95Crossref Google Scholar, Morgan, 1950Morgan W.C. A new tail-short mutation in the mouse whose lethal effects are conditioned by the residual genotypes.J. Hered. 1950; 41: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The name reflects the most obvious phenotype present in Ts/+ mice, a shorter and kinky tail that is associated with more pronounced skeletal patterning defects (Deol, 1961Deol M.S. Genetical studies on the skeleton of the mouse XXVIII. Tail-short.Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B. 1961; 155: 78-95Crossref Google Scholar, Morgan, 1950Morgan W.C. A new tail-short mutation in the mouse whose lethal effects are conditioned by the residual genotypes.J. Hered. 1950; 41: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two additional mouse mutants, Tail-short Shionogi (Tss) (Tsukahara et al., 2000Tsukahara K. Hirasawa T. Makino S. Tss (Tail-short Shionogi), a new short tail mutation found in the BALB/cMs strain, maps quite closely to the Tail-short (Ts) locus on mouse chromosome 11.Exp. Anim. 2000; 49: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and Rabo torcido (Rbt) (Hustert et al., 1996Hustert E. Scherer G. Olowson M. Guenet J.L. Balling R. Rbt (Rabo torcido), a new mouse skeletal mutation involved in anteroposterior patterning of the axial skeleton, maps close to the Ts (tail-short) locus and distal to the Sox9 locus on chromosome 11.Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), display virtually identical phenotypes to Ts and map to the distal part of chromosome 11 where the Ts locus is found. Homozygote Ts mutants are morphologically abnormal at the morula stage and die around the time of implantation (our unpublished observations). In the present study we backcrossed the Ts allele onto a C57BL/6J background. Ts/+ embryos display an abnormally short and kinky tail by embryonic day (E) 12.5 (Figure 1A ), a midline facial cleft (Figure 1A) and/or cleft palate (22%) (data not shown), as well as exencephaly that can be accompanied by a wavy neural tube (30%) (Figure 4B, and Figure S3 available online, and data not shown). Ts/+ embryos also have various eye abnormalities, including failure in optic fissure closure as well as microphthalmy (small eye size) (Figure 1A and data not shown). The most pronounced phenotypes observed in Ts/+ embryos are axial skeletal patterning defects (Figure 1B and Figure 2). For example, Ts/+ mice show the presence of 14 instead of 13 ribs (Figure 1B), strongly suggesting that the first lumbar vertebra that normally does not possess a rib anlage is now transformed anteriorly into a thoracic vertebra. Although this phenotype was noted in the original description of Ts/+ mutant mice in 1950, it was not interpreted as a homeotic transformation at that time (Deol, 1961Deol M.S. Genetical studies on the skeleton of the mouse XXVIII. Tail-short.Proc. R. Soc. Lond., B. 1961; 155: 78-95Crossref Google Scholar, Morgan, 1950Morgan W.C. A new tail-short mutation in the mouse whose lethal effects are conditioned by the residual genotypes.J. Hered. 1950; 41: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our complete analysis of skeletal patterning in Ts/+ mice reveals pronounced patterning defects as well as anterior-posterior (A-P) directed homeotic transformations along the entire axial skeleton (Figure 2). Therefore, the gene mutated in Ts is an important regulator of A-P skeletal patterning.Figure 2Homeotic Transformations and Skeletal Patterning Defects in Ts/+ EmbryosShow full caption(A and B) Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining of WT and Ts/+ skeletons at E18.5.

See also Figure S2. To characterize the genetic defect responsible for the Ts phenotype, we positionally cloned the responsible gene (Figure S1A ) and disclosed an 18 kb deletion in Rpl38 encompassing all exons of the gene in Ts/+ mice (Figure 1C, Figures S1B and S1C). Direct sequencing of Rpl38 in Tss/+ and Rbt/+ mice also identified mutations. In Tss/+ mice, a deletion of a single base is present within exon 3. This results in a frameshift after codon four that is followed by a stop codon, which disrupts the production of RPL38 protein (Figure 1E and Figure S1D). In Rbt/+ mice, an insertion of the dinucleotide AG precedes the first codon in exon 3. This insertion results in a change of the acceptor splice site, leading to a frameshift mutation with a very short theoretical translation product (12 amino acids) and a stop codon (Figure 1E). To further ensure that deletion of the Rpl38 gene indeed causes the Ts phenotype, we generated pCAGGS-Rpl38 transgenic mice and found that the majority of Ts phenotypes, including homeotic transformations, were no longer manifest in Ts/+; pCAGGS-Rpl38 mice (Figure 1D, Figure S1E). Importantly, Rpl38 expression is reduced by approximately 50% in Rbt/+, Tss/+, and Ts/+ mice (Figure 1F and Figure S1F) and is rescued to normal levels in Ts/+; pCAGGS-Rpl38 mice (Figure S1F). All of these results confirm that the phenotypes observed in Ts/+ mice are a direct consequence of the deletion in the Rpl38 gene. The vertebrate skeleton is built on an intricate pattern of stereotyped anatomical elements, the vertebrae, which on the basis of their relative position along the A-P axis in the developing embryo have distinct anatomical features (Iimura et al., 2009Iimura T. Denans N. Pourquie O. Establishment of Hox vertebral identities in the embryonic spine precursors.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 88: 201-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The relative number and arrangement of these vertebrae types collectively give rise to the mammalian body plan (Burke et al., 1995Burke A.C. Nelson C.E. Morgan B.A. Tabin C. Hox genes and the evolution of vertebrate axial morphology.Development. 1995; 121: 333-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vertebrae are grouped into five distinct types: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal that extend from A-P along the body axis. Skeletal patterning defects, including homeotic transformations, are present along the entire A-P axis of Ts/+ mice (Figure 2). Notable examples include transformations in the cervical region. In wild-type (WT) mice, the 6th cervical vertebra (C6) is readily distinguishable by the presence of a ventral process known as the anterior tuberculum, but in Ts/+ embryos it can be found on the 5th cervical vertebra (C5) (Figures 2A and 2B), illustrating a posterior transformation of the C5 vertebra toward the identity of C6. Furthermore, a rib anlage is not normally present on cervical vertebrae. However, in Ts/+ embryos, a minute or extensive rib anlage can develop on one or both processus transversus of C6 or C7, indicating a partial posterior transformation (Figures 2C and 2D). In the thoracic region, Ts/+ embryos display eight instead of seven vertebrosternal ribs (ribs attached to the sternum), and frequently their attachment is asymmetric resulting in a crankshaft sternum (Figures 2C and 2D). The fact that 14 instead of 13 ribs are associated with vertebrae in Ts/+ mice (Figure 1B) indicates that the first lumbar vertebra (L1) is transformed anteriorily and acquires a thoracic identity (Figures 2E and 2F). In the sacral region, normally three or four sacral vertebrae contribute to form the sacral bone, whereas in Ts/+ embryos at least four or even five transverse processes fuse, and these alterations illustrate additional anterior transformations (Figures 2G and 2H). Additional abnormalities in the axial skeleton are observed to a variable extent and include fusions of vertebrae and/or laminae, splitting along neural arches (most predominately in the cervical region) as well as ectopic points of ossification between cervical vertebrae (Figure 2 and data not shown). Therefore, the analysis of Ts/+ mice identifies RPL38 as an important regulator of axial skeletal patterning. Mammals have 39 Hox genes that are clustered on four chromosomes (Kmita and Duboule, 2003Kmita M. Duboule D. Organizing axes in time and space; 25 years of colinear tinkering.Science. 2003; 301: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Targeted loss- and gain-of-function analyses in the mouse have clearly demonstrated that Hox genes are the key regulators of morphology along the axial skeleton (Pourquié, 2009Pourquié O. Hox Genes. Academic Press, San Diego2009Google Scholar, Deschamps and van Nes, 2005Deschamps J. van Nes J. Developmental regulation of the Hox genes during axial morphogenesis in the mouse.Development. 2005; 132: 2931-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Wellik, 2009Wellik D.M. Hox genes and vertebrate axial pattern.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 88: 257-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a careful analysis of Hox gene expression boundaries and transcript levels (Figures S2A and S2B and data not shown) revealed that they remain unchanged in Ts/+ embryos. A notable exception is the increase in Hoxb4 and Hoxd4 transcript levels in Ts/+ embryos (Figure S2B), and these results will be discussed in the context of posttranscriptional analysis of Hox gene expression (see below and Figure 3). Together, these findings show that Rpl38 is a critical regulator of skeletal patterning, and the phenotypes observed in Ts/+ mice are unlikely to be the result of shifts in Hox gene expression boundaries and/or transcript levels.Figure 3Analysis of Global Protein Synthesis Rates and Polysome Profiling within the Neural Tube and Somites of WT and Ts/+ EmbryosShow full caption(A) Transgenic mice expressing a stable, genetically encoded translational reporter for cap- and IRES-dependent translation (CMV-HCV-IREST) were intercrossed with Ts/+ mice.

Data are presented as the average ± standard error of the mean (SEM). See also Figure S3. We next asked whether changes in translational control underlie the skeletal patterning defects observed in Ts/+ mice. Historically, it has been difficult to systematically assess translational control of gene expression directly within a developing vertebrate embryo. To overcome these limitations, we optimized unique approaches. To directly monitor global protein synthesis in vivo, we employed a bioluminescent “translation reporter mouse (CMV-HCV-IREST)” that expresses a stable, genetically encoded translational reporter for cap (Rluc) and IRES-dependent translation (Fluc) (Figure 3A). We simultaneously microdissected the neural tube and somites (the precursors of vertebrae) from somite stage 40 CMV-HCV-IREST and Ts/+; CMV-HCV-IREST embryos and measured Rluc and Fluc activity. This analysis revealed no major differences in general cap-dependent or IRES-dependent translational control in Ts/+ embryonic tissues (Figure 3A). We also confirmed that there is no change in global protein synthesis in Ts/+ embryos by [S35] methionine incorporation (Figures S3G and S3H ) and direct immunostaining with the Y10b antibody, which labels rRNA (Figures S3A–S3F). Together, these findings demonstrate that changes in global protein synthesis are not observed in somites and neural tube of Ts/+ embryos, where patterning defects are manifest (Figure 2 and Figure 5). The relative translation rate of an mRNA can be inferred from the number of ribosomes (polysomes) it recruits and can be quantitatively analyzed by employing sucrose gradients to purify mRNAs associated with translationally active ribosomes (Rousseau et al., 1996Rousseau D. Kaspar R. Rosenwald I. Gehrke L. Sonenberg N. Translation initiation of ornithine decarboxylase and nucleocytoplasmic transport of cyclin D1 mRNA are increased in cells overexpressing eukaryotic initiation factor 4E.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Sagliocco et al., 1996Sagliocco F.A. Moore P.A. Brown A.J. Polysome analysis.Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 297-311PubMed Google Scholar). Several limitations exist to performing polysome analysis from vertebrate embryonic tissues, including the small size of midgestation embryos and the limiting number of cells that can be obtained from microdissected tissue fragments. To investigate whether qualitative changes in mRNA translation may underlie the skeletal patterning defects observed in Ts/+ embryos, we optimized microscale polysome analysis (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S3I–S3K). This approach enabled us to detect and collect polysome fractions employing small tissue fragments. We simultaneously microdissected the neural tube and somites from somite stage 40 (∼E11.0) WT and Ts/+ embryos for this analysis (Figure 3B). This microdissection strategy ensured that all A-P somites and the entire rostral-caudal extent of the neural tube were collected from each embryo in an identical and precise manner. We did not detect noticeable differences in the ratio of small to large ribosome subunits or polysome distribution comparing WT and Ts/+ ribosome profiles, in agreement with the fact that general protein synthesis is not impaired in Ts/+ samples (Figure 3B). We next optimized qPCR primers (Table S1) for all genes that belong to the HoxA, B, C, and D clusters and assayed their translational states in WT and Ts/+ embryos by detecting their mRNA distribution in polysome fractions (Figure 3C and data not shown). Consistent with the fact that general protein synthesis is not perturbed in Ts/+ tissue samples, the majority of Hox genes (a total of 31) did not show any difference in polysome association (Figure 3C and data not shown). Strikingly, however, we identified a specific subset of Hox genes (Hoxa4; a5; a9; a11; b3; b13; c8; d10) that are markedly decreased in polysome association in Ts/+ embryos compared to WT (Figure 3C), and this defect is evident in both he"

https://openalex.org/W2037343688,"Grid cells recorded in the medial entorhinal cortex of freely moving rats exhibit firing at regular spatial locations and temporal modulation with theta rhythm oscillations (4 to 11 hertz). We analyzed grid cell spatial coding during reduction of network theta rhythm oscillations caused by medial septum (MS) inactivation with muscimol. During MS inactivation, grid cells lost their spatial periodicity, whereas head-direction cells maintained their selectivity. Conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells lost grid cell spatial periodicity but retained head-direction specificity. All cells showed reduced rhythmicity in autocorrelations and cross-correlations. This supports the hypothesis that spatial coding by grid cells requires theta oscillations, and dissociates the mechanisms underlying the generation of entorhinal grid cell periodicity and head-direction selectivity."

We used data from Global Positioning System (GPS) networks in Central Chile to infer the static deformation and the kinematics of the 2010 moment magnitude (M(w)) 8.8 Maule megathrust earthquake. From elastic modeling, we found a total rupture length of ~500 kilometers where slip (up to 15 meters) concentrated on two main asperities situated on both sides of the epicenter. We found that rupture reached shallow depths, probably extending up to the trench. Resolvable afterslip occurred in regions of low coseismic slip. The low-frequency hypocenter is relocated 40 kilometers southwest of initial estimates. Rupture propagated bilaterally at about 3.1 kilometers per second, with possible but not fully resolved velocity variations."
https://openalex.org/W2076095878,"Accurate chromosome segregation requires assembly of the multiprotein kinetochore complex at centromeres. Although prior work identified the centromeric histone H3-variant CENP-A as the important upstream factor necessary for centromere specification, in human cells CENP-A is not sufficient for kinetochore assembly. Here, we demonstrate that two constitutive DNA-binding kinetochore components, CENP-C and CENP-T, function to direct kinetochore formation. Replacing the DNA-binding regions of CENP-C and CENP-T with alternate chromosome-targeting domains recruits these proteins to ectopic loci, resulting in CENP-A-independent kinetochore assembly. These ectopic kinetochore-like foci are functional based on the stoichiometric assembly of multiple kinetochore components, including the microtubule-binding KMN network, the presence of microtubule attachments, the microtubule-sensitive recruitment of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, and the segregation behavior of foci-containing chromosomes. We additionally find that CENP-T phosphorylation regulates the mitotic assembly of both endogenous and ectopic kinetochores. Thus, CENP-C and CENP-T form a critical regulated platform for vertebrate kinetochore assembly."

This protective effect is mediated by CO, which binds cell-free Hb and inhibits its oxidation, thus preventing heme release from oxidized Hb (Hebbel et al., 1988Hebbel R.P. Morgan W.T. Eaton J.W.

Inoculation of C57BL/6 mice (Hbwt) with P. berghei ANKA infected red blood cells (RBC) led within 6 to 12 days to the development of clinical signs of ECM (Figure 1A ). Incidence of ECM was significantly reduced in hemizygous C57BL/6 HbSAD mice (Figure 1A) expressing a β-chain of human Hb carrying the β6Glu->Val (HbS) mutation as well as two additional mutations, β23Ala->Ile (Antilles23I) and β121Asp->Gln (D-Punjab121Q), known to enhance HbS polymerization in humans and mice (Trudel et al., 1991Trudel M.

Naïve HbSAD mice present a very mild sickle cell syndrome, which does not lead to anemia (Table S1A available online; Trudel et al., 1994Trudel M. De Paepe M.E. Chretien N. Saadane N. Jacmain J.

Bojang K.A. Conway D.J. Pinder M. et al.Genome-wide and fine-resolution association analysis of malaria in West Africa. Nat Genet, 2009Google Scholar). HbSAD mice that did not develop ECM, succumbed 20-25 days postinfection from hyperparasitemia-induced anemia (data not shown), a condition unrelated to ECM (Schofield and Grau, 2005Schofield L. Grau G.E. Immunological processes in malaria pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 722-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). When infected with P. berghei ANKA, C57BL/6.Sv/129 HbA/a mice expressing normal human Hb as well as endogenous mouse Hb (Wu et al., 2006Wu L.C. Sun C.W. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Ren J. Townes T.M. Correction of sickle cell disease by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells.Blood. 2006; 108: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) developed clinical signs of ECM and succumbed 6 to 12 days after infection (Figure S1A ). Littermate control C57BL/6.Sv/129 Hba/a mice, expressing only the endogenous mouse Hb developed ECM but with lower incidence, as compared to HbA/a mice (Figure S1A). This suggests that normal human Hb might promote, rather than prevent, the pathogenesis of ECM in C57BL/6.Sv/129 mice. While the reason for this is not clear, it is possible that human Hb alters mouse RBC physiology in a manner that would promote the development of ECM. However, this effect becomes negligible as C57BL/6.Sv/129 mice are backcrossed into the C57BL/6 genetic background (Figure S1D), in which ECM incidence is higher than 95% (Figure 1A). Given that HbSAD suppresses the pathogenesis of ECM in C57BL/6 mice and that the deleterious effect of normal human Hb becomes negligible under this genetic background, it is reasonable to infer that the protective effect of HbSAD is attributable to the mutations in the human β-globin chain rather than to human Hb per se. HbSAD mice that did not succumb within 6–12 days postinfection also did not develop the pathologic hallmarks of ECM, including blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Figures 1B), perivascular RBC accumulation in brain (Figure 1B) and brain edema (Figure 1C). These pathologic features were present in Hbwt (Figures 1B and 1C) and HbA/a mice, i.e. brain edema (Figure S1B). Given that BBB disruption and brain edema occur in P. berghei ANKA infected C57BL/6 mice via a CD8+ T cell-dependent mechanism (Belnoue et al., 2002Belnoue E. Kayibanda M. Vigario A.M. Deschemin J.C. van Rooijen N. Viguier M. Snounou G. Renia L. On the pathogenic role of brain-sequestered alphabeta CD8+ T cells in experimental cerebral malaria.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6369-6375PubMed Google Scholar, Schofield and Grau, 2005Schofield L. Grau G.E. Immunological processes in malaria pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 722-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), we asked whether the protective effect of HbSAD against ECM was associated with inhibition of CD8+ T cell sequestration in the brain. The number of CD45high leukocytes and CD8+ T cells, including granzyme B-positive (GrB+) CD8+ T cells, was reduced in P. berghei ANKA infected HbSAD, as compared to Hbwt mice at ECM onset (Figure 1D). When infected with P. berghei ANKA, Hbwt mice also developed severe lung injury and a mild form of liver injury (Figure S2) with no apparent injury to the kidneys or to the heart (data not shown). The extent of lung and liver injury was reduced in P. berghei ANKA infected HbSAD versus Hbwt mice (Figure S2). Protection of HbSAD mice against ECM was not associated with reduction of pathogen load, as assessed by the percentage of infected RBC, i.e., parasitemia (Figure 1E) as well as by the number of circulating infected RBC (Figure 1F) versus control Hbwt (Figures 1E and 1F) or HbA/a mice (Figures S1C and S1E). While the protective effect of the human sickle cell trait against malaria has been associated with decreased pathogen load (Allison, 1954Allison A.C. Protection afforded by sickle-cell trait against subtertian malareal infection.BMJ. 1954; 1: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, May et al., 2007May J. Evans J.A. Timmann C. Ehmen C.

Dis. 2005; 192: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), there are several instances where this does not appear to be the case (Crompton et al., 2008Crompton P.D. Traore B. Kayentao K. Doumbo S. Ongoiba A. Diakite S.A. Krause M.A. Doumtabe D. Kone Y. Weiss G. et al.Sickle cell trait is associated with a delayed onset of malaria: implications for time-to-event analysis in clinical studies of malaria.J. Infect.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemoglobin S, and malaria.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1966; 18: 514-537PubMed Google Scholar), which is in keeping with the observation that HbSAD confers protection against ECM without interfering with pathogen load. These observations suggest that mutations in the β-chain of human Hb, such as those in HbSAD can afford tolerance to Plasmodium infection, a host defense strategy that limits disease severity by preventing tissue damage, without targeting the pathogen. This contrasts to resistance to infection, the well-recognized host defense strategy that limits disease severity by decreasing pathogen load (Raberg et al., 2007Raberg L. Sim D. Read A.F. Disentangling genetic variation for resistance and tolerance to infectious diseases in animals.Science. 2007; 318: 812-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Schneider and Ayres, 2008Schneider D.S.

Parasite sequestration was similar in Hbwt, HbSADHmox1+/+, and HbSADHmox1+/- mice, as assessed using a transgenic luciferase-P. berghei ANKA strain (Figure 4S). This supports further the notion that induction of HO-1 by sickle Hb confers host tolerance to Plasmodium infection. Humans and rodents carrying the HbS mutation express high levels of HO-1 in the hematopoietic compartment (Belcher et al., 2006Belcher J.D. Mahaseth H. Welch T.E. Otterbein L.E. Hebbel R.P.

Consistent with this, naïve HbSAD mice express high levels of Hmox1 mRNA in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, as compared to naïve Hbwt mice (Figure 2A ).

Deletion of one Hmox1 allele (Hmox1+/-) reduced Hmox1 mRNA expression in bone marrow and whole blood leukocytes of HbSAD mice (Figure S3C), without causing overt postnatal lethality (Table S2A). When challenged by P. berghei ANKA infection, HbSADHmox1+/- mice succumbed to ECM (Figure 2B), with concomitant development of BBB disruption (Figure 2C), brain edema (Figure 2D) and sequestration of CD45high leukocytes (data not shown), CD8+ T cells and activated GrB+CD8+ T cells in the brain (Figure 2E) but without noticeable hematological changes (Table S1B). The protective effect of HbSAD against lung and liver injury, associated with P. berghei ANKA infection, was lost in HbSADHmox1+/− mice (Figure S2). This was not associated with increased parasite load (Figure 2F). Pharmacologic inhibition of HO activity by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) (Figures S5A and S5B ), increased ECM incidence in HbSAD mice versus vehicle-treated controls (Figure S5C). This effect was not associated with modulation of parasitemia (Figure S5D), suggesting that heme catabolism by HO-1 confers tolerance to Plasmodium infection in HbSAD mice.Figure S5Pharmacologic inhibition of HO Activity Negates the Protective Effect of Sickle Hb against ECM, Related to Figure 2Show full captionHO activity was measured in a) liver and b) spleen of naïve or P. berghei ANKA infected Hbwt mice receiving the HO enzymatic inhibitor ZnPPIX (mg/kg bw, every 12 hours from day 2 pre-infection to day 7 postinfection) or vehicle (-).

We report direct observations of mechanical, force-induced protein unfolding by the ClpX unfoldase from E. coli, alone, and in complex with the ClpP peptidase.

ClpX generates force, most likely unfolding substrates as a power-stroke motor ClpX subunits take 1 nm steps and display a limited degree of coordination ClpX stochastically slips, briefly disengaging from its substrates ClpXP exhibits reduced substrate slippage and more robust protein unfolding than ClpX ATP-dependent proteases of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) superfamily power the degradation of abnormal, denatured, or otherwise damaged polypeptides, as well as the removal of short-lived regulatory proteins (King et al., 1996King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. How proteolysis drives the cell cycle.Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic active sites of these proteases are sequestered in the internal chamber of a barrel-shaped peptidase complex, preventing the diffusion and nonspecific degradation of folded or even large unfolded polypeptides (Wang et al., 1997Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M.

To facilitate specific protein degradation, the peptidases pair with energy-dependent hexameric AAA+ unfoldases that recognize appropriately tagged protein substrates and utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unfold and translocate the polypeptide into the associated peptidase chamber for degradation (Baker and Sauer, 2006Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. ATP-dependent proteases of bacteria: recognition logic and operating principles.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 647-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has been suggested previously that AAA+ unfoldases may exert mechanical force to unravel the tertiary and secondary structures of protein substrates. Even though there have been initial single-molecule fluorescence studies of ClpX (Shin et al., 2009Shin Y. Davis J.H. Brau R.R. Martin A. Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Lang M.J. Single-molecule denaturation and degradation of proteins by the AAA+ ClpXP protease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19340-19345Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), direct evidence for the generation of force and a detailed characterization of the mechanochemistry of these molecular machines are still lacking. Here we investigate the motor properties of ClpX, a homohexameric AAA+ ATPase from Escherichia coli that recognizes proteins with a C-terminal ssrA tag and uses cycles of ATP hydrolysis to unfold and translocate the substrates into its associated peptidase, ClpP (Gottesman et al., 1998Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. The ClpXP and ClpAP proteases degrade proteins with carboxy-terminal peptide tails added by the SsrA-tagging system.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We use a single-molecule optical tweezers-based assay to demonstrate that ClpX generates mechanical force to unfold its substrates. We characterize the dynamics of ClpX as it encounters a folded substrate such as GFP and translocates unfolded polypeptides through its central processing pore. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of ClpP on the translocation activity and unfolding efficiency of ClpX. These studies thus provide important new insight into the general operating principles used by energy-dependent proteases to unfold and degrade protein substrates inside the cell. A dual-trap optical tweezers geometry was used to monitor real-time trajectories of individual ClpX hexamers or ClpXP complexes as they unfold and translocate GFP-titin fusion substrates. In these substrates, either one GFP molecule or two GFP moieties in tandem separated by either a short or a long unstructured linker were C-terminally fused to a permanently unfolded ssrA-tagged titin I27 module (Ticm) and attached by their N termini to a dsDNA handle (Figure 1, see Experimental Procedures). The DNA-tethered substrates and a single-chain variant of ClpX were immobilized on different polystyrene beads coated with anti-digoxigenin antibody and streptavidin, respectively. ClpX was allowed to bind and engage the ssrA-tagged substrate by bringing the two beads into close proximity in the presence of saturating ATP and an ATP regeneration system (Figure 1A). After successful substrate engagement, we monitored ClpX unfolding and translocation activities by measuring the changes in extension between the two beads in passive mode (i.e., the trap positions are fixed and the force load on the motor is allowed to vary with motor activity). Traces for the three different substrates displayed sudden extension gains (rips) followed by a slower decrease in extension, together resembling a saw-tooth-like pattern (Figures 1B–1D). We assigned rips either to ClpX-induced unfolding events of GFP or to temporary disengagement of the motor along the polypeptide backbone track (Figure 1, red and black arrowheads, respectively). The continuous decrease in extension after a rip was identified as the translocation of the unfolded polypeptide chain through the ClpX pore. As seen in Figures 1B–1E, translocation is interspersed by pauses of various lengths. In >95% of all trajectories, translocation events were not observed before the first rip. We therefore conclude that the motor had already translocated the unfolded Ticm-ssrA segment by the time we started recording ClpX unfolding activity. The changes in extension (in nm) associated with rips and translocation can be expressed in terms of numbers of amino acids (aa) using the worm-like chain (WLC) force-extension formula (Bustamante et al., 1994Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S. Entropic elasticity of lambda-phage DNA.Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). The characteristics of the translocation process of ClpX are fundamentally distinct from those of other molecular motors that have been studied under external force (Bustamante et al., 2011Bustamante C. Cheng W. Meija Y.X. Revisiting the central dogma one molecule at a time.Cell. 2011; 144: 480-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Yildiz and Selvin, 2005Yildiz A. Selvin P.R. Kinesin: walking, crawling or sliding along?.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For molecular motors moving along stiff tracks such as dsDNA or microtubules, the track persistence length (P) is orders of magnitude larger than the step-size of the motor (for example, PdsDNA = ∼50 nm compared to motor step-sizes of just 0.34 and 0.85 nm for RNA polymerase and ϕ29 packaging motor, respectively [Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A.

Schmidt C.F. Schnapp B.J. Block S.M. Direct observation of kinesin stepping by optical trapping interferometry.Nature. 1993; 365: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar]). We observe ClpX(P) taking 1 nm steps (see below), which are larger than the persistence length of the polypeptide track (Ppeptide = 0.65 nm). As a result, on a lengthscale comparable to the step-size, ClpX(P) translocates a flexible, irregular polymer, whereas motors such as kinesin or dsDNA translocases move along much more rigid, periodic tracks. The highly elastic nature of unfolded polypeptides and the unique characteristics of this AAA+ unfoldase compelled us to define two distinct quantities: contour velocity (in aa/s) and extension velocity (in nm/s). Extension velocity refers to the geometric length (in nm) of the translocated polypeptide chain, reflecting the size of the motor step, whereas contour velocity measures how many amino acids pass through the ClpX pore per unit time. For example, 1 nm/s of extension velocity corresponds to ∼8 aa/s of contour velocity at 4 pN external force and only ∼4 aa/s at 13 pN. To illustrate this point, imagine ClpX as an ant walking on a rubber band stretched under force. At a low force the ant will traverse the entire length of the rubber band faster than at a high force, even though the ant maintains a constant step-size and stepping rate in both cases. The product of the step-size and the stepping rate in the ant analogy corresponds to the extension velocity (nm/s) of ClpX, whereas the amount of rubber traveled by the ant corresponds to the contour velocity. Although contour velocity (aa/s) has been widely used in bulk studies (zero-external force), the extension velocity (nm/s) is necessary to properly characterize polypeptide translocation under external forces. Because all of our single-molecule experiments were performed under external force, most of our discussions refer to the extension velocity (nm/s). Our analysis yielded a pause-free extension velocity of 8.2 ± 0.3 nm/s (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) for ClpX at opposing forces between 5–13 pN (Figure 2A , red symbols), whereas the extension velocity for the ClpXP complex in the same force range was 6.0 ± 0.3 nm/s (mean ± SEM, Figure 2A, blue symbols). This 27% decrease in velocity can be explained by the repression in ATP hydrolysis activity of ClpX when bound to ClpP (Table S1 available online). We used the contour velocity (aa/s) to estimate near-zero force velocities of ∼80 aa/s and ∼60 aa/s for ClpX and ClpXP, respectively (Figure 2B). The latter value is in excellent agreement with bulk estimates for ClpXP translocation (Martin et al., 2008bMartin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein unfolding by a AAA+ protease is dependent on ATP-hydrolysis rates and substrate energy landscapes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a rather broad distribution of the mean pause-free translocation velocities for ClpX and ClpXP was seen regardless of the force range (Figure 2C), revealing an intrinsic heterogeneity in the activity of individual ClpX hexamers. Although similar heterogeneity has been described previously for other molecular motor enzymes (Neuman et al., 2003Neuman K.C. Abbondanzieri E.A. Landick R. Gelles J. Block S.M. Ubiquitous transcriptional pausing is independent of RNA polymerase backtracking.Cell. 2003; 115: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), it is possible that this dispersion in part reflects the chemical and physical heterogeneity of the unfolded polypeptide track. A long-standing question about AAA+ unfoldases is whether these enzymes in fact exert mechanical force or just use an allosteric binding mechanism to unfold their substrates. To investigate the unfolding mechanism used by ClpX, we monitored the response of the motor to an opposing force while translocating a substrate. The force versus velocity plot shows that ClpX is capable of working against and therefore generating mechanical force (Figure 2A, red symbols). This plot also reveals that the ClpX translocation velocity is nearly constant up to ∼13 pN, implying that within this force range and at saturating ATP concentrations, chemical steps (hydrolysis or product release) are rate limiting. At opposing external forces exceeding 13 pN, the pause-free velocity decreases monotonically, indicating that conformational changes driving translocation become rate limiting. We were able to place a lower bound of ∼20 pN for the stall force of ClpX (Figure 2A). ClpXP's stall force and force-velocity dependence is very similar to that of ClpX (Figure 2A, blue symbols). It has been proposed that protein unraveling by a AAA+ unfoldase results from the enzyme's attempts to translocate the folded structure through its narrow central pore. Thus, the stall force for translocating a resisting polypeptide gives a measure of the maximum mechanical force that ClpX can apply to unfold a substrate. At high opposing loads, it was possible to observe well-defined translocation steps for ClpXP (Figure 3). The pairwise distribution analysis of these traces revealed a remarkable stepping periodicity of 1, 2, and 3 nm (Figures 3B and 3F). The observed 1 nm step is in good agreement with high-resolution structural data of ClpX (Figure 3C), which show distinct conformations of subunits in different nucleotide states and indicating potential transitions and loop movements of ∼1 nm per ClpX subunit that might lead to substrate translocation (Glynn et al., 2009Glynn S.E. Martin A. Nager A.R. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Structures of asymmetric ClpX hexamers reveal nucleotide-dependent motions in a AAA+ protein-unfolding machine.Cell. 2009; 139: 744-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is assumed that conformational changes of the pore 1 loops with their highly conserved Tyr residues (Figure 3C, red loops) together with rigid-body movements of subunits in the ClpX hexamer propel the substrate through the central pore (Martin et al., 2008aMartin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Pore loops of the AAA+ ClpX machine grip substrates to drive translocation and unfolding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Based on mutational studies, it was suggested that subunits contribute additively to ClpX activity and that ATP hydrolysis in one subunit at a time drives the conformational changes for substrate translocation (Martin et al., 2005Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Rebuilt AAA + motors reveal operating principles for ATP-fuelled machines.Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Our measured extension velocities of 6 and 8 nm/s, along with the smallest observed step-size of 1 nm, predict hydrolysis rates of 360 and 480 ATP⋅min−1 for ClpXP and ClpX, respectively (assuming 1 ATP consumed per step). These values are in good agreement with our bulk measurements of the ATPase activities during translocation of permanently unstructured substrates (Table S1 and Figure S4). Our observation of distinct 2 and 3 nm steps (Figures 3D–3F) suggests a coordinated, near-simultaneous stepping of two or three motor subunits that cannot be resolved in our measurements.Figure S1GFP Unfolding by ClpX(P) Results in a Well-Defined Contour Length Change, Related to Figure 4Show full captionThe total rip size distribution peaked at ∼210 aa in agreement with the expected contour length change upon GFP unfolding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2Side-by-Side Comparison of ClpX (Red Bars) and ClpXP (Orange Bars) Unfolding of GFP, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Histogram of contour length changes corresponding to the full GFP unfolding by ClpX.(B) Histogram of the first rip size in GFP unfolding by ClpX.(C) Histogram of the second rip size in GFP unfolding by ClpX.(D) Histogram of contour length changes corresponding to the full GFP unfolding by ClpXP.(E) Histogram of the first rip size in GFP unfolding by ClpXP.(F) Histogram of the second rip size in GFP unfolding by ClpXP.(G) The distribution of the GFP unfolding intermediate lifetime in ClpXP traces is well described by a single exponential.

Two general models of motor operation have been proposed for AAA+ molecular machines. In the Brownian ratchet model, the motor uses ATP binding/hydrolysis or product release to rectify its Brownian motion, cross the energy barrier, and move in one direction (Astumian, 1997Astumian R.D. Thermodynamics and kinetics of a Brownian motor.Science. 1997; 276: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). In the power-stroke model, the motor uses the energy of ATP binding/hydrolysis or product release to directly drive the motion. Given a lower bound of ∼20 pN for the stall force and a step-size of 1 nm, the work performed by a single ClpX subunit near stall is ΔWsubunit = 20 pN⋅nm = 5 kBT per hydrolyzed ATP. Similar calculations for E. coli RNA polymerase (Brownian ratchet) and ϕ29 ATPase (power-stroke motor) yield near-stall work values of ∼2 kBT and ∼10 kBT, respectively (Moffitt et al., 2009Moffitt J.R. Chemla Y.R. Aathavan K. Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C.

The bacteriophage straight phi29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Because the maximum work done by a ClpX subunit is >5 kBT, we favor the power-stroke model over the Brownian ratchet for ClpX. Moreover, we estimated that the free energy of hydrolyzing one ATP molecule in our buffer is ∼55 pN⋅nm. Therefore, the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of ClpX per step is 20 pN⋅1 nm/55 pN⋅nm = ∼35%, within the efficiency range of other power-stroke motors (Smith et al., 2001Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. The bacteriophage straight phi29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force.Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Future experiments, in which the concentration of ATP and hydrolysis products are changed systematically under varying external force, will be required to identify the force-generating step of the mechanochemical cycle and will help confirm a power-stroke mechanism for ClpX. To better understand the mechanochemistry of ClpX, we analyzed the motor's pause density (number of pauses per amino acid translocated) and pause duration during translocation of the unfolded polypeptide in two opposing force regimes, 5–12 pN and 12–20 pN. We found that higher force loads increased the probability of ClpX entering a pause state by a factor of two from 0.025 ± 0.005 nm−1 to 0.045 ± 0.008 nm−1 (p = 0.008, Table S2). On the other hand, the pause duration (which reflects the probability to exit a pause state) was not affected by high opposing force load (p = 0.99, Table S2). The dissimilar effect of the external force on pause entry versus exit can be explained if the transition state, x‡, is located very close to the pause state (Tinoco and Bustamante, 2002Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. The effect of force on thermodynamics and kinetics of single molecule reactions.Biophys. Chem. 2002; 101-102: 513-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For a displacement (Δx) between the active and pause states, this means that Δx − x‡ ≈0. Calculation of x‡ based on the pause density distribution (Figure 2D) allowed us to estimate Δx ≈x‡ = 1.7 ± 0.1 Å (mean ± standard deviation [SD], Table S2). Analysis of pause durations shows that they are distributed according to a single exponential (k = 2.3 ± 0.6 s−1, R2 = 0.99), indicating that exiting from the pause state involves a single kinetic event. In order to establish whether or not pauses are states off the main translocation pathway of ClpX, we analyzed the natural fluctuations of the pause-free velocity in a force range that does not affect the rate of motor translocation and calculated the correlation between the translocation rate and the probability of entering a pause (pause density in units of 1/nm). Between 5–12 pN, the translocation rate and pause density were negatively correlated (R2 = –0.5, Table S2). Thus, we observe an increase in the number of pauses as the pause-free velocity decreases (Figure 2E), indicating that pausing and translocation compete kinetically. This type of kinetic competition is expected when pauses are states off the main translocation pathway. These results also explain the increase in pause density for forces between 12–20 pN, as the force-induced reduction of the motor velocity increases the pause entry probability. The analysis of pause density, pause duration, and their force dependence was statistically indistinguishable between ClpX and the ClpXP complex (Table S2). Based on these results, we propose the kinetic cycle shown in Figure 2F for the translocation of unfolded polypeptide by ClpXP, as well as the effects of mechanical forces on the various steps. Another fundamental question about AAA+ unfoldases is whether denaturation of single-domain substrates is primarily determined by the protein's energy landscape and occurs in a single cooperative unfolding transition or proceeds through several unfolding events depending on the presence of distinct mechanical barriers along the unfolding trajectory. To address this question, we analyzed the extensions of all rips for the three different GFP-titin substrates (Figure 1). Unfolding trajectories of the fusion construct with a single GFP molecule showed mainly two or three rips, each one followed by translocation of unfolded polypeptide chain (Figure 1B). On average, we observed twice as many rips throughout the unfolding trajectory for substrates with two GFP molecules (Figures 1C and 1D). From all these trajectories, we clearly recognized identical rip extensions that indicate a common unfolding signature of GFP (Figure 1, red arrowheads). In fact, a histogram of the rip extensions (in number of amino acids) obtained from all GFP substrates revealed a higher probability for a transition centered at 207 ± 2 aa (mean ± SEM, Figure 4A , dark red bars). In addition to this 207 aa rip, we observed rips whose extensions are less regular and vary between 20 and 300 aa, with the highest probability at 37 ± 6 aa (mean ± SEM, Figure 4A, pink bars). We interpret these irregular extensions as slipping events of ClpX backward along an already unfolded polypeptide (black arrowheads, Figure 1). Given the extension of the folded"

Here, we show that, in the mouse olfactory epithelium, olfactory receptor (OR) genes are marked in a highly dynamic fashion with the molecular hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. The cell type and developmentally dependent deposition of these marks along the OR clusters are, most likely, reversed during the process of OR choice to allow for monogenic and monoallelic OR expression. In contrast to the current view of OR choice, our data suggest that OR silencing takes place before OR expression, indicating that it is not the product of an OR-elicited feedback signal. Our findings suggest that chromatin-mediated silencing lays a molecular foundation upon which singular and stochastic selection for gene expression can be applied."

Why HCMV would induce viperin, which has antiviral activity, is unknown. We show that HCMV-induced viperin disrupts cellular metabolism to enhance the infectious process. Viperin interaction with the viral protein vMIA resulted in viperin relocalization from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria. There, viperin interacted with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein that mediates β-oxidation of fatty acids to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This interaction with viperin, but not with a mutant lacking the viperin iron-sulfur cluster-binding motif, reduced cellular ATP generation, which resulted in actin cytoskeleton disruption and enhancement of infection. This function of viperin, which was previously attributed to vMIA, suggests that HCMV has coopted viperin to facilitate the infectious process."

Live-cell imaging reveals increased dynamics of genomic loci during differentiation X chromosome pairing initiates in this context and lasts for about 45 min Tsix shows transient monoallelic expression immediately after pairing This may provide a window of opportunity for monoallelic upregulation of Xist in cis X chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensures equal levels of X-linked gene products in females (XX) and males (XY) (Lyon, 1961Lyon M.F. Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.).Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). XCI is initiated during early development via upregulation of the noncoding Xist transcript, which coats one X chromosome in cis and triggers its silencing. Once established, XCI is then maintained through propagation of epigenetic marks during cell divisions. A remarkable feature of XCI is that two identical chromosomes become differentially expressed in the same nucleoplasm. Germline imprinting provides one way of achieving asymmetric expression (see Okamoto and Heard, 2009Okamoto I. Heard E. Lessons from comparative analysis of X-chromosome inactivation in mammals.Chromosome Res. 2009; 17: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar for review). However, in most eutherians, and in postimplantation mouse embryos, XCI is random, with either the paternal or maternal X being silenced (Lyon, 1961Lyon M.F. Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.).Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Random monoallelic gene expression has also been reported to occur at some autosomal loci, with potentially important implications for development and disease (Gimelbrant et al., 2007Gimelbrant A. Hutchinson J.N. Thompson B.R. Chess A. Widespread monoallelic expression on human autosomes.Science. 2007; 318: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In the case of random XCI, the X-inactivation center (Xic), which includes the Xist gene and its antisense transcript Tsix, controls the initiation of this process (see Navarro and Avner, 2010Navarro P. Avner P. An embryonic story: analysis of the gene regulative network controlling Xist expression in mouse embryonic stem cells.Bioessays. 2010; 32: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar for review). XCI takes place during the earliest stages of embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, at a time when other important developmental decisions are also being made. In undifferentiated female ES cells, Xist and Tsix are expressed at low levels, but upon differentiation, Xist becomes upregulated and Tsix downregulated on one of the two X chromosomes (Lee et al., 1999Lee J.T.

Understanding how Xist becomes asymmetrically upregulated during early differentiation is thus central to our understanding of how the two X chromosomes become differentially expressed during random XCI. Activation of Xist during ES cell differentiation depends on downregulation of pluripotency factors such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 (Navarro et al., 2008Navarro P. Chambers I. Karwacki-Neisius V.

Genet. 2011; 20: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, these sensing mechanisms do not readily explain why only one of the two Xist alleles is upregulated, not both. Stochastic Xist expression models might partly explain this (Monkhorst et al., 2008Monkhorst K. Jonkers I. Rentmeester E. Grosveld F. Gribnau J. X inactivation counting and choice is a stochastic process: evidence for involvement of an X-linked activator.Cell. 2008; 132: 410-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the surprisingly low frequency of biallelic Xist upregulation during the initiation of XCI in mice suggests that some other means of ensuring precise monoallelic regulation exists. Recently it was shown that the two Xic loci undergo transient homologous associations (pairing) during early differentiation, and it was proposed that this might play a role in the monoallelic regulation of Xist and Tsix during initiation of XCI (Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P.

Associations between homologous chromosomal loci have been proposed to underlie the establishment of opposite states of transcriptional activity on homologous alleles in other situations, for example, during immunoglobulin recombination in B cell development (Hewitt et al., 2009Hewitt S.L.

In the case of X inactivation, pairing via the Xpr locus (Figure 1A ) has been proposed to help bring together and facilitate pairing at the Tsix loci (Augui et al., 2007Augui S. Filion G.J. Huart S. Nora E. Guggiari M. Maresca M. Stewart A.F. Heard E. Sensing X chromosome pairs before X inactivation via a novel X-pairing region of the Xic.Science. 2007; 318: 1632-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which in turn is proposed to enable coordination of monoallelic Tsix expression and reciprocal Xist expression (Xu et al., 2007Xu N. Donohoe M.E. Silva S.S. Lee J.T. Evidence that homologous X-chromosome pairing requires transcription and Ctcf protein.Nat.

Mechanics and dynamics of X-chromosome pairing at X inactivation.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000244Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In support of this, deletion of both alleles of Tsix in females results in chaotic XCI, with biallelic or no Xist upregulation in a significant proportion of cells (Lee, 2005Lee J.T. Regulation of X-chromosome counting by Tsix and Xite sequences.Science. 2005; 309: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the coordinating role of Tsix pairing in monoallelic XCI has never been tested experimentally, and the actual relationship between Xic pairing and Xist/Tsix regulation has remained unclear, partly because of the asynchronous nature and heterogeneity of early differentiating ES cells, which renders the precise ordering of events impossible in fixed cells, where only snapshots of dynamic events can be obtained. In this paper, we set out to examine the dynamics of X chromosome pairing and its possible outcome, using the Tet operator/Tet repressor (TetO/TetR) tagging system in living ES cells. Both the Xic loci as well as other autosomal regions were visualized in real time in this way. We find a general increase in the dynamics of loci during early ES cell differentiation. This could have important implications for the multiple developmental decisions being taken during this time. We show that Tsix pairing is a transient event, lasting approximately 45 min, and that during pairing, the Tsix loci show reduced mobility, suggesting some form of tethering to each other. We also demonstrate that the outcome of pairing is often monoallelic Tsix expression, which could in turn lead to monoallelic Xist upregulation. We thus present one of the first live-cell investigations of the dynamics of genomic loci during early XX ES cell differentiation and demonstrate that transient homologous associations can provide an efficient means of generating asymmetric expression states. To visualize the Xic loci and other genomic loci in living ES cells, we exploited the TetO/TetR system (Michaelis et al., 1997Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids.Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). We first targeted a single TetO array into a site located 65 kb downstream of Xist's 3′ end and 35 kb away from Xite (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online), in order to avoid any deleterious effects on Xist/Tsix/Xite regulation and initiation of XCI. The homologous recombination construct harboring the 224-repeat TetO array (11.2 kb) and a neomycin resistance gene was targeted into one of the two Xic loci in the PGK12.1 mouse female ES cell line (Penny et al., 1996Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Requirement for Xist in X chromosome inactivation.Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). Two correctly targeted clones out of 310 screened were obtained and one of them was used for further analysis (Figure S1B). Insertion of the TetO into the Xic did not affect the onset of XCI or the choice of X chromosome for XCI. The hemizygous clone (PGKT1) was differentiated in vitro and analyzed for random XCI by Xist RNA FISH accompanied by TetO DNA FISH to distinguish the TetO-tagged allele. Normal kinetics of Xist upregulation and similar frequencies of XCI were observed for both the XicTetO and untagged Xic alleles (Figure 1C and data not shown). This hemizygous PGKT1 clone was then used to generate ES cells in which both Xic loci were tagged for visualization. Initially, targeting of the second Xic locus was attempted using a targeting construct containing a Lac operator (LacO) array. However, this failed despite repeated attempts. Instead, we generated XicTetO homozygous cells by treating the hemizygous PGKT1 cells using increased G418 selection (Figure 1B) (Mortensen et al., 1992Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Production of homozygous mutant ES cells with a single targeting construct.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). One of the clones obtained (PGKT2) was found to have two X chromosomes, each of which carried a TetO-tagged Xic locus based on Southern blotting and DNA FISH on metaphase spreads (Figures S1B–S1D). A TetR-mCherry fusion protein construct was introduced into the PGKT2 cell line as a stable transgene to enable visualization of the two XicTetO loci (Figure 1B). In this clone (PGKT2-TetR), two TetR-mCherry foci could be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1E and Movie S1). The two TetR-mCherry foci corresponded to the TetO-tagged Xics as they systematically colocalized with punctate Xist/Tsix RNA FISH signals in undifferentiated ES cells (Figure S1E). Upon differentiation of PGKT2-TetR cells, monoallelic Xist RNA accumulation was observed with similar kinetics to the parental line (Figure 1D). We conclude that the presence of the TetO tag within each of the Xic loci and the expression of the TetR-mCherry protein in PGKT2-TetR cells did not interfere with normal XCI induction and kinetics. The PGKT2-TetR cell line was therefore used for subsequent experiments. In the course of this work, we also generated a series of ES cell lines carrying randomly inserted, autosomal TetO arrays, which we were able to use to assess general chromosome mobility, as will be described later. We next established conditions for live-cell imaging of TetO-tagged Xic loci in PGKT2-TetR ES cells (Figure S2A ; see also Experimental Procedures). Following deconvolution of three-dimensional (3D) image stacks, more than 80% of nuclei showed two clear XicTetO spots. In some cases, the TetR-bound locus appeared as a doublet, presumably due to sister chromatid separation (Figure 2A and Movie S1 and Movie S2). In order to determine the time window in which Xic pairing most often occurred, we assessed Xic pairing frequencies at different stages of differentiation, by measuring 3D distances between the centers of mass of the two XicTetO spots in snapshots of living cells (Figures 2A and 2B). Based on our previous criteria defined in fixed cells, pairing in living cells was defined as Xic-Xic distances of ≤2 μm (Augui et al., 2007Augui S. Filion G.J. Huart S. Nora E. Guggiari M. Maresca M. Stewart A.F. Heard E. Sensing X chromosome pairs before X inactivation via a novel X-pairing region of the Xic.Science. 2007; 318: 1632-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A peak in XicTetO pairing frequencies was found at day 1 of differentiation, as indicated by a marked shift to shorter TetO-TetO distances when compared to undifferentiated cells or late differentiated cells (day 8) (Figures 2B and 2C and Figure S2B). We reproducibly observed a peak of approximately 5% to 10% cells showing XicTetO pairing at around day 1 of differentiation in three independent experiments (Figures 2B and 2C and data not shown). These results agree with previous DNA FISH studies, where Tsix pairing was significantly enriched at day 1 or 2 of differentiation (Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P. Guggiari M. Brors B. Augui S.

(C) Summary of distribution of 3D distances between two XicTetO spots for each differentiation stage shown in (B). See also Figure S2. In order to determine the general context in which Xic pairing events occur, we wished to assess the dynamics of the Xics and of other genomic loci during ES cell differentiation. First, time-lapse 3D imaging was performed at various stages of differentiation of PGKT2-TetR cells (Figure 2A). Using imaging conditions that minimize phototoxicity in differentiating ES cells (see Experimental Procedures), we first carried out experiments using 1 min time intervals (Δt = 1 min), over a 30 min period, in undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells (from days 1 to 4) (illustrated in Movie S1 for undifferentiated cells and Movie S2 for day 1 differentiated cells). The distances (d) between two loci were used to assess mobility, as this avoids issues of nuclear rotation (Marshall et al., 1997Marshall W.F. Straight A. Marko J.F. Swedlow J. Dernburg A. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Interphase chromosomes undergo constrained diffusional motion in living cells.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 930-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Measuring 3D distances at each time point (n > 50 cells imaged, at each day of differentiation), we noted that distances between the two XicTetO loci appeared to be more variable during early differentiation as compared to undifferentiated ES cells, indicating a possible increase in mobility. This is illustrated when the change in TetO-TetO distances is plotted over time for multiple cells (Figure S2C, compare cells differentiated for 1 or 2 days to undifferentiated cells). To quantify whether there was a difference in mobility and assess whether the movements observed were random (diffusive) or directional, we plotted the mean square displacement (MSD, < Δd2 >) of the loci over time (Marshall et al., 1997Marshall W.F. Straight A. Marko J.F. Swedlow J. Dernburg A. Belmont A. Murray A.W. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Interphase chromosomes undergo constrained diffusional motion in living cells.Curr.

Macromolecular mobility inside the cell nucleus.Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 491-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The slope of the MSD is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (D) of the loci (see Experimental Procedures). The more mobile two loci are, the faster the < Δd2 > value increases over time, and the steeper the MSD slope. We measured the MSD for ≥40 cells at each stage of differentiation. For short time experiments, a linear increase of < Δd2 > with increasing time intervals (Δt) was observed in all cases, suggesting that XicTetO loci undergo diffusive rather than directional motion over a timescale of several to tens of minutes (Figure 3A ). However, the MSD < Δd2 > value increased more rapidly in differentiating cells (days 1, 2, 3, and 4) compared to undifferentiated cells (Figure 3A). This increased mobility could be seen even in day 8 differentiated cells (data not shown). At day 1 of differentiation, 47% of cells (n = 62) showed a change in TetO-TetO distances of >2 μm over 1 hr, in contrast to only 14% of undifferentiated cells (n = 21). MSD values calculated from data points near the beginning versus the ends of extended observation periods did not change in any significant way indicating that the observed increase in mobility was not due to variable phototoxicity effects in differentiated versus undifferentiated cells (Figure S3A ). We could also exclude that this increase in mobility was due to increased nuclear volume during differentiation, as we found no significant change in nuclear volume in day 1 differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated cells (data not shown), similarly to a previous study (Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P. Guggiari M. Brors B. Augui S. Clerc P. Avner P. Eils R. Heard E. Transient colocalization of X-inactivation centres accompanies the initiation of X inactivation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), even though mobility changed substantially between these two time points. At sufficiently longer times, the plateau of an MSD curve reflects constraints on long-range chromatin mobility imposed by chromosome and/or nuclear structure (see legend to Figure 3B). Measurements over longer time periods (≥120 min) revealed radii of “constrained diffusion” of ∼1.7 μm (square root of 3 μm2 plateau) for both days 0 and 1. This is in the range of chromosome territory size and well below nuclear size (Figure 3B).Figure S3Mean Square Displacement Analyses, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Assessing potential phototoxicity effects on XicTetO dynamics.

For these statistically significant time points, MSD curves depend linearly on time: 3D diffusion constants D are deduced from the slope of the curve. We next evaluated whether the increase in mobility we observed during early differentiation was specific to the Xic locus or was a more general feature of the genome in early differentiating ES cells. To this end, different ES cell lines in which two independent autosomal loci had been tagged by random integration of TetO arrays and also expressed a TetR-mCherry transgene to enable visualization, were examined (Figure 3C and Movie S3). The TetO-TetO distances in these lines (PGK28 and PGK134) were measured in living cells (in 3D, over time) at different stages of differentiation (n ≥ 39 cells for each differentiation day) and MSDs were calculated. We observed a general increase in locus mobility upon differentiation, similar to that observed for the Xics, in both cell lines (Figure 3D). Although the kinetics of this increase differed in each case, the trend was the same, implying a general increase in genome mobility during early differentiation. In the case of the Xics, this greater mobility during early differentiation might facilitate the onset of homologous Xic pairing through an increase in the frequency of collisions between loci. On the other hand, it might also inhibit prolonged interactions during pairing. We therefore examined the dynamics of Xic loci during the pairing process in more detail. Based on previous fixed cell data, it has remained unclear whether Xic pairing is a transient but frequent event, or else a prolonged but rare event. To assess the frequency and duration of pairing, and the mobility of the Xic loci during this process, live-cell imaging experiments were performed on PGKT2-TetR cells at day 1 of differentiation, which show the highest frequencies of Xic pairing (Figures 2B and 2C). This also corresponds to the time when reciprocal Xist/Tsix expression patterns are first seen. Time-lapse imaging was performed on cells for 30 min periods, with 1 min intervals. We noted that in the majority of cells where Xic pairing (distances ≤ 2 μm) was detected, both XicTetO loci"

As such, HDAC inhibitors (HDACI) could be used to deplete reservoirs of persistent, quiescent HIV-1 proviral infection. However, the development of HDACI to purge latent HIV-1 requires knowledge of the HDAC isoforms contributing to viral latency and the development of inhibitors specific to these isoforms. In this study, we identify the HDACs responsible for HIV-1 latency in Jurkat J89GFP cells using a chemical approach that correlates HDACI isoform specificity with their ability to reactivate latent HIV-1 expression. We demonstrate that potent inhibition or knockdown of HDAC1, an HDAC isoform reported to drive HIV-1 into latency, was not sufficient to de-repress the viral LTR. Instead, we found that inhibition of HDAC3 was necessary to activate latent HIV-1. Consistent with this finding, we identified HDAC3 at the HIV-1 LTR by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we show that valproic acid is a weak inhibitor of HDAC3 (IC50 = 5.5 mm) relative to HDAC1 (IC50 = 170 μm). Because the total therapeutic concentration of valproic acid ranges from 275 to 700 μm in adults, these data may explain why this inhibitor has no effect on the decay of latent HIV reservoirs in patients. Taken together, our study suggests an important role for HDAC3 in HIV-1 latency and, importantly, describes a chemical approach that can readily be used to identify the HDAC isoforms that contribute to HIV-1 latency in other cell types.

In fission yeast, adjacent heterochromatin can direct CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin establishment, but the underlying features governing where CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin assembles are unknown. We show that, in addition to centromeric regions, a low level of CENP-A(Cnp1) associates with gene promoters where histone H3 is depleted by the activity of the Hrp1(Chd1) chromatin-remodeling factor. Moreover, we demonstrate that noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from CENP-A(Cnp1) chromatin at centromeres. These analyses reveal a similarity between centromeres and a subset of RNAPII genes and suggest a role for remodeling at RNAPII promoters within centromeres that influences the replacement of histone H3 with CENP-A(Cnp1)."

A conserved mode of proteasome regulation An SCF ubiquitin-ligase regulates a proteasome activator, PI31 Drosophila PI31 is an essential protein, required for normal proteasome activity Caspases and proteasomes are coordinately regulated during cell remodeling The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major system for selective degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells, and is implicated in the regulation of most cellular processes, including cell-cycle control, transcription, signal transduction, inflammation, and cell viability (Finley, 2009Finley D.

Protein substrates are targeted for degradation by a set of enzymes that attach multiple molecules of the small protein ubiquitin (Ub). These include the Ub-activating enzymes (E1s), Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and a variety of Ub-protein ligases (E3s), which are responsible for substrate recognition and specificity (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002Glickman M.H.

The 26S proteasome is a large protease complex composed of two major components: the core or catalytic particle (CP or 20S), a cylindrical particle within which polypeptides are hydrolyzed to small peptides. The 20S proteasome is associated with one or two regulatory particles (RP or 19S) that bind the ubiquitinated substrate, unfold it, and translocate the extended polypeptide through the narrow entry channel of the CP (Coux et al., 1996Coux O.

An added level of proteasomal regulation is the replacement of the 19S RP with alternative activator complexes, such as REGαβ (PA28αβ or 11S), REGδ (PA28δ), and Blm10 (PA200) (Ma et al., 1992Ma C.P.

These complexes can bind to either or both end of the 20S particle, and enhance the entry and degradation of small peptide substrates (Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011Stadtmueller B.M. Hill C.P.

Given the variety and complexity of these regulatory components, and the growing number of proteasome associated proteins being identified, it is clear that proteasomes are much more complicated, more diverse and highly regulated structures than previously thought (Demartino and Gillette, 2007Demartino G.N. Gillette T.G. Proteasomes: machines for all reasons.Cell. 2007; 129: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of a proteasome regulatory complex that controls caspase activation and spermatogenesis in Drosophila. Caspases are the key executioners of apoptosis, but during terminal sperm differentiation they are utilized for an apoptosis-like process that eliminates excess organelles and cytoplasm (Arama et al., 2003Arama E.

Cell. 2003; 4: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Nonlethal caspase activity is also used in other examples of cellular remodeling, such as neuronal pruning (Kuo et al., 2006Kuo C.T. Zhu S. Younger S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Therefore, insights into cellular remodeling and the proteases that mediate it will likely contribute to a better understanding of these diseases. From a screen for genes that control caspase activation during terminal sperm differentiation, we isolated the F box protein Nutcracker, the substrate-binding unit of an SCF Ub-ligase complex (Bader et al., 2010Bader M. Arama E. Steller H. A novel F-box protein is required for caspase activation during cellular remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutations in nutcracker abrogate caspase activity and prevent the progression of cellular remodeling, resulting in sterility. We describe the identification and characterization of a Nutcracker-binding partner, DmPI31, discovered in a proteomic screen for Nutcracker interactors. We show that DmPI31 stability is promoted by Nutcracker, and that they functionally cooperate to activate caspases and drive sperm differentiation. Furthermore, we find that DmPI31, which was originally described as a proteasome inhibitor in mammalian systems, can activate purified 26S proteasomes in vitro (Chu-Ping et al., 1992Chu-Ping M.

Elevated levels of DmP31 can suppress phenotypes caused by reduced proteasome activity in vivo. Finally, loss-of-function mutations in DmPI31 are lethal, demonstrating that this protein has an essential physiological function. DmPI31 mutants accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins and display cell-cycle abnormalities, suggesting that DmPI31 is physiologically required for normal proteasome activity in vivo. These findings reveal a conserved mode of proteasome regulation. Nutcracker is a Drosophila F box protein previously identified in a screen for mutants that fail to activate caspases during spermatid differentiation (Bader et al., 2010Bader M. Arama E. Steller H. A novel F-box protein is required for caspase activation during cellular remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further understand its role in caspase activation and spermatogenesis, we sought to identify interacting partners by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) of Nutcracker followed by identification of associated proteins using mass-spectrometry (Figure 1A ). A protein-A (PrA) tagged version of full-length Nutcracker (PrA-ntc) was expressed in both Drosophila testes and S2 cells. After co-IP, the interacting proteins were identified using MS/MS mass-spectrometry (Figure 1B and Figure S1A available online). This revealed a group of proteins belonging to the UPS, primarily proteasome subunits (alpha1 and alpha7). Co-IP experiments confirmed that Nutcracker can associate with proteasomes in vivo (Figure 1C). In addition, we identified a putative proteasome inhibitor, DmPI31 (CG8979), as a binding partner of PrA-ntc in both S2 cells and testes (Figures 1B and 1D and Figure S1A). The interaction between Nutcracker and DmPI31 appears to be direct since both proteins can bind each other in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Giot et al., 2003Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C. Chaudhuri A. Kuang B. Li Y. Hao Y.L. Ooi C.E. Godwin B. Vitols E. et al.A protein interaction map of Drosophila melanogaster.Science. 2003; 302: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Next, we generated an antibody against recombinant DmPI31 and confirmed that this interaction occurs in vivo (Figure 1D). We chose to focus on DmPI31 because of its potential role in regulating the proteasome. We previously showed that the F box domain of Nutcracker is important for binding Cullin1 and SkpA (Bader et al., 2010Bader M. Arama E. Steller H. A novel F-box protein is required for caspase activation during cellular remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if the F box domain is also required for Nutcracker-DmPI31 binding, we performed co-IP experiments using testes expressing either the original PrA-ntc, or a truncated version that lacks the F box domain (PrA-ntcΔF). Co-IP of both PrA-ntc and PrA-ntcΔF resulted in enrichment of DmPI31 (Figure 1D). This suggests that the interaction between Nutcracker and DmPI31 is independent of the F box domain. To further investigate the nature of Nutcracker-DmPI31 interaction, we looked at a related, structurally defined association between the mammalian F box protein FBXO7 and PI31 (Kirk et al., 2008Kirk R. Laman H. Knowles P.P. Murray-Rust J. Lomonosov M. Meziane K. McDonald N.Q. Structure of a conserved dimerization domain within the F-box protein Fbxo7 and the PI31 proteasome inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22325-22335Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nutcracker has some homology with FBXO7 and they share a critical conserved valine (Figure S1B) that is required for FBXO7-PI31 binding. We mutated this valine in Nutcracker (V > E) to examine its significance in the Nutcracker-DmPI31 interaction. As shown in Figure 1E, significantly less endogenous DmPI31 was bound to the mutant Nutcracker protein than the wild-type form. These results show that the conserved FP domain is essential for interaction with DmPI31. DmPI31 is the Drosophila homolog of mammalian PI31 proteins, which have been found to inhibit the activity of purified 20S proteasomes (Chu-Ping et al., 1992Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N.

The Drosophila homolog shares over 45% homology with these proteins (Figure 2A ). DmPI31 mRNA is expressed throughout the Drosophila lifecycle, but drops substantially in the adult female (Arbeitman et al., 2002Arbeitman M.N. Furlong E.E. Imam F. Johnson E. Null B.H. Baker B.S.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that mRNA levels in adult females are equivalent to those of son-of-oskar males, which lack germ cells and functioning testes. This suggests that the majority of adult mRNA resides in testes (Figure 2B). In order to determine the expression and intracellular localization of DmPI31, testes were stained with the DmPI31 antibody. At the onset of terminal sperm differentiation, in a process called “individualization,” actin-rich cones form around the nuclei to create the Individualization Complex (IC) (Figures 2C and 2D; Fuller, 1993Fuller M.T. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). As the IC moves, most of the cytoplasm and excess organelles are expelled in an inflated structure called the cystic bulge (CB). Nutcracker protein is highly localized around the IC's actin cones in the CB (Figure 2E and Bader et al., 2010Bader M. Arama E. Steller H. A novel F-box protein is required for caspase activation during cellular remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DmPI31 is distributed in a very similar pattern (Figures 2E and 2F), and both proteins can colocalize upon expression in cultured cells (Figure S2). This suggests that DmPI31 and Nutcracker localize to the same cellular compartment during individualization, consistent with their physical interaction in vivo. We also generated a mCherry-DmPI31 fusion protein driven by the dmPI31 endogenous promoter. This reporter displayed a similar subcellular distribution as the antibody staining, indicating that the fusion protein is properly localized (Figure 2G). Furthermore, mCherrry-DmPI31 was able to rescue the lethality of dmPI31 mutants (see below). Therefore, this fusion protein can substitute for endogenous DmPI31 protein and appears to be a faithful reporter for DmPI31 localization and behavior. Since the Nutcracker-DmPI31 interaction is independent of the F box domain, we asked whether DmPI31 might be a substrate of the Nutcracker-containing SCF ubiquitin ligase. If DmPI31 is a substrate for Nutcracker-mediated degradation, we would have expected DmPI31 to accumulate in the mutants. In contrast, DmPI31 levels were greatly reduced in testes of both Nutcracker null (nutcracker07259) or truncated F box (nutcrackerms771) mutants (Figure 3A ) (Bader et al., 2010Bader M. Arama E. Steller H. A novel F-box protein is required for caspase activation during cellular remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Instead, smaller molecular weight products were detected. The full-length DmPI31 band was fully restored in nutcrackerms771−/− flies that express wild-type Nutcracker (nutcracker “rescue” transgenes: hsp83-nutcracker). This indicates that DmPI31 is cleaved in a nutcracker mutant background, suggesting that Nutcracker positively regulates DmPI31 protein stability. Also, because an F box-truncated form of Nutcracker (nutcrackerms771−/−) still destabilizes DmPI31, it appears that the F box domain is important for stabilizing DmPI31. Finally, we investigated whether the cleavage of DmPI31 in a nutcracker mutant background depends on caspases or proteasome activity and found no evidence for an involvement of these proteases (Figure S3A ).Figure S3Nutcracker Controls Caspase Activation and Sperm Individualization by Promoting DmPI31 Stability, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) DmPI31 cleavage in the nutcrackerms771 mutant background is not dependent on caspase or proteasome activity.

After 6 hr, the indicated protease inhibitors were added to the culture for an additional 6 hr at concentrations previously shown to be effective in protease inhibition. The testes were then lysed, and DmPI31 cleavage was monitored by Western blot analysis using a DmPI31 antibody. MG132 is a pan proteasome inhibitor, and zVAD is a caspase inhibitor.

The amino-terminal region of PI31 is structured and contains the FP domain, while the carboxy-terminal end, which contains proline-rich sequences, is unstructured (Kirk et al., 2008Kirk R. Laman H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18557-18565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). We therefore investigated whether the cleaved form of DmPI31 seen in lysates of nutcracker mutants is the result of random proteolysis, or cleavage of a specific portion of the protein. For this purpose, we expressed mCherry-DmPI31 in a nutcracker771−/− mutant background and probed with an anti-mCherry antibody. If cleavage of DmPI31 were near the C terminus, the resulting band would decrease by approximately 10 kDa. On the other hand, if the cleavage were near the N terminus, we would expect the molecular weight to decrease by 20 kDa (see diagram in Figure 3B). The size of mCherry-DmPI31 in a nutcracker mutant background decreased by 10 kDa. Since mCherry-DmPI31 is biologically active, we assume that the cleavage site is not affected by the presence of the mCherry tag and conclude that the C terminus of DmPI31 is truncated in a nutcracker mutant background. The C terminus of mammalian PI31 is required for proteasome interaction, so loss of nutcracker function is predicted to inactivate DmPI31 (McCutchen-Maloney et al., 2000McCutchen-Maloney S.L. Matsuda K. Shimbara N. Binns D.D. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. cDNA cloning, expression, and functional characterization of PI31, a proline-rich inhibitor of the proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18557-18565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated if the interaction between DmPI31 and Nutcracker is lost upon truncation of the DmPI31 C-terminal domain. We repeated the co-IP experiment, but this time we expressed PrA-ntc in the testes of the nutcrackerms771−/− mutant flies (Figure 3C). PrA-ntc was able to IP both the full-length and cleaved forms of DmPI31, indicating that the cleaved form is folded and capable of interacting with Nutcracker. This suggests that the phenotypes observed in nutcracker mutants result from the cleavage of DmPI31, and not simply from the inability of both proteins to interact. We asked if the interaction between the two proteins is important for their biological activity in vivo. For this purpose, we mutated the FP domain of Nutcracker and tested whether a transgene carrying this mutation can rescue nutcrackerms771−/−. Although both constructs were expressed at similar levels (Figure S3B), hsp83-nutcrackerV-E transgenenic flies were unable to rescue the nutcrackerms771−/− sterility phenotype (Table 1). When we stained testes from these males with the caspase3 antibody, we noticed that some staining was restored, demonstrating that the mutated construct was partially functional (data not shown). However, it appears that full Nutcracker activity requires binding to DmPI31.Table 1Summary of nutcracker Mutant Rescue ExperimentsGenotypeFertilityCaspase3 StainingdmPI31 CleavageMorphologyWild-type (yw)100%yesnonormalms771(−/−)0%noyesno IC formed, failure to individualizems771(−/−) + nutcracker-WT100%yesnonormalms771(−/−) + nutcracker-V-E0%yespartialincomplete individualizationms771(−/−) + PI310%yesno IC formed, failure to individualizenutcrackerms771−/− (ms771−/−) phenotypes rescued by ectopic expression of either wild-type nutcracker (nutcracker-WT), a nutcracker construct containing a mutation that prevents binding to DmPI31 (nutcrackerV-E), or a DmPI31 construct (PI31).

At least four transgenic insertions were tested for each construct. A control for equal expression is demonstrated in Figure S3B. We then investigated if the inability of the mutated rescue construct to restore fertility is caused by persistent DmPI31 cleavage. We found that hsp83-nutcrackerV-E;nutcrackerms771−/− still displayed DmPI31 cleavage, albeit less than in the original nutcrackerms771−/− homozygote mutant line (Figure 3D). This indicates that the interaction between Nutcracker and DmPI31 is important for Nutcracker's role in stabilizing DmPI31, and that this stabilization is crucial for proper sperm differentiation.

It is influenced by the local bone environment that involves cross-talks between endothelial cells and adjacent bone cells. However, data regarding factors that directly contribute to angiogenesis by bone cells remain poorly understood. Here, we report that EGFL6, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat superfamily proteins, induces angiogenesis by a paracrine mechanism in which EGFL6 is expressed in osteoblastic-like cells but promotes migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that EGFL6 is secreted in culture medium as a homodimer protein. Using scratch wound healing and transwell assays, we found that conditioned medium containing EGFL6 potentiates SVEC (a simian virus 40-transformed mouse microvascular endothelial cell line) endothelial cell migration. In addition, EGFL6 promotes the endothelial cell tube-like structure formation in Matrigel assays and angiogenesis in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. Furthermore, we show that EGFL6 recombinant protein induces phosphorylation of ERK in SVEC endothelial cells. Inhibition of ERK impaired EGFL6-induced ERK activation and endothelial cell migration. Together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that osteoblastic-like cells express EGFL6 that is capable of promoting endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via ERK activation. Thus, the EGLF6 mediates a paracrine mechanism of cross-talk between vascular endothelial cells and osteoblasts and might offer an important new target for the potential treatment of bone diseases, including osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, and fracture healing.

IntroductionAngiogenesis plays a pivotal role in bone formation, remodeling, and healing (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In early osteogenesis during embryonic development, vascularization is required for the replacement of the hypertrophied cartilage core with bone marrow. During adulthood, angiogenesis is closely coupled with the process of bone remodeling (2Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Carlevaro M.F. Cermelli S. Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that bone remodeling takes place in specialized vascular structures, bone remodeling compartments that contain osteoblastic-like cells and a vascular structure (4Hauge E.M. Qvesel D. Eriksen E.F. Mosekilde L. Melsen F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Parfitt A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1583-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lack of bone vascularity is associated with decreased bone formation and bone mass (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner.

Furthermore, inhibition of angiogenesis during fracture repair in animals results in the formation of fibrous tissue and atrophic nonunions, leading to impaired bone healing (7Fang T.D. Salim A. Xia W. Nacamuli R.P. Guccione S. Song H.M. Carano R.A. Filvaroff E.H. Bednarski M.D. Giaccia A.J. Longaker M.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).It has been widely speculated that bone remodeling requires an intimate connection between blood vessels and bone cells. Vascular endothelial cells, bone building osteoblasts, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts contribute multiple regulatory proteins that interplay autocrine/paracrine modes of regulation for the recruitment, proliferation, differentiation function, and survival of these vascular and bone cells (1Brandi M.L.

For instance, endothelial cells produce many factors that influence bone cells, including M-CSF, RANKL, 2The abbreviations used are: RANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligandbFGFfibroblast growth factor-basicCAMchorioallantoic membraneα-MEMcomplete α-modified Eagle's mediumRGDarginine-glycine-aspartic acidSVECa simian virus 40-transformed mouse microvascular endothelial cell lineBMP-2bone morphogenetic protein-2. and chemokines (1Brandi M.L.

Conversely, both osteoclasts and osteoblasts are thought to regulate endothelial cells through parathyroid hormone and proinflammatory cytokines (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, data regarding factors that have a direct effect on inducing angiogenesis by bone cells remain poorly understood.EGF-like proteins are characterized by their multiple EGF repeats. The binding of EGF-like proteins to their receptors triggers a wide range of biological functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration (10Singh A.B. Harris R.C. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). EGF receptors are expressed in a number of cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and endothelial cells (11Schneider M.R. Mayer-Roenne B. Dahlhoff M. Proell V. Weber K. Wolf E. Erben R.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; Google Scholar, 12Wang K. Yamamoto H. Chin J.R. Werb Z. Vu T.H. J. Biol.

Recently, EGF-like proteins such as TGF-α, Heparin-binding-EGF, amphiregulin, and betacellulin have been shown to play important roles in bone development (11Schneider M.R. Mayer-Roenne B.

In addition, MAEG expression was detected in several tissues, including all of the dermatome derivatives as the dermis of the trunk, the hair follicles, and the mesenchyme of the cranio-facial region (24Buchner G. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Orfanelli U. Gattuso C. Ballabio A. Franco B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Localization studies revealed that MAEG protein targets to the basement membrane of embryonic skin and developing hair follicles (25Osada A. Kiyozumi D. Tsutsui K. Ono Y. Weber C.N. Sugimoto N. Imai T. Okada A. Sekiguchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More recently, EGFL6 has been proposed as a possible biomarker in ovarian cancer (26Buckanovich R.J. Sasaroli D. O'Brien-Jenkins A. Botbyl J. Hammond R. Katsaros D. Sandaltzopoulos R. Liotta L.A. Gimotty P.A. Coukos G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the potential expression and role of EGF-like family genes on angiogenesis and bone biology have yet to be addressed.In the present study, we show that osteoblastic-like cells express EGFL6 transcripts that encode a secreted protein. Moreover, EGFL6 is capable of promoting cell migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells through the activation of the ERK pathway. We propose that EGFL6 mediates a paracrine mechanism of cross-talk between osteoblastic-like cells and vascular endothelial cells to regulate angiogenesis in the bone local environment.DISCUSSIONThe regulation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis is highly complex and orchestrated by multiple intercellular signaling networks, and knowledge of these networks will be useful for finding angiogenic inhibitors or activators with therapeutic potential. In this study, we have shown that EGFL6, although highly expressed by osteoblastic-like cells, directly regulates migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells via activation of the ERK signaling pathway. This finding represents a novel paracrine mechanism in which EGFL6 regulates a potential cross-talk between osteoblastic-like cells and endothelial cells in the bone local environment. A close association between vascularization and bone cells has long been recognized to play an important role in bone remodeling and fracture repair (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Carlevaro M.F. Cermelli S. Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar, 6Street J.

Today. 2003; 8: 980-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of EGFL6 as an angiogenic factor might provide a potential mechanistic insight into the intercellular communication between bone cells and endothelial cells. Although a number of factors that are expressed by bone cells can regulate angiogenesis via an indirect mechanism on endothelial cells, based on these studies, EGFL6 appears to have a direct effect on endothelial cells.EGFL6, as a member of the EGF repeat superfamily proteins, consists of the EGF domain. However, the biological functions of EGFL6 have not been previously examined. Using RNA in situ hybridization, EGFL6/MAEG expression was detected in several sites, including all of the dermatome derivatives as the dermis of the trunk, the hair follicles, and the mesenchyme of the cranio-facial region. It was suggested that EGFL6/MAEG may play a role as a mediator regulating epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during hair follicle development (25Osada A. Kiyozumi D. Tsutsui K. Ono Y. Weber C.N.

In the present study, we have shown that EGFL6 is highly expressed in osteoblastic-like cells. Our observation is consistent with the in situ detection of EGFL6 on the mesenchyme of the cranio-facial region which potentially contains cells of osteoblastic lineage (24Buchner G. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Orfanelli U. Gattuso C. Ballabio A. Franco B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because the osteoblastic-like cells used in the present study were freshly isolated from calvaria of young age mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in addition to osteoblasts, it might also contain mesenchymal or more differentiated stromal-like cells. Interestingly, we have found that the EGFL6 transcripts are induced in cultured cell with osteogenic medium, indicating that EGFL6 expression lies, at least in part, within the osteoblastic/stromal cell linage.EGF-like proteins are structurally unrelated to VEGF, and the role of EGF-like family in angiogenesis and bone biology is not yet well defined. One of most well characterized members of EGF-like family is EGFL7, which encodes two EGF-like domains and a leucine and valine-rich C-terminal region. Intriguingly, EGFL7 is a secreted protein and shares no significant amino acid sequence homology with EGFL6. EGFL7 is expressed at high levels in the vasculature itself (37Fitch M.J. Campagnolo L. Kuhnert F. Stuhlmann H. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and loss of EGFL7 function in zebrafish embryos results in loss of vascular tubulogenesis (16Parker L.H. Schmidt M. Jin S.W. Gray A.M. Beis D. Pham T. Frantz G. Palmieri S. Hillan K. Stainier D.Y. De Sauvage F.J. Ye W. Nature. 2004; 428: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, delayed development of vasculature in organs was found in EGFL7 knock-out mice (17Schmidt M. Paes K. De Mazière A. Smyczek T. Yang S. Gray A. French D. Kasman I. Klumperman J. Rice D.S. Ye W. Development. 2007; 134: 2913-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that it regulates angiogenesis by an autocrine mechanism involving vasculature alone. Interestingly, in contract to EGFL7, EGFL6 is not expressed in endothelial cells but by osteoblastic-like cells, which suggests that EGFL6 regulates angiogenesis in local bone environment by a paracrine mechanism. These studies hint that angiogenesis and vascular development form a complex but orderly process that is specifically controlled by different factors, including various EGF-like family proteins. Several members of EGF-like family termed EGFL2, EGFL3, EGFL5, EGFL6, EGFL7, EGFL8, and EGFL9 are comparable in EGF-like domain but distinct in their amino acid sequence. Notably, they are abundantly expressed in osteoblastic-like cells, raising the possibility that these EGF-like family proteins might play an important role in angiogenesis and bone biology. In this study, we present evidence that EGFL6 is produced by osteoblastic-like cells and plays a role in endothelial cells and angiogenesis.During angiogenesis, there is evidence that several signaling pathways are potentially activated. These include integrins/FAK-mediated pathway, MAPK pathway, and the PIK3/Akt pathways (13Mehta V.B. Besner G.E. Growth Factors. 2007; 25: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Kim H.S. Shin H.S. Kwak H.J. Cho C.H. Lee C.O. Koh G.Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Lamalice L. Le Boeuf F. Huot J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to mention that the signaling pathway of EGFL6 has not been previously reported. In the light of the knowledge that EGFL6 promotes angiogenic endothelial cells, we tested the effect of EGFL6 on the activation of these potential signaling pathways using specific phosphorylated antibodies to Akt and MAPK. We found that ERK is activated by EGFL6 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling pathway blocks EGFL6-induced ERK activation and endothelial cell migration. These results further attest to its role in the induction of cell migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells via a specific signaling pathway of ERK.It has been well established that EGF domain binds with high affinity to specific cell-surface receptors and induces their dimerization, which is essential for activating the tyrosine kinase in the receptor cytoplasmic domain, then initiating signal transduction that results in DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and developmental processes (10Singh A.B. Harris R.C. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 39Sanderson M.P. Dempsey P.J. Dunbar A.J. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the EGF-like family proteins might have distinct member of receptors given their sequence diversity and different expression patterns (40Schmidt M.H. Bicker F. Nikolic I. Meister J. Babuke T. Picuric S. Müller-Esterl W. Plate K.H. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Linton J.M. Martin G.R. Reichardt L.F.

The receptor of EGFL6 is yet to be identified. A recent report found that EGFL6 contains an RGD region that binds to α8β1 integrin (25Osada A. Kiyozumi D. Tsutsui K. Ono Y. Weber C.N. Sugimoto N. Imai T. Okada A. Sekiguchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mice with loss of function of α8β1 integrin because of a mutant in the α8 gene exhibited profound deficits in kidney morphogenesis (43Brandenberger R. Schmidt A. Linton J. Wang D. Backus C. Denda S. Müller U. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Müller U. Wang D. Denda S. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Reichardt L.F. Cell. 1997; 88: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β1 integrin plays an essential role in vascular development (45Schmidt A. Brixius K. Bloch W. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 46Bloch W. Forsberg E. Lentini S. Brakebusch C. Martin K. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Addicks K. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrated that EGFL6 might interact with integrins and regulate angiogenic activities. Taken together, these raise questions whether the activation of ERK is mediated by α8β1 integrin. To our knowledge, data regarding the association of α8β1 integrin with ERK are presently lacking. It remains to be defined whether EGFL6 uses an RGD motif to bind to α8β1 integrin as a receptor or use other critical region for binding to a more specific receptor. The identification of EGFL6 cognate receptor in endothelial cells will be the focus of our future study.In summary, we have shown that EGFL6 has a specific role in the induction of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis through the activation of ERK pathway. Our data also suggest a potential paracrine action between endothelial cells and bone cells. Understanding the mechanisms by which EGFL6 regulates the intercellular communication in bone local environment should aid in advancing our knowledge of bone remodeling and angiogenesis and may facilitate us to design novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of disease associated with pathological angiogenesis such as tumor and bone fracture healing. IntroductionAngiogenesis plays a pivotal role in bone formation, remodeling, and healing (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In early osteogenesis during embryonic development, vascularization is required for the replacement of the hypertrophied cartilage core with bone marrow. During adulthood, angiogenesis is closely coupled with the process of bone remodeling (2Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Carlevaro M.F. Cermelli S. Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that bone remodeling takes place in specialized vascular structures, bone remodeling compartments that contain osteoblastic-like cells and a vascular structure (4Hauge E.M. Qvesel D. Eriksen E.F. Mosekilde L. Melsen F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Parfitt A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1583-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lack of bone vascularity is associated with decreased bone formation and bone mass (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 6Street J. Bao M. deGuzman L. Bunting S. Peale Jr., F.V. Ferrara N. Steinmetz H. Hoeffel J. Cleland J.L. Daugherty A. van Bruggen N. Redmond H.P. Carano R.A. Filvaroff E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9656-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of angiogenesis during fracture repair in animals results in the formation of fibrous tissue and atrophic nonunions, leading to impaired bone healing (7Fang T.D. Salim A. Xia W. Nacamuli R.P. Guccione S. Song H.M. Carano R.A. Filvaroff E.H. Bednarski M.D. Giaccia A.J. Longaker M.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).It has been widely speculated that bone remodeling requires an intimate connection between blood vessels and bone cells. Vascular endothelial cells, bone building osteoblasts, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts contribute multiple regulatory proteins that interplay autocrine/paracrine modes of regulation for the recruitment, proliferation, differentiation function, and survival of these vascular and bone cells (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 8Eriksen E.F. Eghbali-Fatourechi G.Z. Khosla S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For instance, endothelial cells produce many factors that influence bone cells, including M-CSF, RANKL, 2The abbreviations used are: RANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligandbFGFfibroblast growth factor-basicCAMchorioallantoic membraneα-MEMcomplete α-modified Eagle's mediumRGDarginine-glycine-aspartic acidSVECa simian virus 40-transformed mouse microvascular endothelial cell lineBMP-2bone morphogenetic protein-2. and chemokines (1Brandi M.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20659-20672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Conversely, both osteoclasts and osteoblasts are thought to regulate endothelial cells through parathyroid hormone and proinflammatory cytokines (1Brandi M.L. Collin-Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, data regarding factors that have a direct effect on inducing angiogenesis by bone cells remain poorly understood.EGF-like proteins are characterized by their multiple EGF repeats. The binding of EGF-like proteins to their receptors triggers a wide range of biological functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration (10Singh A.B. Harris R.C. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). EGF receptors are expressed in a number of cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and endothelial cells (11Schneider M.R. Mayer-Roenne B. Dahlhoff M. Proell V. Weber K. Wolf E. Erben R.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; Google Scholar, 12Wang K. Yamamoto H. Chin J.R. Werb Z. Vu T.H. J. Biol.

Recently, EGF-like proteins such as TGF-α, Heparin-binding-EGF, amphiregulin, and betacellulin have been shown to play important roles in bone development (11Schneider M.R. Mayer-Roenne B.

In addition, MAEG expression was detected in several tissues, including all of the dermatome derivatives as the dermis of the trunk, the hair follicles, and the mesenchyme of the cranio-facial region (24Buchner G. Broccoli V. Bulfone A. Orfanelli U. Gattuso C. Ballabio A. Franco B. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).

We also showed that recombinant Pv (rPv) acted as a pattern recognition receptor capable of recognizing the microbial signature molecules LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan, as well as binding the Gram-negative and -positive microbes Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus and functioned as an antimicrobial agent capable of killing the microbes.

Importantly, microinjection of rPv or Pt5 into early embryos significantly enhanced their resistance to A. hydrophila challenge, and this enhanced bacterial resistance was markedly reduced by co-injection of anti-Pv antibody plus rPv (or Pt5) but not by injection of anti-actin antibody plus rPv. Moreover, the generated mutants with in vitro antimicrobial activity, when injected into the embryos, could also promote their resistance to A. hydrophila, but those without in vitro antimicrobial activity could not. It is thus proposed that Pv participates in the protection of early embryos against pathogenic attacks via binding and disrupting potential pathogens.

We purified a native toxin complex (toxin complex 1) from Xenorhabdus nematophilus. The toxin complex is composed of three different proteins, XptA2, XptB1, and XptC1, representing products from class A, B, and C toxin complex genes, respectively. We showed that recombinant XptA2 and co-produced recombinant XptB1 and XptC1 bind together with a 4:1:1 stoichiometry. XptA2 forms a tetramer of ∼1,120 kDa that bound to solubilized insect brush border membranes and induced pore formation in black lipid membranes. Co-expressed XptB1 and XptC1 form a tight 1:1 binary complex where XptC1 is C-terminally truncated, resulting in a 77-kDa protein. The ∼30-kDa C-terminally cleaved portion of XptC1 apparently only loosely associates with this binary complex. XptA2 had only modest oral toxicity against lepidopteran insects but as a complex with co-produced XptB1 and XptC1 had high levels of insecticidal activity. Addition of co-expressed class B (TcdB2) and class C (TccC3) proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens to the Xenorhabdus XptA2 protein resulted in formation of a hybrid toxin complex protein with the same 4:1:1 stoichiometry as the native Xenorhabdus toxin complex 1.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed this result and further evidenced the production of non-immunoreactive smaller peptides. The degradation was not observed when a calpain 1-specific inhibitor was added. The calpain cleavage sites identified by Edman degradation were regularly present in the B-type repeats of FLG2. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of normal human skin revealed colocalization of FLG2 and calpain 1 in the upper epidermis.

In the epidermis, the program of keratinocyte terminal differentiation is an oriented process during which cells of the basal layer undergo a series of metabolic and structural changes throughout their migration to the surface of the tissue. The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is formed by the stacking of so-called corneocytes, the end products of the process. The stratum corneum functions as an effective barrier between the body and its outside environment, limiting skin dehydration and preventing the penetration of outside pathogens, UV radiation, and exogenous chemicals. It also contributes to mechanical protection of the body. So that this function can be achieved, peculiar structures are formed, such as the cornified cell envelope, a resistant and insoluble protein shell that replaces the plasma membrane, and the intracorneocyte fibrous matrix made by the aggregation of keratin intermediate filaments. The epidermal differentiation complex comprises a large number of genes that are of crucial importance for keratinocyte differentiation. So far, at least 45 genes encoding structural and regulatory proteins have been mapped within this 2-Mb region on chromosome 1q21 (1Mischke D. Korge B.P. Marenholz I. Volz A. Ziegler A. J. Invest.

It consists of 10–12 tandem repeats of filaggrin (FLG) joined by a short hydrophobic linker peptide and flanked by NH2- and COOH-unique terminal domains. It is synthesized by granular layer keratinocytes, where it is stored in cytoplasmic granules, the so-called keratohyalin granules. During cornification, the transition from granular keratinocyte to corneocyte, profilaggrin is enzymatically proteolyzed into mature basic FLG monomers. Subsequently, FLG associates with intermediate filaments to promote the formation of macrofibrils and the fibrous matrix (16Mack J.W. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 50-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Then, deimination of FLG arginyl residues by peptidylarginine deiminases types 1 and 3 (PAD1 and PAD3) results in the dissociation of FLG from the matrix (17Harding C.R. Scott I.R. J. Mol.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Toulza E. Mattiuzzo N.R. Galliano M.F. Jonca N. Dossat C. Jacob D. de Daruvar A. Wincker P. Serre G. Guerrin M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) shares a number of common features with the other S100-fused type proteins. Its gene consists of three exons: a small 5′ non-coding exon, a small second exon containing the translation start site, and a very large third exon encoding most of the protein. FLG2 is mainly detected in skin, particularly in granular keratinocytes of the epidermis (9Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Gläser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly to the FLG gene, FLG2 gene expression is probably regulated at the transcriptional level because the corresponding mRNA level is dramatically (800-fold) increased in granular compared with basal keratinocytes (27Toulza E. Mattiuzzo N.R. Galliano M.F. Jonca N. Dossat C. Jacob D. de Daruvar A. Wincker P. Serre G. Guerrin M. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). FLG2 is a 2391-amino acid-long protein with a predicted NH2-terminal calcium binding domain homologous to S100 proteins followed by a large repetitive region containing two types of tandem repeats, each 75–77 amino acids long. The nine A-type repeats (A1–A9) are homologous (50–77% identity) to the repeats of HRNR (9Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Gläser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a component of cornified cell envelopes, as recently demonstrated in our laboratory (28Henry J. Hsu C.Y. Haftek M. Nachat R. de Koning H.D. Gardinal-Galera I. Hitomi K. Balica S. Jean-Decoster C. Schmitt A.M. Paul C. Serre G. Simon M. FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fourteen B-type repeats (B1–B14) are closer to FLG units (28–39% identity) (9Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Gläser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The B-type repeats in particular are rich in Gln (8.4%) and in the basic amino acids Arg (8.4%) and His (14.9%), as FLG is. Furthermore, FLG2 has been shown, like FLG and HRNR, to accumulate in the keratohyalin granules and to be proteolytically processed later during cornification (9Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Gläser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To date, however, the biological function of FLG2 is unknown. Considering the essential role of FLG in keratinocyte terminal differentiation and the similarity of FLG2 to profilaggrin, it is important to determine the biochemical properties of FLG2. In this study, we demonstrate that the FLG2 B-type repeat domain is maturated by proteolysis and that the serine protease, calpain 1, is involved in the processing. Furthermore, we also show that FLG2 is a substrate of PADs, the deimination promoting its proteolysis by calpain 1. Finally, we discuss the role of FLG2 in the stratum corneum. Human calpain 1 was purchased from Calbiochem. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucine-CHO (ALLN), a calpain inhibitor, was from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human PADs were produced and purified as reported previously (19Méchin M.C. Enji M. Nachat R. Chavanas S. Charveron M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Serre G. Takahara H. Simon M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1984-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit anti-FLG2 serum against a synthetic peptide (IP2; Fig. 1A) present on repeat B10, with an added NH2-terminal Cys residue for coupling purposes (CTVHKRHQTTHGQ) was produced by Génosphère (Paris, France). Anti-peptide anti-FLG2 antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography against the synthetic peptide covalently bound on a SulfoLink® Resin (SulfoLink® immobilization kit for peptides) as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). A goat polyclonal antibody directed against calpain 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibodies to tetra-His (anti-His; Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), actin (MAB1501; Chemicon International, Southampton, UK), and both profilaggrin and FLG (AHF3 (29Simon M. Sebbag M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Girbal-Neuhauser E. Rakotoarivony J. Sommé G. Schmitt D. Serre G. J. Invest.

Anti-mouse Flg2 antibodies were purified from a previously reported serum directed against the human FLG2 spacer (9Wu Z. Hansmann B. Meyer-Hoffert U. Gläser R. Schröder J.M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography on a recombinant form of the mouse Flg2 NH2-terminal spacer domain (amino acids 96–231). The purified immunoglobulins were shown to specifically recognize both human FLG2 and mouse Flg2. 3B. Hansmann, unpublished data. Alexa Fluor® 488- and 555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, and Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. For immunoblotting analyses, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). All experiments were performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and with appropriate approval from the University of Toulouse ethics committee. Human abdominal epidermis from healthy donors undergoing plastic surgery was cleaved from the dermis, and proteins were sequentially extracted as described previously (30Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, the epidermis was sequentially homogenized on ice in equal volumes of the following buffers: TE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm PMSF with 0.2% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), TE-Nonidet P-40 buffer (TE buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40), TEU buffer (TE buffer with 8 m urea), and TEUD buffer (TEU buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). After each extraction, the homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g and the supernatants were kept at −20 °C until used. Mouse skin samples were scraped off with a scalpel blade to get the epidermis. Epidermal proteins were then sequentially extracted as described above with TE-Nonidet P-40 and TEU buffers. Samples were separated by 10% (or 7.5% when indicated) SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was performed with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The anti-FLG2 and AHF3 were diluted to 1:200 and to 1:5000, respectively. Anti-His and anti-mouse Flg2 were diluted to 1:1000. Anti-actin was used at 1:30,000. Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantified by densitometry using the National Institutes of Health ImageJ software available on the World Wide Web. Human FLG and FLG2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR with the following primers derived from the published sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AF043380 and AY827490, respectively). 5′-CATATGCTATACCAGGTGAGCACTCATG-3′ (an added NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-CTCGAGCCCTGAACGTCCAGACCGTCC-3′ (an added XhoI restriction site is underlined) were primers for FLG, and 5′-CATATGCAGTCAGAATCCATAGTTCC-3′ (an added NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-CTCGAGTGGATAGTGAGATCCAGC-3′ (an added XhoI restriction site is underlined) were primers for FLG2. The resulting PCR products were cloned into TA vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The PCR fragments were then subcloned into NdeI/XhoI-digested pET41b vector (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), allowing inducible expression of the COOH-terminal His6-tagged proteins in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-Condon Plus (DE3+)-RiL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bacteria were transformed with the various recombinant expression plasmids and grown in LB broth medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C until cell density reached an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Then the bacteria were induced to express the recombinant proteins for 3 h by the addition of 0.5 and 0.1 mm IPTG to the culture medium for FLGHis and FLG2His, respectively. Cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 × g, and recombinant proteins extracted from cell pellets with 8 m urea were affinity-purified from bacterial lysates using a Hi-Trap column (GE Healthcare), following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection with the anti-His antibody. Recombinant human FLGHis and FLG2His (100 ng/test) were incubated at 50 °C for 19 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT with or without 40 milliunits of human PAD1, PAD2, or PAD3 (19Méchin M.C.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Equal amounts of proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunodetected with the anti-His antibody. The cleavage of unmodified and deiminated proteins was performed at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:50. Purified recombinant FLGHis and FLG2His (15.8 μm) were incubated with calpain 1 (0.32 μm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm DTT at 30 °C. A calpain 1 inhibitor, ALLN, was also present, when indicated, at a concentration of 50 or 100 μm. All reactions were stopped at the indicated time by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue or assessed by immunoblotting. Equal amounts of FLG2His and deiminated FLG2His were taken for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses. The samples were manipulated together with exactly the same procedure, and results were acquired in the same time. Calpain 1 digests were dried and reconstituted in 10 μl of a 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% acetonitrile solution. For each sample, a 0.75-μl drop of analytes solution was deposited on a MALDI plate, and a 0.75-μl drop of matrix (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (sinapinic acid; Sigma-Aldrich)) dissolved at 30 mg/ml in a 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% acetonitrile aqueous solution was then added. The samples were then left to dry completely in air. MALDI-TOF analyses were performed on a Perseptive DE-STR Voyager, (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer in positive linear mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a 500 ns delay time. Mass spectra were acquired for m/z 500–50,000 (2,000 shots/spectrum). External calibration was performed with bovine serum albumin from the Sequazyme BSA test standard kit (Applied Biosystems) with a mass precision on the order of 50 Da after calibration. Spectra were analyzed using the Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant FLG2His and calpain 1 were incubated as indicated above for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to obtain a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems), and stained with Coomassie Blue. The membrane areas corresponding to some calpain-produced FLG2 peptides were excised. The NH2 terminus of the fragments was sequenced for up to 9 Edman degradation cycles on an Applied Biosystems 494A sequencer following the manufacturer's specifications in the Laboratoire de Microséquençage des Protéines of the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). The anti-FLG2 and AHF3 antibodies were diluted to 1:50 and 1:2,000, respectively. The anti-mouse Flg2 was diluted to 1:50. For the commercially available primary and secondary antibodies, we followed the manufacturer's recommendations. Staining intensities were quantified by densitometry using the NIH ImageJ software. Co-immunolocalization experiments were performed on sections of paraffin-embedded formaldehyde-fixed human skin. Deparaffinized and rehydrated 5-μm sections were processed for heat-induced epitope retrieval at 95 °C for 45 min using 50 mm glycine solution, pH 3.5. The sections were subsequently incubated overnight with either rabbit anti-FLG2 or mouse anti-FLG antibodies and then with goat anti-calpain 1 antibodies at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for primary antibody detection. Fluorescence was analyzed using an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Transgenic C57BL/6 mice constitutively overexpressing rabbit calpastatin (under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter region) have been described previously (31Peltier J. Bellocq A. Perez J. Doublier S. Dubois Y.C. Haymann J.P. Camussi G. Baud L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples of back skin were obtained from 8-week-old transgenic and wild type mice. Unilateral Student's t test was performed for statistical evaluation of the data. To analyze the expression of FLG2 and a putative processing similar to that of FLG, sera were produced in rabbits and affinity-purified against a synthetic peptide (TVHKRHQTTHGQ; IP2) present within a B-type repeat of FLG2 (i.e. B10) (Fig. 1A). We previously checked in silico that this sequence did not show any similarities with other proteins, including the other S100-fused type proteins. The specificity of the affinity-purified anti-FLG2 antibodies was tested by immunoblotting on a FLG subunit, the FLG2 segment B7–B10 (residues 1683–1984), and HRNR, all produced in Escherichia coli as GST-fused recombinant proteins as described previously (28Henry J. Hsu C.Y. Haftek M. Nachat R. de Koning H.D. Gardinal-Galera I. Hitomi K. Balica S. Jean-Decoster C. Schmitt A.M. Paul C. Serre G. Simon M. FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The anti-FLG2 antibodies only recognized FLG2. Their reactivity was completely suppressed by preincubation with either the peptide used for immunization or the recombinant FLG2 (Fig. 1B) but not with two other synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the B-type repeat domain of FLG2. Moreover, the reactivity of the monoclonal antibody AHF3, directed against FLG and profilaggrin, was not altered by preincubation with any of the three peptides. Further confirming the specificity of the anti-FLG2 antibodies, no reactivity was observed using the preimmune sera (data not shown). To characterize the biochemical properties of FLG2, normal human epidermis was sequentially homogenized on ice in the presence of protease inhibitors, in equal volumes of a Tris-HCl buffer containing either EDTA (TE buffer), the non-ionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (TE-Nonidet P-40 buffer), urea (TEU buffer) or, finally, urea and the reducing agent DTT (TEUD buffer). Extracted proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-FLG2 antibodies (Fig. 1C, left). In the first two extracts (TE and TE-Nonidet P-40 buffers), two proteins of ∼65 and ∼45 kDa were immunodetected (lanes 1 and 2). In addition, several immunoreactive proteins with a high molecular mass (from 250 to 130 kDa) were extracted only with TEU buffer (lane 3). The largest corresponded to the expected full size of FLG2 (∼248 kDa). Furthermore, several immunodetected proteins were extracted only in the presence of DTT (lane 4). The detection of multiple proteins smaller than the expected size of the full-length FLG2 indicates a possible proteolytic processing of a precursor as is already known for profilaggrin (32Presland R.B. Kimball J.R. Kautsky M.B. Lewis S.P. Lo C.Y. Dale B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 170-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 1C (right). To locate FLG2 in the epidermis, 5-μm sections of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded healthy skins were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with both the anti-FLG2 antibodies and AHF3. FLG2 (red) was detected in the upper granular layer and in the lower stratum corneum (Fig. 1D). The labeling was completely suppressed by preincubation with either the peptide used for immunization or the purified recombinant FLG2 but not with the control peptides described above (data not shown). The merged image (Fig. 1D, bottom) clearly shows that FLG2 is expressed slightly later than profilaggrin (green) because it is not observed in the lowest granular keratinocyte in which profilaggrin is already evidenced. In the upper granular cells, FLG2 labeling was granular. In the lower stratum corneum, FLG2 and FLG were detected in the intracorneocyte fibrous matrix, whereas in the upper layer, they were not detected or only slightly detected. This parallel disappearance of the two proteins suggests that FLG2 may be degraded in the upper stratum corneum by one of the proteases involved in the degradation of FLG (e.g. calpain 1). To test our hypothesis, a pure recombinant FLG2 fragment corresponding to repeat B7–B10 was produced with a COOH-terminal His tag (called FLG2His) and incubated with calpain 1. A recombinant FLG subunit with such a His tag (named FLGHis) was used as a positive control. The reaction products were then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both FLGHis and FLG2His were rapidly degraded during the incubation with calpain 1 in the presence of 2 mm calcium ion. The calcium chelator EDTA and the calpain inhibitor ALLN prevented this degradation, indicating the specificity of the proteolysis. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that FLG2 is a direct substrate of calpain 1. The FLG2His proteolytic fragments were further examined by immunoblotting with the anti-FLG2 and anti-His antibodies (Fig. 2, C and D). This analysis confirmed the rapid and specific degradation of FLG2His by calpain 1 and highlighted the time-dependent appearance of many proteolytic fragments from 40 to 15 kDa. This indicated that multiple calpain 1 cl"

Presenilins are proteins with nine transmembrane (TM) domains that function as catalytic subunits of the γ-secretase complex responsible for the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein and other type I transmembrane proteins. The water-filled cavity within presenilin is necessary to mediate the intramembrane proteolysis reaction. Consistent with this idea, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and NMR studies revealed a number of water-accessible residues within TM7 and TM9 of mouse PS1. In addition to γ-secretase function, presenilins also demonstrate a low conductance endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak function, and many familial Alzheimer disease presenilin mutations impair this function. To map the potential Ca2+ conductance pore in PS1, we systematically evaluated endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak activity supported by a series of cysteine point mutants in TM6, TM7, and TM9 of mouse PS1. The results indicate that TM7 and TM9, but not TM6, could play an important role in forming the conductance pore of PS1. These results are consistent with previous cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and NMR analyses of PS1 and provide further support for our hypothesis that the hydrophilic catalytic cavity of presenilins may also constitute a Ca2+ conductance pore.

https://openalex.org/W2033108034,"Induced radioresistance in the surviving cancer cells after radiotherapy could be associated with clonal selection leading to tumor regrowth at the treatment site. Previously we reported that post-translational modification of IκBα activates NFκB in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and plays a key role in regulating apoptotic signaling. Herein, we investigated the orchestration of NFκB after IR in human neuroblastoma. Both in vitro (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-MC, and IMR-32) and in vivo (xenograft) studies showed that IR persistently induced NFκB DNA binding activity and NFκB-dependent TNFα transactivation and secretion. Approaches including silencing NFκB transcription, blocking post-translational NFκB nuclear import, muting TNF receptor, overexpression, and physiological induction of either NFκB or TNFα precisely demonstrated the initiation and occurrence of NFκB → TNFα → NFκB positive feedback cycle after IR that leads to and sustains NFκB activation. Selective TNF-dependent NFκB regulation was confirmed with futile inhibition of AP-1 and SP-1 in TNF receptor muted cells. Moreover, IR increased both transactivation and translation of Birc1, Birc2, and Birc5 and induced metabolic activity and clonal expansion. This pathway was further defined to show that IR-induced functional p65 transcription (not NFκB1, NFκB2, or c-Rel) is necessary for activation of these survival molecules and associated survival advantage. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time the functional orchestration of NFκB in response to IR and further imply that p65-dependent survival advantage and initiation of clonal expansion may correlate with an unfavorable prognosis of human neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1972805722,"Pkh1, -2, and -3 are the yeast orthologs of mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Although essential for viability, their functioning remains poorly understood. Sch9, the yeast protein kinase B and/or S6K ortholog, has been identified as one of their targets. We now have shown that in vitro interaction of Pkh1 and Sch9 depends on the hydrophobic PDK1-interacting fragment pocket in Pkh1 and requires the complementary hydrophobic motif in Sch9. We demonstrated that Pkh1 phosphorylates Sch9 both in vitro and in vivo on its PDK1 site and that this phosphorylation is essential for a wild type cell size. In vivo phosphorylation on this site disappeared during nitrogen deprivation and rapidly increased again upon nitrogen resupplementation. In addition, we have shown here for the first time that the PDK1 site in protein kinase A is phosphorylated by Pkh1 in vitro, that this phosphorylation is Pkh-dependent in vivo and occurs during or shortly after synthesis of the protein kinase A catalytic subunits. Mutagenesis of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 abolished binding of the regulatory subunit and cAMP dependence. As opposed to PDK1 site phosphorylation of Sch9, phosphorylation of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 was not regulated by nitrogen availability. These results bring new insight into the control and prevalence of PDK1 site phosphorylation in yeast by Pkh protein kinases.

These results bring new insight into the control and prevalence of PDK1 site phosphorylation in yeast by Pkh protein kinases. The activity of a large number of protein kinases is regulated through phosphorylation of their activation loop (also known as T-loop), one of the most dynamic regions of the kinase core (1Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). A feature shared by almost all members of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases (to which PKA, 3The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase APDK13-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1HMhydrophobic motifPIFPDK1-interacting fragmenttstemperature-sensitivePKBprotein kinase BPKGprotein kinase GPtdInsphosphatidylinositol(m)TOR(mammalian) target of rapamycinSCsynthetic completePHSphytosphingosineSDsynthetic definedPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. PKG, and PKC belong) is the presence of a phosphorylation site in their activation loop with consensus sequence TFCGTXEY where the Thr residue in bold represents the phosphorylated residue and X represents any amino acid. Phosphorylation of this site is required for full kinase activity. In most AGC kinases, this site is targeted by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and is therefore also called the PDK1 site (2Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). protein kinase A 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 hydrophobic motif PDK1-interacting fragment temperature-sensitive protein kinase B protein kinase G phosphatidylinositol (mammalian) target of rapamycin synthetic complete phytosphingosine synthetic defined phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. PDK1 is a main downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling: binding of growth factors or insulin to their corresponding receptors triggers activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, which phosphorylate inositol phospholipids (PtdIns) at the 3′-OH position of their inositol ring. In this way, class I PI3K generate PtdIns3P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (3Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The latter two lipid species recruit PDK1 to the plasma membrane through binding to its C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. This causes colocalization of PDK1 and its substrate, PKB, at the plasma membrane (4Andjelković M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J.

Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of these phosphoinositides to PKB causes a conformational change in PKB, enabling it to be phosphorylated by PDK1 (7Milburn C.C. Deak M. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Alessi D.R. Van Aalten D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Apart from PKB, none of the other PDK1 substrates contain a pleckstrin homology domain, nor do they interact with phosphoinositides. The interaction of these substrates with PDK1 is regulated in a different way. They contain a hydrophobic motif (HM) located C-terminal of the catalytic domain with consensus sequence FXXF(S/T)(F/Y) with the Ser/Thr residue in bold indicating the phosphorylation site. This HM functions as a docking site for PDK1 since it can bind to a hydrophobic pocket in PDK1 called the PDK1-interacting fragment “(PIF) pocket” (8Frödin M. Antal T.L. Dümmler B.A. Jensen C.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies demonstrated the existence of a phosphate binding groove adjacent to the PIF pocket in PDK1 capable of binding the phosphorylated Ser/Thr of the HM in PDK1 substrates. Binding of the phosphorylated HM to PDK1 increases PDK1 catalytic activity, resulting in phosphorylation of the substrate activation loop (12Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This in turn prompts binding of the phosphorylated HM to the HM pocket of the PDK1 substrate, creating an active conformation of this kinase. Although not required for its interaction with PDK1, PKB also contains a HM whose phosphorylation further increases the catalytic activity of PKB. Recent work has shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), either as part of mTORC1 or mTORC2, is capable of phosphorylating the HM motif found in most AGC kinases (for a recent review, see Ref. 13Jacinto E. Lorberg A. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three PDK1 orthologs, Pkh1–3. Combined deletion of PKH1 and PKH2 is lethal due to a cell wall defect, and expression of human PDK1 rescues this lethality (14Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Pkh3 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the cell wall defect in a pkh1ts pkh2Δ strain (15Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8344-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but so far no data are available that could reveal a functional role for Pkh3. Pkh substrates identified to date include mostly protein kinases involved in cell integrity signaling, such as the yeast serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase homologs Ypk1 and Ypk2 and the yeast PKC1 homolog Pkc1, all of which are phosphorylated on their conserved PDK1 site (15Inagaki M.

Thevelein J.M. Wera S. Bos J.L. Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction. IOS Press, Fairfax, VA2000: 117-126Google Scholar), recent work suggests that Sch9 might also function analogously to mammalian S6K (27Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Although these data underscore the importance of Sch9 in cellular signaling, its precise activation mechanism is still elusive. Urban et al. (27Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) showed that six amino acids in the C terminus of Sch9 are directly phosphorylated by the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex, and this phosphorylation is sensitive to the nutrient status of the medium. One of these residues, Thr-737, is located in a HM C-terminal to the catalytic domain and is conserved in PKB and S6K. mTORC1 phosphorylates the HM in S6K, whereas mTORC2 targets the HM in PKB. Phosphorylation of this HM is essential for Sch9 activity. The presence of a PDK1 site in Sch9 indicates a possible role for Pkh kinases as regulators of Sch9. Previous work has shown that PDK1 site phosphorylation in Sch9 is dependent in vivo on Pkh1–2 activity (27Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and that Pkh1 can phosphorylate this site in vitro (28Liu K. Zhang X. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22679-22687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of Pkh-dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 has remained unclear. Other yeast kinases containing a PDK1 site are the catalytic subunits of PKA (encoded by TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3). Yeast Tpk1 is a phosphoprotein, and the PDK1 site in Tpk1 was identified as one of the phosphorylated residues (29Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Which protein kinase targets this site in S. cerevisiae has not been explored. In mammalian cells, PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of PKB is well-established, but phosphorylation of PKA by PDK1 remains enigmatic (30Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Nirula A. Ho M. Phee H. Roose J. Weiss A. J. Exp.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that both Sch9 and Tpk1 physically interact with Pkh1 in vitro and that this interaction depends on a hydrophobic pocket in the kinase domain of Pkh1. We demonstrate that yeast Pkh kinases target the PDK1 site of Sch9 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this site is no longer phosphorylated in nitrogen-deprived cells, and addition of all nitrogen compounds required for growth results in rephosphorylation. We also demonstrate for the first time direct Pkh-dependent phosphorylation of the PDK1 site in the yeast PKA catalytic subunit Tpk1 in vitro and absence of this phosphorylation in newly synthesized Tpk1 in a strain lacking Pkh activity in vivo. Contrary to PDK1 site phosphorylation of Sch9, the PDK1 site in Tpk1 is not nitrogen-responsive. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Standard rich yeast peptone (YP) and defined minimal media (synthetic complete (SC)) containing either 2% glucose, 2% raffinose, or 2% galactose as the carbon source and supplemented with the appropriate nutrients to maintain selection for plasmids were used for yeast cultivation. Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C with the exception of temperature-sensitive strains, which were grown at 24 °C. For experiments with nitrogen-starved cells, cells were first grown to exponential phase (A600 nm = 1.5–2.0), harvested, and resuspended in nitrogen starvation medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate) containing 4% glucose. Cultures were then incubated with shaking for 24 h unless stated otherwise; care was taken that the glucose level remained high (2%) throughout the entire period of incubation. Plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutation(s) as well as the absence of any erroneous mutations. Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21, and expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS buffer. Cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (1× PBS, 0.4% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Lysis was completed by 3 × 15-s pulses of sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant fraction was incubated with 400 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) (pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT)) in a roller drum for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and washed five times with wash buffer. For the induction of Pkh1-HA expression from the GAL promoter, plasmids were transformed into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ2168. Cultures were grown to midlog phase on SC-raffinose medium, 2% galactose was added to the cultures, and cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS buffer 4 h later. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)). Glass beads were added, and cells were lysed by vigorous vortexing (4 × 1 min with cooling on ice in between). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for a second time at 14,000 × g. Clarified extracts were incubated with 100 μl of a 50:50 slurry of protein G-agarose beads (washed with lysis buffer) and 5 μl of anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead-bound immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, and beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Signal intensity was quantified with AIDA software. Yeast strains were transformed with a plasmid containing HA3-GFP-Tpk1 under control of the CUP1 promoter (derived from plasmid pPHY2203 (33Deminoff S.J. Howard S.C. Hester A. Warner S. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2006; 173: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Transformants were grown to midexponential phase (A600 nm = 1.5) at 24 °C on synthetic medium lacking uracil to select for plasmid maintenance. 1.2 m sorbitol was included in the growth medium to compensate for cell wall defects caused by Pkh inactivation. After Pkh inactivation by shifting cells to 35 °C for 30 min, Tpk1 expression was induced (for a period of 2 h) by the addition of CuSO4 to a final concentration of 100 μm. As a control, the same experiment was performed at the permissive temperature of 24 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were purified as described. GST fusion proteins were extracted from BL21 E. coli cells as described. Beads were finally resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm DTT). Yeast extracts were prepared as described, and clarified extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) to reduce aspecific binding. Beads were collected with a brief spin at 500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with equal amounts of bead-bound purified GST fusion proteins prepared as described. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, samples were allowed to stand for 5 min on ice. The sedimented beads were washed three times with PBS-T (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100). Finally, proteins were solubilized by adding SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Yeast extracts were prepared as described. After incubation with the appropriate antibody, bead-bound immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). Beads were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the appropriate substrate (purified as bead-bound GST fusion proteins from E. coli as described). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained by Coomassie and analyzed by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager and by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. To test specificity of the phosphospecific antibodies, a dot blot assay was performed. 100 μg of the synthetic phosphopeptides used to generate the antibodies (Eurogentec) was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) BSA in TBS-Tween buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody in blocking buffer. After this, blots were washed three times with TBS-Tween buffer and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody in blocking buffer. After washing three times with TBS-Tween, membranes were incubated with SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) for visualization. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using rat monoclonal antibodies (3F10) (Roche Applied Science) and detected using rat monoclonal anti-HA-peroxidase high affinity antibodies (Roche Applied Science). GST-PIFtide was detected using GST antibody from GE Healthcare. Anti-Bcy1 antibody was custom-made by Eurogentec. Sch9 Thr-570 phosphospecific antibodies and Tpk1 Thr-241 phosphospecific antibodies were generated by Eurogentec using synthetic phosphopeptides (with sequences H2N-KDRTNT(PO3H2)FCGTTEY-CONH2 and H2N-VPDVTYT(PO3H2)LCGTPD-CONH2, respectively) as immunizing reagent. The antiserum was depleted of antibodies that recognized the non-phosphorylated form before phosphospecific antibodies were purified. Secondary antibodies were from GE Healthcare. Yeast extracts were prepared as described. Extracts were diluted to a final concentration of 0.125 μg/μl. The kinase reaction mixture (50-μl final volume) contained 0.5 μg of protein, 300 μm kemptide (Sigma), 5 μg of BSA in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the indicated cAMP concentrations. Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (to a final concentration of 0.1 μCi/μl) in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP and 1.5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2 (final concentrations). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by spotting 10 μl onto a phosphocellulose filter (Whatman P81). Filters were washed three times with phosphoric acid for 10 min and once with acetone. Filter papers were then dried at 60 °C, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Yeast strains containing GST-SCH9 behind the GAL1 promoter, integrated in the genome, were transformed with plasmids expressing HA3-tagged mutant versions of Sch9. Cells were diluted to a start A600 nm of 0.02, grown for 6 h in rich medium containing 2% galactose, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were harvested, resuspended in rich medium containing 2% glucose as the carbon source, and allowed to grow for 9 h before being analyzed by flow cytometry. Forward light scattering was used as a measure of cell size. Standard deviations were below 6% in each case. All experiments were repeated at least twice. PKH3 was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect of a pkh1D398G pkh2Δ strain (hereafter referred to as pkh1ts pkh2Δ). Unlike a pkh1Δ pkh2Δ strain, combined deletion of PKH3 and PKH1 or of PKH3 and PKH2 is viable (15Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8344-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because of this, studies on the functional role of yeast Pkh kinases have focused on Pkh1 and Pkh2. We have now created a pkh1ts pkh2Δ pkh3Δ strain to investigate the relative importance of all three PDK1 orthologs. Additional deletion of PKH3 exacerbated the growth defect of a pkh1ts pkh2Δ strain at the restrictive temperature of 35 °C (Fig. 1). Moreover, although the presence of 1.2 m sorbitol (acting as osmosupport and thus preventing cell lysis) could rescue the growth defect of a pkh1ts pkh2Δ strain at 35 °C, it did not fully restore growth in a pkh1ts pkh2Δ pkh3Δ strain. This could indicate a more severe cell wall defect in the latter strain that could not be entirely overcome by sorbitol. Alternatively, it is plausible that inactivation of all three Pkh protein kinases prevents activation of proteins involved in cell growth. In this regard, it is interesting to note that cells lacking Sch9 or cells with low PKA activity display a slow growth phenotype. Together with the presence of a putative PDK1 site in these kinases, this prompted us to investigate the precise connection between Pkh1–3, Sch9, and PKA. Using a GST pulldown assay, we could demonstrate binding between Sch9 and Pkh1. An N-terminal GST fusion of the Sch9 protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and incubated with yeast extract containing Pkh1-HA. After isolation of GST-Sch9, Pkh1-HA could be recovered, indicating that these proteins interact (Fig. 2A). Our results are consistent with a recent report documenting interaction between Sch9 and Pkh2 (27Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. Broach J.R. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Loewith R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Sch9 belongs to the class of AGC kinases whose members contain both a PDK1 phosphorylation site and a C-terminal HM. The yeast Pkh proteins display high sequence similarity to mammalian PDK1 in the region comprising the hydrophobic PIF pocket, which contributes to PDK1-substrate binding through interaction with the HM in substrates (10Biondi R.M.

To check whether Pkh1 has a functional equivalent of the PIF pocket found in PDK1 and thus perhaps a substrate binding mechanism similar to PDK1, a binding assay using GST-PIFtide was performed. This peptide of 24 amino acids encompasses the HM found in the PDK1 substrate PRK2 and shows high similarity to the HM found in PKB except that the residue equivalent to Ser-473 in PKB is an acidic Asp. GST-PIFtide interacted with Pkh1, and mutagenesis of the FXXF motif (part of the HM) of PIFtide into FXXA almost completely abolished interaction (Fig. 2B). Substitution of Phe by Ala in the FXXF motif of Sch9 reduced the amount of bound Pkh1 as shown by a GST pulldown assay (Fig. 2C). We also modified the PIF pocket of Pkh1 by mutagenesis of a conserved, crucial hydrophobic residue into a glutamate residue (L199E), thus disrupting the hydrophobic nature of the pocket. Although the expression of the Pkh1L199E allele was somewhat reduced compared with the wild type allele, the results clearly showed that mutagenesis of the Leu residue largely abolished Pkh1-Sch9 binding (Fig. 2A). In addition, the L199E mutant allele cannot substitute for wild type Pkh1 in vivo as judged by its inability to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a pkh1ts pkh2Δ pkh3Δ strain (Fig. 2D). The pkh1ts pkh2Δ strain was partially rescued by this allele, suggesting a function for Pkh3 in support of growth under certain conditions. All known substrates of Pkh1 (the cell integrity signaling proteins Ypk1, Ypk2, and Pkc1) are phosphorylated on their PDK1 site (14Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr.

Sch9 too contains a PDK1 site, and we could demonstrate Pkh1-dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3A). This phosphorylation was strongly reduced in a Sch9T570A mutant protein, confirming that Pkh1 phosphorylates Sch9 primarily on its PDK1 site (Fig. 3A).

Membrane PPases consist of 70–81-kDa subunits that apparently form a homodimer (1Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and are divided into K+-dependent and K+-independent subfamilies. The key determinant of K+ dependence is a single amino acid position located near the cytoplasm-membrane interface, which is occupied by Ala in the K+-dependent and Lys in the K+-independent enzymes (2Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All PPases additionally require Mg2+ for function (3Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Eur. J.

In bacteria and archaea, these enzymes generate an ion-motive force for ATP synthesis and transport processes, particularly during stress and low energy conditions (7Baltscheffsky M. Schultz A.

Des. 2008; 14: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In contrast, Na+-transporting PPases (Na+-PPases) were only recently identified in the mesophilic archaeon Methanosarcina mazei, the moderately thermophilic acetogenic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica, and the marine hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (19Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8872-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These enzymes are similar to the H+-PPases in many aspects but require both K+ and Na+ for activity (20Belogurov G.A. Malinen A.M. Turkina M.V. Jalonen U. Rytkönen K. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The initial discovery of Na+-PPases in the contrasting ecological and evolutionary niches suggests that PPi-energized Na+ transport is a ubiquitous process. However, verification of this hypothesis has been severely hampered by our inability to predict transport specificity directly from protein sequence information. In this study, we overcame this limitation by experimentally screening transport specificity across different types of membrane PPases. These data, in conjugation with phylogenetic analysis, indicate that Na+ transport specificity is indeed a very common property and preceded H+ transport specificity in the evolutionary history of the protein family. We additionally employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify the structural elements defining membrane PPase transport specificity.DISCUSSIONThe membrane PPase family consists of two independently evolving subfamilies, one (K+-dependent) requiring millimolar concentrations of K+ to attain catalytic activity and the other being K+-independent (2Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both subfamilies were originally believed to operate as H+ pumps until the recent discovery of Na+-PPases within the K+-dependent subfamily (19Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8872-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The four novel Na+-PPases uncovered in this study have further increased the total number of identified Na+-PPases to seven. Moreover, Biegel and Müller (37Biegel E. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) recently reported PPi-dependent Na+ accumulation in IMV prepared from Acetobacterium woodii, suggesting that this bacterium also contains a Na+-PPase. Notably, Ctet-PPase was previously reported to operate as a H+ pump (38Huang Y.T. Liu T.H. Chen Y.W. Lee C.H. Chen H.H. Huang T.W. Hsu S.H. Lin S.M. Pan Y.J. Lee C.H. Hsu I.C. Tseng F.G. Fu C.C. Pan R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23655-23664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We did not observe a PPi-induced H+ transport signal with Ctet-PPase IMV but detected a strong Na+ transport signal. Ctet-PPase has thus been classified as a Na+ pump, consistent with the findings that C. tetani employs Na+ as the major coupling ion for membrane transport processes, lacks primary H+ pumps, and has a V-type Na+-coupled ATPase instead of H+-ATPase (39Bruggemann H. Baumer S. Fricke W.F. Wiezer A. Liesegang H. Decker I. Herzberg C. Martinez-Arias R. Merkl R. Henne A. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).K+-dependent PPases can be phylogenetically classified into four major clades rooting at nodes A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1). Clade A branches at the interface of K+-dependent and K+-independent subfamilies, whereas clades B, C, and D group monophyletically at node N further within the K+-dependent subfamily. Clade A contains H+-PPases, clades B and C are populated by Na+-PPases, and clade D possesses both H+- and Na+-PPases. Na+-PPases thus dominate the K+-dependent subfamily, whereas Na+ pumping and dependence are traced to node N and thus are considered as an ancestor of the N cluster (groups of clades B, C, and D). At the functional level, the monophyletic origin of all existing Na+-PPases is supported by the finding that the activities of the enzymes characterized are regulated similarly by a complex Na+- and K+-dependent mechanism affecting both maximal enzymatic activity and ligand binding affinities. Two scenarios are envisaged to explain the presence of H+-PPases in clade D, specifically placement of H+-PPase in clade D is an artifact of phylogenetic reconstitution, or the H+ specificity of some PPases in clade D is not homologous to that in clade A and K+-independent H+-PPases but a result of homoplasy. Our analysis of the Glu residues in TMH5 and TMH6 favors the latter possibility.The three subtypes of clade D membrane PPases are represented by Na+-transporting Cl-PPase, H+-transporting Fj-PPase, and plant-type H+-PPases. Cl-PPase is similar to enzymes from evolutionarily diverse bacteria. Fj-PPase has close homologs only in Bacteroidetes, whereas the plant category of H+-PPases additionally includes enzymes from unicellular protozoa and the spirochaete bacterium Leptospira. H+-transporting Fj-PPase and plant enzymes group polyphyletically and differ from all Na+-PPases and the clade D ancestor enzyme in that Glu242 (Cl-PPase numbering) is relocated from its cytoplasm-membrane interface position in TMH6 to a membrane-embedded position in TMH5 or TMH6, respectively. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Glu242 relocations are key, albeit not the only structural modifications during the evolutionary pathways responsible for the H+ transport specificity of Fj-PPase-type and Leptospira/protozoan/plant-type enzymes. First, site-directed mutagenesis data indicate an essential role for TMH5 and TMH6 carboxyl groups in maintaining PPi hydrolysis coupling to H+ transport across the membrane. This conclusion is further supported by the recently published results of an alanine scanning mutagenesis study of transmembrane domain 6 of mung bean H+-PPase (40Pan Y.J. Lee C.H. Hsu S.H. Huang Y.T. Lee C.H. Liu T.H. Chen Y.W. Lin S.M. Pan R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Second, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which preferentially reacts with protonated carboxyl groups, targets the relevant Glu residue in A. thaliana H+-PPase (AVP1) (41Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Finally, the E242D substitution leads to a dramatic increase in the Na+ concentration required for the maximal activity of Na+-PPase in the presence of K+, indicating changes in the affinity of the Na+-specific binding site that presumably functions as the cytoplasmic acceptor for the transported Na+ (42Malinen A.M. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13447-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).K+-independent enzymes from C. thermocellum and T. lettingae are phylogenetically the most closely related to K+-dependent PPases. Ct-PPase and Pa-PPase do not transport Na+ and may thus perform H+ transport activity similar to other characterized K+-independent membrane PPases, but this is yet to be directly demonstrated. Because five characterized K+-independent H+-PPases represent distinct divergent clades within the subfamily and no K+-independent Na+-PPases have been encountered so far, it is highly likely that all members of the K+-independent subfamily operate as H+ pumps.Significantly, the Na+-PPase and K+-independent H+-PPase genes are adjacent in the M. mazei genome, suggesting that the gene cluster is a footprint of an ancient gene duplication event resulting in the formation of the two deeply rooted subfamilies. To date, the classification of membrane PPases has been based on their requirement for K+. However, we speculate that the initial specialization of the duplicates leading to emergence of two subfamilies was, in fact, driven by changes in transported cation specificity and followed by secondary loss of K+ dependence in H+-PPases. Indeed, the absence of K+-independent Na+-PPases and our failure to generate such enzymes via mutagenesis 3G. A. Belogurov and H. H. Luoto, unpublished data. suggest that K+ independence is incompatible with Na+ pumping. The change in transport specificity adds to the capability of the organism to utilize PPi for the generation of both Na+ and H+ gradients, whereas changes in K+ dependence do not provide an immediate fitness benefit. We further propose that the ancestor enzyme is possibly a Na+ pump. Thus, the evolution of a membrane PPase coupling ion specificity from Na+ to H+ parallels the scenario suggested for Na+- and H+-coupled F- and V-type ATP synthases/ATPases and adds support to the concept of global evolutionary primacy of Na+-coupled bioenergetics (43Mulkidjanian A.Y. Galperin M.Y. Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Biol. Direct. 2008; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44Mulkidjanian A.Y. Dibrov P. Galperin M.Y. Biochim. Biophys.

April 2, 2011; 10.1007/s11084-011-9235-4PubMed Google Scholar).Further research is required to establish the physiological role of Na+-PPase. A literature search has revealed two interesting trends. First, Na+-PPase is more frequently found in anaerobic organisms than H+-PPase. Thus, 23 of the 30 characterized and predicted Na+-PPases in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) are derived from anaerobic hosts, whereas only 14 of 49 H+-PPases belong to anaerobes. Thus, a change from an anaerobic to aerobic environment may have provided the driving force for evolution from PPi-energized Na+ pumping to H+ pumping. This is most evident in clade D, which contains four of seven aerobic Na+-PPases (compared with only 3 of 25 Na+-PPases from aerobic hosts in clades B and C). Second, at least half of the anaerobic and all except one of the aerobic Na+-PPase hosts are halophilic or halotolerant compared with only one-quarter of the H+-PPases. Accordingly, it is proposed that Na+-PPase function is related to creating salt tolerance, especially in aerobic host organisms. This theory may be extended to speculate that because Na+-PPase is naturally preferred in halophiles, this enzyme may prove better than H+-PPase (6Serrano A. Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Baltscheffsky M. Baltscheffsky H. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in engineering salt tolerance in plants/microbes.In summary, our results confirm that a wide range of microorganisms employ PPi-energized Na+ extrusion systems. We provide a comprehensive reconstruction of membrane PPase evolution and predict the transport specificity of membrane PPases as follows: (i) K+-independent enzymes are proton pumps, (ii) K+-dependent enzymes belonging to clade N are sodium pumps if Glu is present at the TMH6 interface and proton pumps if the Glu residue is relocated, and (iii) K+-dependent enzymes belonging to clade A are proton pumps. Notably, the sequence determinants governing the differences in transport specificity between clades A and N are not fully clarified at present, and therefore, the position of the sequence in the phylogenetic tree is an essential part of the prediction algorithm.

Des. 2008; 14: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In contrast, Na+-transporting PPases (Na+-PPases) were only recently identified in the mesophilic archaeon Methanosarcina mazei, the moderately thermophilic acetogenic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica, and the marine hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (19Malinen A.M. Belogurov G.A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8872-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These enzymes are similar to the H+-PPases in many aspects but require both K+ and Na+ for activity (20Belogurov G.A. Malinen A.M. Turkina M.V. Jalonen U. Rytkönen K. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The initial discovery of Na+-PPases in the contrasting ecological and evolutionary niches suggests that PPi-energized Na+ transport is a ubiquitous process. However, verification of this hypothesis has been severely hampered by our inability to predict transport specificity directly from protein sequence information. In this study, we overcame this limitation by experimentally screening transport specificity across different types of membrane PPases. These data, in conjugation with phylogenetic analysis, indicate that Na+ transport specificity is indeed a very common property and preceded H+ transport specificity in the evolutionary history of the protein family. We additionally employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify the structural elements defining membrane PPase transport specificity."

https://openalex.org/W1965669311,"Early steps in the biogenesis of Photosystem II (PSII) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are thought to occur in a specialized membrane fraction that is characterized by the specific accumulation of the PSII assembly factor PratA and its interaction partner pD1, the precursor of the D1 protein of PSII. Here, we report the molecular characterization of this membrane fraction, called the PratA-defined membrane (PDM), with regard to its lipid and pigment composition and its association with PSII assembly factors, including YCF48, Slr1471, Sll0933, and Pitt. We demonstrate that YCF48 and Slr1471 are present and that the chlorophyll precursor chlorophyllide a accumulates in the PDM. Analysis of PDMs from various mutant lines suggests a central role for PratA in the spatial organization of PSII biogenesis. Moreover, quantitative immunoblot analyses revealed a network of interdependences between several PSII assembly factors and chlorophyll synthesis. In addition, formation of complexes containing both YCF48 and Sll0933 was substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The findings are integrated into a refined model for PSII biogenesis in Synechocystis 6803."

Subsequently, the ricin A chain traverses the ER bilayer by a process referred to as dislocation or retrograde translocation to gain access to the cytosol. To study the molecular processes of ricin A chain dislocation, we have established, for the first time, a human cell system in which enzymatically attenuated ricin toxin A chains (RTAE177D and RTAΔ177–181) are expressed in the cell and directed to the ER. Using this human cell-based system, we found that ricin A chains underwent a rapid dislocation event that was quite distinct from the dislocation of a canonical ER soluble misfolded protein, null Hong Kong variant of α1-antitrypsin. Remarkably, ricin A chain dislocation occurred via a membrane-integrated intermediate and utilized the ER protein SEL1L for transport across the ER bilayer to inhibit protein synthesis. The data support a model in which ricin A chain dislocation occurs via a novel strategy of utilizing the hydrophobic nature of the ER membrane and selective ER components to gain access to the cytosol.

https://openalex.org/W2157571256,"Six novel inhibitors of Vibrio harveyi chitinase A (VhChiA), a family-18 chitinase homolog, were identified by in vitro screening of a library of pharmacologically active compounds. Unlike the previously identified inhibitors that mimicked the reaction intermediates, crystallographic evidence from 14 VhChiA-inhibitor complexes showed that all of the inhibitor molecules occupied the outer part of the substrate-binding cleft at two hydrophobic areas. The interactions at the aglycone location are well defined and tightly associated with Trp-397 and Trp-275, whereas the interactions at the glycone location are patchy, indicating lower affinity and a loose interaction with two consensus residues, Trp-168 and Val-205. When Trp-275 was substituted with glycine (W275G), the binding affinity toward all of the inhibitors dramatically decreased, and in most structures two inhibitor molecules were found to stack against Trp-397 at the aglycone site. Such results indicate that hydrophobic interactions are important for binding of the newly identified inhibitors by the chitinase. X-ray data and isothermal microcalorimetry showed that the inhibitors occupied the active site of VhChiA in three different binding modes, including single-site binding, independent two-site binding, and sequential two-site binding. The inhibitory effect of dequalinium in the low nanomolar range makes this compound an extremely attractive lead compound for plausible development of therapeutics against human diseases involving chitinase-mediated pathologies.

Family-18 chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are enzymes that catalyze the degradation of chitin, a homopolymer of β-(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine that is the major structural component of crustaceans and arthropod shells and the cell walls of fungi. The enzymes are present in various organisms ranging from bacteria to animals, and their physiological functions depend on the structural roles of chitin substrates in different species. The catalytic domain of the known family-18 chitinases consists of an (α/β)8-barrel fold with a long, deep substrate-binding cleft containing six binding subsites −4, −3, −2, −1, +1, and +2, with the cleavage site located between subsites −1 and +1 (1Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C.

In recent years, family-18 chitinases have received much attention as therapeutic targets for certain human infectious and inflammatory diseases. Malaria, the first well demonstrated example, accounts for 300–500 million cases worldwide, from which approximately one million die annually, according to a World Health Organization report. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite. During the reproductive stage of their complex life cycles, the zygotes (so-called ookinetes) produce significant levels of chitinases to penetrate the chitin-containing wall of the mosquito midgut (6Langer R.C. Vinetz J.M. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 269-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This stage of development is crucial because it allows the parasites to be repetitively transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. Disruption of the transmission pathway by chitinase inhibitors could open up new avenues to control epidemic waves of malaria in high risk regions. Paradoxically, although chitin does not exist in mammals, a family-18 acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) 4The abbreviations used are: AMCaseacidic mammalian chitinasepNPp-nitrophenolateITCisothermal titration microcalorimetryDEQdequaliniumPROpropentofyllineCHEchelerythrineIDAidarubicinIMI2-(imidazolin-2-yl)-5-isothiocyanatobenzofuranPENpentoxifyllinSANsanguinarineDMABp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. has been described in the serum of patients with asthma and allergic diseases (7Donnelly L.E.

Biochemical and immunochemical studies in a mouse asthma model suggested that the AMCase may act as a selective activator of Th-2/IL-13-induced inflammatory responses (9Zhu Z. Zheng T. Homer R.J.

A number of chitinase inhibitors have been reported recently. The pseudotrisaccharide allosamidin, a natural product isolated from Streptomyces sp., was the first candidate to be identified (10Andersen O.A. Dixon M.J. Eggleston I.M. van Aalten D.M. Nat. Prod.

As an alternative, peptide-derived compounds have been a focal point of chitinase-based drug development after two cyclopentapeptides, argifin and argadin, were isolated from fungal strains FTD-0668 and FO-7314, respectively (19Omura S.

Because the high affinity suggests that pharmaceutical use might be possible, a series of argadin/argifin derivatives were further generated (24Andersen O.A. Nathubhai A. Dixon M.J.

One of the synthesized argifin analogs, referred to as MeTyr(Bn) for MePhe mutation, showed the highest affinity, with an IC50 of 11 nm toward AfChiB1 (25Dixon M.J. Nathubhai A. Andersen O.A. van Aalten D.M. Eggleston I.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2009; 7: 259-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, other peptidic derivatives were evaluated, for instance CI-4 (cyclo-(l-Arg-d-Pro)) (29Houston D.R. Synstad B. Eijsink V.G. Stark M.J. Eggleston I.M. van Aalten D.M. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 5713-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), disulfide-cyclized peptides (30Petter C. Scholz C. Wessner H. Hansen G. Henklein P. Watanabe T. Höhne W. J. Mol.

Acta. 2010; 1800: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These recognized compounds interacted with family-18 chitinases at submicromolar to micromolar concentrations. A high throughput screening technique was also applied to a drug library and identified pentoxifyllin as the most active inhibitor, with a Ki of 37 μm toward AfChiB1 (32Rao F.V. Andersen O.A. Vora K.A. Demartino J.A. van Aalten D.M. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In a selection of ∼50,000 xanthine derivatives from a virtual library screen, C2-dicaffeine was the most active, with a Ki of 2.8 μm toward the same chitinase (33Schüttelkopf A.W. Andersen O.A.

The most recently reported chitinase inhibitors are chitobiose and chitotriosethiazoline analogs, which had a Ki range of 0.15–30 μm toward SmChiA (34Macdonald J.M. Tarling C.A. Taylor E.J. Dennis R.J. Myers D.S. Knapp S. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2010; 49: 2599-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All of the above-mentioned reports emphasize the ongoing search for the most effective chitinase inhibitors. However, difficulties arising from the limited availability of the starting materials, complex chemistry, and/or insufficient affinity of the target compounds still hamper the current development of anti-chitinase agents that could satisfactorily meet pharmaceutical needs. Here, we describe the identification of nonpeptidic, easily produced, and highly effective chitinase inhibitors using high throughput screening of a commercially available drug library. All of the identified species, with the exception of pentoxifyllin, are novel in their reported activity against a family-18 chitinase (Vibrio harveyi chitinase A or VhChiA). The crystallographic data revealed two hydrophobic inhibitor binding areas in the substrate-binding cleft. The arrangement of these binding areas implied different binding mechanisms for the inhibitors, which could be confirmed by isothermal titration microcalorimetry. Dequalinium, the most promising compound obtained from this study, had a Ki of 70 nm. From the chemical biology point of view, this compound could serve as an excellent scaffold for generation of effective agents against human diseases including malaria, asthma, and inflammation. VhChiA mutant W275G was obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (35Suginta W. Songsiriritthigul C. Kobdaj A. Opassiri R. Svasti J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type and mutant W275G were expressed in Escherichia coli M15 cells as described by Pantoom et al. (36Pantoom S. Songsiriritthigul C. Suginta W. BMC Biochem. 2008; 21 (9:2)Google Scholar). Cells expressing recombinant chitinase were harvested and disrupted in an HC-2000 microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Lampertheim, Germany). For purification, the crude enzyme obtained after final centrifugation was purified using affinity chromatography on a gravity-fed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (5 × 1 ml; Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), followed by a HisTrapTM HP column (5 × 1 ml; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) connected to an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). The eluted fractions were pooled and then subjected to several rounds of membrane centrifugation using Vivaspin-20 ultrafiltration membrane concentrators (Mr 10,000 cut-off; Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) for a complete removal of imidazole and for concentrating the proteins. Potential chitinase inhibitors were screened from the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany). The general set-up of the primary screen is described elsewhere (37Prinz H. Schönichen A. J. Chem. Biol. 2008; 1: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, 5 μl of 1 mm substrate pNP-GlcNAc2 were added to 5 μl of VhChiA wild-type preincubated with 200 μm of the respective inhibitor. The buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.025% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Formation of pNP was detected by absorbance measurement at 405 nm (A405). The reaction rate without enzyme was taken as 0% activity and without inhibitor to 100% activity. Dose-response curves of inhibitors obtained from initial screen were carried out using the pNP assay (36Pantoom S. Songsiriritthigul C. Suginta W. BMC Biochem. 2008; 21 (9:2)Google Scholar) or DMAB assay (38Boller. T. Mauch F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 430-435Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For the pNP assay, a 2-fold dilution series of different inhibitors was incubated for 10 min with 0.25 μm VhChiA in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm ammonium acetate and 0.025% (v/v) Triton X-100 before the substrate was added to a final concentration of 125 μm. The progress of the reaction (A405) was monitored continuously at 27 °C for 16 min in a TecanGENios Pros Microplate Reader (MTX Lab Systems Inc., Vienna, VA). The slope obtained from a linear portion of the reaction progress curve was taken as the initial velocity using the standard calibration curve of pNP (8–500 μm). It is worth mentioning that the VhChiA mutant W275G exhibited very low activity toward pNP-GlcNAc2 but reasonable activity toward pNP-GlcNAc3. Hence, pNP-GlcNAc3 was used as the substrate of choice for determining the IC50 values of W275G mutant. Dose-response curves were also obtained from the DMAB method (38Boller. T. Mauch F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 430-435Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar), by which N-acetylhexosamines are quantitatively determined from chitohexaose hydrolysis. With this assay, the reaction mixture was titrated with a 2-fold dilution series of each inhibitor to obtain a concentration range of 1 nm to 1 mm. The reaction mixtures (500 μl), containing 500 μm substrate, 50 μg of native enzyme or 200 μg of mutant, and 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, were incubated at 37 °C in a Thermomixer Comfort (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). After 15 min of incubation, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. A 200-μl aliquot was then taken for spectophotometric assay of the released amino sugars, absorbance at 585 nm being converted to molar concentrations using a standard calibration curve of GlcNAc2 (0–875 μm). The dose-response curves were constructed from the nonlinear four-parameter algorithmic fit available in the Prism v5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), yielding IC50 values and Hill coefficients. The purified wild-type VhChiA (0.25 μm) was titrated with different concentrations of the inhibitors (5 nm to 100 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were monitored directly in a LS-50 fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer (Thailand) Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and emission intensities were collected over 300–450 nm with the excitation and emission slit widths being kept at 5 nm. Each protein spectrum was corrected for the buffer spectrum. The fluorescence intensity data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression function available in Prism v5.0. ITC experiments were carried out using the ITC-200 system (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Measurements of the wild-type VhChiA were carried out at 25 °C with stirring speed 1,000 rpm. After the baseline was set with distilled water, 4 μl of 250 μm dequalinium (DEQ) or 500 μm SAN and PEN was injected into the 300-μl calorimeter cell containing 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 25 μm enzyme. The injections were repeated 10 times over 90-s intervals. The background was measured by injecting the inhibitor into the cell containing only buffer. ITC experiments with the mutated VhChiA were performed as described for the wild-type enzyme but with higher concentrations of the reaction components (100 μm of the mutated enzyme, 1 mm DEQ, or 2 mm SAN and PEN). All of the measurements of mutant W275G were conducted at 18 °C. After subtracting the background, titration curves were fitted using the algorithms supplied by Microcal v7.0. The measured enthalpy changes as a function of ligand concentrations can give information on the binding enthalpy (amplitude and direction of the change), binding affinity (maximal slope of the sigmoid part), and number of sites (position of the inflection point relative to the protein concentration). For Scheme 2 fits, we fixed N1 = N2 = 1. The parameter values listed in supplemental Table S2 are derived from multiparameter fitting, using the simplest theoretical models that adequately fit the data; nevertheless, they must be viewed with caution, because the parameters cannot be fitted independently. When one of these correlated parameters is fixed at an arbitrary value, the other parameters may adjust to new values without decreasing the quality of the fit. Gibb's free energy (ΔG) and the entropy change (ΔS) can be calculated from the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the binding constant K: ΔG = ΔH − TΔS = −R × T × ln(K), where R represents the gas constant (1.98 cal K−1 mol−1), and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin (K). Crystallization screenings of the native VhChiA were performed at 22 °C using the commercially available Crystal Screen HR2–110, Crystal Screen HR2–112 (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA), and JBScreen HTS II (Jena Bioscience GmbH, Jena, Germany). Crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method in a hanging drop, followed by microseeding under two different conditions: 1) 16% (w/v) PEG 4000, 21% (v/v) propanol, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6; and 2) 1.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystallization of the mutant W275G was carried out using the same techniques as described for the native enzyme. However, single crystals were obtained only in 26% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Crystal complexes of wild-type VhChiA with the inhibitors DEQ and propentofylline (PRO) were obtained by co-crystallization using 400 μm inhibitors, whereas the complexes with other inhibitors were obtained by soaking the native crystals with 5–15 mm inhibitors in the corresponding mother liquor at 22 °C for 16 h. All of the crystal complexes of mutant W275G were obtained by soaking as described for wild type. Afterward, the crystals were immersed in a cryoprotectant consisting of the reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol for 5–10 s and then picked up in a loop and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For some of the crystals, blocking the cryostream for a few seconds (annealing) improved the diffraction quality considerably. X-ray diffraction data of most of the chitinase complexes were collected at the beamline PX-II of the Swiss Light Source in Villigen, Switzerland, using a MAR Research CCD detector. Some data sets were collected on a BrukerMicrostar rotating anode generator (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with Bruker Helios and Xenocs Fox mirrors and a MAR Research DTB image plate detector. Initial data processing was conducted with the program XDS (39Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). For crystals with a previously unknown space group, molecular replacement was employed to obtain phase information using the program MOLREP from the CCP4 suite (40Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure of the apoform of native VhChiA was solved using the published structure of the VhChiA mutant E315M in complex with GlcNAc6 (Protein Data Bank code 3b9a) as a search model. Subsequently, the final model of native VhChiA was employed to obtain the phases of all data sets of the VhChiA-inhibitor complexes. Rigid body fitting followed by restrained refinement were performed in REFMAC, available in the CCP4 suite. Model building was done in COOT (41Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Cryst. 2004; D60: 2126-2132Crossref Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). The molecular topologies of the inhibitors were created using Maestro and the PRODRG server (42Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Cryst. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar), and the inhibitors were modeled into the corresponding 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps. The further refinement resulted in the final models described in supplemental Table S1. The geometry of each final model was verified by PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (44Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The figures were generated using PYMOL and LIGPLOT (45Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Screening of compound libraries requires an assay that is technically simple and not prone to artifacts. Chitinase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically from the generation of p-nitrophenolate from the substrate pNP-GlcNAc2 (or pNP-GlcNAc3 in the case of W275G) (hereafter referred to as the pNP assay). Because the phenolate anion is only formed at neutral or basic pH values, the enzymatic hydrolysis was performed at pH 7.5, although the optimum pH for VhChiA is between 5.5 and 6.0. Screening of the Sigma Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds identified nine hits of 1,280. These were subjected to further screening using the DMAB assay, which measures the amount of amino sugars (here only N-acetylhexosamines) liberated from the substrate GlcNAc6. Two of the initial hits were not confirmed, because their IC50 values were above 1 mm. Other compounds, including chelerythrine (CHE), dequalinium (DEQ), idarubicin (IDA), 2-(imidazolin-2-yl)-5-isothiocyanatobenzofuran (IMI), pentoxifyllin (PEN), propentofylline (PRO), and sanguinarine (SAN), displayed IC50 values less than 100 μm in both DMAB and pNP assays. These were selected for more detailed studies. The IC50 values obtained from both assays are listed in Table 1; for chemical structures, see Fig. 1. It is notable that PRO and PEN are methylxanthine derivatives, and PEN is the only compound that had been reported earlier to inhibit the AfChiB1 activity, with a Ki of 37 μm (IC50 = 126 μm) (32Rao F.V.

Pantoom S. Aguda A.H. Robinson R.C. Suginta W. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 162: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) had already suggested that Trp-275 and Trp-397 are important for maintaining the molecular interactions with the substrate around subsites +1 and +2. According to the six substrate-binding subsites identified previously for VhChiA by Songsiriritthigul et al. (46Songsiriritthigul C. Pantoom S. Aguda A.H. Robinson R.C. Suginta W. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 162: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the glycone part is assumed to cover subsites −4, −3, and −2, whereas the aglycone part covers the product sites or subsites +1 and +2. Subsite −1 is not included, because it is located at the bottom of the substrate-binding cleft and did not at all interact with the inhibitors reported in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis data revealed that both residues are crucial for the binding selectivity toward short chain substrates, such as tetra-, penta-, and hexachitooligosaccharides (35Suginta W. Songsiriritthigul C. Kobdaj A. Opassiri R. Svasti J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, crystallization trials of the previously described mutants (both W275G and W397F) were made. However, only the mutant W275G could be crystallized. The availability of the crystal complexes of W275G helped to evaluate how Trp-275 contributes to the binding affinity of the enzyme to the identified inhibitors. Crystals of wild-type VhChiA could be obtained from either PEG solution at pH 5.6 or ammonium sulfate solution at pH 8.5 so that solubility problems, encountered with some inhibitors, could be circumvented by choosing the more suitable mother liquor for soaking and/or co-crystallization. The space groups of the wild-type were P21 with two different unit cells, thus allowing detailed analysis of the effect of crystal packing on inhibitor binding. On the other hand, all of the complexes of mutant W275G crystallized in the same space group (P212121) and unit cell as the previously determined VhChiA E315Q mutant (Pr"

Kovar H. Paulussen M. Randall R.L. Schuck A. Teot L.A. Juergens H. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The genetic hallmark of EFTs is a reciprocal translocation between the N terminus of the EWS gene and the C terminus of one of five ETS transcription factor family members: FLI1, ERG, ETV-1, ETV4, or FEV (2Turc-Carel C. Philip I. Berger M.P. Philip T. Lenoir G. C. R. Seances Acad. Sci. III. 1983; 296: 1101-1103PubMed Google Scholar, 3Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. et al.Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Forced expression of EWS/FLI1 results in transformation and tumorigenesis in NIH (National Institutes of Health) 3T3 cells (4Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When either the EWS or FLI1 domains are deleted, transformation is lost (5May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Also, when EWS/FLI1 expression is reduced via RNAi, EFT cell lines typically undergo growth arrest (6Dohjima T. Lee N.S. Li H. Ohno T. Rossi J.J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 811-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Matsunobu T. Tanaka K. Nakamura T. Nakatani F. Sakimura R. Hanada M. Li X. Okada T. Oda Y. Tsuneyoshi M. Iwamoto Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data have bolstered the consensus view that EWS/ETS fusions are necessary both for EFT formation and for continued growth.Functions of normal EWS and ETS proteins have molded current views of how EWS/ETS fusions promote cellular transformation. ETS proteins belong to a well characterized family of winged helix-loop-helix transcription factors that are related through a highly conserved 85-amino acid ETS domain. They typically work by forming heteromeric complexes with other transcription factors and can act as either transcription activators or repressors. The ETS domain mediates site-specific DNA binding, recognizing the GGA(A/T) consensus sequence as well as facilitating protein-protein interactions (8Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar, 9Karim F.D. Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C.

The ETS proteins are involved in a wide variety of functions that include cellular proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle control, development, and tumorigenesis (8Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2708-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a result of chromosomal translocation, the normal N terminus of FLI1 is replaced by N-terminal sequences from EWS. However, in all EFT fusions, the ETS domain is invariably present.EWS is a member of the ubiquitously expressed FET family of proteins, consisting of FUS (TLS), EWS, and TAF15 (hTAFII68). The N terminus of these proteins, which is retained in EFT fusion proteins, is a highly disordered peptide consisting of a series of degenerate repeats with a consensus sequence of NSYGQQS (14Ng K.P. Potikyan G. Savene R.O. Denny C.T. Uversky V.N. Lee K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This domain can act as a potent transcriptional activator in heterologous model systems (15May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The C terminus of this family, which is not present in EFT fusions, consists of an RNA-binding domain and several RGG-box domains. Although the functions of FET proteins have yet to be completely elucidated, evidence of interactions with TFIID, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (16Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 17Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and elements of the RNA splicing machinery (18Janknecht R. Gene. 2005; 363: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) indicate that these proteins may play a role in transcription and/or mRNA splicing.Given this information, the prevailing theory is that EWS/FLI1 causes transformation by acting as an aberrant transcription factor. Much of this theory is on the basis of the replacement of the FLI1 activation domain with the more potent EWS activation domain, whereas the FLI1 DNA-binding domain remains intact and functional. EWS/FLI1 has been shown to bind directly to the promoters of several of its target genes and is also able to modulate gene expression in reporter assays (20Cironi L. Riggi N. Provero P. Wolf N. Suvà M.L. Suvà D. Kindler V. Stamenkovic I. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Beauchamp E. Bulut G. Abaan O. Chen K. Merchant A. Matsui W. Endo Y. Rubin J.S. Toretsky J. Uren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9074-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, EWS/FLI1 retains the ability of native EWS to interact with Pol II (22Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, the explicit molecular mechanisms through which EWS/ETS fusions modulate gene expression remain ill defined.Previous microarray and ChIP experiments have identified several direct targets of EWS/FLI1 in both human and murine cell lines. Uridine phosphorylase (Upp) was identified as a direct target gene necessary for tumorigenesis that is up-regulated by EWS/FLI1 in NIH 3T3 cells (23Deneen B. Hamidi H. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4268-4274PubMed Google Scholar). Although most research has focused on up-regulated genes, there are actually more genes repressed by EWS/FLI1 in microarray analysis. In NIH 3T3 cells, thrombospondin 2 (Tsp2) is a direct target gene of EWS/FLI1, and several of its binding sites are present in the Tsp2 promoter (24Potikyan G. Savene R.O. Gaulden J.M. France K.A. Zhou Z. Kleinerman E.S. Lessnick S.L. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6675-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Forced expression of thrombospondins antagonized EFT tumor growth in a murine model system, confirming the potential biologic impact of down-regulated target genes. In EFT cell lines, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), an important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis, has been shown to be directly down-regulated by EWS/FLI1 (25Prieur A. Tirode F. Cohen P. Delattre O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7275-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Using these previously identified direct target genes in well characterized cellular model systems, we now find that EWS/ETS fusions can modulate target gene expression through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.DISCUSSIONFor the last 15 years, the hypothesis that EWS/FLI1 transforms cells by acting as an aberrant transcription factor has stood. However, trying to mechanistically dissect how these fusion proteins function at a molecular genetic level has been notoriously difficult. With this in mind, we began our investigation from a broad perspective by querying whether EWS/FLI1 regulated target genes at a transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. To do this, we compared the levels of mRNA and pre-mRNA of EWS/FLI1 direct target genes in both murine and human model systems. Our results in both systems fit the view that EWS/FLI1 can modulate target gene expression both at the level of transcript synthesis and at the level of mRNA degradation.The strategy of using pre-mRNA levels as a proxy for new transcript synthesis has been previously validated by other investigators. However, this approach has limitations. First, because pre-mRNA levels are assayed by qRT-PCR using site-specific primers spanning intron-exon borders, it assumes that EWS/FLI1 does not significantly alter splicing rates at each specific location. Second, it is well known that for each gene there is intron-to-intron variability in splicing rates. This makes it difficult to derive quantitative meaning from comparisons of pre-mRNA and mRNA levels. For example, EWS/FLI1 down-regulates IGFBP3 mRNA levels 40-fold more than pre-mRNA levels in A673 cells. However, this difference can only be interpreted qualitatively. Although both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is occurring, the relative proportion of each mechanism cannot be gleaned from this assay.To gain further insight into transcript synthesis dynamics of EWS/FLI1 target genes, Pol II ChIP analyses were performed. The relative low level of enrichment of Pol II at the promoters of Upp and Tsp2 in NIH 3T3 cells and IGFBP3 in EFT cell lines when compared with GAPDH suggests that with or without EWS/FLI1, these genes are being transcribed at modest rates. Despite showing an almost 8-fold increase in Upp pre-mRNA in response to EWS/FLI1 in NIH 3T3 cells, there was no significant increase in Pol II occupancy. This suggests that in this cellular context, EWS/FLI1 may be exerting its effect on Upp at stages distal to recruitment of Pol II such as promoter escape, elongation rate, or movement through pause sites.In contrast to Upp, we found that for down-regulated target genes, EWS/FLI1 did alter promoter Pol II occupancy in both NIH 3T3 and EFT model systems. Although they were reproducible, the differences in Pol II occupancy were small, ∼3.5-fold for Tsp2 in NIH 3T3 cells and about 2-fold for IGFBP3 in EFT cell lines. EWS/FLI1 may also change the Pol II occupancy within the IGFBP3 coding region in A4573 cells, but the changes were near the limit of detectability. Because of the lower level of IGFBP3 Pol II ChIP enrichment in A673 cells, we were unable to determine the level of Pol II occupancy in the IGFBP3 coding region. Together with our pre-mRNA analyses, these data suggest that EWS/FLI1 down-regulates some target genes through a decrease in transcript synthesis.Although transcript synthesis may be playing a role in dictating the steady-state levels of EWS/FLI1 down-regulated targets, our pre-mRNA studies suggested that additional regulatory mechanisms might be at work as well. We confirmed this by finding that in A673 cells, EWS/FLI1 decreased the half-life of IGFBP3 transcripts by almost 3-fold. Although there was considerable experiment-to-experiment variation, the decrement in half-life was clearly statistically significant. The relatively high degree of variation is probably due to the serial manipulations needed in our model system, EFT cells first being lentivirally transduced with shRNA constructs and then treated with α-Amanitin. By sequentially coupling these two procedures, the net effect on overall variability of the assay is cumulative.When we tried to perform similar analyses with the A4573 EFT cell line, we were unable to obtain consistent results. This may be due to the fact that A4573 cells, like most EFT cell lines, undergo growth arrest in response to EWS/FLI1 knockdown. Factoring in this additional parameter could have increased the overall variability of the assay to the point that it was no longer interpretable. Alternatively, half-life modulation of EWS/FLI1-down-regulated target genes may take time to develop fully. Qualitatively comparing the change in IGFBP3 pre-mRNA and mRNA levels in response to EWS/FLI1 knockdown in the two EFT cell lines suggests that this might be true. Although the change in pre-mRNA in both cell lines was about 10-fold, IGFBP3 mRNA changed ∼30-fold in A4573 cells that by necessity were harvested 2 days after EWS/FLI1 knockdown, whereas an over 300-fold change was found in A673 cells that could be harvested 2 weeks after knockdown. In effect, the ability of A673 cells to survive in tissue culture with greatly reduced levels of endogenous EWS/FLI1, allowed us to uncover an additional mechanism of target gene modulation.On a mechanistic level, the loss of repression of IGFBP3 in A673 cells expressing an shRNA construct targeting endogenous EWS/FLI1 can be reestablished by transducing EWS/FLI1, which drives down IGFBP3 mRNA levels. However, neither transduction of EWS nor ETS EWS/FLI1 mutants were able to fully repress IGFBP3 to the extent seen with the wild-type fusion. This suggests that both these domains play functional roles in this process, perhaps by promoting protein-protein and DNA binding interactions through the EWS and ETS domains, respectively. The fact that IGFBP3 levels consistently increased in cells transduced with the EWS/FLI1(TPM) construct also suggests that this mutant might be acting in a dominant negative fashion by sequestering factors involved with EWS/FLI1 target gene repression.There are multiple ways through which cells can regulate transcript degradation rates, ranging from modulating components of the mRNA metabolism machinery to altering expression of specific microRNAs. For example, EWS/FLI1 has been shown to down-regulate miRNA145 in human pediatric mesenchymal stem cells (38Riggi N. Suvà M.L. De Vito C. Provero P. Stehle J.C. Baumer K. Cironi L. Janiszewska M. Petricevic T. Suvà D. Tercier S. Joseph J.M. Guillou L. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 916-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although explicitly defining the components through which EWS/FLI1 modulates target gene half-life is beyond the scope of this manuscript, such investigations will depend on having well characterized EFT model systems that can exist in the absence of EWS/FLI1 for more than 1 or 2 days. This will be a challenge.Our work suggest that EWS/FLI1 may be able to induce large gene expression changes by causing smaller alterations in multiple stages of gene regulation. The regulation of casein by prolactin is a case in point of such synergy (40Guyette W.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Cell. 1979; 17: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Prolactin was able to up-regulate casein mRNA 6–12-fold but only increased casein transcription by 2- to 4-fold. On further investigation, the authors also found that prolactin increased casein mRNA half-life and concluded that both mechanisms were necessary for proper regulation.EWS/FLI1 may work in a similarly multifaceted manner, at least for some down-regulated target genes. From a pragmatic point of view, this is not a welcoming prospect. Studying multiple regulatory mechanisms, each with a limited dynamic response to EWS/FLI1, will certainly be more challenging than investigating a single mode of action with a large dynamic range. If indeed EWS/FLI1 is working via multiple molecular mechanisms, effective therapeutic targeting of this fusion could prove to be difficult. The key to meeting these challenges will be to devise better EFT model systems in which EWS/FLI1 target gene modulation can be studied at multiple mechanistic levels.

Kovar H. Paulussen M. Randall R.L. Schuck A. Teot L.A. Juergens H. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The genetic hallmark of EFTs is a reciprocal translocation between the N terminus of the EWS gene and the C terminus of one of five ETS transcription factor family members: FLI1, ERG, ETV-1, ETV4, or FEV (2Turc-Carel C. Philip I. Berger M.P. Philip T. Lenoir G. C. R. Seances Acad. Sci. III. 1983; 296: 1101-1103PubMed Google Scholar, 3Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. et al.Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Forced expression of EWS/FLI1 results in transformation and tumorigenesis in NIH (National Institutes of Health) 3T3 cells (4Thompson A.D. Teitell M.A. Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5506-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When either the EWS or FLI1 domains are deleted, transformation is lost (5May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Also, when EWS/FLI1 expression is reduced via RNAi, EFT cell lines typically undergo growth arrest (6Dohjima T. Lee N.S. Li H. Ohno T. Rossi J.J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 811-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Matsunobu T. Tanaka K. Nakamura T. Nakatani F. Sakimura R. Hanada M. Li X. Okada T. Oda Y. Tsuneyoshi M. Iwamoto Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data have bolstered the consensus view that EWS/ETS fusions are necessary both for EFT formation and for continued growth.Functions of normal EWS and ETS proteins have molded current views of how EWS/ETS fusions promote cellular transformation. ETS proteins belong to a well characterized family of winged helix-loop-helix transcription factors that are related through a highly conserved 85-amino acid ETS domain. They typically work by forming heteromeric complexes with other transcription factors and can act as either transcription activators or repressors. The ETS domain mediates site-specific DNA binding, recognizing the GGA(A/T) consensus sequence as well as facilitating protein-protein interactions (8Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar, 9Karim F.D. Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Gunther C.V. Nye J.A. et al.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ETS proteins are involved in a wide variety of functions that include cellular proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle control, development, and tumorigenesis (8Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 327-334PubMed Google Scholar, 10Papas T.S. Bhat N.K. Spyropoulos D.D. Mjaatvedt A.E. Vournakis J. Seth A. Watson D.K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2708-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As a result of chromosomal translocation, the normal N terminus of FLI1 is replaced by N-terminal sequences from EWS. However, in all EFT fusions, the ETS domain is invariably present.EWS is a member of the ubiquitously expressed FET family of proteins, consisting of FUS (TLS), EWS, and TAF15 (hTAFII68). The N terminus of these proteins, which is retained in EFT fusion proteins, is a highly disordered peptide consisting of a series of degenerate repeats with a consensus sequence of NSYGQQS (14Ng K.P. Potikyan G. Savene R.O. Denny C.T. Uversky V.N. Lee K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This domain can act as a potent transcriptional activator in heterologous model systems (15May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The C terminus of this family, which is not present in EFT fusions, consists of an RNA-binding domain and several RGG-box domains. Although the functions of FET proteins have yet to be completely elucidated, evidence of interactions with TFIID, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (16Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 17Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and elements of the RNA splicing machinery (18Janknecht R. Gene. 2005; 363: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) indicate that these proteins may play a role in transcription and/or mRNA splicing.Given this information, the prevailing theory is that EWS/FLI1 causes transformation by acting as an aberrant transcription factor. Much of this theory is on the basis of the replacement of the FLI1 activation domain with the more potent EWS activation domain, whereas the FLI1 DNA-binding domain remains intact and functional. EWS/FLI1 has been shown to bind directly to the promoters of several of its target genes and is also able to modulate gene expression in reporter assays (20Cironi L. Riggi N. Provero P. Wolf N. Suvà M.L. Suvà D. Kindler V. Stamenkovic I. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Beauchamp E. Bulut G. Abaan O. Chen K. Merchant A. Matsui W. Endo Y. Rubin J.S. Toretsky J. Uren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9074-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, EWS/FLI1 retains the ability of native EWS to interact with Pol II (22Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, the explicit molecular mechanisms through which EWS/ETS fusions modulate gene expression remain ill defined.Previous microarray and ChIP experiments have identified several direct targets of EWS/FLI1 in both human and murine cell lines. Uridine phosphorylase (Upp) was identified as a direct target gene necessary for tumorigenesis that is up-regulated by EWS/FLI1 in NIH 3T3 cells (23Deneen B. Hamidi H. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4268-4274PubMed Google Scholar). Although most research has focused on up-regulated genes, there are actually more genes repressed by EWS/FLI1 in microarray analysis. In NIH 3T3 cells, thrombospondin 2 (Tsp2) is a direct target gene of EWS/FLI1, and several of its binding sites are present in the Tsp2 promoter (24Potikyan G. Savene R.O. Gaulden J.M. France K.A. Zhou Z. Kleinerman E.S. Lessnick S.L. Denny C.T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6675-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Forced expression of thrombospondins antagonized EFT tumor growth in a murine model system, confirming the potential biologic impact of down-regulated target genes. In EFT cell lines, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), an important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis, has been shown to be directly down-regulated by EWS/FLI1 (25Prieur A. Tirode F. Cohen P. Delattre O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7275-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Using these previously identified direct target genes in well characterized cellular model systems, we now find that EWS/ETS fusions can modulate target gene expression through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2094382262,"SHP2 is a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway downstream of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases. One of the proposed mechanisms involving SHP2 in this context is to dephosphorylate and inactivate inhibitors of the Ras/ERK pathway. Two protein families bearing a unique, common domain, Sprouty and SPRED proteins, are possible candidates because they have been reported to inhibit the Ras/ERK pathway upon FGF activation. We tested whether any of these proteins are likely substrates of SHP2. Our findings indicate that Sprouty2 binds to the C-terminal tail of SHP2, which is an unlikely substrate binding site, whereas SPRED proteins bind to the tyrosine phosphatase domain that is known to be the binding site for its substrates. Overexpressed SHP2 was able to dephosphorylate SPREDs but not Sprouty2. Finally, we found two tyrosine residues on SPRED1 that are required, when phosphorylated, to inhibit Ras/ERK activation and identified Tyr-420 as a specific dephosphorylation target of SHP2. The evidence obtained indicates that SPRED1 is a likely substrate of SHP2, whose tyrosine dephosphorylation is required to attenuate the inhibitory action of SPRED1 in the Ras/ERK pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2085030105,"Hemoglobin (Hb) E (β-Glu26Lys) remains an enigma in terms of its contributions to red blood cell (RBC) pathophysiological mechanisms; for example, EE individuals exhibit a mild chronic anemia, and HbE/β-thalassemia individuals show a range of clinical manifestations, including high morbidity and death, often resulting from cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine and evaluate structural and functional consequences of the HbE mutation that might account for the pathophysiology. Functional studies indicate minimal allosteric consequence to both oxygen and carbon monoxide binding properties of the ferrous derivatives of HbE. In contrast, redox-sensitive reactions are clearly impacted as seen in the following: 1) the ∼2.5 times decrease in the rate at which HbE catalyzes nitrite reduction to nitric oxide (NO) relative to HbA, and 2) the accelerated rate of reduction of aquometHbE by L-cysteine (L-Cys). Sol-gel encapsulation studies imply a shift toward a higher redox potential for both the T and R HbE structures that can explain the origin of the reduced nitrite reductase activity of deoxyHbE and the accelerated rate of reduction of aquometHbE by cysteine. Deoxy- and CO HbE crystal structures (derived from crystals grown at or near physiological pH) show loss of hydrogen bonds in the microenvironment of βLys-26 and no significant tertiary conformational perturbations at the allosteric transition sites in the R and T states. Together, these data suggest a model in which the HbE mutation, as a consequence of a relative change in redox properties, decreases the overall rate of Hb-mediated production of bioactive NO."
https://openalex.org/W1965605636,"Resistance to antibiotics is a problem not only in terms of healthcare but also biodefense. Engineering of resistance into a human pathogen could create an untreatable biothreat pathogen. One such pathogen is Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.

IntroductionAntibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing problem in the fight against microbial disease. It is a major public health issue, where naturally resistant strains are emerging against all classes of antibiotics. In addition, genetic engineering has raised the specter that resistance could be engineered into an organism to create an untreatable biothreat pathogen. Current bactericidal antibiotics inhibit only a few targets: DNA, RNA, cell wall, or protein synthesis (1Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Collins J.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), and as such, there is a need to identify new targets against which antimicrobial compounds could be developed.Three species of Yersinia are known to be pathogenic for man; Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are gastrointestinal pathogens, whereas Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis is considered to be a clonal derivative of Y. pseudotuberculosis (2Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) but is awarded species designation due to the severity of the disease it causes. The infectivity of Y. pestis by the aerosol route, the acute disease, and high associated mortality rate meant that plague attracted attention as a potential bioweapon in the offensive biological weapons programs of the last century and is still an agent of concern in biodefense. Antibiotic-resistant strains are rare, but a multiple antibiotic-resistant strain was isolated in Madagascar (3Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Buchrieser C. Galimand M. Rahalison L. Chanteau S. Courvalin P. Carniel E. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and efficient transfer of resistance genes to Y. pestis in the midgut of the flea has been demonstrated (4Hinnebusch B.J. Rosso M.L. Schwan T.G. Carniel E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a need for novel effective therapeutics for use in treatment of plague.It is notable that the close relatives Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis cause remarkably different diseases yet are very closely genetically related (99% nucleotide identity for most shared genes), and data based on multiple locus sequence typing analysis suggest that Y. pestis diverged from Y. pseudotuberculosis only 1500–20,000 years ago (2Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The evolution from a mild intestinal pathogen into a systemic pathogen, which has repeatedly devastated the human race, has occurred in an eye blink of evolutionary time. A major step along this pathway appears to be the acquisition of two plasmids by Y. pestis. Pathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis retains a single plasmid (pCD1), whereas Y. pestis also possesses plasmids pMT1 and pPCP1. It is therefore widely accepted that Y. pestis was once a simple enteropathogen, and gene acquisition and loss allowed it to change its environmental niches and its lifestyle. The complete genome sequence of Y. pestis CO92 (biovar orientalis) was determined and revealed a highly fluid genome, with large inversions occurring between insertion sequence (IS) elements (5Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Thomson N.R. Titball R.W. Holden M.T. Prentice M.B. Sebaihia M. James K.D. Churcher C. Mungall K.L. Baker S. Basham D. Bentley S.D. Brooks K. Cerdeño-Tárraga A.M. Chillingworth T. Cronin A. Davies R.M. Davis P. Dougan G. Feltwell T. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Leather S. Moule S. Oyston P.C. Quail M. Rutherford K. Simmonds M. Skelton J. Stevens K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). A large number of pseudogenes are also present in the Y. pestis genome, disrupted by IS elements or by other mutations. These pseudogenes are thought to have been required for an enteropathogenic lifestyle but are now redundant. However, the close relationship between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis means that often the proteins in one organism retain the same role in the other. This allows us to gain insight into Yersinia virulence using the less pathogenic enteropathogen, which can then be followed up by focused efforts on the highly virulent plague bacillus.When considering novel antimicrobial development, ideally, a target will be common to a range of pathogens. We have previously reported a bioinformatic approach to identify genes more commonly found in pathogens than in non-pathogens (6Stubben C.J. Duffield M.L. Cooper I.A. Ford D.C. Gans J.D. Karlyshev A.V. Lingard B. Oyston P.C. de Rochefort A. Song J. Wren B.W. Titball R.W. Wolinsky M. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of the targets identified as potentially being of interest was ecotin. Ecotin is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits a range of serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (7Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we validated eco as an attenuating locus. We elucidated the crystal structure of ecotin in complex with activated bovine chymotrypsin and described the molecular basis for the serine protease inhibition by ecotin. These molecular details provide a useful platform on which to base further research into the development of novel therapeutics for plague.DISCUSSIONThe need for new antibiotics has become pressing in light of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of human pathogens. Development of such drugs is important in terms of not only healthcare but also biodefense. Y. pestis, the causative agent of plague, is an agent of concern in biodefense. One potential new target for the development of novel antimicrobials is the serine protease inhibitor ecotin. The gene encoding ecotin was found to be more common in the genomes of pathogens compared with non-pathogens, therefore identifying ecotin as a potential target (6Stubben C.J. Duffield M.L. Cooper I.A. Ford D.C. Gans J.D. Karlyshev A.V. Lingard B. Oyston P.C. de Rochefort A. Song J. Wren B.W. Titball R.W. Wolinsky M. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that eco is an attenuating locus in Y. pseudotuberculosis, identifying it as a potential target in this bacterium and the closely related bacterium Y. pestis. It has previously been postulated that ecotin plays a role in pathogenicity in other pathogens; the presence of ecotin in the E. coli periplasm led to the suggestion that ecotin acts to protect the bacterium from serine proteases in the intestines of the mammalian host (7Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As Y. pseudotuberculosis is also an enteric pathogen, it is possible that it plays a similar role in this organism. However, we observed attenuation after intravenous challenge, thus by-passing the intestines, and the gene is functional in Y. pestis, implying further functions in pathogenesis. Yersinia ecotin inhibits neutrophil elastase, and so there is a potential role for ecotin in protection against intracellular host immunity (23Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yersinia species are susceptible to killing by neutrophils, and ablation of neutrophils results in increased colonization (24Laws T.R. Davey M.S. Titball R.W. Lukaszewski R. Microbes Infect. 2010; 12: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, it is possible that the main function of ecotin in vivo is to protect Yersinia from neutrophil killing. It has been observed that E. coli ecotin enhances recovery following neutrophil elastase treatment (23Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Yersinia ecotin inhibits neutrophil elastase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, factor Xa, and thrombin (23Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pan-specificity is shared by E. coli ecotin (25Seymour J.L. Lindquist R.N. Dennis M.S. Moffat B. Yansura D. Reilly D. Wessinger M.E. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3949-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Ulmer J.S. Lindquist R.N. Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is thought to be partly facilitated by the presence of a methionine at the P1 position. Serine protease inhibitors traditionally have a target-specific residue at the P1 position, whereas a methionine is considered to be a good “all-rounder.” It has been suggested that the contribution of the secondary binding site to the free energy of the E. coli ecotin-trypsin complex (27McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) allows for the less than favorable methionine at the P1 site (28Gillmor S.A. Takeuchi T. Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).We have observed inhibition of chymotrypsin by Yersinia ecotin, and we have provided a structural basis for this observed inhibition. Ecotin inhibits chymotrypsin in a “substrate-like” fashion (32Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), and the Ki for Yersinia ecotin inhibition of chymotrypsin is <0.002 nm (23Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 100% sequence identity of ecotin across a range of species of Yersinia makes this structural result relevant to a range of Yersinia species, including Y. pestis, although inhibition of chymotrypsin may be less important for Y. pestis than for Y. pseudotuberculosis. We have shown that the Yersinia ecotin-chymotrypsin complex features a biologically relevant tetramer, in line with what is observed in a number of related structures. A number of structures of E. coli ecotin in complex with a target protease have identified the biologically significant unit as a tetramer that is formed when a dimer of ecotin binds two target proteases. In the structure of the E. coli ecotin-rat ionic trypsin complex, there is one tetramer per asymmetric unit (27McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (29Wang S.X. Esmon C.T. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10038-10046Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) created an E. coli ecotin mutant and solved the structure of the mutant in complex with thrombin, and the asymmetric unit in this structure is composed of half of the tetramer. The crystal packing in the Yersinia ecotin-chymotrypsin complex shown here has displayed the unique arrangement of the asymmetric unit, which contains two tetramers related by non-crystallographic symmetry. A key element of the biologically relevant tetramer is the ecotin dimer. Dimerization of ecotin provides a large surface area (17,802 Å2 for the Yersinia ecotin-chymotrypsin complex) that features two clefts into which two molecules of chymotrypsin can fit. This large surface area has meant that E. coli ecotin has attracted attention as a potential scaffold for engineering novel protease inhibitors (30Stoop A.A. Craik C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The primary interface between ecotin and chymotrypsin buries a large surface area. The buried surface area of 1927 Å2 is comparable with that of the related structures of E. coli ecotin-protease complexes: the primary interface of the ecotin-trypsin complex buries 2000 Å2 (27McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), that of the ecotin mutant-thrombin complex buries 2290 Å2 (29Wang S.X. Esmon C.T. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10038-10046Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the ecotin-crab collagenase complex buries 1950 Å2 at this interface (31Perona J.J. Tsu C.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5381-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ecotin binding loop on which the P1 site methionine resides is stabilized through binding to an inner loop. There is a disulfide bridge between the two loops anchored by a number of hydrogen bonds. The architecture of this binding loop is characteristic of that of the substrate-like family of serine protease inhibitors and their protease ligands (32Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonding characteristics of the P1 methionine residue are also characteristic of this type of inhibitor.Some specific comparisons can be made between the Yersinia ecotin-chymotrypsin primary interface and the related E. coli ecotin-protease interfaces. The Ki value for E. coli ecotin is also <0.002 nm (23Eggers C.T. Murray I.A. Delmar V.A. Day A.G. Craik C.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence, any structural differences between the E. coli and Y. pestis ecotins should not affect the ability to inhibit chymotrypsin. The Yersinia and E. coli ecotins share 70% identity and 79% similarity across the C-terminal 139 residues of the functional protein (Fig. 5). Key residues are conserved between E. coli and Yersinia ecotin residues at the primary interface, including the methionine residue at the P1 position. Hydrogen bonding features of the P1 residue in E. coli ecotin at the interface with chymotrypsin (Protein Data Bank code 1N8O) are also found in this structure and the related E. coli ecotin-rat anion trypsin structure (27McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Among the residues of ecotin at binding site 1, Ser-108–Pro-114 (P3–P4′) are conserved. Adjacent to this section is a glutamic acid residue (Glu-115) not present in E. coli ecotin, the side chain of which extends toward chymotrypsin in the Yersinia structure and makes contacts. The P6 serine of E. coli ecotin is substituted for a glutamine (Gln-105) in Yersinia ecotin, which contributes more to the solvation free energy gain upon complex formation than the equivalent serine and makes a potential hydrogen bond with chymotrypsin. Arg-78 on the inner loop of Yersinia ecotin shows potential hydrogen bonds in two of the four interfaces; it is replaced with a leucine residue in E. coli ecotin, which is not involved in hydrogen bonding. Asn-84 of Yersinia ecotin lies at the periphery of the residues involved in binding at binding site 1, extending this section in comparison with E. coli ecotin, where the substituted lysine makes no contacts with chymotrypsin.Ecotin is unique among serine protease inhibitors in that it makes an additional discrete interaction with the protease. In the absence of structural data for the secondary ecotin-chymotrypsin interaction, McGrath et al. (27McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) modeled 10 putative secondary site interactions for the E. coli ecotin-chymotrypsin complex, nine of which featured ecotin residues that are conserved between E. coli and Yersinia ecotins. However, our structural data (based on the structure of the Yersinia ecotin-chymotrypsin complex) show that only three of those hydrogen bonds are predicted correctly in the modeled structure.Various features of the ecotin-chymotrypsin structure reflect the inherent flexibility of ecotin. It can be seen that the solvation free energy gain upon complex formation for the primary and secondary interfaces varies throughout the asymmetric unit. There is a complementation process whereby the sum of the energy gain for the interfaces within each tetramer in the asymmetric unit is approximately the same; however, the distribution of energies across the interfaces within the tetramers varies: compare the solvation free energy gain upon complexation at the E1/C1 interface of −14.3 kcal/mol with that of the E1/C2 interface of −3.3 kcal/mol, with the equivalent primary and secondary interface values of −16.7 kcal/mol (E3/C3) and −0.7 kcal/mol (E3/C4) in the E3/E4/C3/C4 tetramer. It can be postulated that alterations in binding occur as a result of crystal packing and that the flexibility of ecotin allows the molecule to compensate for this by altering binding elsewhere, resulting in a stable tetrameric complex arrangement. Flexibility is a trait shared with E. coli ecotin, which has been characterized as an inherently flexible molecule (28Gillmor S.A. Takeuchi T. Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).CONCLUSIONSEcotin has been identified as a potential protein target for antimicrobial development, and we have validated the eco gene as an attenuating locus in Y. pseudotuberculosis, identifying that ecotin is a virulence factor for this bacterium. Ecotin contributes to Yersinia pathogenicity through its inhibition of host serine proteases, and the ecotin-chymotrypsin structure described represents an important host-pathogen interaction. The molecular details shown here will provide an adequate platform on which to base further research; for example, an inhibitor of the ecotin-protease interaction may reduce the pathogenicity of Y. pestis such that it has potential for development as a treatment for plague. IntroductionAntibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing problem in the fight against microbial disease. It is a major public health issue, where naturally resistant strains are emerging against all classes of antibiotics. In addition, genetic engineering has raised the specter that resistance could be engineered into an organism to create an untreatable biothreat pathogen. Current bactericidal antibiotics inhibit only a few targets: DNA, RNA, cell wall, or protein synthesis (1Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Collins J.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), and as such, there is a need to identify new targets against which antimicrobial compounds could be developed.Three species of Yersinia are known to be pathogenic for man; Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are gastrointestinal pathogens, whereas Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis is considered to be a clonal derivative of Y. pseudotuberculosis (2Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) but is awarded species designation due to the severity of the disease it causes. The infectivity of Y. pestis by the aerosol route, the acute disease, and high associated mortality rate meant that plague attracted attention as a potential bioweapon in the offensive biological weapons programs of the last century and is still an agent of concern in biodefense. Antibiotic-resistant strains are rare, but a multiple antibiotic-resistant strain was isolated in Madagascar (3Guiyoule A. Gerbaud G. Buchrieser C. Galimand M. Rahalison L. Chanteau S. Courvalin P. Carniel E. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and efficient transfer of resistance genes to Y. pestis in the midgut of the flea has been demonstrated (4Hinnebusch B.J. Rosso M.L. Schwan T.G. Carniel E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a need for novel effective therapeutics for use in treatment of plague.It is notable that the close relatives Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis cause remarkably different diseases yet are very closely genetically related (99% nucleotide identity for most shared genes), and data based on multiple locus sequence typing analysis suggest that Y. pestis diverged from Y. pseudotuberculosis only 1500–20,000 years ago (2Achtman M. Zurth K. Morelli G. Torrea G. Guiyoule A. Carniel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14043-14048Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The evolution from a mild intestinal pathogen into a systemic pathogen, which has repeatedly devastated the human race, has occurred in an eye blink of evolutionary time. A major step along this pathway appears to be the acquisition of two plasmids by Y. pestis. Pathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis retains a single plasmid (pCD1), whereas Y. pestis also possesses plasmids pMT1 and pPCP1. It is therefore widely accepted that Y. pestis was once a simple enteropathogen, and gene acquisition and loss allowed it to change its environmental niches and its lifestyle. The complete genome sequence of Y. pestis CO92 (biovar orientalis) was determined and revealed a highly fluid genome, with large inversions occurring between insertion sequence (IS) elements (5Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Thomson N.R. Titball R.W. Holden M.T. Prentice M.B. Sebaihia M. James K.D. Churcher C. Mungall K.L. Baker S. Basham D. Bentley S.D. Brooks K. Cerdeño-Tárraga A.M. Chillingworth T. Cronin A. Davies R.M. Davis P. Dougan G. Feltwell T. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Leather S. Moule S. Oyston P.C. Quail M. Rutherford K. Simmonds M. Skelton J. Stevens K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). A large number of pseudogenes are also present in the Y. pestis genome, disrupted by IS elements or by other mutations. These pseudogenes are thought to have been required for an enteropathogenic lifestyle but are now redundant. However, the close relationship between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis means that often the proteins in one organism retain the same role in the other. This allows us to gain insight into Yersinia virulence using the less pathogenic enteropathogen, which can then be followed up by focused efforts on the highly virulent plague bacillus.When considering novel antimicrobial development, ideally, a target will be common to a range of pathogens. We have previously reported a bioinformatic approach to identify genes more commonly found in pathogens than in non-pathogens (6Stubben C.J. Duffield M.L. Cooper I.A. Ford D.C. Gans J.D. Karlyshev A.V. Lingard B. Oyston P.C. de Rochefort A. Song J. Wren B.W. Titball R.W. Wolinsky M. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of the targets identified as potentially being of interest was ecotin. Ecotin is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits a range of serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (7Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we validated eco as an attenuating locus. We elucidated the crystal structure of ecotin in complex with activated bovine chymotrypsin and described the molecular basis for the serine protease inhibition by ecotin. These molecular details provide a useful platform on which to base further research into the development of novel therapeutics for plague.

FPR-prethrombin 1 (Pre 1), fragment 1 (F1), fragment 1.2 (F1.2), and FPR-thrombin produced no significant inhibition, demonstrating the requirement for all three ProT domains. Kinetics of inhibition of ProT activation by the inactive ProTS195A mutant were compatible with competitive inhibition as an alternate nonproductive substrate, although FPR-ProT deviated from this mechanism, implicating a more complex process. FPR-ProT exhibited ∼10-fold more potent anticoagulant activity compared with ProTS195A as a result of conformational changes in the ProT catalytic domain that induce a more proteinase-like conformation upon FPR labeling. Unlike ProT and ProTS195A, the pathway of FPR-ProT cleavage by prothrombinase was redirected from meizothrombin toward formation of the FPR-prethrombin 2 (Pre 2)·F1.2 inhibitory intermediate.

Platelets have long been thought to be the primary cellular surface for prothrombinase assembly. Activation of platelets results in redistribution of membrane phospholipids with increased exposure of PS on the outer membrane surface, crucial for assembly of coagulation factor activating complexes (27Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Assembly of prothrombinase on activated platelets results in an enhancement in the rate of thrombin formation similar to that obtained with optimal phospholipid vesicles (21Tracy P.B. Eide L.L.

Although the primary role of the endothelial cell layer lining blood vessels is to prevent clot formation and maintain normal flow through anticoagulant mechanisms, stimulation or injury of the endothelium can also provide a thrombogenic surface, which binds FXa (29Gajdusek C.

The cellular location of ProT activation during thrombosis in vivo has not been established, but it has been widely anticipated to be activated platelet surfaces. A model employing laser-induced focal damage to the vessel wall of cremaster arterioles in living mice has revealed several important aspects of the mechanism of thrombosis (34Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3355-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 35Falati S. Gross P. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B.C. Furie B. Nat.

Haemost. 2003; 1: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this model, both fibrin generation and initial platelet activation are thrombin-dependent and reflect tissue factor (TF)-initiated activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway (37Dubois C. Panicot-Dubois L. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B. Furie B.C. Blood. 2006; 107: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other mouse models of thrombosis, for example, the severe, ferric chloride-induced vessel wall injury, where the endothelium is denuded and initial platelet activation is induced by interaction of glycoprotein VI with exposed vessel wall collagen (37Dubois C. Panicot-Dubois L. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B. Furie B.C. Blood. 2006; 107: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Both vessel wall TF and microparticle borne TF participate in thrombus formation in the laser-injury model (38Chou J. Mackman N. Merrill-Skoloff G. Pedersen B. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 2004; 104: 3190-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Platelets accumulate at the site of injury; the platelet thrombus reaches maximal size between 90 and 120 s and then decreases. Fibrin accumulation begins essentially simultaneously with platelet deposition and is seen first at the vessel wall-platelet thrombus interface (35Falati S. Gross P. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B.C. Furie B. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 36Celi A. Merrill-Skoloff G. Gross P. Falati S. Sim D.S. Flaumenhaft R. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Thromb.

Med. 2003; 197: 1585-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Maximal fibrin deposition is achieved at about 100 s. Confocal microscopy studies confirm that fibrin accumulates primarily at the vessel wall-platelet interface and only partially colocalizes with the platelet thrombus (40Vandendries E.R. Hamilton J.R. Coughlin S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In Par4−/− mice, small platelet thrombi form rapidly but fail to grow and the platelets within this thrombus are activated very slowly. However, fibrin generation and deposition is normal in the Par4−/− mice (40Vandendries E.R. Hamilton J.R. Coughlin S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results challenge the view that the activated platelet membrane is the primary site of prothrombinase assembly in vivo and suggest an important role for activated endothelium or microparticles. Recent studies support a role of the endothelium in thrombus formation by demonstrating that endothelial cells are rapidly activated by localized laser injury before platelet accumulation, and provide a procoagulant surface for prothrombinase-generated thrombin (41Atkinson B.T. Jasuja R. Chen V.M. Nandivada P. Furie B. Furie B.C. Blood. 2010; 116: 4675-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present studies, examination of the inhibition of thrombin generation by a novel active site-blocked ProT derivative in vitro in plasma and in model systems of purified proteins provided new insight into the mechanism of ProT activation and the exosite-mediated mechanism of inhibition of coagulation by active site-labeled ProT. Understanding these mechanisms allowed us to interpret in vivo wide-field and confocal microscopy experiments with active site fluorescently labeled ProT to determine the dynamics of formation of sites of ProT localization during thrombosis in the laser injury murine model. C57BL/6J mice (4–6 weeks old; 13–17 g) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal experiments. Rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Fab fragments from CD41 antibody were generated using an ImmunoPure Fab Preparation kit from Pierce Biotechnology. The anti-CD41 Fab fragments were conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488-tetrafluorophenyl ester (Invitrogen). Human ProT, FXa, and thrombin were purified, active site-titrated, and characterized as described previously (42Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Human prethrombin 1 (Pre 1), prethrombin 2 (Pre 2), fragment 1 (F1), and fragment 1.2 (F1.2) were purified from products of ProT cleavage as described (13Anderson P.J. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Murine ProT (Hematologic Technologies) and human ProT and Pre 1 were inactivated with Nα-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-CH2Cl and labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 C2-maleimide (Invitrogen) using staphylocoagulase (47Panizzi P.

ProT, Pre 1, and Pre 2 inactivated with FPR-CH2Cl were prepared similarly. Human F1.2 (Hematologic Technologies) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 660-tetrafluorophenyl ester according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). CaCl2 (5 mm) was included in the reaction mixture to prevent labeling of the NH2 terminus necessary for maintaining the proper conformation of the Gla domain. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)−1 cm−1) and molecular weights (48Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G.

Thrombin and FXa concentrations were determined routinely using the chromogenic substrates d-Phe-l-pipecolyl-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide and Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, respectively. Concentrations of fluorescently labeled proteins were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Concentrations of ProT species in vivo in mice were calculated from the ratio of the dose in micrograms/g of mouse weight, divided by a blood volume to weight ratio of 0.078 ml/g (52van Zutphen L.F.M. Baumans V. Beynen A.C. Principles of Laboratory Animal Science. Elsevier, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar) and expressed in a molar concentration to allow, for example, FPR-ProT, FPR-Pre 1, and FPR-thrombin to be compared on the same molar scale. Human platelet-poor, mouse platelet-rich, platelet-poor, and human platelet-rich plasmas were prepared as described (53Tchaikovski S.N. van Vlijmen B.J. Rosing J. Tans G. J. Thromb.

Blood. 2003; 102: 1686-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human ProT-deficient plasma was purchased (George King Biomedical). Thrombin generation in plasma was monitored by calibrated automated thrombography (CAT), where the fluorescence enhancement accompanying hydrolysis of the low affinity fluorogenic substrate, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem), by thrombin was followed with time in a Fluoroskan Ascent® plate reader (Thermo Labsystems) (53Tchaikovski S.N. van Vlijmen B.J.

Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The fluorescence changes in plasma with time were transformed into thrombin concentration by the use of a calibrated thrombin solution measured in parallel. Thrombin generation curves were analyzed to obtain the phenomenological parameters (lag time, maximum thrombin concentration, time to maximum thrombin concentration, and the area under the curve, the endogenous thrombin potential) using ThrombinoscopeTM software (Thrombinoscope BV). Thrombin generation was initiated by addition of a mixture of calcium and fluorogenic substrate in the presence of either human recombinant TF (Dade Innovin®) or FXa (Enzyme Research Laboratories). In experiments with platelet-poor plasma, phospholipid vesicles were added. Dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC), dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (PS), and dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Vesicles (20% PS/60% PC/20% PE) were prepared as described (3Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Twenty μl of prewarmed 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.7 at 37 °C), 175 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin containing ProT was added to 40 μl of prewarmed buffer containing FVa, CaCl2, and phospholipid vesicles, and after 15 s, reactions were started by addition of 10 μl of FXa. When additional ProT derivatives were present, these were premixed with ProT to reach the desired final concentrations. Final concentrations were 5 mm CaCl2, 5 nm FVa, 1 μm phospholipid vesicles, 2 pm FXa, 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and ProT or its derivatives as indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots removed after 1 and 2 min of incubation at 37 °C were diluted into ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9 at 25 °C), 175 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml of ovalbumin. Thrombin was quantified from the rate of d-Phe-l-pipecolyl-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis and rates of ProT activation were calculated (3Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent values of Vmax, Km, and Ki were obtained by non-linear least-squares fitting of the competitive inhibition mechanism to the rates of ProT activation as function of inhibitor concentration obtained at three ProT concentrations (50, 150, and 1500 nm). Estimates of error in kinetic and binding parameters represent the 95% confidence interval. Titrations of 20 nm [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO3−) with ProT and its derivatives were performed with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer with excitation at 491 nm and emission at 520 nm (4 nm band pass), using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000, as described previously (12Anderson P.J.

Experiments were performed in 50 mm Hepes, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml of polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The results expressed as ΔF/Fo = (Fobs − Fo)/Fo) were analyzed by fitting the quadratic binding equation to obtain the dissociation constant (KD) and maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax/Fo), with the stoichiometric factor fixed at 1. Competitive binding of F1.2 to [6F]FPR-thrombin and native Pre 2 or FPR-Pre 2 were performed by titrations of the decrease in fluorescein fluorescence (495 nm excitation, 520 nm emission, 4 nm band pass) of [6F]FPR-thrombin in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations of native Pre 2 (3.5 and 10 μm) or FPR-Pre 2 (10 μm). Titrations in the absence and presence of competitors were fit simultaneously by the cubic equation for tight competitive binding to obtain the KD for F1.2 binding to [6F]FPR-thrombin and the KD for F1.2 binding to either native Pre 2 or FPR-Pre 2, with stoichiometric factors fixed at 1, as described previously (51Bock P.E.

Activation reactions containing 5.2 μm ProT, ProTS195A, or FPR-ProT, 50 μm PS/PC/PE vesicles, 60 μm dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide, 50 nm FVa, and 0.7 nm FXa were performed simultaneously at 37 °C, initiated by addition of ProT or ProT derivative. Reactions of ProTR271Q, ProTR320Q, and their FPR derivatives were done the same way except at 0.25 nm FXa. Pre 2 or FPR-Pre 2 cleavage by prothrombinase was performed with 2 μm Pre 2 or FPR-Pre 2 and 0.7 nm FXa. Reactions were sampled (40 μl) at different times and quenched by addition of 14 μl of 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 150 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml of polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 8.2, containing FPR-CH2Cl to give a final concentration of 250 μm. NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 125 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mm EDTA was then added, the samples were boiled for 2 min, centrifuged, and aliquots containing 4 μg of protein were loaded and developed on NuPage Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gels in NuPage MES SDS Running Buffer as described by Invitrogen. Gels were simultaneously stained for identical duration with the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 analog, Imperial protein stain (Pierce). Images were collected with an EDAS290 digital camera system (Kodak) and densitometry analysis was performed with ImageQuant TL software (GE Biosciences) using the rolling-ball method of integration and normalized to total protein staining in each lane. Fractional molar staining intensities of fProT = 1, fF1.2-A-chain = 0.59, fF1.2 = 0.47, fthrombin B-chain = 0.51, and fPre 2 = 0.43 were determined from the slopes of linear plots of density for purified proteins versus mole of protein loaded, and used to convert densities into relative molar concentrations.

Moreover, it has been shown that chronic jet lag leads to atrophy of the human temporal cortex and that light deprivation damages monoamine neurons, producing a depressive behavioral phenotype in rats (9Cho K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Gonzalez M.M. Aston-Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, in adulthood, diurnal BDNF rhythms seem to contribute to the regulation of particular brain functions. To date, the issues whether there are diurnal rhythms of BDNF (and/or NT-3) levels in the developing brain and how the rhythms contribute to brain development have not been well studied. brain-derived neurotrophic factor neurotrophin-3 light-dark cerebellum hippocampus neocortex suprachiasmatic nucleus visual cortex Bdnf gene-deficient Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 gene-deficient zeitgeber time transcription factor Tbr1 nuclear hormone receptor ROR protected least significant difference cAMP response element-binding protein methyl CpG binding protein 2. BDNF levels are low during the embryonic and/or early postnatal period and are enhanced with postnatal age in the majority of brain regions, whereas NT-3 levels are higher during the neonatal period as well as the embryonic period than in adulthood (11Kaisho Y. Shintani A. Nishida M. Fukumoto H. Igarashi K. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Semba R. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Generally, it is accepted that BDNF and NT-3 play their own important roles at specific periods and contribute to the development of brain structures and functions. Recently, on the other hand, it has been proposed that normal brain function and sleep generation are linked by common molecular systems and regulatory pathways (13Wulff K. Gatti S. Wettstein J.G. Foster R.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thus, there is now a reevaluation of the importance of normal sleep rhythms for normal brain development, although the association between sleep rhythms and brain functions has been debated for a long time. The sleep-wake cycle is controlled by the external LD cycle via the SCN, a target region of the optic nerves (14Ibuka N. Kawamura H. Brain Res. 1975; 96: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Moore R.Y. Sleep Med. 2007; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which indicates the importance of a normal external LD cycle for brain development. However, the molecules associated with the external LD cycle (or the sleep-wake cycle) and their effects on brain development are largely unknown. Regarding BDNF, it has been reported that sleep deprivation increases BDNF mRNA levels in neonatal rat brain and that constant dark rearing during the neonatal period reduces BDNF mRNA in the visual cortex (16Pollock G.S. Vernon E. Forbes M.E. Yan Q. Ma Y.T. Hsieh T. Robichon R. Frost D.O. Johnson J.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3923-3931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hairston I.S. Peyron C. Denning D.P. Ruby N.F. Flores J. Sapolsky R.M. Heller H.C. O'Hara B.F. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1586-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we found evidence for diurnal variation in BDNF levels in a majority of brain regions from 14-day-old rats and an inverse variation of NT-3 levels specifically in the NCX as well as in the visual cortex (VCX). We then focused on the NCX of 14-day-old rats. We first examined the effects of an abnormal LD cycle or of a disturbed sleep-wake cycle on BDNF and NT-3 levels and on synaptophysin expression in the NCX of rat pups. An abnormal LD cycle and a disturbed sleep-wake cycle have influence on not only BDNF and NT-3 levels but also on other biologically active molecules. Therefore, we subsequently analyzed synaptophysin expression in the NCX using genetic mutants, Bdnf gene-deficient (BDNF-KO) mice, at 10 days of age to confirm whether abnormal levels of BDNF really affect structural development of the NCX. Finally, because sleep and circadian rhythm disruption is frequently observed in patients with psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (13Wulff K. Gatti S. Wettstein J.G. Foster R.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), we investigated alterations of the diurnal rhythms of BDNF and NT-3 levels and synaptophysin expression in mutant mice with abnormal sleep-wake cycles and compared them with controls. For the model mice, Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 gene-deficient (CAPS2-KO) mice with an abnormal free-running rhythm and autistic-like phenotype were used at 14 days of age (18Sadakata T. Washida M. Iwayama Y. Shoji S. Sato Y. Ohkura T. Katoh-Semba R. Nakajima M. Sekine Y. Tanaka M. Nakamura K. Iwata Y. Tsuchiya K.J. Mori N. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Ichikawa H. Itohara S. Yoshikawa T. Furuichi T. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this work, we report that alteration of BDNF and NT-3 levels and/or perturbation in diurnal rhythms of their levels reduces synaptophysin-positive presynaptic terminals in layer IV of the NCX of juvenile rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were raised in our laboratory and maintained on a 12-hour LD cycle (lights on at 07:00, lights off at 19:00) at a controlled ambient temperature (24 ± 1 °C). Male rat pups were used on postnatal day 14 except for experiments on age-related changes. Male BDNF-KO mice (19Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Inaguma Y. Ichisaka S. Hata Y. Tsumoto T. Iwai M. Mikoshiba K. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and male CAPS2-KO mice with an abnormal free-running rhythm (18Sadakata T. Washida M. Iwayama Y. Shoji S.

Invest. 2007; 117: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were used on days 10 and 14, respectively. Food and water for mother rats were available ad libitum. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines for animal experimentation of the Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center, and of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute. A single 8-h phase advance of the LD cycle was achieved using procedures similar to those previously reported for adult rats (8Katoh-Semba R. Tsuzuki M. Miyazaki N. Matsuda M. Nakagawa C. Ichisaka S. Sudo K. Kitajima S. Hamatake M. Hata Y. Nagata K. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 2131-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The advance was started at 23:00 on postnatal day 6. Control and experimental pups were sacrificed at 10:30 on day 7 (groups A and C, respectively) or day 14 (groups B and D, respectively). Constant light rearing and dark rearing experiments were performed as follows: pups were reared for 27.5 h from 07:00 on the 13th postnatal day to 10:30 on the 14th day for the former rearing (group F) and for 23.5 h from 19:00 on the 13th postnatal day to 18:30 on the 14th day for the latter rearing (group G) (see Fig. 4B). Age-matched pups, which were reared under the regular cycle, were used as controls (groups B and E). Sleep deprivation was induced by 12-min shaking and 3-min resting during the light phase, from 07:00 on the 14th day (see Fig. 4C, Group H), and neuronal activity was reduced by a subcutaneous injection of urethane (500 mg/kg) into pups at 19:00 on the 13th day (see Fig. 4C, Group I). Control (group E) and experimental male pups (groups H and I) were sacrificed from 18:30 on the 14th day. All experiments were carried out with nursing mothers. To examine diurnal changes in the levels of BDNF and NT-3, nine brain regions (Cbl; Hip; NCX (regions corresponding to the parietotemporal cortex); hypothalamus; VCX; superior colliculus; brain regions including the entorhinal cortex, piriform cortex, and amygdaloid nuclear complex; medial septum, and inferior colliculus) were dissected from 14-day-old control male rats at 4-h or 6-h intervals (see Figs. 2A or 5A). In other experiments, the Cbl, Hip, or NCX was dissected at zeitgeber times (ZTs) and at ages as depicted in the respective figures. All dissected brain regions were weighed immediately, frozen, and stored at −80 °C until use. To determine the relative amounts of active serine/threonine kinase Akt (Akt) and ERK1/2, the three brain regions (Cbl, Hip, and NCX) were dissected at 4-h intervals from 14-day-old rats.FIGURE 5Diurnal variations in levels of BDNF and NT-3 in the NCX of rats 1 week after the phase advance.

Takeuchi I.K. Semba R. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Inaguma Y. Ito H. Kato K. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 35: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard neurotrophins or tissue extracts were incubated with polystyrene beads bearing immobilized neurotrophin-specific antibodies for 5 h at 30 °C, and the antigen-bound beads were further incubated with 1 milliunit of β-d-galactosidase-labeled Fab′ fragments at 4 °C for 16 h or more. The β-galactosidase activity bound to the beads was assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside as the substrate. Active Akt and ERK1/2 in the NCX were analyzed as described previously (8Katoh-Semba R. Tsuzuki M. Miyazaki N. Matsuda M. Nakagawa C. Ichisaka S. Sudo K. Kitajima S. Hamatake M. Hata Y. Nagata K. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 2131-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates of the NCX were applied to 10% SDS gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained with the following antibodies: anti-phospho(Ser-473)-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-phospho(Thr-202 and Tyr-204)-ERK1/2, or anti-ERK1/2 (all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG prepared in our laboratory. Proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence reagents and quantified with an LAS-1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). For immunohistochemical staining of synaptophysin, phase-advanced 14-day-old rats (Group D in Fig. 4A) or CAPS2-KO mice were intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS after an initial perfusion with saline, whereas 10-day-old BDNF-KO mice were perfused with 30 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and 8% sucrose (19Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Inaguma Y. Ichisaka S. Hata Y. Tsumoto T. Iwai M. Mikoshiba K. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Coronal paraffin sections of brains (7 μm) were prepared from brains of phase-advanced rat pups and BDNF-KO mice, and cryostat sections (10 μm) were prepared from brains of CAPS2-KO mice. Control sections were prepared from age-matched rat pups under regular conditions or age-matched WT mice. Paraffin sections were incubated with anti-synaptophysin antibodies (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) (1:1000), and cryostat sections were incubated with the same antibodies (1:3000) after passing through a graded alcohol series. Reactions were enhanced using ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and visualized as described previously (19Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Inaguma Y. Ichisaka S. Hata Y. Tsumoto T. Iwai M. Mikoshiba K. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). cDNAs for in situ hybridization were amplified using the following forward and reverse primers, respectively: for transcription factor Tbr1 (Tbr1), 5′-TAAGTGCAGGTCTCTCACTATG-3′ and 5′-TATTAACATCCCTACCATCCAT-3′, and for nuclear hormone receptor ROR (ROR), 5′-AGCGCCATTGTCCACTTT-3′ and 5′-CTGTGCCTCCCGATTACC-3′. The Tbr1 and ROR antisense riboprobes were prepared using their respective cDNAs as templates and were 3′ end-labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche). In situ hybridization brain histochemistry was performed as described previously (21Sadakata T. Mizoguchi A. Sato Y. Katoh-Semba R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), hybridizing cryostat sections (10 μm) with 0.2 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled Tbr1 or ROR riboprobes. Synaptophysin analyses were usually carried out using regions of the occipital and/or parietal cortices of littermate animals. The staining intensity was drawn using ImageJ, ver. 1.43r by scanning on stained sections corresponding to the occipital cortices of phase-advanced male pups and their control groups. The density of synaptophysin deposits in layers IV, V, and VI in the occipital and/or parietal cortices of individual animal groups was also measured according to the ImageJ ver. 1.43r program. Density in the white matter on the same section was subtracted as background. Numbers of synaptophysin-positive presynaptic terminals were quantified as described by Shinoda et al. (22Shinoda Y. Kamikubo Y. Egashira Y. Tominaga-Yoshino K. Ogura A. Brain Res. 2005; 1042: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein was quantified using a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. or S.D. Differences among groups were examined for statistical significance using analysis of variance (followed by a Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) test) or the Student's t test. It has been reported that BDNF is abundant in adulthood, whereas NT-3 is abundant during the embryonic and/or early postnatal period (11Kaisho Y. Shintani A. Nishida M. Fukumoto H. Igarashi K. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Katoh-Semba R. Takeuchi I.K. Semba R. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We first explored developmental changes in the concentrations of BDNF and NT-3 in the rat Cbl, Hip, and NCX, where, in adult rats, there is a known molecular variation between sleeping and wakefulness (supplemental Fig. S1). In all three regions, BDNF levels sharply increased during the first 30 postnatal days. In contrast, NT-3 levels in the Cbl and NCX rapidly decreased after postnatal day 10, whereas the hippocampal level gradually increased with age up to 60 days of age. Levels of BDNF and NT-3 in the Cbl and NCX crossed at around 2 weeks of age. In the next step, to investigate whether diurnal rhythms in BDNF and NT-3 concentrations were age-dependent, the concentrations of BDNF and NT-3 in the Cbl, Hip, and NCX of male pups at 7, 14, and 21 days of age were measured at ZT6 and ZT18 (Fig. 1). When the levels at ZT6 were normalized to 100% at any age, BDNF levels at ZT18 significantly increased in the three brain regions of 14-day-old rats but not 7- or 21-day-old rats, (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 by the Student's t test). Regarding NT-3 concentrations, a prominent, statistically significant reduction at ZT18 was found in the NCX of 14-day-old rats (*, p < 0.05). A slight reduction in NT-3 levels at ZT18 was also observed in the NCX of rats at 21 days of age, whereas, at 7 days of age, a slight increase was observed, although they did not reach statistical significance. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in NT-3 levels in the Cbl and Hip for any ages between the two ZTs. It has been reported that circadian variations in BDNF levels are observed in limited brain regions of adult rats (3Bova R. Micheli M.R. Qualadrucci P. Zucconi G.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 57: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Schaaf M.J. Duurland R. de Kloet E.R. Vreugdenhil E. Brain Res. Mol.

Neurochem. 2008; 106: 2131-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because increases in BDNF concentrations in the dark phase were prominent in the Cbl, Hip, and NCX of rats at 14 days of age (see Fig. 1), we examined changes with ZT in BDNF and NT-3 levels in nine rat brain regions at 14 days of age according to the schedule of Fig. 2A. As shown in Fig. 2B, there were clear diurnal variations in BDNF concentrations, with high levels during the dark phase and low levels during the light phase, in the Cbl (F(5,36) = 6.399, p < 0.001), Hip (F = 11.25, p < 0.001) and NCX (F = 10.94, p < 0.001). Similar variations were also found in the hypothalamus (F = 4.745, p = 0.002), VCX (F = 2.814, p = 0.0303), and superior colliculus (F = 3.148, p = 0.0185) (regions to which the optic nerve projects in adult rats, see Fig. 2C) and in the entorhinal cortex (F = 6.865, p < 0.001) and medial septum (F = 4.786, p = 0.0029), except the inferior colliculus (F = 0.986, p = 0.442) (other regions, see D). When compared with the minimal levels observed in each region, statistically significant increases were found in BDNF levels during the dark phase in eight brain regions except for the inferior colliculus (*, p < 0.05 by the Fisher's PLSD). On the other hand, NT-3 levels varied only in specific cortical regions such as the NCX (F(5,36) = 5.215, p = 0.0011) and VCX (F = 6.050, p = 0.0004), with an inverse cycle compared with BDNF, high in the light phase and low in the dark phase (see Fig. 2, B and C). Differences in NT-3 levels between the minimal level (ZT22) and ZT2 or ZT6 or ZT10 were statistically significant in both NCX and VCX (*, p < 0.05). There were no clear variations in NT-3 levels in other regions examined here (see Fig. 2, B–D). The BDNF/NT-3 balance in the NCX and VCX also oscillated with a pattern similar to the BDNF level but with larger amplitude (F(5,36) = 6.007, p = 0.0004 for the NCX; F = 7.026, p = 0.0001 for the VCX). BDNF is synthesized in an activity-dependent manner (1Lindsay R.M. Neurotrophic Factors. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 257-277Google Scholar). There are several intracellular signals and transcription factors that are known to stimulate BDNF production. Our previous report demonstrated in vivo regulation by p38 MAPK of AMPA-induced BDNF production in adult rat Hip (23Katoh-Semba R. Kaneko R. Kitajima S. Tsuzuki M. Ichisaka S. Hata Y. Yamada H. Miyazaki N. Takahashi Y. Kato K. Neuroscience. 2009; 163: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, however, there were no diurnal rhythms of p38 MAPK in any regions of the Cbl, Hip, and NCX of rats at 14 days of age. We investigated changes with ZT in amounts of active Akt and ERK1/2 in the three brain regions of 14-day-old rats. In the NCX, both amounts of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Akt proteins oscillated with their own cycles (Fig. 3A). Relative amounts of active Akt were markedly low in the dark phase in contrast to high BDNF levels (Fig. 3B, F(5,12) = 3.347, p = 0.040; *, p < 0.05, statistical significances compared with minimal level at ZT22), whereas amounts of active Akt were also reduced around ZT14 and ZT18 (Fig. 3C, F(5,12) = 5.504, p = 0.0073; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, compared with minimal level at ZT14). In the Hip and Cbl, compared with small diurnal changes in total Akt levels, active Akt levels were prominently high during the light phase, resulting in high relative amounts of active Akt in the light phase (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). A high level of BDNF mRNA during the light phase was observed in the Hip. On the other hand, relative amounts of active ERK1 and ERK2 in the NCX of 14-day-old rats were inclined to increase at the end of the dark phase, in contrast with NT-3 levels (Fig. 3, D and E, F(5,12) = 4.734, p = 0.013 for ERK1; *, p < 0.05 between ZT14 (minimal level) and ZT18 or ZT 22 by the Fisher's PLSD; F = 2.333, p = 0.106 for ERK2). However, they did not show any variations with ZT in the Hip and Cbl as is the case for the NT-3 level (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The following experiments were focused on the NCX of 14-day-old rats because diurnal variations in both BDNF and NT-3 levels (also active Akt and ERK1/2 levels) were limited to the NCX. Recently, it has been reported that cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and/or methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) regulate activity-dependent BDNF production in the NCX (24Tao X. Finkbeiner S. Arnold D.B. Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 709-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 25Zhou Z. Hong E.J. Cohen S. Zhao W.N. Ho H.Y.

Then we investigated relative amounts of active CREB and three types of active MeCP2 in the NCX of 14-day-old rats. Although relative amounts of active CREB were slightly high at the beginning of the light phase compared with those at ZT22, diurnal variation was not prominent (supplemental Fig. S2C-i). Although considerable levels of total MeCP2 and phospho(Ser-80)-MeCP2, being phosphorylated in resting neurons (26Tao J. Hu K. Chang Q. Wu H. Sherman N.E. Martinowich K. Klose R.J. Schanen C. Jaenisch R. Wang W. Sun Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2009; 106: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), were found in the NCX of 14-day-old rat pups as well as adult rats, their diurnal variations in pups were not obvious (supplemental Fig. S2, C-ii and C-iii). On the other hand, signals corresponding to around 75 kDa of phospho(Ser-421)-MeCP2, being phosphorylated in active neurons (25Zhou Z. Hong E.J. Cohen S. Zhao W.N. Ho H.Y. Schmidt L. Chen W.G. Lin Y. Savner E. Griffith E.C. Hu L. Steen J.A. Weitz C.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2006; 52: 255-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), were clearly observed in the adult NCX but hardly in the juvenile NCX (supplemental Fig. S2C-ii). This was also true of phospho(Ser-292)-MeCP2. Signals of phospho(Ser-421 or Ser-292)-MeCP2 at a younger age were too weak to determine. It has been reported that, in specific brain regions of adult rats, an 8-h phase advance of the LD cycle causes an increase or decrease in BDNF concentrations after a 12-h rearing or a 1-week rearing, respectively (8Katoh-Semba R. Tsuzuki M. Miyazaki N. Matsuda M. Nakagawa C. Ichisaka S. Sudo K. Kitajima S. Hamatake M. Hata Y. Nagata K. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 2131-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we carried out similar experiments using juvenile rats (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The experiment was started at 23:00 on the 6th postnatal day when the pups were still together with their mothers. In the NCX 12 h after the phase advance (Fig. 4A, lower panel, 7-day), mean relative concentration of BDNF in phase-advanced pups (group C) differed little from that in controls (group A), whereas that of NT-3 in the former group was increased slightly but not significantly. The mean relative BDNF level 1 week after the phase advance (group D) was significantly elevated compared with that of age-matched controls (group B), whereas the NT-3 level was conversely reduced, a"
https://openalex.org/W1970380702,"Chlorella virus DNA ligase (ChVLig) is a minimized eukaryal ATP-dependent DNA sealing enzyme with an intrinsic nick-sensing function. ChVLig consists of three structural domains, nucleotidyltransferase (NTase), OB-fold, and latch, that envelop the nicked DNA as a C-shaped protein clamp. The OB domain engages the DNA minor groove on the face of the duplex behind the nick, and it makes contacts to amino acids in the NTase domain surrounding the ligase active site. The latch module occupies the DNA major groove flanking the nick. Residues at the tip of the latch contact the NTase domain to close the ligase clamp. Here we performed a structure-guided mutational analysis of the OB and latch domains. Alanine scanning defined seven individual amino acids as essential in vivo (Lys-274, Arg-285, Phe-286, and Val-288 in the OB domain; Asn-214, Phe-215, and Tyr-217 in the latch), after which structure-activity relations were clarified by conservative substitutions. Biochemical tests of the composite nick sealing reaction and of each of the three chemical steps of the ligation pathway highlighted the importance of Arg-285 and Phe-286 in the catalysis of the DNA adenylylation and phosphodiester synthesis reactions. Phe-286 interacts with the nick 5′-phosphate nucleotide and the 3′-OH base pair and distorts the DNA helical conformation at the nick. Arg-285 is a key component of the OB-NTase interface, where it forms a salt bridge to the essential Asp-29 side chain, which is imputed to coordinate divalent metal catalysts during the nick sealing steps.

Alanine scanning defined seven individual amino acids as essential in vivo (Lys-274, Arg-285, Phe-286, and Val-288 in the OB domain; Asn-214, Phe-215, and Tyr-217 in the latch), after which structure-activity relations were clarified by conservative substitutions. Biochemical tests of the composite nick sealing reaction and of each of the three chemical steps of the ligation pathway highlighted the importance of Arg-285 and Phe-286 in the catalysis of the DNA adenylylation and phosphodiester synthesis reactions. Phe-286 interacts with the nick 5′-phosphate nucleotide and the 3′-OH base pair and distorts the DNA helical conformation at the nick. Arg-285 is a key component of the OB-NTase interface, where it forms a salt bridge to the essential Asp-29 side chain, which is imputed to coordinate divalent metal catalysts during the nick sealing steps."
https://openalex.org/W2034215953,"Bacterial communication via quorum sensing has been extensively investigated in recent years. Bacteria communicate in a complex manner through the production, release, and reception of diffusible low molecular weight chemical signaling molecules. Much work has focused on understanding the basic mechanisms of quorum sensing. As more and more bacteria grow resistant to conventional antibiotics, the development of drugs that do not kill bacteria but instead interrupt their communication is of increasing interest. This study presents a method for analyzing bacterial communication by investigating single cell responses. Most conventional analysis methods for bacterial communication are based on the averaged response from many bacteria, masking how individual cells respond to their immediate environment. We applied a fiber-optic microarray to record cellular communication from single cells. Single cell quorum sensing systems have previously been employed, but the highly ordered array reported here is an improvement because it allows us to simultaneously investigate cellular communication in many different environments with known cellular densities and configurations. We employed this method to detect how genes under quorum regulation are induced or repressed over time on the single cell level and to determine whether cellular density and configuration are indicative of the single cell temporal patterns of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992554281,"The antibiotic fusidic acid potently inhibits bacterial translation (and cellular growth) by lodging between domains I and III of elongation factor G (EF-G) and preventing release of EF-G from the ribosome. We examined the functions of key amino acid residues near the active site of EF-G that interact with fusidic acid and regulate hydrolysis of GTP. Alanine mutants of these residues spontaneously hydrolyzed GTP in solution, bypassing the normal activating role of the ribosome. A conserved phenylalanine in the switch II element of EF-G was important for suppressing GTP hydrolysis in solution and critical for catalyzing translocation of the ribosome along mRNA. These experimental results reveal the multipurpose roles of an interdomain joint in the heart of an essential translation factor that can both promote and inhibit bacterial translation."
https://openalex.org/W2006494432,"Every year, about 10 million North American kindergarten through high school (K–12) students complete a science project. What part of these science projects is the most difficult? Formulating a hypothesis? Designing an experiment? Analyzing data? The answer: None of the above. Science Buddies ([www.sciencebuddies.org][1])—a nonprofit developer of software, content, and other resources for informal science and engineering education—found that students have the most difficulty selecting a topic and doing background research to inform their work. Meanwhile, scientists and engineers interested in advising and inspiring students often do not have a means to connect with them (see the first figure). To Science Buddies, these difficulties presented an ideal challenge, and we applied a business methodology to address them, viewing our users as customers and our output as products.
