https://openalex.org/W1988044873,"The target of rapamycin proteins regulate various cellular processes including autophagy, which may play a protective role in certain neurodegenerative and infectious diseases. Here we show that a primary small-molecule screen in yeast yields novel small-molecule modulators of mammalian autophagy. We first identified new small-molecule enhancers (SMER) and inhibitors (SMIR) of the cytostatic effects of rapamycin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three SMERs induced autophagy independently of rapamycin in mammalian cells, enhancing the clearance of autophagy substrates such as mutant huntingtin and A53T alpha-synuclein, which are associated with Huntington's disease and familial Parkinson's disease, respectively. These SMERs, which seem to act either independently or downstream of the target of rapamycin, attenuated mutant huntingtin-fragment toxicity in Huntington's disease cell and Drosophila melanogaster models, which suggests therapeutic potential. We also screened structural analogs of these SMERs and identified additional candidate drugs that enhanced autophagy substrate clearance. Thus, we have demonstrated proof of principle for a new approach for discovery of small-molecule modulators of mammalian autophagy."

https://openalex.org/W2002315265,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis and rheumatoid joint destruction result from increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Osteoclast formation induced by these cytokines requires NF-κB p50 and p52, c-Fos, and NFATc1 expression in osteoclast precursors. c-Fos induces NFATc1, but the relationship between NF-κB and these other transcription factors in osteoclastogenesis remains poorly understood. We report that RANKL and TNF can induce osteoclast formation directly from NF-κB p50/p52 double knockout (dKO) osteoclast precursors when either c-Fos or NFATc1 is expressed. RANKL- or TNF-induced c-Fos up-regulation and activation are abolished in dKO cells and in wild-type cells treated with an NF-κB inhibitor. c-Fos expression requires concomitant RANKL or TNF treatment to induce NFATc1 activation in the dKO cells. Furthermore, c-Fos expression increases the number and resorptive capacity of wild-type osteoclasts induced by TNF <i>in vitro</i>. We conclude that NF-κB controls early osteoclast differentiation from precursors induced directly by RANKL and TNF, leading to activation of c-Fos followed by NFATc1. Inhibition of NF-κB should prevent RANKL- and TNF-induced bone resorption."

https://openalex.org/W2052495973,"The small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) regulates transcriptional activity and the translocation of proteins across the nuclear membrane. The identification of SUMO substrates outside the nucleus is progressing but little is yet known about the wider cellular role of protein SUMOylation. Here we report that in rat hippocampal neurons multiple SUMOylation targets are present at synapses and we show that the kainate receptor subunit GluR6 is a SUMO substrate. SUMOylation of GluR6 regulates endocytosis of the kainate receptor and modifies synaptic transmission. GluR6 exhibits low levels of SUMOylation under resting conditions and is rapidly SUMOylated in response to a kainate but not an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) treatment. Reducing GluR6 SUMOylation using the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP-1 prevents kainate-evoked endocytosis of the kainate receptor. Furthermore, a mutated non-SUMOylatable form of GluR6 is not endocytosed in response to kainate in COS-7 cells. Consistent with this, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices demonstrate that kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents are decreased by SUMOylation and enhanced by deSUMOylation. These data reveal a previously unsuspected role for SUMO in the regulation of synaptic function."

Hypomethylation of wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A (WNT5A), S100 calcium-binding protein P (S100P) and cysteine-rich protein 1(CRIP1) was confirmed in the cancer cells by bisulfite sequencing. Treatment of the corresponding normal prostate epithelial cells 1542-NPTX with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) induced higher levels of mRNA expression and partial loss of methylation on these genes. Primary prostate cancers were tested using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. WNT5A was hypomethylated in 11/17 (65%) tumors, S100P in 8/16 (50%) and CRIP1 in 13/20 (65%). Bisulfite sequencing of a section of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of WNT5A revealed that three CpG sites (15, 24 and 35) were consistently methylated (93%) in the normal cell line and normal tissues, but not in the prostate cancer cell line and eight primary prostate cancers. Multiple putative binding sites for the transcription factors SP1 and AP-2 were found adjacent to CpG sites 15 and 24. A putative c-Myb binding site was located within the CpG site 35. Anti-c-Myb antibody co-precipitation with WNT5A was methylation-sensitive in 1542-NPTX cells. It is likely that an epigenetic mechanism regulates WNT5A expression in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2002339899,"The 11q13 region is amplified in approximately 15% of all breast tumors. Situated in this region are the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) and the p-21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) gene. Both genes encode proteins shown to activate the estrogen receptor (ER), leading to transcription of CCND1 and other ER-responsive genes. Here, we investigate the prognostic and treatment predictive role of CCND1 and PAK1 gene amplification in postmenopausal breast cancer patients randomized to tamoxifen treatment or no adjuvant treatment. Amplification of CCND1 and PAK1, assessed by real-time PCR, was observed in 12.5 and 9.3%, respectively. Amplification of PAK1 was seen in 37% of the CCND1-amplified tumors, indicating coamplification (P<0.001). In ER-positive patients, amplification of at least one of the genes indicated a reduced recurrence-free survival (P=0.025). When response to tamoxifen treatment was analysed, patients with PAK1 amplification showed decreased benefit from the drug (ER+; relative risk ratio (RR)=1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47–5.55) compared to patients without amplification (ER+; RR=0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88). This was not evident for CCND1 amplification. We show that PAK1 may be a predictor of tamoxifen resistance and furthermore, we do not discard PAK1 as a potential candidate oncogene in the 11q13 amplicon. In addition, we show that high pak1 protein levels may predict tamoxifen insensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1981981363,"Several distinct mutations within the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with non-small cell lung cancer, but mechanisms underlying their oncogenic potential are incompletely understood. Although normally ligand-induced kinase activation targets EGFR to Cbl-mediated receptor ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation in lysosomes, we report that certain EGFR mutants escape this regulation. Defective endocytosis characterizes a deletion mutant of EGFR, as well as a point mutant (L858R-EGFR), whose association with c-Cbl and ubiquitinylation are impaired. Our data raise the possibility that refractoriness of L858R-EGFR to downregulation is due to enhanced heterodimerization with the oncogene product HER2, which leads to persistent stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1978199318,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that signals to the nucleus through cell surface transmembrane receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity and cytoplasmic effectors, including Smad proteins. Here we describe two novel modulators of this pathway, lipoprotein-receptor related protein (LRP-1) and decorin. Decorin null (Dcn null) myoblasts showed a diminished TGF-β response that is restored by decorin re-expression. Importantly, this reactivation occurs without changes in the binding to TGF-β receptors, Smad protein phosphorylation, or Smad-4 nuclear translocation. In wild type myoblasts, inhibition of decorin binding to LRP-1 and depletion of LRP-1 inhibited TGF-β response to levels similar to those observed in Dcn null myoblasts. Re-expression of decorin in Dcn null myoblasts cannot restore TGF-β response if the Smad pathway or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is inhibited, suggesting that this LRP-1-decorin modulatory pathway requires activation of the Smad pathway by TGF-β and involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. This work unveils a new regulatory mechanism for TGF-β signaling by decorin and LRP-1.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). This growth factor, which belongs to a superfamily of structurally related proteins that comprises activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenic proteins, presents three very similar mammalian isoforms, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 (2Gray P.C. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates cellular processes by binding to high affinity cell surface receptors: TGF-β-RI, TGF-β-RII, and TGF-β-RIII (also known as betaglycan). A general mechanism for TGF-β signaling has been established in which TGF-β binds to type III receptors and is presented to type II receptors or binds to type II receptors directly (4Lopez-Casillas F. Riquelme C. Perez-Kato Y. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Osses N. Esparza-Lopez J. Gonzalez-Nunez G. Cabello-Verrugio C. Mendoza V. Troncoso V. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 382-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Once activated by TGF-β, type II receptors recruit, bind, and transphosphorylate type I receptors, thereby stimulating their protein kinase activity. Active type I receptor kinases then phosphorylate Smad-2 or -3, allowing their association with Smad-4. Smad complexes translocate to the cell nucleus and mediate the transcriptional regulation of TGF-β target genes. Smad-7, on the other hand, is a strong inhibitor of this pathway (5Massague J. Blain S. Lo R. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar, 6Piek E. Heldin C. Ten Dijke P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Besides Smad-mediated transcription, TGF-β activates other signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways. Some of these pathways regulate Smad activation, but others might induce non-transcriptional responses (7Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). TGF-β can activate the ERK (8Imamichi Y. Waidmann O. Hein R. Eleftheriou P. Giehl K. Menke A. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), JNK (9Lien S.C. Usami S.

Kidney Int. 2006; 70: 901-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Decorin is one of the most studied members of the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (12Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Its core protein, which constitutes up to 80% of the protein moiety, is composed of 12 repeats of a 24-amino-acid-residue domain (leucine-rich repeats). In addition, decorin carries a single glycosaminoglycan chain at its NH2 terminus. Decorin is able to interact with several growth factors and plasma membrane-located receptors. For instance, it is well known that decorin binds to the insulin-like growth factor-I (13Schonherr E. Sunderkotter C. Iozzo R.V. Schaefer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15767-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and interacts with tumor necrosis factor-α (14Tufvesson E. Westergren-Thorsson G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Decorin is also known to cause rapid phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 15: 406-412Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Decorin also modulates TGF-β activity (16Takeuchi Y. Kodama Y. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32634-32638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi Y. Mann D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Several different functions, based in these interactions, have been established for decorin. Cells that do not express decorin show a decreased cell responsiveness to TGF-β, suggesting that decorin is required to activate the TGF-β signaling pathways (18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schonherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, proteoglycans are modulators of the biological activity of several growth factors (19Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 20Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), and its presence either in the ECM or in the plasma membrane seems to be critical for this modulation (19Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). Although decorin has been normally considered as an ECM proteoglycan, it has been shown to be able to associate to the plasma membrane through a specific decorin endocytic receptor in a variety of eukaryotic cells (21Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hausser H. Schonherr E. Muller M. Liszio C. Bin Z. Fisher L.W. Kresse H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that decorin binds and that it is endocyted by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1) (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). LRP-1 is a giant receptor that binds, internalizes, and mediates the degradation of several ligands (24Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The folding process of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum requires the participation of a 39-kDa receptor chaperone, the receptor-associated protein (RAP) (25Bu G. Marzolo M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This protein competes efficiently with the binding of decorin to LRP-1 at the cell surface (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To study the possible role of LRP-1 in the modulation of TGF-β signaling by decorin, we decided to study its role in myoblasts since it has been characterized with regard to TGF-β response (18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schonherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Massague J. Cheifetz S. Endo T.

This novel function for LRP-1 and decorin requires activation of the Smad pathway and is affected by PI3K inhibitors. This work unveils a new regulatory role for decorin and LRP-1 in TGF-β signaling. Cell Culture—The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (ATCC) (28Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) was grown and induced to differentiate as described (29Larrain J. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol.

Adenoviral Infection—Myoblasts were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates. After 4 h, myoblasts were infected with 500 plaque-forming units/cell of an adenovirus containing the human sequence of decorin (Adv-Dcn) (18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schonherr E. Henriquez J.P.

After 90 min of incubation, standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium, 10% FBS) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. Transfection assays were performed in fresh growth medium. Transient Plasmid Transfection—The following TGF-β responsive constructs were used: p3TP-Lux (30Droguett R. Cabello-Verrugio C. Riquelme C.

Massagué, Sloan Kettering, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, NY) were used to overexpress Smad-7-Myc and a negative dominant mutant of TGF-β receptor II (DN-TGF-β-RII-HA) respectively. Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates until they reached 60% confluence. Cells were then incubated in Opti-MEM I containing 1 μg of each plasmid, 0.02 μg of pRL-SV40, 2 μl of PLUS reagent, and 1 μl of Lipofectamine. After 6 h, FBS was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured for a further 12 h. Medium was changed to fresh growth medium, and the following reagents were added: TGF-β1 dissolved in 0.5% FBS; GST or GST-RAP in phosphate-buffered saline (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol.

Dual Luciferase activity assays (Promega) were performed after 6 or 24 h depending on the experiment. Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analyses, cell extracts obtained from myoblasts were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 with a mixture of protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For analysis of phosphorylated proteins, cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) as described previously (32Osses N. Brandan E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C383-C394Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Aliquots were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis in 5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with rabbit anti-LRP extracellular domain (1:1000) as described previously (33Obermoeller L.M.

All immunoreactions were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was isolated from cell cultures at the indicated days of differentiation using TRIzol. RNA samples were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membranes, and hybridized with probes for mouse Smad-7, biglycan, or tubulin during 3 h to 65 °C, and the probe for mouse connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was incubated during 20 h at 42 °C. The probe for Smad-7 was obtained by digestion of pActEF-Smad7-Myc plasmid, which has the full mouse cDNA of Smad-7, with NheI and EcoRV. The probe for tubulin has been described previously (18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schonherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The probe for CTGF was obtained by PCR reactions using specific primers. Immunofluorescence Microscopy— LRP expression and distribution and Smad-4 intracellular localization in C2C12 myoblasts was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h with 1:100 mouse anti-LRP-1 antibody, directed against the cytoplasmic tail of human LRP-1 (Calbiochem) or 1:100 mouse anti-Smad-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The incubation buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2% bovine serum albumin. After buffer removal and several washes with the above buffer, bound antibodies were detected by incubating the cells for 30 min with 1:100 affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Pierce Biotechnology). For nuclear staining, sections were incubated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After rinsing, the sections were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Corp.) under glass coverslips, viewed, and photographed with a Nikon Eclipse microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—Annealed siRNA specific for LRP-1 and control siRNA were previously described (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, for transfection, myoblasts were seeded into six-well plates until they reached 70% confluence. Subsequently, cells were incubated during 6 h in 800 μl of Opti-MEM I containing siRNA for LRP-1 or control siRNA plus 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For experiments with p3TP-Lux or pMyo-Luc plasmid reporters, these were co-transfected with siRNA. Following transfection, FBS was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured for a further 24 h. Then, cells were analyzed through immunofluorescence assays of Smad-4 or LRP-1 or harvested for immunoblot analysis of LRP-1, myogenin, or integrin β1. Labeling of Cultures—Cells were infected with Adv-Dcn and incubated for 18 h in sulfate- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium/F12 with 100 μCi/ml H2[35S]O4 (25 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (18Riquelme C.

These conditioned media were concentrated on a DEAE-Sephacel column pre-equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and samples were eluted with 1 m NaCl and analyzed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimaging system. Protein Determination—Proteins were determined in aliquots of cell extracts using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Decorin Is Required for TGF-β Response without Changes in the Smad-dependent Pathway—We have previously shown that Dcn null myoblasts present a decreased response to TGF-β1 when compared with wild type myoblasts, (18Riquelme C. Larrain J. Schonherr E. Henriquez J.P. Kresse H. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Now, we have investigated this phenomenon, evaluating three TGF-β-inducible reporters: p3TP-lux, which contains the promoter region of plasminogen activator inhibitor (34Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X-F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar); pCTGF, a reporter containing the promoter region of CTGF (35Leask A. Abraham D.J. FASEB. J. 2004; 18: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar); and p4X-SBE-luc, a reporter containing four specific binding sites for Smad proteins (31Hjelmeland M.D. Hjelmeland A.B. Sathornsumetee S. Reese E.D. Herbstreith M.H. Laping N.J. Friedman H.S. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Rich J.N. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 737-745PubMed Google Scholar). The three reporter activities were reduced in response to TGF-β in Dcn null when compared with wild type myoblasts (Fig. 1, A–C). The same effect was observed for the amount of integrin β1, a TGF-β1-inducible protein (Fig. 1D). The decreased responses to TGF-β1 were specific to the absence of decorin since its re-expression, using an adenovirus containing Adv-Dcn, restored the TGF-β-dependent activity to wild type levels (Fig. 1, A–D). The diminished response was observed at different TGF-β1 concentrations (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Reexpression of decorin, after the infection with the Adv-Dcn in Dcn null myoblasts, shows this proteoglycan as the main radiolabeled biosynthetic product (supplemental Fig. 1C). These results suggest that decorin is required for part of the response to TGF-β in myoblasts. The proteoglycan biglycan, highly related to decorin, has been shown to be a target of TGF-β (36Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fig. 1E shows the amount of biglycan messenger transcripts in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts in response to TGF-β for 24 h. A diminished response to TGF-β, when compared with wild type myoblasts, was observed in Dcn myoblasts. The levels of TGF-β-RI and TGF-β-RII, the binding of 125I-TGF-β1 to TGF-β-RI and TGF-β-RII, as well as the amount of Smad-2, -3, -4, and -7 were similar in the Dcn null when compared with wild type myoblasts (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). The phosphorylation of Smad-2 induced by different amounts of TGF-β1, as well as the kinetic, are normal when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2A, and see supplemental Fig. 2C). Indirect immunofluorescence analyses showed that the nuclear accumulation of Smad-4 in response to different TGF-β1 concentrations was also similar in both cell types (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the re-expression of decorin in Dcn null myoblasts by infection with Adv-Dcn did not affect the amount of phospho-Smad-2 (Fig. 2C), an experimental situation that totally recovers TGF-β responses in Dcn null myoblasts (Fig. 1, A–D). These results clearly indicate that although Dcn null myoblasts are less responsive to TGF-β, the Smad pathway is unaffected. Decorin Requires an Active Smad Signaling Pathway to Allow Maximal TGF-β Response—To examine the contribution of the Smad pathway with regard to the role of decorin in the TGF-β response, we used a specific inhibitor of TGF-β-RI kinase activity (SB431542) (Fig. 3A), overexpression of Smad-7, an inhibitor of TGF-β phosphorylation of Smad-2 and -3 (Fig. 3B), or a dominant negative mutant of TGF-β receptor II (DN-TGF-β-RII) (Fig. 3C) in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts. These three approaches, independently, produced a strong decrease in the TGF-β1-dependent p3TP-Lux activity in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts, which was dependent on the expression levels of Smad-7 or DN-TGF-β-RII. Under these treatments, re-expression of decorin in Dcn-null myoblasts did not recover TGF-β-dependent activity (Fig. 3A, left panel, and B and C, right panels). The effect of the SB431542 inhibitor on Smad-2, -3 phosphorylation and the overexpression of Smad-7 and DN-TGF-β-RII are shown (Fig. 3A, right panel, and B and C, left panels). The above results suggest that decorin requires an active Smad pathway to allow maximal TGF-β response. Decorin Requires LRP-1 to Exert Its Effect on TGF-β Signaling—Decorin is a soluble proteoglycan internalized by different cell types, including endothelial and myogenic cells. One possibility to explain how decorin positively regulates the TGF-β response in myoblasts is through its interaction with a specific cell surface receptor. A candidate for this function is LRP-1, the endocytic receptor for decorin, as we have recently shown (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether LRP-1 participates in the regulation that decorin exerts in response to TGF-β, we determined TGF-β-dependent p3TP-Lux activity in the presence or absence of RAP, a protein that inhibits the binding and endocytosis of decorin by LRP-1 (23Brandan E. Retamal C. Cabello-Verrugio C. Marzolo M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RAP inhibited about 50% of TGF-β1-dependent p3TP-Lux activity in wild type myoblasts (Fig. 4A) similar to the decrease of TGF-β activity in Dcn null cells. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of RAP depends on decorin because in Dcn null myoblasts, RAP has no effect (Fig. 4A). The inhibitory effect by RAP was reversible (supplemental Fig. 3A). This effect was dependent on the presence of decorin because in Dcn null myoblasts that re-express this proteoglycan, RAP inhibited the induction of p3TP-Lux in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 4A). RAP did not have any effect on Smad-2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts (Fig. 4B), supporting the idea that Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling is not affected in Dcn null myoblasts. Levels of LRP-1 in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts were equivalent (supplemental Fig. 3B). To prove the participation of LRP-1 in the regulatory mechanism that decorin exerts in the TGF-β response in myoblasts, we used siRNA for LRP-1. A strong decrease of LRP-1 protein was observed when compared with siRNA control transfected cells (Fig. 5A). The strong decrease of LRP-1 was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (supplemental Fig. 3C). To determine whether the absence of LRP-1 has an effect in the response to TGF-β, we evaluated: p3TP-Lux activity; the amount of integrin β1; and the amount of CTGF messenger transcripts in wild type and Dcn null myoblasts transfected with a siRNA for LRP-1 or siRNA control. The decrease of LRP-1 protein levels diminished these three parameters in wild type myoblasts (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 4A). Interestingly, in Dcn null myoblasts, the absence of LRP-1 did not affect any of the parameters evaluated (Fig. 5B and C, and supplemental Fig. 4). When Dcn null myoblasts re-express decorin, the absence of LRP-1 inhibited p3TP-Lux activity and the amounts of integrin β1 and CTGF messenger transcripts (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 4). Therefore, decorin did not re-establish maximum levels of TGF-β response in the absence of LRP-1. Finally, the absence of LRP-1 did not have any effect on the nuclear accumulation of Smad-4 in response to TGF-β1 in wild type or Dcn null myoblasts (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that decorin could exert its effect on TGF-β signaling through LRP-1. Inhibitors of PI3K Pathway Affect the Decorin-LRP-1 Component of the TGF-β Response—The above results indicate that part of the response to TGF-β is modulated by the presence of decorin and LRP-1. To study which pathway(s) might be implicated in this decorin-LRP-1 modulatory effect, we used specific inhibitors of PI3K, p38MAPK, MEK1/2, and IGFR-I kinase activities on the response to TGF-β of wild type and Dcn null myoblasts. Only the inhibitor of the PI3K pathway LY294002 affected the decorin-LRP-1 component of the response to TGF-β determined by the p3TP-lux reporter activity (Fig. 6A). Inhibitors of p38MAPK (Fig. 6B) did not affect the p3TP-lux activity, and inhibitors of MEK1/2 or IGFR-I kinase activity did affect the TGF-β-dependent reporter activity in both cell types independent of decorin expression (Fig. 6, C and D). Fig. 7A shows that re-expression of decorin using Adv-Dcn did not revert the effect of two PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) on the TGF-β response. Finally, the absence of LRP-1 did not revert the effect of LY294002 on the TGF-β1 response in wild type or Dcn null myoblasts (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the PI3K pathway may be involved in the modulatory response to TGF-β mediated by the interaction between LRP-1 and decorin.FIGURE 7Inhibition of PI3K pathway affect component of TGF-β when decorin and LRP-1 are present. A, wild type (WT) and Dcn null myoblasts were transiently transfected with plasmids containing p3TP-lux and pRL-SV40 reporters and co-incubated with TGF-β1 (1.0 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence of wortmannin (1 μm) or LY294002 (10 μm).

Cells obtain cholesterol from the circulation but can also synthesize cholesterol de novo through the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway. This pathway, however, has several branches and also produces non-sterol isoprenoids. Squalene synthase (SQS) is the enzyme that determines the switch toward sterol biosynthesis. Here we demonstrate that in prostate cancer cells SQS expression is enhanced by androgens, channeling intermediates of the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway toward cholesterol synthesis. Interestingly, the resulting increase in de novo synthesis of cholesterol mainly affects the cholesterol content of lipid rafts, while leaving non-raft cholesterol levels unaffected. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated SQS inhibition results in a decrease of raft-associated cholesterol. These data show that SQS activity and de novo cholesterol synthesis are determinants of membrane microdomain-associated cholesterol in cancer cells. Remarkably, SQS knock down also attenuates proliferation and induces death of prostate cancer cells. Similar effects are observed when cancer cells are treated with the chemical SQS inhibitor zaragozic acid A. Importantly, although the anti-tumor effect of statins has previously been attributed to inhibition of protein isoprenylation, the present study shows that specific inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis branch of the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway also induces cancer cell death. These findings significantly underscore the importance of de novo cholesterol synthesis for cancer cell biology and suggest that SQS is a potential novel target for antineoplastic intervention.

Cholesterol is a major structural lipid. It intercalates with phospholipids in cellular membranes and drives domain organization, giving rise to discrete structures that are mobile in the plane of the membrane and are referred to as lipid rafts (1Spector A.A. Yorek M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1015-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 3Hancock J.F.

The distinct nature of these rafts or membrane microdomains is supported by the insolubility of lipid rafts in cold non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, resulting in their low buoyant density in sucrose gradients (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar). The association of specific subsets of proteins with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains allows for functional compartmentalization of membranes and is thought to play a crucial role in key cellular functions, including signal transduction, cell growth, cell polarization, migration, and survival (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 3Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 4Simons K.

Care. 2006; 9: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept, it has been shown that cholesterol is required for the growth of cancer cells (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Siperstein M.D. Fed. Proc. 1973; 32: 2168-2173PubMed Google Scholar, 8Haeffner E.W. Hoffmann C.J. Stoehr M. Scherf H. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2668-2676PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings have linked these effects to changes in lipid rafts and have shown that elevated levels of circulating cholesterol increase the cholesterol content of lipid rafts, promote tumor growth, and reduce apoptosis in prostate cancer xenografts (6Hager M.H.

Investig. 2005; 115: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cells acquire cholesterol from the circulation but also have the ability to synthesize cholesterol de novo via the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway (Fig. 1) (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

One of the first and rate-limiting steps in this pathway is the formation of mevalonate by β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) 4The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; SQS, squalene synthase; SRE, sterol regulatory element; SREBP, SRE-binding protein. 4The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; SQS, squalene synthase; SRE, sterol regulatory element; SREBP, SRE-binding protein. reductase, the enzyme that constitutes the target of statins (11Veillard N.R.

Vupputuri S. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 2340-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several large population-based studies have shown that statins also reduce the risk of developing various cancers (13Demierre M.F. Higgins P.D. Gruber S.B. Hawk E. Lippman S.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 930-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Furthermore, statins have been demonstrated to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cell cultures in vitro (14Ukomadu C. Dutta A. J. Biol.

Whether inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is the main trigger of these effects remains, however, a matter of debate. In fact, mevalonate is further metabolized to farnesyl diphosphate, which functions as a precursor for cholesterol but can also be used for isoprenylation (farnesylation and geranyl-geranylation) of proteins and for the synthesis of heme, dolichol, and ubiquitin (11Veillard N.R. Mach F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1771-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

As a consequence, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins not only inhibits cholesterol synthesis but also blocks protein isoprenylation, which is essential for the function of several cancer-associated signaling proteins, including members of the ras/Rho family (24Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the anticancer effects of statins have been largely attributed to inhibition of this post-translational mechanism (13Demierre M.F. Higgins P.D. Gruber S.B. Hawk E. Lippman S.M. Nat. Rev.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Uptake and synthesis of cholesterol are tightly controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), transcription factors that are synthesized as inactive endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated precursors (28Brown M.S.

When cells are depleted of cholesterol, SREBPs migrate to the Golgi where they are proteolytically cleaved; then SREBPs translocate to the nucleus and stimulate the expression of proteins involved in the uptake and synthesis of cholesterol (28Brown M.S.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in prostate cancer cells, the feedback regulation of these transcription factors is partially lost due to activation of the SREBP maturation mechanism by androgens (31Heemers H.V. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Swinnen J.V. Heemers H. van de Sande T. de Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W.

Monogr. 2000; 27: 39-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In fact, androgens enhance the expression of SREBP cleavage-activating protein, a key protein involved in the sensing of intracellular sterol levels, thereby disturbing the delicate balance between sensor and retention proteins present in the regulatory complex that governs SREBP maturation (30Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Heemers H.V. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol.

As a consequence, androgens induce activation of SREBPs in prostate cancer cells even in the presence of cholesterol, thereby stimulating the expression of various enzymes of the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, such as HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (32Swinnen J.V.

Moreover, by targeting SQS using small interfering RNA technology or chemical inhibitors, we explored the role and importance of SQS activity and cholesterol synthesis in the growth and survival of cancer cells. Cell Culture and Materials—The human prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The human prostate carcinoma cell lines MDA-PCa-2a and PC-346c were provided by Dr. N. Navone (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and Dr. W. Van Weerden (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), respectively. Cells were cultured as previously described (30Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol.

To assess the effects of R1881, charcoal-treated fetal calf serum was used to reduce the background levels of steroids. Zaragozic acid A (Squalestatin S1), mevastatin, FTI-277, and water-soluble cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Transient transfections were performed using Transfast reagent (Promega). The plasmid pAcGFP1-F was purchased from Clontech. RNA Interference—Transfection procedures with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) have been described previously (41De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3799-3804PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6719-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides targeting luciferase have been described (41De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V.

The siRNA oligonucleotides targeting SQS were sense, GAGGUUUGGAGCAGGUAUGdTdT, and antisense, CAUACCUGCUCCAAACCUCdTdT. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA preparation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (34Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A cDNA probe for squalene synthase was synthesized by PCR on human cDNA (generated by reverse transcription as described) (34Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Equal loading of RNA was verified using a probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA. Relative quantitation of mRNA levels was performed using a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a reducing buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.715 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 8.7% glycerol. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (34Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For the preparation of membrane fractions, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 150 mm NaCl; homogenates were cleared from debris (centrifugation at 3,000 × g, 5 min) and subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) to separate the membrane fraction. Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to all protein buffers. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce).

For Western blot analysis on cellular fractions separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (see below), equal volumes of each fraction were used for gel electrophoresis. Promoter-Reporter Assays—The promoter-reporter constructs pSQSwt-luc, pSQSmut124-luc, and pSQSmut123-luc have been described previously (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pSQSmut124-luc construct harbors mutations in three SREBP-binding sites (two SRE-1 sequences and an inverted SRE-3), whereas in the pSQSmut123-luc construct two SREBP-binding sites (one SRE-1 and the inverted SRE-3) and the auxiliary-binding site for NF-Y are mutated (Fig. 3A). LNCaP cells were transfected with promoter-reporter constructs using Transfast transfection reagent (Promega). Where indicated, an expression vector encoding a dominant-negative form of SREBP-1, encoding amino acids 90–460 of SREBP-1 (30Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or an empty expression vector was added. The next day, medium was replaced and cells were incubated with 10–8m R1881 or with vehicle for 48 h. Then, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed; cleared lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity using a luciferase reporter kit (Promega). Quantification of 2-[14C]Acetate Incorporation in Cholesterol—After 48 h of incubation with R1881, at 72 h after transfection with siRNA, or after 72 h of incubation with zaragozic acid A, 2-14C-labeled acetate (57 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium of LNCaP cells (2 μCi/100-mm dish). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation. Lipids were extracted using the Bligh Dyer method as previously described (44Swinnen J.V. Van Veldhoven P.P. Esquenet M. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4468-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Acetate incorporation into cholesterol was analyzed after separation of lipids by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel G plates (Merck). To separate neutral lipids, plates were developed in hexanediethyl ether-acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v). Radiolabeled lipids were quantitated using a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). Values were normalized for sample protein content. For quantification of 2-[14C]acetate incorporation in lipid fractions separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, ∼3 million cells (exposed to 2-14C-labeled acetate for 4 h at 37 °C) were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended at 4 °C in a detergent lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (Merck), and protease inhibitors (Complete mini; Roche Applied Science). Detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble lipids were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described (45Swinnen J.V. Van Veldhoven P.P. Timmermans L. De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Vanderhoydonc F. Van de Sande T. Heemers H. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Lipids of each fraction were extracted using the Bligh Dyer method, and incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into cholesterol was analyzed by TLC (see above). Quantitation of Cholesterol Content in Lipid Fractions Separated by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Cellular fractions from sucrose density gradients (see above) were extracted using the Bligh Dyer method. Quantitation of free cholesterol in cellular fractions was based on the use of cholesterol oxidase and coupling of the produced hydrogen peroxide to the formation of the fluorescent dimer of homovanillic acid by means of peroxidase (45Swinnen J.V. Van Veldhoven P.P. Timmermans L. De Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Vanderhoydonc F. Van de Sande T. Heemers H. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Proliferation/Cytotoxicity Assays—At the indicated time after transfection with siRNA or after incubation with zaragozic acid A, cells were collected and cell number and viability were determined using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described previously (46Brusselmans K. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was quantitated using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Androgens Markedly Stimulate SQS Expression in Androgen-responsive Prostate Cancer Cells—To evaluate whether expression of the gene encoding SQS is regulated by androgens, different human prostate cancer cell lines were incubated for 48 h with or without R1881 (10–8m), a synthetic androgen that, unlike the natural androgens testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone, is metabolically stable. As shown in Fig. 2A, SQS mRNA expression was detected in all prostate cancer cell lines under androgen-deprived conditions. Exposure to R1881 induced a marked increase of SQS mRNA in the androgen-responsive cell lines LNCaP, PC-346c, and MDA-PCa-2a. In contrast, R1881 had no effect on SQS transcript levels in the androgen receptor-negative PC-3 and DU-145 cells (Fig. 2A). Androgens Increase SQS mRNA and Protein Levels in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—To analyze the androgen regulation of SQS gene expression in more detail, LNCaP cells were incubated with R1881 at different concentrations or for different periods of time. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrated that R1881 increased SQS expression at concentrations starting from 10–10m. Effects were maximal at 10–9m (Fig. 2B). At a concentration of 10–8m R1881, elevation of SQS expression occurred between 8 and 12 h after the addition of the steroid and reached a plateau between 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2C). Involvement of SREBP-binding Sites in the Androgen-induced Activation of SQS Promoter Activity—The human SQS promoter harbors three SREBP-binding sites (two SRE-1 motifs and an inverted SRE-3) and an auxiliary-binding site for NF-Y (inverted Y-box). The two SRE-1 sequences and the inverted SRE-3 have been demonstrated to bind SREBP-1 and/or SREBP-2 (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12526-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the inverted Y-box is also involved in sterol-mediated regulation of the SQS promoter (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12526-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previous promoter-reporter studies have revealed that mutation of the three SREBP-binding sites (two SRE-1 sites and the inverted SRE-3) in the SQS promoter (Fig. 3A) severely decreases reporter expression after SREBP overexpression (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12526-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of the first SRE-1 and the inverted SRE-3 together with the inverted Y-box (Fig. 3A) even further decreased SREBP-mediated reporter expression, which was almost completely abolished (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12526-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating that these three elements are essential for SREBP-mediated induction of SQS expression. To investigate whether the effects of androgens on SQS expression were mediated by SREBPs, we performed transient transfection experiments using promoter-reporter constructs derived from the human SQS gene (Fig. 3A). First, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct containing a 1-kb wild type promoter fragment of the human SQS gene in front of a luciferase reporter gene (pSQSwt-luc). Treatment of transfected cells with R1881 caused a marked increase in reporter activity (Fig. 3B). Then, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with the pSQSmut124-luc construct in which the three SREBP-binding sites (two SRE-1 sites and the inverted SRE-3) were mutated, or with the pSQSmut123-luc construct in which one SRE-1, the inverted SRE-3, and the inverted Y-box were mutated (Fig. 3A). Compared with the wild type construct pSQSwt-luc, androgen stimulation of the SQS promoter was decreased after transfection with pSQSmut124-luc (Fig. 3B). In agreement with previously obtained data (37Guan G. Dai P.H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2087998073,"In human mammary and prostate cancer cells, steroid hormones or epidermal growth factor (EGF) trigger association of the androgen receptor (AR)-estradiol receptor (ER) (alpha or beta) complex with Src. This interaction activates Src and affects the G1 to S cell cycle progression. In this report, we identify the sequence responsible for the AR/Src interaction and describe a 10 amino-acid peptide that inhibits this interaction. Treatment of the human prostate or mammary cancer cells (LNCaP or MCF-7, respectively) with nanomolar concentrations of this peptide inhibits the androgen- or estradiol-induced association between the AR or the ER and Src the Src/Erk pathway activation, cyclin D1 expression and DNA synthesis, without interfering in the receptor-dependent transcriptional activity. Similarly, the peptide prevents the S phase entry of LNCaP and MCF-7 cells treated with EGF as well as mouse embryo fibroblasts stimulated with androgen or EGF. Interestingly, the peptide does not inhibit the S phase entry and cytoskeletal changes induced by EGF or serum treatment of AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. The peptide is the first example of a specific inhibitor of steroid receptor-dependent signal transducing activity. The importance of these results is highlighted by the finding that the peptide strongly inhibits the growth of LNCaP xenografts established in nude mice."

PGs of pathogens and commensal bacteria may also be degraded by hydrolases of animal origin (lysozymes), which act as antimicrobials. The genetic mechanisms regulating PG resistance to hydrolytic degradation were dissected in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis. We found that the ability of L. lactis to counteract PG hydrolysis depends on the degree of acetylation. Overexpression of PG O-acetylase (encoded by oatA) led to bacterial growth arrest, indicating the potential lethality of oatA and a need for its tight regulation. A novel regulatory factor, SpxB (previously denoted as YneH), exerted a positive effect on oatA expression. Our results indicate that SpxB binding to RNA polymerase constitutes a previously missing link in the multistep response to cell envelope stress, provoked by PG hydrolysis with lysozyme. We suggest that the two-component system CesSR responds to this stress by inducing SpxB, thus favoring its interactions with RNA polymerase.

Daneo-Moore L. Kariyama R. Massidda O. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also responsible for cell shape, participates in cell division, and serves as support for attachment of other cell wall molecules such as teichoic acids, proteins, and exopolysaccharides (3Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The bacterial PG is a giant multilayer polymer that envelops the cell as a rigid sacculus. It is composed of N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide pentapeptide blocks that are synthesized intracellularly and transported through the cytoplasmic membrane as lipid-disaccharide pentapeptides. These blocks are covalently linked to the pre-existing PG polymers by high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (4Matsuhashi M. Ghuysen J.M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 55-71Google Scholar). To allow cell division and surface expansion, the rigid PG sacculus has to be relaxed. This is achieved by PG ruptures, which could be introduced in several ways. First, not all possible covalent bonds are formed during PG synthesis; for example, only 36% of possible PG cross-links between stem peptides are formed in Lactococcus lactis (5Courtin P. Miranda G. Guillot A. Wessner F. Mezange C. Domakova E. Kulakauskas S. Chapot-Chartier M.-P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5293-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bacteria also possess a number of endogenous bacterial enzymes (collectively called autolysins) that disrupt PG and can result in cell lysis. According to their hydrolytic bond specificity and products, autolysins are classified as muramidases, lytic transglycosylases, glucosaminidases, amidases, and peptidases (6Foster S.J. Popham D.L. Sonenstein A.L. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 21-41Google Scholar). Bacteria often possess several autolysins, e.g. L. lactis encodes a main autolysin (N-acetylglucosaminidase AcmA) (7Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4142-4148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human or animal host, antimicrobial PG lytic enzymes such as lysozyme constitute a first line of defense against infection. Bactericidal properties of lysozyme are attributed to its N-acetylmuramidase activity. Human body fluids such as tears, saliva, and milk contain 2.6, 0.13, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, respectively (12Masschalck B. Michiels C.W. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 29: 191-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). As the name suggests, autolysins have potentially suicidal activities and must be exquisitely well regulated. Regulation of PG hydrolysis is also important with regard to the proposed role of PG hydrolases in resuscitation from the dormant state (13Telkov M.V. Demina G.R. Voloshin S.A. Salina E.G. Dudik T.V. Stekhanova T.N. Mukamolova G.V. Kazaryan K.A. Goncharenko A.V. Young M. Kaprelyants A.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2006; 71: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Mukamolova G.V.

Numerous studies indicate that PG resistance to hydrolysis is effectuated via acetylation. PG acetylation occurs at N-2 of either N-acetylglucosaminyl or N-acetylmuramyl residues (N-acetylation) or at the C-6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylmuramyl residues (O-acetylation) (15Clarke A.J. Dupont C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). N-Acetylation proceeds during precursor synthesis prior to transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and incorporation into PG. However, >80% of the glucosamine and 10% of the muramic acid residues are not acetylated in Streptococcus pneumoniae PG, suggesting the presence of deacetylation activities. This was confirmed, as a pgdA gene was identified as encoding the PG N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase; the pgdA mutant produced fully N-acetylated PG and became hypersensitive to lysozyme (16Vollmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PG N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase was also described in Bacillus cereus (17Psylinakis E. Boneca I.G. Mavromatis K. Deli A. Hayhurst E. Foster S.J. Varum K.M. Bouriotis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30856-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis was shown to possess the PG N-acetylmuramic acid deacetylase PdaA (18Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to N-acetylation, O-acetylation occurs after nascent PG strands are attached to the cell wall. The gene oatA (encoding PG O-acetyltransferase) was identified in Staphylococcus aureus; an oatA mutant showed increased sensitivity to lysozyme (19Bera A. Herbert S. Jakob A. Vollmer W. Gotz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The analogous mutant was later isolated in S. pneumoniae and named adr for its attenuation of the drug (penicillin) resistance phenotype (20Crisostomo M.I. Vollmer W. Kharat A.S. Inhulsen S. Gehre F. Buckenmaier S. Tomasz A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The concerted action of PG O-acetyltransferases and O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterases was proposed to participate in the control of PG degradation (21Weadge J.T. Pfeffer J.M. Clarke A.J. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although the genetic mechanisms of such regulation remain unknown. In this study, we developed an in vivo screen for functions affecting PG modifications, which allowed us to identify a homolog of the staphylococcal oatA gene, encoding an O-acetylase in the non-pathogenic Gram-positive food bacterium L. lactis. Control of O-acetylation was found to occur via a newly identified regulator, SpxB (previously designated as YneH). Our results indicate that SpxB is induced by the two-component regulatory system CesSR, which reacts to cell envelope stress. Growth Conditions and Bacterial Strains—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (BD Biosciences, Le Pont-de-Claix, France) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17 medium). Erythromycin (2.5 μg/ml), tetracycline (2.5 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml; all from Sigma, Saint-Quentin, France) were added as needed. Nisin was prepared in Me2SO (Sigma) and added at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. For growth curve measurements, overnight cultures grown in the presence of antibiotics were diluted 100-fold in fresh GM17 medium without antibiotic, distributed in Serowell microtiter plates (200 μl/well; Barloworld Scientific Ltd., Stone, UK), and incubated at 30 °C. Growth was followed by spectrophotometric absorbance measurements at 600 nm (Model EL808 spectrophotometer, BioTek Instruments, Inc., Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Escherichia coli was grown in LB medium (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin or 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol as needed.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this study and their relevant genetic propertiesRelevant genotypeRef./sourceStrainL. lactisMG1363Plasmid-free strain59Gasson M.J.

For the lysozyme resistance test, a 10-fold concentrated hen egg white lysozyme solution (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was freshly prepared in GM17 medium and then diluted 10-fold in melted GM17 agar (1.5%) at 45 °C. Overnight bacterial cultures were successively diluted 10-fold, and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted on GM17 agar plates supplemented with different concentrations of lysozyme. Preparation of L. lactis Genomic DNA Libraries—Three genomic libraries were constructed after chromosomal DNA digestions with HindIII, NspI, or TaqI restriction endonuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Digested genomic DNA fragments were inserted into the recipient vector pVE3916, a pNZ8020 derivative that replicates in both E. coli and Gram-positive bacteria and that has a copy number of ∼30 in L. lactis. 8T. Rochat and P. Langella, unpublished data. For this purpose, genomic DNA was totally digested with NspI or HindIII or partially digested with TaqI for 5 min at 37 °C and ligated with linearized HindIII, NspI, or ClaI and dephosphorylated pVE3916. T4 DNA ligase and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli TG1, and transformants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Colony PCR was performed on transformants to estimate genomic DNA insertion frequency. For the HindIII and TaqI libraries, we used primers BankS (5′-TGAGATAATGCCGACTGTA-3′) and BankAS (5′-CATGCTGAAGAGCATCTC-3′). For the NspI library, we used primers BankS and BankAS2 (5′-ACGCTCAAGGGCTTTTACG-3′). Insertion frequencies were estimated to be 50, 88, and 67% for the HindIII, NspI, and TaqI libraries, respectively, whereas average insert sizes were estimated to be 1.3, 1.6, and 1.7 kilobase pairs, respectively. Approximately 13,000, 16,200, and 12,000 clones for the HindIII, NspI, and TaqI libraries, respectively, were harvested from plates in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 25% sucrose. Plasmid extraction from each library was performed using a Midi-Prep kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Selection of Plasmids Carrying L. lactis Lysozyme Resistance Determinants—L. lactis MG1363 was transformed with each genomic library and plated on GM17 agar supplemented with 3 mg/ml lysozyme (Fluka) and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. We selected 32, 32, and 14 lysozyme-resistant clones resulting from transformation with the NspI, HindIII, and TaqI libraries, respectively. For each clone, the genomic DNA insert was verified by colony PCR using primers BankS and BankAS2. 22 and 26 of the 32 tested clones from the HindIII and NspI libraries were shown to have the same insert size (∼1870 and 3138 bp, respectively). Plasmid DNA corresponding to one clone of each library was sequenced using primers BankS and BankAS2. Reactions for DNA sequence determination were performed according to the protocol of the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) using a MegaBACE 1000 automated capillary sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). The repeated 1870-bp insert from the NspI library contained the xynD gene, and the repeated 3138-bp insert from the HindIII library contained the pabB and spxB yneG genes. The plasmids carrying these inserts were named pVES3787 and pVES3801, respectively, and retained for further work. Other isolated lysozyme-resistant clones were confirmed to carry xynD and spxB yneG inserts by colony PCR using BankS and BankAS2 as vector-specific primers and a specific primer for the xynD or spxB gene. To obtain in-frame deletions of the spxB, yneG, and pabB genes in plasmid pVES3801, we used an inverse PCR strategy. For deletion of pabB, the fragment of pVES3801 was PCR-amplified using primers YGH1-XmaI (5′-AAAAACCCGGGCGTAAAAGCCCTTGAGCG-3′; restriction sites present on primers are underlined throughout) and YGH2-XmaI (5′-AAAAACCCGGGTACTTATTTGGATTGGTTCGG-3′) and the Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The PCR fragment was digested with XmaI, self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into L. lactis MG1363. Plasmid pVES3902 deleted for pabB was obtained from a chloramphenicol-resistant clone. The same strategy was used to delete the spxB or yneG gene from pVES3902. We used primers iYH1-BamHI (5′-AAAAAGGATCCCTCAGCTGACTGATTTGAAC-3′) and iYH2 (5′-AAAAAGGATCCCGTACTTTTATTCCTTGGCG-3′) to inactivate spxB and primers iYG1-BamHI (5′-AAAAAGGATCCGAATTCGGGAATTTCTCTCTC-3′) and iYG2-BamHI (5′-AAAAAGGATCCGGTTGTCAGGATTGTTCTTG-3′) to inactivate yneG. The PCR fragments obtained were digested with BamHI, self-ligated, and transformed into MG1363, giving rise to plasmids pVES3908 (spxB– yneG+) and pVES3910 (spxB+ yneG–), respectively. Chromosomal Gene Inactivation—For inactivation of the mtlA, pepN, oatA, and xynD genes in the L. lactis MG1363 chromosome, we used a strategy based on gene disruption by single cross-over plasmid insertion. For this, internal fragments of each gene were PCR-amplified from L. lactis MG1363 chromosomal DNA using the following primer pairs: mtlA10-EcoRI (5′-ATGATGGAATTCGTGTTGACGATGTTCTTCAT-3′) and mtlA11-XmaI (5′-ATGATGCCCGGGCATTTCAAGGCCCGCTTTAA-3′), pepN1-XmaI (5′-ATGATGCCCGGGACTTCAACAAAGTTCGCGCT-3′) and pepN2-EcoRI (5′-ATGATGGAATTCACAATGATGTCGCCTTCTTC-3′), yvhB1-EcoRI (5′-ATGATGGAATTCCTTTATCACCTCTGGCCAAAT-3′) and yvhB2-XmaI (5′-ATGATGCCCGGGCAGCGAAGTAAGAACTTCCT-3′), and xynD1-SmaI (5′-AAACCCGGGAGTTCGTAAGCAGA-3′) and xynD2-EcoRI (5′-CCCGAATTCTGAGGAGTGGTAGT-3′). PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XmaI, ligated to pRV300 (22Leloup L. Ehrlich S.D. Zagorec M. Morel-Deville F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously digested with EcoRI and XmaI enzymes, and transformed into E. coli HB101. Plasmids pVES4258, pVES4341, pVES4260, and pVES4533, carrying fragments of mtlA (327 bp), pepN (313 bp), oatA (316 bp), and pdgA (459 bp), respectively, were isolated as ampicillin-resistant transformants (Table 1). Plasmids pVES4258, pVES4341, and pVES4260, containing an internal fragment of mtlA, pepN, and oatA, respectively, were transformed into L. lactis strain MG1363. Single cross-over insertion mutants were selected on GM17 agar plates containing erythromycin (5 μg/ml) and verified by PCR. An in-frame deletion of the internal 425-bp fragment of the spxB gene was constructed using the pORI280 (lacZ+)/pVE6007 two-plasmid system (23Law J. Buist G. Haandrikman A. Kok J. Venema G. Leenhouts K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7011-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). First, a fragment of the spxB gene situated upstream of the deletion site was PCR-amplified from L. lactis MG1363 genomic DNA using primer pair yneGH6-XbaI (5′-ATGATATCTAGACAAACTTTCAGGTCCTGATT-3′) and yneGH5-XmaI (5′-ATGATACCCGGGCTCAGCTGACTGATTTGAAC-3′). The PCR-amplified region was ligated to an XbaI-XmaI digest of pORI280, and the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli JIM4646, which carries a chromosomal copy of repA, required for pORI280 replication. A derivative of pORI280 carrying an spxB upstream fragment was obtained as an erythromycin (100 μg/ml)-resistant transformant. Second, a fragment of the spxB gene situated downstream of the deletion site was PCR-amplified from MG1363 genomic DNA using primer pair yneGH4-XmaI (5′-ATGATACCCGGG TTTATTCCTTGGCGCCTTC-3′) and yneGH1-BglII (5′-ATGATATAGATCTCGAAAGAACAAAAAATGCGC-3′). The amplified region was digested with the corresponding restriction endonucleases and then ligated to a BglII-XmaI digest of the pORI280 derivative containing the spxB upstream region, and the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli JIM4646. The resulting plasmid pVES4196 was transformed into an MG1363 derivative carrying pVE6007, a thermosensitive plasmid encoding a chloramphenicol resistance determinant, selecting for erythromycin (2.5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (2.5 μg/ml). Integration of plasmid pVES4196 in the resulting strain was obtained after overnight growth in GM17 liquid medium supplemented with erythromycin at 37 °C, a non-permissive temperature for pVE6007 replication. The culture was then plated on GM17 agar with erythromycin, and four independent chloramphenicol-sensitive clones were isolated and grown on GM17 medium without antibiotics for at least 100 generations. Strain VES4284 (ΔspxB) was then selected as a white colony on GM17 agar supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) and verified by PCR. For construction of the MG1363ΔtrmA strain, primer pair F1-forward (5′-CGGAATTCGGCTTGATTGTTCAATAACGG-3′) and F1-reverse (5′-CGGGATCCTTTGCCTTCTGTAACTCTCG-3′) was used to amplify the 720-bp fragment just upstream of the trmA start codon (called fn). Primer pair F2-forward (5′-CGGGATCCGACGAAAAACGTCTTCATGTAGG-3′) and F2-reverse (5′-GCTCTAGAGTTGTTCAAGAAGAAAGTGAATGG-3′) was used to amplify a 535-bp fragment including the end of trmA and the downstream region (called FC). The PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI-BamHI and BamHI-XbaI, respectively, and ligated to EcoRI-XbaI-digested pBluescript-KS+ (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The resulting plasmid containing the ligated fn-FC fragment was denoted pΔtrmA. Subsequently, a 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment containing the erythromycin resistance gene was cloned into pΔtrmA, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into MG1363. One transformant resulting from plasmid integration via FC was selected and verified by PCR. Inactivation of trmA increases the heat tolerance of MG1363 (25Frees D. Varmanen P. Ingmer H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, to enrich for bacteria carrying a chromosomal deletion of trmA as a result of plasmid excision (via fn), bacteria were grown for 3 h at 40 °C, serially diluted, and spread on GM17 plates that were incubated overnight at 38 °C. This procedure resulted in a high proportion of erythromycin-sensitive colonies that all carried the chromosomal deletion of trmA as verified by PCR using primers clpP-tag (5′-CCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTTTAATCAATTATTTTCCATAATTTCATC-3′) and hypC (5′-GCTGAACGCAATCGAGCTCCAC-3′). Cloning of oatA—A DNA fragment containing the oatA gene and its promoter region was PCR-amplified using the high fidelity enzyme Pfx (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and primers yvhB5-kpnI (5′-CGGCGGGGTACCTACGACTGGAAATACTCCAG-3′) and yvhB6-BamHI (5′-CGGCGGGGATCCCTTTCGCTACTGATGAAAGA-3′). The PCR fragment was inserted into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations, resulting in plasmid pVES4000, with XhoI and NspI restriction sites around the inserted fragment. The XhoI-NspI fragment of pVES4000 was ligated to an XhoI-NspI digest of pVE3916, with subsequent transformation into JIM4646. The resulting plasmid (carrying the oatA gene) was obtained as a chloramphenicol-resistant clone and named pVES4375. To substitute the oatA native promoter with the Pnis promoter (26Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar), pVES4448 minus the oatA native promoter sequence was amplified by inverse PCR with primers pVE1-BglII (5′-ATGATGAAGATCTGGAGCTGTAATATAA-3′) and pVE2-XhoI (5′-ATGATGCTCGAGTGAAGCGTTACGTCACAGG-3′) using Phusion high fidelity enzyme. PnisA was PCR-amplified from a derivative of pNZ8048 using primers Pnis1-BglII (5′-TACAGCTCCAAGATCTAGTC-3′) and Pnis2-XhoI (5′-ATGATGCTCGAGTGCCTCCTTATAATTTAT-3′). Both PCR fragments were digested with BglII and XhoI, mixed, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli TG1 repA, and plasmid pVES5540 (carrying oatA under the control of the Pnis promoter) was obtained as a chloramphenicol-resistant clone.

https://openalex.org/W2086349829,"Protein kinase CK2 is an ubiquitous and constitutively active kinase, which phosphorylates many cellular proteins and is implicated in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and transformation. We investigated its possible involvement in the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) by analysing its level in two variants of CEM cells, namely S-CEM and R-CEM, normally sensitive or resistant to chemical apoptosis, respectively. We found that, while the CK2 regulatory subunit β was equally expressed in the two cell variants, CK2α catalytic subunit was higher in R-CEM and this was accompanied by a higher phosphorylation of endogenous protein substrates. Pharmacological downregulation of CK2 activity by a panel of specific inhibitors, or knockdown of CK2α expression by RNA interference, were able to induce cell death in R-CEM. CK2 inhibitors could promote an increased uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs inside the cells and sensitize them to drug-induced apoptosis in a co-operative manner. CK2 blockade was also effective in inducing cell death of a different MDR line (U2OS). We therefore conclude that inhibition of CK2 can be considered as a promising tool to revert the MDR phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2004926324,"Inhibitors of the energy metabolism, such as sodium azide and valinomycin, render yeast cells completely resistant against the killing action of a number of cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the salivary antimicrobial peptide Histatin 5. In this study the Histatin 5-mediated killing of the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans was used as a model system to comprehensively investigate the molecular basis underlying this phenomenon. Using confocal and electron microscopy it was demonstrated that the energy poison azide reversibly blocked the entry of Histatin 5 at the level of the yeast cell wall. Azide treatment hardly induced depolarization of the yeast cell membrane potential, excluding it as a cause of the lowered sensitivity. In contrast, the diminished sensitivity to Histatin 5 of energy-depleted C. albicans was restored by increasing the fluidity of the membrane using the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol. Furthermore, rigidification of the membrane by incubation at low temperature or in the presence of the membrane rigidifier Me2SO increased the resistance against Histatin 5, while not affecting the energy charge of the cell. In line, azide induced alterations in the physical state of the interior of the lipid bilayer. These data demonstrate that changes in the physical state of the membrane underlie the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides.

These data demonstrate that changes in the physical state of the membrane underlie the increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides. In the last few decades an expanding number of antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from virtually all classes of organisms, where they play an important role in the innate defense against microbial and viral infections. Characterization of these peptides has revealed a wide diversity in amino acid sequences, yet they share characteristic features; they are usually polycationic and amphipathic, containing both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic side. This promotes their insertion into and transmigration over the cytoplasmic membrane of the target cell, with killing of the cell as a final consequence. Interestingly, cellular sensitivity to cationic proteins and peptides such as salivary histatins and defensins is diminished by conditions that affect the energy status of the target cell (1Olson V.L.

This effect is not restricted to cationic peptides, because azoles are also sensitive to the energy status of Candida glabrata (7Brun S. Aubry C. Lima O. Filmon R. Berges T. Chabasso D. Bouchara J-P.

In Chlorella metabolic inhibition abolishes the membrane-disruptive effects of the polyene nystatin and even of the detergent Triton X-100 (8Komor E. Weber H. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As explanation for the desensitizing effects of energy depletion, it has been proposed that interaction of cationic peptides with the target cell would involve active transport systems, which for their activity are dependent on the energy charge of the cell (1Olson V.L. Hansing R.L. McClary D.O. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Aspedon A. Groisman E.A.

However, direct experimental proof corroborating this hypothesis is still lacking.The present study addresses the question of how on a molecular level the energy metabolism is linked with the sensitivity of the Candida cell to antimicrobial peptides. Thus far, many different types of mechanisms have been identified that contribute to an acquired drug-resistant phenotype in yeast cells, including the overexpression of energy-driven efflux pumps, mutations in the target enzyme, or alterations in biosynthetic pathways (13White T.C. Marr K.A. Bowden R.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 382-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resistance induced by energy depletion seems fundamentally different from these mechanisms, because it is a direct response to a physiological stress condition, which protects the yeast against a range of natural and pharmacological anti-fungal agents. Thus, elucidation of this molecular resistance mechanism not only will deepen our insight in the working mechanism of antimicrobial peptides but will aid in the development of (non)peptide therapeutics that are suited for fighting infections under energy-restricted conditions, such as in biofilms.The Histatin 5 (Hst5) 2The abbreviations used are: Hst5, Histatin 5; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PPB, potassium phosphate buffer; PI, propidium iodide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; DPH, diphenylhexatriene. 2The abbreviations used are: Hst5, Histatin 5; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PPB, potassium phosphate buffer; PI, propidium iodide; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; DPH, diphenylhexatriene.-mediated killing of Candida albicans is used in the present study as a model system to comprehensively investigate the different aspects of the peptide-target cell interaction, including the role of the cell wall, the membrane potential, and the physical state of the membrane, in relation to the energy charge of the cell. We found that energy depletion induced a decrease in membrane fluidity, which was reversed by the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol. In line, the increased resistance of energy-depleted C. albicans against Hst5 was reversed by the membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol, without restoration of the energy charge of the cell. On the other hand, inducing increased membrane rigidity by lowering the temperature or by treatment with a membrane-rigidifying agent led to an increased resistance against Hst5. It is hypothesized that the actin cytoskeleton, which is highly sensitive to the energy charge of the cell mediates the effect, because the cytoskeleton inhibitor jasplakinolide also induced resistance to Hst5.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and FITC Labeling of the Peptides—Peptides (see Table 1) were manufactured by solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry with a MilliGen 9050 peptide synthesizer (Milligen-Biosearch, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's procedures. N-α-Fmoc protected amino acids and preloaded polyethylene glycol-polystyrene supports were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to a purity of at least 90%, and the authenticity of the peptides was confirmed by ion trap mass spectrometry with a LCQ Deca XP (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). FITC labeling of Hst5 and Dhvar5 was performed as described previously (3Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7286-7291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The labeled peptides were designated F-Hst5 and F-Dhvar5, respectively. Both in the viability assay and in the propidium iodide assay, fluoresceinlabeled peptides exhibited comparable activities against C. albicans as the parent peptides.TABLE 1The effect of energy depletion on the activity of various antimicrobial peptidesPeptideSequenceLC50NaClNaN3μmHistatin 5DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY1.1>100F-Histatin 53.0>100Dh5 (11-24)KRKFHEKHHSHRGY2.5>100P-113 (4-15)AKRHHGYKRKFH2.7>100P-113Dakrhhgykrkfh2.4>100Dhvar4KRLFKKLLKFSLRKY0.10.2Dhvar5LLLFLLKKRKKRKY210F-Dhvar52.56.5LFampin 265-284DLIWKLLSKAQEKFGKNKSR0.82.0LFcin 17-30FKCRRWQWRMKKLG0.5>40Drosocin-1GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV3.5>100Drosocin-4GKPRPYTPRPTSHPRPIRV2.3>100 Open table in a new tab Growth Conditions—C. albicans (ATCC 10231) cultured aerobically at 30 °C on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) was suspended in 25 ml of Sabouraud dextrose broth in a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask. After 20 h of incubation at 30 °C, 1 ml from this suspension was subcultured for 1–2 h in 20 ml of Sabouraud dextrose broth to obtain a mid-log phase culture. The cells were washed twice in 1 mm potassium phosphate (PPB) and resuspended to a cell density of 2 McFarland (∼107 cells/ml).Spheroplast Preparation—One gram (wet weight) of C. albicans of a mid-log phase culture was suspended in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), supplemented with 100 mm EDTA (TE buffer) and incubated for 45 min with β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were washed and suspended in 4 ml of TE buffer, supplemented with 1 m sorbitol, and incubated with 100 μl zymolase (50 units). After treatment, more than 90% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts, as determined by counting cells after lysis in distilled water. The spheroplasts were resuspended in PPB supplemented with 0.5 m sorbitol as osmoprotectant.Determination of the Membrane-disruptive Activity of Peptides (PI Assay)—Membrane-disruptive activity of peptides was determined by monitoring the fluorescence enhancement of propidium iodide (Invitrogen) in peptide-treated cells, as described previously (14Veerman E.C.I. Nazmi K. Van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G.M. Den Hertog A.L. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The membrane impermeant PI only enters membrane-compromised cells, after which the fluorescence of this probe is enhanced by 20–30-fold because of its binding to nucleic acids. Cell suspensions were mixed with the indicated agents and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (unless indicated otherwise) with gentle shaking. NaN3 was dissolved in PPB; cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in methanol; and rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich), valinomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), latrunculin B (MP Biomedicals), and jasplakinolide (Invitrogen) were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted prior to use. The final concentrations of methanol and Me2SO did not exceed 0.1%. Controls were incubated with PPB supplemented with appropriate volumes of the corresponding vehicle (Me2SO or methanol) alone. Cell suspensions were supplemented with PI (final concentration, 10 μm) and subsequently added to 2-fold serial dilutions of peptides. PI fluorescence was measured at 5-min intervals for 1 h, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 544 and 620 nm, respectively, in a Fluostar Galaxy microplate fluorimeter (BMFG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). Afterward, the numbers of surviving cells were determined by plating aliquots on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates and counting colony-forming units, as described below.Candidacidal Activity of Peptides—The effects of the various agents and treatments on the viability of C. albicans were determined in a microdilution viability assay, essentially as described previously (3Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7286-7291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In brief, 50-μl aliquots from a mid-log phase culture of C. albicans were incubated with equal volumes of peptide solutions (0.3–100 μm) and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The incubation mixtures were appropriately diluted (200–500-fold) in phosphate-buffered saline, and 25-μl aliquots were plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. After 48 h of incubation at 30 °C, the numbers of colony-forming units were counted.DiSC3(5) Fluorescence to Monitor Membrane Potential—Induction of release of the fluorescent probe DiSC3(5) (Invitrogen) was monitored to study the effect of azide on the membrane potential of C. albicans (15Eddy A.A. Hopkins P.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). C. albicans (∼107 cells/ml) in PPB were incubated with a final concentration of 1.6 μm DiSC3(5) at 30 °C until a constant fluorescence level was achieved (after approximately 10 min). Next either 5 mm NaN3 or 5 mm NaCl (control experiment) was added, followed by an excess of Hst5. An excess of Dhvar4 (8 times its LC50 value) was added to achieve complete dissipation of the cytoplasmic membrane potential. Changes in peptide-mediated fluorescence intensity were monitored with a Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer).FACS Analysis—FACS analysis was performed essentially as described previously (3Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7286-7291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). C. albicans (∼107 cells/ml) were preincubated in PPB with 5 mm NaN3 at 30 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, equipotent concentrations of FITC-labeled peptides were added (65.5 μm F-Hst5 or 17 μm F-Dhvar5), and incubation was continued for another 15 min. The cells were washed twice with PPB with NaN3, suspended to a density of ∼107 cells/ml, and diluted 10-fold in the same buffer before use. Cell-associated fluorescence was measured with a FACS apparatus (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using a 15 mm argon laser at 488 nm for excitation and a 530-nm filter for detection of emitted light. In the control experiment, cells the were treated the same way, except that NaN3 was replaced by NaCl.Confocal Microscopy—C. albicans (∼107 cells/ml) were preincubated with PPB with NaN3 at 37 °C for 15 min. FITC-labeled peptides were added (final F-Hst5 concentration, 65 μm; final F-Dhvar5 concentration, 17 μm), and incubation was continued for another 15 min. To remove unbound peptide, the cells were washed with PPB with NaN3, centrifuged (5 min at 10,000 × g), and resuspended in the same buffer. The resulting suspensions were divided into two equal volumes, which were centrifuged (5 min at 10,000 × g) and of which one pellet was resuspended in PPB with NaN3, the other in PPB with NaCl. Cells treated with Hst5 or Dhvar5 in PPB with NaCl served as positive controls. The cells were examined with a Leica TCS NT confocal system (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an argon/krypton laser and a 100× NA 1.4 object lens.Electron Microscopy—Ultrastructural localization was examined using immunogold-labeling and transmission electron microscopy as described previously (6Ruissen A.L.A. Groenink J. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Van Marle J. Van Veen H. Voorhout W.F. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). C. albicans (∼107 cells/ml) were preincubated with either PPB with NaN3 or PPB with NaCl and incubated with 65.5 μm F-Hst5, or 17 μm F-Dhvar5 at 37 °C for 15 min. Fixation, preparation of cryo-sections, and incubation with gold-labeled mouse anti-FITC antibodies (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) were performed as described previously (6Ruissen A.L.A. Groenink J. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Van Marle J. Van Veen H. Voorhout W.F. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cells were examined using a Philips EM-420 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).Determination of the Adenine Nucleotide Content of C. albicans—Cellular content of adenine nucleotides was determined as previously described (14Veerman E.C.I. Nazmi K. Van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G.M. Den Hertog A.L. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In short, C. albicans (∼107 cells/ml) were suspended in PPB supplemented with 5 μg/ml guanosine bromide as internal standard. After treatment with various agents or incubation under various conditions, 400 μl of the cell suspension (in duplicate) was transferred to 80% boiling ethanol, buffered with 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) (16Gonzales B. François J. Renaud B. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) to lyse the cells, and boiled for 3 min. After freeze-drying, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of distilled water and centrifuged (10 min at 10,000 × g). Aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis with a BioFocus 2000 capillary electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad), equipped with an uncoated fused-silica capillary (internal diameter, 50 μm; length, 50 cm).Kinetics of azide-induced effects on the adenine nucleotide composition were determined in the same way using NaN3 (final concentration, 5 mm) in the incubation buffer. At different time intervals 400-μl aliquots were taken and transferred into buffered boiling ethanol and processed as described above. The control incubations were carried out in the same way, except that NaCl was added instead of NaN3.To monitor the reversibility of the effect of azide on the intracellular adenine nucleotide composition, the cells were incubated with 5 mm NaN3 for 30 min. Then 400-μl aliquots (in duplicate) were taken and processed as described above. Subsequently, NaN3 was removed by washing twice in 9 ml of PPB. From the resulting suspension 400-μl aliquots (in duplicate) were taken at different time intervals and processed as described above for measurement of the adenine nucleotide content in comparison with the initial content.Fluorescence Anisotropy of DPH—The effect of energy poisons on the physical state of the yeast plasma membrane was measured in whole cells using the membrane fluidity probe DPH as described previously (17Obrénovitch A. Sené C. Nègre M-T. Monsigny M. FEBS Lett. 1978; 88: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Kuhry J.G. Duportail G. Bronner C. Laustriat G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In short, a mid-log phase culture of C. albicans was washed twice and then suspended in PPB to a density of 8 mg/ml wet weight. The cells were incubated at 20 °C for 5 min, and the DPH was added to a final concentration of 2 μm. The same volume of the solvent (Me2SO) was added to the control cells. Incubation was continued for 20 min at 20 °C, after which the cells were washed twice with PPB. Subsequently the DPH-treated cells were suspended in the same volume of PPB supplemented with 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm NaN3 with 50 mm benzyl alcohol, PPB with 50 mm benzyl alcohol, and PPB with 5% (v/v) Me2SO, respectively. Immediately thereafter, fluorescence emission anisotropy measurements were performed in a 1-cm quartz cuvette on a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France) in the right angle conformation. The optical densities of the samples were kept low to avoid inner filter effects. The samples were stirred continuously throughout the measurements. Upon 365-nm excitation, emission wavelengths were scanned from 422 to 432 nm using emission and excitation slits of 4.5 nm. In the 422–432-nm wavelength range, the value for fluorescence anisotropy of DPH is constant (19Patra D. J. Appl. Spectrosc. 2004; 71: 334-338Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The temperature of the samples was maintained at 30 or 4 °C using a thermostatted water bath. All four combinations of vertically and horizontally polarized excitation and emission light were measured, and the fluorescence anisotropy (r) was automatically calculated. Anisotropy values of three repeated measurements of various conditions were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc multicomparison with Tukey test. The data were analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.RESULTSEffect of Energy Metabolism on Candidacidal Activities of Antimicrobial Peptides—In previous studies we found that Hst5 accumulates in the mitochondria of C. albicans (3Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M. Veerman E.C.I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. J. Biol.

Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because treatment with mitochondrial poisons such as sodium azide renders C. albicans cells insensitive to Hst5 (3Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. Van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M.

J. 2001; 356: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it was tempting to speculate about a causative relationship between the cellular target of the peptide and the desensitizing effects of azide. Therefore, we addressed the issue of whether the effects of azide and other energy poisons were specific for Hst5 and tested a number of structurally different peptides for their sensitivity to azide: (i) Hst5 and Hst5-derived peptides, including dh5 (residues 11–24), Dhvar4 (a multi-substituted variant of dh5), P-113 (encompassing residues 4–15 of Hst5), and its D-enantiomer P-113D; (ii) the bovine lactoferrin-derived peptides (21Van der Kraan M.I.A. Van Marle J. Nazmi K. Groenink J. Van 't Hof W. Veerman E.C.I. Bolscher J.G.M. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Peptides. 2006; 26: 1537-1542Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) LFcin 17–30 and LFampin 265–284; (iii) drosocin and a drosocin variant (22Bikker F.J. Kaman-van Zanten W.E. De Vries-Van de Ruit A.-M.B.C. Voskamp-Visser I. Van Hooft P.A.V. Mars-Groenendijk R.H. De Visser P.C. Noort D. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2006; 68: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); and (iv) the artificial peptide Dhvar5. The peptides were tested in a viability assay as well as in a microtiter plate assay using PI to monitor their membranolytic effects. The membrane-impermeant PI only enters membrane-compromised cells, after which the fluorescence of this probe is enhanced by 20–30-fold because of its binding to nucleic acids. The candidacidal activities (Table 1) and the membranolytic activities of all peptides tested were inhibited in the presence of azide. Differences in sensitivity to azide, however, were noted: Hst5, dh5, both P-113 and its enantiomer P-113D, LFcin 17–30, and the drosocin peptides were completely inactive in the presence of azide. On the other hand, Dhvar5 and LFampin 265–284 were intermediately active, whereas the activity of Dhvar4 was marginally diminished (Table 1). These results were mirrored in the membranolytic assays with PI (not shown). This was in line with previous results showing that peptide-mediated PI uptake is accompanied by leakage of vital cell constituents, including ATP and other adenine nucleotides, resulting in cell death (14Veerman E.C.I. Nazmi K. Van't Hof W. Bolscher J.G.M. Den Hertog A.L. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).We decided to use the extremely azide-sensitive Hst5 as a model peptide to explore the molecular basis underlying the apparent correlation between the energy metabolism of the yeast cell and its sensitivity for antimicrobial peptides. In parallel, the effect on the intracellular adenine nucleotide content was systematically monitored. The addition of azide virtually instantaneously inhibited Hst5-mediated influx of PI (Fig. 1A), and concomitantly depleted the energy charge of the cell (Fig. 2A). These effects were readily reversed after washing out of the energy poison (Figs. 1B and 2B). This illustrated that the sensitivity of the cell to Hst5 was closely linked with its energy charge. Other energy poisons such as the potassium ionophore valinomycin and the protonophore CCCP likewise depleted the energy charge of the cell and blocked the Hst5-mediated PI influx (Figs. 1C and 2C). The inhibitory effects of these energy poisons were also confirmed in viability assays (not shown).FIGURE 2The effect of energy poisons on the energy charge of C. albicans.

It has been proposed that in the first stage, Hst5 associates transiently with a putative receptor at the cell wall (23Li X.W.S. Sun J.N.N. Okamoto-Shibayama K. Edgerton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22453-22463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is followed by transmigration over the membrane and accumulation in the cell. To identify the step in the killing process that is sensitive to the energy charge of the yeast cell, we examined the effect of azide on the association between F-Hst5 and C. albicans by FACScan analysis (Fig. 3). Introduction of the fluorescein group marginally influences the candidacidal and membrane disrupting activity of the peptides (Table 1). To compensate for ionic strength effects caused by the presence of sodium and azide ions, the incubations without sodium azide were carried out in PPB supplemented with an equimolar concentration of sodium chloride. After incubation with F-Hst5 in the absence of azide, the cell-associated fluorescence increased to a value that was a thousand times higher than that of control cells, which had been incubated with either a fluoresceintagged irrelevant peptide or without any peptide. The cells treated with F-Hst5 in PPB with NaN3 exhibited a 100-fold lower fluorescence, but this was still ∼10-fold higher than that of the negative control. This flu"

Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 and CDK4/6 by p21 leads to dephosphorylation and activation of Rb. We now show that ectopic p21 expression in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells causes not only dephosphorylation but also depletion of Rb; this effect was p53-independent and susceptible to a proteasome inhibitor. CDK inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B) also caused Rb dephosphorylation and depletion, but another CDK inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A) induced only dephosphorylation but not depletion of Rb. Rb depletion was observed in both HT1080 and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, where p21 was induced by DNA-damaging agents. Rb depletion after DNA damage did not occur in the absence of p21, and it was reduced when p21 induction was inhibited by p21-targeting short hairpin RNA or by a transdominant inhibitor of p53. These results indicate that p21 both activates Rb through dephosphorylation and inactivates it through degradation, suggesting negative feedback regulation of damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoint arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1995640803,"ATP-binding cassette transporters perform energy-dependent transmembrane solute trafficking in all organisms. These proteins often mediate cellular resistance to therapeutic drugs and are involved in a range of human genetic diseases. Enzymological studies have implicated a helical subdomain within the ATP-binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain in coupling ATP hydrolysis to solute transport in the transmembrane domains. Consistent with this, structural and computational analyses have indicated that the helical subdomain undergoes nucleotide-dependent movement relative to the core of the nucleotide-binding domain fold. Here we use theoretical methods to examine the allosteric nucleotide dependence of helical subdomain transitions to further elucidate its role in interactions between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains. Unrestrained 30-ns molecular dynamics simulations of the ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and apo states of the MJ0796 monomer support the idea that interaction of a conserved glutamine residue with the catalytic metal mediates the rotation of the helical subdomain in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Simulations of the nucleotide-binding domain dimer revealed that ATP hydrolysis induces a large transition of one helical subdomain, resulting in an asymmetric conformation of the dimer not observed previously. A coarse-grained elastic network analysis supports this finding, revealing the existence of corresponding dynamic modes intrinsic to the contact topology of the protein. The implications of these findings for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes in the transmembrane domains required for solute transport are discussed in light of recent whole transporter structures.

Here we use theoretical methods to examine the allosteric nucleotide dependence of helical subdomain transitions to further elucidate its role in interactions between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains. Unrestrained 30-ns molecular dynamics simulations of the ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and apo states of the MJ0796 monomer support the idea that interaction of a conserved glutamine residue with the catalytic metal mediates the rotation of the helical subdomain in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Simulations of the nucleotide-binding domain dimer revealed that ATP hydrolysis induces a large transition of one helical subdomain, resulting in an asymmetric conformation of the dimer not observed previously. A coarse-grained elastic network analysis supports this finding, revealing the existence of corresponding dynamic modes intrinsic to the contact topology of the protein. The implications of these findings for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes in the transmembrane domains required for solute transport are discussed in light of recent whole transporter structures. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TMD, transmembrane domain; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; HD, helical domain; MD, molecular dynamics; GNM, Gaussian network model; r.m.s., root mean square; ICL, intracytoplasmic loop. transporters couple hydrolysis of ATP to vectorial translocation of substrates across cellular membranes, typically against a concentration gradient. These integral membrane proteins are involved in the transport of a wide range of substrates, including ions, sugars, amino acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, and xenotoxins, and form one of the largest protein families across all species (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). Many ABC transporters are central to important biomedical problems, including resistance of cancers, microbes, and parasites to cytotoxic drugs, as well as human genetic diseases such cystic fibrosis and Stargardt disease (2Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanism of these proteins is necessary for the rational design of agents to control their transport function. The architecture of ABC transporters comprises a conserved core structure of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two cytosolic ABCs, also known as nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Most prokaryotic ABC transporters are importers with the core TMDs and NBDs expressed as separate subunits, whereas most eukaryotic ABC transporters are exporters that commonly have a single polypeptide for the core structure, with each NBD C-terminal to each TMD. The primary sequences of the NBDs are generally highly conserved and contain the Walker A and B consensus motifs for ATP binding (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) and the “LSGG(Q)” motif or “signature sequence,” which also interacts directly with ATP (4Bianchet M.A. Ko Y.H. Amzel M. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The TMDs, which contain cytosolic as well as membrane-spanning regions, are less well conserved, reflecting their role in substrate binding and translocation. Notwithstanding recent advances in structural studies, crucial questions remain concerning how ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs are coupled to protein conformational changes in the TMDs, which drive vectorial transmembrane substrate movement. Many protein monomers are composed of relatively independent subdomains, which are able to change conformation cooperatively and move as rigid bodies, thus providing the structural flexibility that enables the functioning of the enzyme (5Gerstein M. Lesk A. Chothia C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6739-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In other P-loop NBDs such as Ras, myosin, RecA, and F1-ATPase, NBD intradomain motions have been found, or are generally thought, to be central to the mechanism of the oligomeric complex, mediating the transduction of the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to functional changes in the protein conformation (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 7Ye J. Osborne A.R. Groll M. Rapoport T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of the ABC ATPase have revealed a bilobal design (see Fig. 1A), in which a region comprising three α-helices, known as the helical domain (HD), is flexibly attached to the rest of the NBD and rotates as a rigid body (8Yuan Y.R. Blecker S. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 9Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The HD contains the LSGG signature sequence, which interacts with the nucleotide bound to the Walker A and B residues of the opposite monomer, thus forming two active sites in the NBD dimer (Fig. 1A). Enzymological studies have suggested that the HD mediates interdomain allosteric communication between the ATPase active site and the substrate-binding site(s) in the TMDs (reviewed in Ref. 10Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular details of this critical allosteric process remain obscure and the exact role of the rotation of the HD in current models of the catalytic cycle is unclear. It has been suggested that a transition between “closed” and “open” conformations of the HD is dependent on the active site occupancy (ATP, ADP, or empty), being mediated by a conserved glutamine, Gln-90 in MJ0796 (8Yuan Y.R. Blecker S. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The side chain of the conserved glutamine coordinates the active site catalytic magnesium ion, in a manner similar to other P-loop ATPases (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and is proposed to act as a sensor of the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP (11Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Gln-90 is located at the C terminus of β-strand 5 of the central β-sheet, at the junction with a linker sequence (Q-loop; residues 91-108 in MJ0796) that connects the ABC core to the HD (see Fig. 1B). Karpowich et al. (9Karpowich N. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Yuan Y.R. Dai P.L. MacVey K. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Structure. 2001; 9: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) suggested that γ-phosphate release from the active site results in withdrawal of the glutamine and the coupled outward rotation of the HD to the open state. The structural data, however, are inconclusive regarding the role of the conserved glutamine in controlling the orientation of the HD.

Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and elastic network analyses (Gaussian network model (GNM)) (18Haliloglu T. Bahar I. Erman B. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 79: 3090-3093Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar) of the MJ0796 NBD dimer and monomer in tandem to characterize the motions of the HD and the effect of the ligand on its conformational changes. GNM analysis is a computational method for identifying the principal dynamic modes, which play a predominant role in effectuating the functional motions of the protein (19Yang L-W. Bahar I. Structure. 2005; 13: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The GNM approach is based on a coarse-grained model in which the protein is represented as a set of points, corresponding to the Cα atom positions, connected to their nearest neighbors by simple harmonic springs (20Bahar I. Atilgan A.R. Erman B. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Elastic network analysis has been used previously to identify functional dynamics in other membrane transporters (21Liao J. Beraten D.N. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1369-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Lu W.C. Wang C.Z. Yu E.W. Ho K.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). GNM analysis of the MJ0796 dimer provides an independent methodology that supports the view that the rotation of the HD is fundamental to functionally important conformational transitions of the NBD monomer and dimer. This analysis also suggests the possibility that the function of the NBD dimer involves asymmetric dynamics of the monomers. In contrast to the GNM analytical approach, MD simulations use a full atomic model, including explicit water molecules, with empirical force fields to model the dynamics of the protein. This methodology is a valuable complement to crystallographic structural analysis, which is often unable to analyze the wild-type protein bound to its natural reactant ligand(s). To more fully characterize the relationship between active site nucleotide occupancy, interactions of the conserved glutamine and transitions of the HD, we performed 30-ns MD simulations of the ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and apo states of the isolated monomer, using the ATP-bound monomer from the MJ0796 dimer as the starting structure. Our data support the idea that the conserved glutamine senses the presence of ATP in the active site and maintains the equilibrium conformation of the HD in a more closed state than the apo or ADP-bound monomer conformations. Here we also report that in three independent 22-ns simulations of the ATP/ATP-bound dimer, no significant alteration in the conformation of the HD occurred. In contrast, replacement of ATP with ADP in one active site of the dimer results in a significantly altered conformation of the HD in the monomer with ADP bound to its Walker A and B residues. The observed HD rotation opens a large gap between helix 2 and the region of the α3-4 loop (Fig. 1A) of the ADP-bound monomer. This conformational change, which is reproduced in four independent runs, is different from that which can be inferred from any published crystal structures, with the exception of the Thermococcus litoralis MalK NBD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1G29 23). A possible role for this transition in mediating TMD-NBD interactions in response to ATP hydrolysis is discussed in the light of recent whole transporter structures. The starting coordinates for the MD simulations were taken from the x-ray structure of dimeric MJ0796 E171Q (monomer A was used for the monomer simulations) published in the PDB (ID code 1L2T, 1.9-Å resolution) (11Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This structure contains ATP in the active site and, therefore, was preferred for the current MD studies. The wild-type active site glutamate residue 171 was restored, and a magnesium ion replaced the sodium ion in the active site in the crystal structure. MD simulations were performed using the parallel MD program NAMD 2.5 (24Kalé L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput.

Chem. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30557) Google Scholar). The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain the bonds containing hydrogens to their equilibrium length (27Ryckaert J. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar). A cutoff of 11 Å (switching function starting at 9.5 Å) for van der Waals interactions and real space electrostatic interactions was used. Periodic boundary conditions were used, and minimum distances between periodic images of the protein were 20 Å in all cases. Sodium ions were added to the system to maintain electrical neutrality where required. The particle-mesh Ewald method (28Darden T.A. York D.M. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar) was used to compute long range electrostatic forces with a grid density of ∼1/Å3. An integration time step of 1.5 fs was used, permitting a multiple time-stepping algorithm to be employed in which interactions involving covalent bonds, and short range nonbonded interactions were computed every time step, whereas long range electrostatic forces were computed every two time steps. Langevin dynamics was utilized to keep a constant temperature of 358 K in all simulations, to mimic the native environment of Methanococcus jannaschii (29Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M.

Constant pressure simulations at 50 atm were conducted using the hybrid Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method with a decay period of 100 fs and a damping timescale of 50 fs. The solvated starting structure was minimized using conjugate gradient minimization to a 0.5-kcal/mol·Å root mean square (r.m.s.) gradient with all protein heavy atoms fixed. Water molecules and protein hydrogens were then further minimized during a 50-ps MD run at 358 K, in which all protein heavy atoms were again fixed. This starting model was then minimized with harmonic positional constraints, derived from the crystallographic temperature factors (B), on the NCαCO backbone. A 2000/B kcal/mol·Å2 force constant was used to minimize the system to a 0.5-kcal/mol·Å r.m.s. gradient. The constraints were gradually removed, by subsequent minimizations to a 0.1-kcal/mol·Å r.m.s. gradient, scaling the initial force constants by factors of 0.5, 0.15, 0.05, and 0. The minimized structure was then heated from 50 to 350 K in steps of 25 K using velocity reassignment during a 16.2-ps MD run. The equilibrated system was then used for the production runs. For analysis, the coordinates were saved every 0.75 ps. Three 30-ns simulations of the ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and apo forms of the MJ0796 monomer were performed. Four simulations were performed of the ADP/ATP-bound MJ0796 dimer (Table 1). Simulations 1 and 2 used the crystallographic dimer, whereas simulations 3 and 4 used a constructed dimer of two monomer Bs. Durations were: simulation 1 (ADP in monomer A), 28 ns; simulation 2 (ADP in monomer B), 19 ns; simulation 3, 20 ns; and simulation 4, 25 ns. Three 22-ns simulations were performed of the ATP/ATP-bound dimer (Table 1). Simulation 5 used the crystallographic dimer, whereas simulations 6 and 7 used a constructed dimer of two monomer Bs. In all simulations, the starting x-ray structure was re-equilibrated for the production run. All simulations remained stable throughout, and simulation run durations were chosen to optimize computational resources.TABLE 1Summary of MJ0796 dimer simulationsSimulationaSimulations that used the crystal structure (PBD 1L2T) are indicated by “X-ray,” and those that used a constructed dimer of two monomer B subunits from the same crystal structure are labeled “BB.”Run timeActive site nucleotideSer-117 transition > 12 ÅbTime point at which the measured transition of serine 117 (see Fig. 5) first exceeded 12 Å.Average Ser-117 transitioncFor the ADP-bound monomer, the average of the serine 117 transition following the point at which it first exceeded 12 Å to the end of the simulation is given.

Bruögner (1992) X-PLOR, Version 3.1, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. with a 1.4-Å probe radius. The program Hingefinder was used for analysis of domain rotations using the slow partitioning algorithm (32Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). GNM analysis was performed on the MJ0796 dimer (PDB 1L2T) using the iGNM online facility (33Yang L.W. Liu X. Jursa C.J. Holliman M. Rader A.J. Karimi H. Bahar I. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using a 10-Å nearest neighbor cutoff criterion. Fig. 1A was prepared using PyMOL. All other structural figures were prepared using VMD (34Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). The GNM analysis was performed on the MJ0796 dimer structure using the iGNM webserver using a 10-Å nearest neighbor cutoff criterion. This analysis showed that principal modes 1-5, which represent the most collective motions of the protein, account for over 30% of all residue fluctuations within the dimer. GNM Mode 1 Shows Anticorrelated Motions of the NBDs in the Dimer—As found previously for other homodimers, the hinge region in mode 1 lies at the interface between the monomers (Fig. 2A), and this mode is exclusively induced by the dimeric form (19Yang L-W. Bahar I. Structure. 2005; 13: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, dimerization induces a new cooperative mode, not found in the isolated monomer. This result is consistent with previous biochemical and structural data, which indicate that the dimeric form of the ABC NBD is required for catalytic activity (35Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hopfner K-P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and illustrates the relationship between the dominant dynamic modes and the functioning of the protein. Interestingly, visualization of the GNM modes indicates that the motion described by mode 1 (Fig. 2A) would most likely involve one NBD moving toward the TMD while the other moves away, thus suggesting the possibility of asymmetric engagement of the NBDs and the TMDs. Principal Modes 2 and 3 Reveal Both In- and Out-of-phase Patterns of Mobility within the NBD Dimer—Fig. 2, B and C, illustrate the second and third principal modes, respectively, as calculated by the GNM analysis of the MJ0796 dimer. As found previously for other homodimers (19Yang L-W. Bahar I. Structure. 2005; 13: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), mode 2 of the dimer is indistinguishable from that of mode 1 of the isolated monomer. In both principal modes 2 and 3 of the dimer, the HD moves in an opposite sense to the rest of the NBD, clearly showing that the HD is structurally and dynamically a distinct entity within the NBD. As in mode 1, the monomers are 180° out of phase with respect to mode 2, but symmetrical with respect to mode 3. These data thus suggest that both in-phase and out-of-phase motions of the two HDs may be involved in the functional dynamics of the dimer. Modes 4 and 5 Indicate Asymmetric Patterns of Mobility between the Monomers in the NBD Dimer—Fig. 2, D and E, illustrate the fourth and fifth principal modes. In contrast to modes 1-3, modes 4 and 5 reveal asymmetric dynamics between the two monomers. Although the most significant fluctuations in these two modes involve the dynamics of the A-loops (Fig. 1A 41Ambudkar S.V. Kim I.W. Xia D. Sauna Z.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), other possibly significant dynamic asymmetries also appear. In mode 4, monomer B undergoes relative motions of its HD and the core β-sheet, whereas monomer A is relatively quiescent. In mode 5, in monomer A, the region of helix 2 and the α3-4 loop (see Fig. 1A) within the HD undergo opposite sense motions, while the equivalent regions in monomer B undergo concerted motions in the same direction. These dynamic asymmetries between the NBD monomers are notable in view of earlier experimental work that also indicated asymmetric functioning of the monomers (42Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zaitseva J. Oswald C. Jumpertz T. Jenewein S. Wiedenmann A. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3432-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and thus may be of significance in the understanding of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, as discussed below, modes 4 and 5 are broadly in accord with the results of our MD analysis of the MJ0796 NBD dimer. MD Simulations of the Apo, ADP-bound, and ATP-bound MJ0796Monomer—A previous MD study (44Campbell J.D. Deol S.S. Ashcroft F.M. Kerr I.D. Sansom M.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3703-3715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found nucleotide-dependent mobility of the HD in simulations of the HisP monomer using a crystal structure of the isolated monomer containing ATP but not Mg2+. However, this study did not address in detail the interaction of the conserved glutamine with the catalytic Mg2+, the ADP-bound state of the monomer, nor the transitions from the ATP-bound dimer conformation of the NBD to that of the isolated monomer. We performed unrestrained MD simulations of the apo, ADP-bound, and ATP-bound forms of the MJ0796 monomer, to further characterize the effect of the ligand on its intradomain motions. Monomer A from the MJ0796 E171Q dimer (PDB 1L2T) was used as the starting structure for these simulations after substituting the crystal structure Gln-171 with the wild-type Glu-171 residue, and placement of a Mg2+ ion in the canonical position in the catalytic site in the ADP- and ATP-bound forms. Uniquely, this computational analysis allows us to characterize the effect of unhydrolyzed ATP on the dynamics and structure of the monomer. Evaluation of the change in the overall structure for the simulations is provided by analysis of the Cα r.m.s. deviations relative to the initial structure as a function of time. These data indicate that all simulations were stable, with the average r.m.s. difference and standard deviation from the starting structure over the last 20 ns of each simulation being: ATP, 2.21 ± 0.30 Å; ADP, 2.47 ± 0.33 Å; and apo, 3.09 ± 0.39 Å. Simulations Show Good Agreement with Crystallographic Data—Fig. 3A shows the per residue r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms between the average structures over the last 3 ns of each simulation and the starting structure. This shows that the HD (residues 96-162) has moved significantly relative to the core domain in all simulations but to a markedly greater extent in the apo and ADP simulations, where the c"

With TNFα, NF-κB-mediated protection involves suppression of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, and we have identified Gadd45β, a member of the Gadd45 family, as a pivotal effector of this activity of NF-κB. Inhibition of TNFα-induced JNK signaling by Gadd45β depends on direct targeting of the JNK kinase, MKK7/JNKK2. The mechanism by which Gadd45β blunts MKK7, however, is unknown. Here we show that Gadd45β is a structured protein with a predicted four-stranded β-sheet core, five α-helices, and two acidic loops. Association of Gadd45β with MKK7 involves a network of interactions mediated by its putative helices α3 and α4 and loops 1 and 2. Whereas α3 appears to primarily mediate docking to MKK7, loop 1 and α4-loop 2 seemingly afford kinase inactivation by engaging the ATP-binding site and causing conformational changes that impede catalytic function.

We and others have shown that, downstream of TNF-Rs, the NF-κB-mediated antagonism of PCD involves a suppression of the sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade (6De Smaele E.

Prolonged activation of JNK by TNFα was shown to elicit PCD by causing Itch-dependent proteolysis of the caspase-8 antagonist, c-FLIPL, and cleavage of Bcl-2-like factor, Bid, into proapototic jBid (2Papa S.

Thus, the biological outcome of the triggering of TNF-Rs is determined by a delicate balance between the opposing activities of the JNK and NF-κB pathways. The inhibitory activity that NF-κB exerts on the JNK cascade involves an up-regulation of target genes (1Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8961-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and we have identified Gadd45β, a member of the Gadd45 family of structurally related factors (11Papa S. Zazzeroni F.

Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Gadd45β is induced rapidly by TNFα through a mechanism that requires NF-κB, its ectopic expression blocks TNFα-elicited JNK activity and PCD in NF-κB null cells, and gene targeted- or antisense-mediated inactivation of endogenous gadd45β impairs the NF-κB-mediated control of JNK signaling and PCD downstream of TNF-Rs (2Papa S.

The Gadd45β-afforded blockade of this signaling depends on a direct targeting and inactivation of the MAPKK, MKK7/JNKK2, a selective and essential inducer of JNK following exposure to TNFα (11Papa S.

Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Gadd45β-MKK7 interaction is a crucial molecular link between the NF-κB and JNK pathways, and accordingly, a key checkpoint controlling cell fate downstream of TNF-Rs (2Papa S. Bubici C.

The relevance of this link is underscored by the ability of cell-permeable peptides selectively interfering with the Gadd45β-mediated suppression of MKK7 to hinder NF-κB afforded cytoprotection against TNFα-induced killing (11Papa S.

Wu X. Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Knock-out studies confirmed the essential role that Gadd45β plays in blocking TNFα-induced PCD in certain tissues (2Papa S. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Kuntzen C. Knabb J.R. Dean K. Franzoso G.

In many instances, the biological activity of Gadd45 factors has been linked to regulation of protein kinases, such as MAPK pathway kinases (15Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 16Liebermann D.A. Hoffmann B.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We showed for instance that Gadd45β binds directly to MKK7, and that this binding is sufficient alone to cause inactivation of this kinase. As other Gadd45 family proteins, however, Gadd45β lacks enzymatic activity such as phosphatase activity (16Liebermann D.A. Hoffmann B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3391-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Bubici C. Franzoso G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and so, the basis for its ability to block MKK7 remains unknown. To understand this basis, here we used a combined structural and functional approach. Using this approach, we constructed a model predicting that Gadd45β is a structured protein, consisting essentially of a central four-stranded β-sheet core surrounded by five α-helices and two acidic loops. In this model, contact of Gadd45β with MKK7 involves an extensive network of interactions mediated by its α-helices α3 (Ile69-Asn85) and α4 (Met95-Leu102) and loops 1 and 2 (Ile61-Asp68 and Gly103-Leu117, respectively). Indeed, we found that whereas α3 plays a key role in docking of Gadd45β to MKK7, the loop 1 and α4-loop 2 regions of Gadd45β are essential for kinase inactivation. These regions appear in fact to establish several bonds with residues in the catalytic pocket and the β3-helix C loop of MKK7, preventing access of the kinase to ATP and inducing conformational changes that stabilize this kinase in an inactive conformation. These data provide a mechanism for Gadd45β-mediated suppression of MKK7, and ultimately, of TNFα-induced PCD (2Papa S. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Kuntzen C. Knabb J.R. Dean K. Franzoso G. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Given the key role that inappropriate blockade of PCD by NF-κB plays in chronic inflammation and cancer (1Kucharczak J. Simmons M.J. Fan Y. Gelinas C.

Protein Purification and Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) proteins used Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione beads (Sigma) as detailed elsewhere (11Papa S.

Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Purity was verified by Coomassie Blue staining (Figs. 3E and 4C). For binding assays, in vitro translated proteins (5 μl) were incubated with GST (10 μl) proteins for 20 min and then pulled down with glutathione beads as described previously (11Papa S. Zazzeroni F.

Prior to loading onto gels, beads were washed extensively in binding buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100; Figs. 1, B, D, and F, and 2B). In Fig. 2D and supplementary Fig. S5B, higher stringency was achieved by performing GST precipitations using 0.4% Triton X-100, 5 μl of translated proteins, and 4 μl of GST-coupled beads.FIGURE 2Identification of Gadd45β residues mediating binding to MKK7.

Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, active FLAG-MKK7 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) from lysates of HEK-293 cells treated with human TNFα (2,000 units/ml; Peprotech) for 10 min and then subjected to in vitro kinase reaction for 20 min at 30 °C. Preincubation with recombinant GST or GST-Gadd45β proteins was for an additional 10 min (Figs. 3, B and D, and 4B). Additional Methods—A detailed description of additional materials and methods, including cell treatments and death assays, plasmids, human (h)Gadd45β purification, native gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, LC-MS, circular dichroism (CD), limited proteolysis and alkylation analyses, and modeling can be found in the supplementary data. Identification of the Regions of Gadd45β Contacting MKK7—Gadd45 proteins have no known enzymatic activity (16Liebermann D.A. Hoffmann B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3391-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Bubici C. Franzoso G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine the basis for Gadd45β-mediated inactivation of MKK7, we mapped the region(s) of Gadd45β involved in interaction with this kinase. Plasmids encoding N- or C-terminal truncated Gadd45β proteins were translated in vitro (Fig. 1, A and C, respectively), and the resulting products were tested for their ability to bind to GST-MKK7 fusion proteins in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1, B and D). GST served as negative control. Full-length (FL) Gadd45β bound strongly to GST-MKK7, but not to GST (Fig. 1B), as shown previously (11Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Bubici C. Jayawardena S. Alvarez K. Matsuda S. Nguyen D.U. Pham C.G. Nelsbach A.H. Melis T. De Smaele E. Tang W.J. D'Adamio L. Franzoso G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Gadd45β-(41–160), Gadd45β-(60–160), and Gadd45β-(69–160) also interacted with the fusion protein with high affinity (Fig. 1B; compare the fractions of precipitated products relative to their inputs), suggesting that residues 1–68 are dispensable for tight binding of Gadd45β to MKK7. Notably, removal of an additional 18 amino acids severely compromised this binding (Fig. 1B, see 87–160), whereas further truncations also involving residues Ile87–Glu113 abolished it (Fig. 1B, see 114–160). These data suggest that region Ile69–Asp86 is essential for association of Gadd45β with MKK7 and that the adjacent region Ile87–Glu113 also contributes to this association. Analysis of C-terminal truncations confirmed the presence of a MKK7 interaction region between Gadd45β residues 69 and 95 (Fig. 1D, compare 1–95 and 1–68). Full-length Gadd45β, yielded by incomplete restriction digestion of pBS-Gadd45β templates (Fig. 1D), served as internal positive control. Together, these findings suggest that Gadd45β interacts with MKK7 primarily through region Ile69–Asp86, and that additional contacts are made through Ile87–Glu113. These data do not exclude existence of additional MKK7-binding regions within Gadd45β (discussed below). The importance of the Ile69–Asp86 region for this binding, however, was corroborated by findings with internal Gadd45β peptides (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1F, Gadd45β-(60–113) interacted with GST-MKK7 with high affinity (comparable with that of FL), and Gadd45β-(69–86) virtually recapitulated this interaction, suggesting that Ile69–Asp86 is sufficient alone for tight association of Gadd45β with MKK7 (compare 69–86 to FL). Delineation of Residues Involved in Interaction of Gadd45β with MKK7—To further delineate which residues of Gadd45β are most critical for binding to MKK7, we generated alanine-scanning mutants of region Ile69–Asp86 (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation of residues Leu71–His74 or Phe75–Ile78 (Ala-1 and Ala-2, respectively) severely compromised association of Gadd45β-(69–86) with MKK7, whereas mutation of residues Gln79–Cys82 or Cys83–Asp86 impacted on this association only modestly (Fig. 2B, Ala-3 and Ala-4, respectively), suggesting that contact with MKK7 is primarily mediated through the Leu71–Ile78 segment of region Ile69–Asp86. Next, we introduced select mutations within the broader region Ala60–Ala106 in the context of Gadd45β(FL) (Fig. 2C), because additional residues within this region appeared to be involved in association with MKK7 (discussed above; see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2D, alanine substitutions of acidic residues Asp62–Asp67 (Mut-1) significantly weakened Gadd45β interaction with MKK7 (compare with FL). Conversely, mutation of Ile69, Leu71, and Ile73 (Mut-2) had no effect on this interaction, suggesting that the binding impairment seen with Ala1 (Fig. 2B) was due to ablation of Gln72 and/or His74, and not of Leu71 or Ile73. Indeed, substitution of the former residues, along with that of Thr76 severely compromised Gadd45β association with MKK7 (Fig. 2D, Mut-3). Binding was also impaired by mutation of Asp84/Asp86/Asp88 (Mut-5) or Ile89/Val90/Val92 (Mut-6), and to a lesser extent, of Gln79/Ser80 (Mut-4) or Met95/Gln96/Arg97 (Mut-7) (Fig. 2D). Mut-8 precipitated with GST-MKK7 with efficiency comparable with that of Gadd45β(FL). Notably, consistent with the notion that Gadd45β contacts MKK7 through an extended surface, beyond that created by Ile69–Asp86, alanine substitutions within Gadd45β(FL) had only partial inhibitory effects on the interaction of these proteins (Fig. 2D and data not shown), whereas the inhibitory effects of mutations introduced in the context of Gadd45β-(69–86) were virtually complete (Fig. 2B, Ala-2, and Ala-1). It is also noteworthy that, with the former mutants, binding assays were performed at higher stringency (see “Experimental Procedures”), which may explain in part why ablation of certain residues appeared to have more dramatic effects in the context of Gadd45β(FL) than in that of Gadd45β-(69–86) (e.g. see mutation of Gln79/Ser80; note binding of Mut-4 (Fig. 2D) and Ala-3 (Fig. 2B); see also Mut-5 (Fig. 2D) and Ala-4 (Fig. 2B), both containing mutations of Asp84/Asp86). It is also possible, however, that certain mutations had conformational effects that could be revealed only in the context of a full-length polypeptide (further discussed below; see also “Discussion”). In summary, the data suggest that binding of Gadd45β to MKK7 primarily involves Gln72 and/or His74, as well as residues within peptide Phe75–Ile78 such as Thr76. They also suggest an involvement in this binding (either in direct contact with MKK7 or in maintenance of Gadd45β conformational stability) of additional residues both within and outside region Ile69–Asp86 (i.e. Gln79, Ser80, Asp84 and/or Asp86, within; and Asp62–Asp67, Asp88, Ile89, Val90, Val92, Met95, Gln96, and/or Arg97, outside). Regions of Gadd45β Mediating MKK7 Inactivation—To delineate regions of Gadd45β involved in inhibition of MKK7, we examined the activity of N- and C-terminal Gadd45β truncations in MKK7 kinase assays, in vitro (Fig. 3, A and C, respectively). Active FLAG-MKK7 was isolated from TNFα-treated 293 cells, and kinase assays were performed in the presence of purified GST-Gadd45β proteins or control GST (Fig. 3, B and D; see also Fig. 3E). As shown previously, phosphorylation of GST-JNK1 by MKK7, as well as autophosphorylation, were effectively blocked by Gadd45β(FL) but not by GST (Ctrl), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and D; see also Ref. 11Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Bubici C. Jayawardena S. Alvarez K. Matsuda S. Nguyen D.U. Pham C.G. Nelsbach A.H. Melis T. De Smaele E. Tang W.J. D'Adamio L. Franzoso G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of Gadd45β was virtually unaffected by removal of 40 N-terminal residues, and was affected only marginally by removal of an additional 19 amino acids (Fig. 3B, 41–160 and 60–160, respectively), suggesting that region 1–59 is dispensable for effective blockade of MKK7 by Gadd45β. Notably, larger deletions progressively hindered the ability of Gadd45β to inhibit kinase function, with Gadd45β-(114–160) proteins virtually lacking any such ability (Fig. 3B). Gadd45β-(69–160) and, albeit to a lesser extent, Gadd45β-(87–160) retained instead significant inhibitory activity in vitro, but only at high concentrations. Findings were confirmed by analysis of C-terminal Gadd45β truncations (Fig. 3, C and D). Deletion of residues 114–160 had no effect on Gadd45β afforded blockade of MKK7 (Fig. 3D, 1–113), and a further deletion of residues 87–160 impacted upon this blockade only modestly, albeit reproducibly (Fig. 3D, 1–86; see 5 μm). In contrast, a Gadd45β-(1–68) protein exhibited only weak inhibitory activity, and Gadd45β-(1–40) had virtually no such activity (Fig. 3D). These findings correlate with the physical interaction data shown in Fig. 1B, and suggest that Gadd45β-mediated inactivation of MKK7 involves, in addition to the MKK7-binding peptide Ile69–Asp86 (Fig. 1F), two regions spanning Tyr41–Asp68 and Ile87–Glu113. To further delineate the role of these regions in inhibition of MKK7 and determine whether these are also sufficient for this activity, we examined internal Gadd45β fragments (Fig. 4, A, see also C). As shown in Fig. 4B, Gadd45β-(60–86) exhibited strong inhibitory activity in vitro, even though at lower concentrations (i.e. 5 μm) this activity was somewhat weaker than that of Gadd45β(FL). Of interest, removal of the acidic stretch at Asp62–Asp68 completely abolished kinase inactivation (Fig. 4B, compare 69–86 and 60–86), suggesting that this stretch is crucial for inhibitory function. Notably, however, its relevance to this function was markedly less apparent in the context of longer Gadd45β polypeptides, extending C-terminal to either Glu113 or Arg160. Indeed, these polypeptides, but not those extending only to Glu104, were capable of affording significant suppression of MKK7 even in the absence of the Asp62–Asp68 stretch (Fig. 4B, compare 69–86, 69–104, and 69–113; see also Fig. 3B, note the inhibitory activity of 69–160). These data are consistent with those shown in Fig. 3 and further support existence of a second MKK7 inhibitory module within Pro105–Glu113. Activity of this module was especially evident at lower protein concentrations (i.e. 5 μm or lower; see Figs. 3B and 4B; data not shown), suggesting that this plays an important physiologic role. Altogether, the data indicate that high affinity binding of Gadd45β to MKK7 is mediated through region Ile69–Asp86, being both necessary and sufficient for this binding (Fig. 1). Association of Ile69–Asp86 with MKK7, however, is insufficient alone to inhibit kinase activity (Fig. 4B). The suppressive action of Gadd45β on MKK7 depends in fact on establishment of further contacts involving the two inhibitory modules at Ala60–Asp68 and Glu104–Glu113. Gadd45β Regions Mediating Suppression of TNFα-induced PCD—To tighten the link between Gadd45β-mediated suppression of MKK7 and antagonism of TNFα-induced PCD (2Papa S. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Pham C.G. Kuntzen C. Knabb J.R. Dean K. Franzoso G. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we examined whether these activities of Gadd45β were mediated by the same peptidic regions. To this end, C- and N-terminal truncations of Gadd45β (Fig. 5, A and C, respectively) were tested in cytoprotection assays in RelA-/- cells. As shown previously (6De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), upon expression of a fusion protein of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and Gadd45β(FL), these cells were effectively rescued from TNFα-induced killing, with more than 50% of eGFP-Gadd45β(FL)-expressing cells being viable at 12.5 h (Fig. 5B). Cells expressing eGFP(-) remained susceptible to this killing, as expected. Deletion of residues 114–160 had no apparent effect on the ability of Gadd45β to counter TNFα-induced PCD (Fig. 5B, 1–113), whereas larger deletions progressively impaired this ability, with a Gadd45β protein spanning residues 1–40 completely lacking such ability (Fig. 5B, 1–40, also 1–28). Hence, as for inhibition of MKK7, in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4), Gadd45β depends for antiapoptotic function on a peptidic segment comprised between Tyr41"
https://openalex.org/W2010536491,"Cleavable isoforms of the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that may translocate to the nucleus and regulate signaling. However, ErbB4 gene is alternatively spliced generating CYT-1 and CYT-2 isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails. Here, we addressed whether the two alternative ErbB4 ICDs of either CYT-1 (ICD1) or CYT-2 (ICD2) type differ in signaling to the nucleus. Confocal microscopy and extraction of nuclear cell fractions indicated that significantly more ICD2 translocated to the nuclei when compared to ICD1. Unlike the membrane-anchored 80 kDa fragments derived from full-length ErbB4 isoforms, the two ICDs did not differ from each other in metabolic stability or ubiquitylation. However, ICD2 was phosphorylated at tyrosine residues to a higher extent and demonstrated greater in vitro kinase activity than ICD1. Mutating the ATP-binding site within ICD2 kinase domain (ICD2 K751R) blocked its tyrosine phosphorylation and significantly reduced its nuclear translocation. When expressed in the context of full-length ErbB4, ICD2 was also more efficient than ICD1 in promoting transcriptional activation of the STAT5 target gene beta-casein. These findings indicate that the two alternative ICDs of ErbB4 differ in their nuclear accumulation, and that the mechanism involves differential kinase activity but not ubiquitin-regulated ICD stability."
https://openalex.org/W2056795440,"In lung cancer, frequent loss of one allele of chromosome 3p is seen in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), providing evidence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in this chromosomal region. The mechanism of Fus1 tumor suppressor activity is unknown. We have found that a Fus1 peptide inhibits the Abl tyrosine kinase in vitro (IC50 35 μ M). The inhibitory Fus1 sequence was derived from a region that was deleted in a mutant FUS1 gene (FUS1 (1–80)) detected in some lung cancer cell lines. Importantly, a stearic acid-modified form of this peptide was required for the inhibition, but stearic acid alone was not inhibitory. Two NSCLC cell lines, which lack expression of wild-type Fus1, contain activated c-Abl. Forced expression of an inducible FUS1 cDNA in H1299 NSCLC cells decreased levels of activated c-Abl and inhibited its tyrosine kinase activity. Similarly, treatment of c-Abl immune complexes with the inhibitory Fus1 peptide also reduced the level of c-Abl in these immune complexes. The size and number of colonies of the NSCLC cell line, H1299, in soft agar was strongly inhibited by the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Co-expression of FUS1 and c-ABL in COS1 cells blocked activation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase. In contrast, co-expression of mutant FUS1 (1–80) with c-ABL had little inhibitory activity against c-Abl. These findings provide strong evidence that c-Abl is a possible target in NSCLC patients that have reduced expression of Fus1 in their tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020666604,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored T-cadherin (T-cad) influences several parameters of angiogenesis including endothelial cell (EC) differentiation, migration, proliferation, and survival. This presupposes signal transduction networking via mediatory regulators and molecular adaptors since T-cad lacks transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Here, using pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, adenoviral-mediated T-cad-overexpression, siRNA-mediated T-cad-depletion, and agonistic antibody-mediated ligation, we demonstrate signaling by T-cad through PI3K-Akt-GSK3beta pathways in EC. T-cad-overexpressing EC exhibited increased levels and nuclear accumulation of active beta-catenin, which was transcriptionally active as shown by increased Lef/Tcf reporter activity and cyclin D1 levels. Cotransduction of EC with constitutively active GSK3beta (S9A-GSK3beta) abrogated the stimulatory effects of T-cad on active beta-catenin accumulation, proliferation, and survival. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a membrane proximal upstream regulator of Akt and GSK3beta, was considered a candidate signaling mediator for T-cad. T-cad was present in anti-ILK immunoprecipitates, and confocal microscopy revealed colocalization of T-cad and ILK within lamellipodia of migrating cells. ILK-siRNA abolished T-cad-dependent effects on (Ser-473)Akt/(Ser-9)GSK3beta phosphorylation, active beta-catenin accumulation, and survival. We conclude ILK is an essential mediator for T-cad signaling via Akt and GSK3beta in EC. This is the first demonstration that ILK can regulate inward signaling by GPI-anchored proteins. Furthermore, ILK-GSK3beta-dependent modulation of active beta-catenin levels by GPI-anchored T-cad represents a novel mechanism for controlling cellular beta-catenin activity."
https://openalex.org/W2060679709,"Cancers often exhibit high levels of cyclin E expression, and aberrant cyclin E activity causes genomic instability and increased tumorigenesis. Two tumor suppressor pathways protect cells against cyclin E deregulation. The p53 pathway is induced by excess cyclin E in primary cells and opposes cyclin E activity through induction of p21Cip1. In contrast, the Fbw7 pathway targets cyclin E for degradation, and Fbw7 mutations occur commonly in cancers. We investigated the cooperativity of these two pathways in countering cyclin E-induced genomic instability in primary human cells. We find that loss of p53 and Fbw7 synergistically unmasks cyclin E-induced instability. In normal cells, impaired cyclin E degradation produces genome instability, but this is rapidly mitigated by induction of p53 and p21. In contrast, p53 loss allows the high level of cyclin E kinase activity that results from Fbw7 loss to persist and continuously drive genome instability. Moreover, p21 plays a critical role in suppressing cyclin E when Fbw7 is disabled, and in the absence of p21, sustained cyclin E activity induces rapid cell death via apoptosis. These data directly demonstrate the cooperative roles of these Fbw7 and p53 pathways in restraining cyclin E activity and its associated genome instability."
https://openalex.org/W2028635283,"Among the numerous effects of lithium on intracellular targets, its possible action on mitochondria remains poorly explored. In the experiments with suspension of isolated brain mitochondria, replacement of KCl by LiCl suppressed mitochondrial swelling, depolarization, and a release of cytochrome c induced by a single Ca2+ bolus. Li+ robustly protected individual brain mitochondria loaded with rhodamine 123 against Ca2+-induced depolarization. In the experiments with slow calcium infusion, replacement of KCl by LiCl in the incubation medium increased resilience of synaptic and nonsynaptic brain mitochondria as well as resilience of liver and heart mitochondria to the deleterious effect of Ca2+. In LiCl medium, mitochondria accumulated larger amounts of Ca2+ before they lost the ability to sequester Ca2+. However, lithium appeared to be ineffective if mitochondria were challenged by Sr2+ instead of Ca2+. Cyclosporin A, sanglifehrin A, and Mg2+, inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), increased mitochondrial Ca2+ capacity in KCl medium but failed to do so in LiCl medium. This suggests that the mPT might be a common target for Li+ and mPT inhibitors. In addition, lithium protected mitochondria against high Ca2+ in the presence of ATP, where cyclosporin A was reported to be ineffective. SB216763 and SB415286, inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which is implicated in regulating reactive oxygen species-induced mPT in cardiac mitochondria, did not increase Ca2+ capacity of brain mitochondria.

Mitochondrial injury plays a crucial role in excitotoxic neuronal death induced by prolonged activation of glutamate receptors (1Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Exposure of neurons to excitotoxic glutamate causes massive influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol through the glutamate receptors and possibly through the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (2Choi D.W.

Mitochondria contribute to clearance of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ by accumulating Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix (6Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B.

However, excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the matrix might induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) 2The abbreviations used are: mPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; Rh123, rhodamine 123; CsA, cyclosporin A; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium cation. that leads to depolarization and swelling of the organelles (12Bernardi P.

Both manifestations of the mPT are dangerous for the cell. The former leads to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and suppression of Ca2+ uptake, whereas the latter might cause the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and a release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the mechanisms of induction and regulation of the mPT. Numerous factors and pharmacological agents influence the probability of the mPT (13Antonsson B. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14Zoratti M. Szabo I.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) is considered to be the most prominent and widely used inhibitor (or “desensitizer” as recently suggested by Dr. Paolo Bernardi (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V.

Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)) of the mPT, but it also leads to inhibition of calcineurin, a cytosolic phosphatase (15Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). NIM811 and UNIL025, more selective CsA derivatives that do not suppress calcineurin, are probably the most potent and specific inhibitors of the mPT (16Hansson M.J. Mattiasson G. Mansson R.

CsA as well as its congeners bind to mitochondrial cyclophilin D, desensitizing the mPT pore to Ca2+ (17Basso E. Fante L. Fowlkes J. Petronilli V. Forte M.A. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Sanglifehrin, another potent inhibitor of the mPT, also binds to cyclophilin D and suppresses the mPT (21Clarke S.J. McStay G.P. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol.

There is evidence that adenine nucleotides can inhibit the mPT due to binding to adenine nucleotide translocase, a putative conducting pathway of the mPT pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane (23Le Quoc K. Le Quoc D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Additionally, mitochondria possess at least two separate mPT-related binding sites for divalent cations (Me2+) (25Bernardi P. Veronese P. Petronilli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One type of binding site was found inside of mitochondria (internal site), whereas another type (external) was located on the outer side of the IMM. Binding of Ca2+ to the internal site increased probability of the mPT, whereas binding of other Me2+ (Sr2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+) proved to be inhibitory. Binding of any Me2+ to the external site decreased the probability of the mPT (25Bernardi P. Veronese P. Petronilli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether monovalent cations can bind to these sites and affect mPT induction is not known. Among other monovalent cations, Li+ has several remarkable properties. Its ionic radius is very close to Mg2+, and therefore in some cases, Li+ exert actions similar to Mg2+ (26Hutson S.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5251-5258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown in early studies that Li+ binds to mitochondria with higher affinity than other monovalent cations (27Gear A.R. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3953-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, it was demonstrated that Li+ binds to phospholipids (28Srinivasan C. Minadeo N. Geraldes C.F. Mota de Freitas D.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). For more than 50 years, lithium has been used in the psychiatric treatment of bipolar disorder, although the mechanism of the lithium action remains unknown (30Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev.

Recently, Li+ was found to be protective against the ROS-induced mPT in experiments with cardiomyocytes and isolated cardiac mitochondria (32Juhaszova M. Zorov D.B. Kim S.H. Pepe S. Fu Q.

Since Li+ is an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (33Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zorov D.B. Kim S.H. Pepe S. Fu Q. Fishbein K.W. Ziman B.D. Wang S. Ytrehus K. Antos C.L. Olson E.N. Sollott S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In long term experiments, low concentrations of lithium were found to interfere with phosphoinositol metabolism in neuronal cells (34Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1981; 36: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The long term treatment of cerebellar granule cells led to robust inhibition of Ca2+ influx through N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors and also led to protection against excitotoxicity (36Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). An acute exposure to low concentrations of lithium did not affect Ca2+ influx into neurons induced by glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate (36Nonaka S. Hough C.J. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2642-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Upon glutamate stimulation, Na+ and Li+ can enter neurons through the nonselective ion channel of the glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (37Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 501-527Crossref Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi K. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 420: 185-206Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Tsuzuki K. Mochizuki S. Iino M. Mori H. Mishina M. Ozawa S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether Na+ or Li+ can change the susceptibility of brain mitochondria to Ca2+-induced mPT and thus potentially contribute to sensitization or desensitization of neurons to glutamate exposure. In the present study, we addressed this question. Using various experimental approaches to evaluate induction of the mPT in isolated synaptic and nonsynaptic brain mitochondria, we found that Li+ remarkably desensitizes brain mitochondria to Ca2+. We hypothesize that this effect might be due to Li+ binding to the external mPT-related cation binding site proposed earlier by Dr. Paolo Bernardi for divalent cations (25Bernardi P. Veronese P. Petronilli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further speculate that Li+-evoked desensitization of neuronal mitochondria to Ca2+ might contribute to protection against delayed Ca2+ deregulation in cultured neurons exposed to excitotoxic glutamate in LiCl-based medium. Isolation of Brain, Liver, and Heart Mitochondria—To isolate mitochondria, male Sprague-Dawley rats (225–250 g) (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were sacrificed by decapitation according to an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol.

Synaptic mitochondria were isolated from synaptosomes by the nitrogen cavitation method using a nitrogen cell disruption bomb, model 4639 (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL), cooled on ice (42Brown M.R. Sullivan P.G. Dorenbos K.A. Modafferi E.A. Geddes J.W. Steward O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 137: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the synaptosomes obtained during preparation of nonsynaptic mitochondria were transferred in a cooled plastic beaker and placed into the nitrogen bomb on ice under 1,000 p.s.i. for 13 min. Then the synaptosomes were layered on top of the discontinuous Percoll gradient (26%/40%) and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 28 min in a Beckman SW-41 rotor. The mitochondrial fraction in the interface between Percoll layers was transferred into a fresh tube, diluted 1:5 with medium containing 394 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of the latter medium and kept on ice. Liver and heart mitochondria were isolated and purified in the same way as nonsynaptic brain mitochondria, except the lower level in the discontinuous density gradient contained 60% Percoll (43Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurements of Light Scattering, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ), Respiration, and Ca2+ Uptake—Mitochondrial swelling was evaluated by following changes in the scattering of transmitted light by mitochondrial suspension at 525 nm in a 0.3-ml chamber at 37 °C and continuous stirring. In the experiments with slow Ca2+ infusion, mitochondrial swelling was followed by monitoring the scattering of light beam directed on mitochondrial suspension under 90° to the axis of the photodetector at 525 nm in a 0.4-ml cuvette at 37 °C and continuous stirring using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-55 luminescence spectrometer. Δψ was monitored by following the distribution of TPP+ between the external medium (initially 1.8 μm TPP+-Cl) and the mitochondrial matrix with a TPP+-sensitive electrode (45Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) in the standard incubation medium containing 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (free from fatty acids), 0.1 mm ADP, and 1 μm oligomycin supplemented with 3 mm glutamate and 1 mm malate unless stated otherwise. A decline in the external TPP+ concentration corresponded to mitochondrial polarization, whereas a rise in the TPP+ concentration in the medium corresponded to depolarization. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was measured by following the disappearance of Ca2+ from the incubation medium with a miniature Ca2+-selective electrode under the same conditions as the light scattering and Δψ. Mitochondrial respiration was recorded as described previously (46Shalbuyeva N. Brustovetsky T. Bolshakov A. Brustovetsky N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37547-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Respiratory activities and respiratory control ratios of mitochondrial preparations used in this study were similar to those published earlier (46Shalbuyeva N. Brustovetsky T. Bolshakov A.

Physiol. 2005; 568: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Where stated, experiments have been performed in hypotonic 75 mm KCl- or LiCl-based medium or medium where 125 mm KCl was substituted for equimolar concentrations of LiCl, NaCl, CsCl, RbCl, or N-methyl-d-glucamine. In all experiments with isolated mitochondria, the concentration of mitochondrial protein in the chamber was 0.1 mg/ml. All data traces shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. Experiments with Individual Mitochondria Loaded with Rhodamine 123—Membrane potential of individual brain nonsynaptic mitochondria was monitored following fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) loaded into mitochondria (48Huser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 49Vergun O. Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3358-3366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated mitochondria were placed into a glass-bottomed 35-mm Petri dish and continuously perfused with a standard incubation medium supplemented with 0.2 μm Rh123. In some experiments, KCl was substituted with equimolar LiCl. A Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S inverted microscope (100% output at the right optical port) equipped with a Nikon CFI Plan Apo VC ×100 1.4 numerical aperture objective and SimplePCI 6.1 software (Compix, Sewickley, PA) was used to visualize individual mitochondria loaded with Rh123 in nonquenching mode. In all experiments, mitochondria were perfused using a ValveBank 8 perfusion system (AutoMate Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Mitochondria were illuminated at 480 ± 20 nm using a Lambda LS lighting system (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) with a 175-watt xenon lamp. The light beam was attenuated by neutral density filters to 1%. Fluorescence was collected through a 505-nm dichroic mirror and a 535 ± 25-nm emission filter by a back-illuminated EM-CCD Hamamatsu C9100-12 camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Images were taken at room temperature every 15 s throughout the experiment. Slow Ca2+ Infusion—The experiments with slow Ca2+ infusion were performed as described previously (50Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19062-19070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mitochondria were incubated in a 0.3-ml chamber at 37 °C and continuous stirring. Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation was followed by monitoring the disappearance of Ca2+ from the incubation medium with a miniature Ca2+-selective electrode. Where stated, experiments have been performed in the standard incubation medium or in the media where KCl was substituted for equimolar LiCl, NaCl, CsCl, RbCl, or N-methyl-d-glucamine. All media were supplemented with 0.1 mm ADP and 1 μm oligomycin unless stated otherwise. A solution of CaCl2 was delivered into the chamber at a constant rate 333 nmol/mg protein × min using a KDS 100 syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) equipped with a Hamilton microsyringe. The Ca2+ capacity was estimated as the amount of accumulated Ca2+ (μmol/mg mitochondrial protein) before the failure to further accumulate Ca2+. This was determined by linear fitting of the initial fragment of the experimental trace and the final linear fragment of the trace and then finding the intersection point of these linear graph lines (Fig. 3). Measurements of ROS Production with Amplex Red Assay—Production of ROS by nonsynaptic brain mitochondria incubated in media of various cationic compositions was assessed using the Amplex Red assay for H2O2 (Invitrogen), as described previously (51Brustovetsky T. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. Brustovetsky N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 980-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Release of cytochrome c from isolated brain mitochondria was assessed using Western blotting in supernatants obtained through incubation of mitochondria either in 75 mm KCl- or 75 mm LiCl-based medium for 15 min at 37 °C with or without Ca2+. Western blotting was performed as previously described (51Brustovetsky T. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. Brustovetsky N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 980-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria treated with alamethicin (30 μg/ml) was used as a control for maximal cytochrome c release. Statistics—Statistical analyses of experimental data consisted of one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test (GraphPad Prism, version 4.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The data represent mean ± S.E. of at least three separate, independent experiments. Ca2+ Pulse Experiments with Purified Mitochondrial Suspension—In these experiments, we simultaneously evaluated two main manifestations of the mPT, mitochondrial depolarization and swelling (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Ca2+ pulses of various magnitudes were applied to mitochondria, and distribution of TPP+ between external medium and mitochondrial matrix (indicative of Δψ) and light scattering of mitochondrial suspension (indicative of matrix volume) were followed simultaneously in either KCl- or LiCl-based medium (Fig. 1a). In KCl medium, low and moderate Ca2+ pulses caused reversible swelling of brain mitochondria similar to those reported recently (46Shalbuyeva N. Brustovetsky T. Bolshakov A. Brustovetsky N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37547-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In LiCl medium, the same Ca2+ pulses produced a smaller amplitude of swelling. The effect of Li+ was concentration-dependent; smaller concentrations of Li+ produced less protection against swelling (supplemental Fig. 1). Larger Ca2+ pulses equalized the amplitude of swelling in both KCl and LiCl medium. In addition, Ca2+ pulses caused mitochondrial depolarization. In LiCl medium, a low Ca2+ pulse caused less depolarization than the same pulse applied in KCl medium (Fig. 1a). Replacement of K+ by Na+ failed to increase resilience of mitochondria to Ca2+ (not shown). The Ca2+-dependent depolarization and reversible swelling in brain mitochondria can be prevented by CsA and therefore can be attributed to the mPT (46Shalbuyeva N. Brustovetsky T. Bolshakov A. Brustovetsky N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37547-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that Li+ also protected brain mitochondria due to desensitization of the mPT pore to Ca2+. Li+ decreases apparent Vmax for Ca2+ uptake by liver mitochondria (52Bragadin M. Pozzan T. Azzone G.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5972-5978Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since the mPT depends on Ca2+ influx into mitochondria (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), we used parallel experiments to test whether replacement of K+ for Li+ affects mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. It appeared that mitochondria more effectively accumulated Ca2+ in LiCl medium than in KCl medium (Fig. 1b). Thus, desensitization of mitochondria to Ca2+ in LiCl medium cannot be explained by deficient Ca2+ uptake. The decreased mitochondrial swelling in LiCl medium correlated with a suppressed release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1c). The maximal cytochrome c release was observed after treatment of mitochondria with alamethicin, which eliminated the barrier properties of the OMM (41Brustovetsky N. Brustovetsky T. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this case, the release was similar in both KCl and LiCl medium. Thus, the substitution of K+ by Li+ did not affect the maximal cytochrome c release, but it prevented the release induced by Ca2+ pulses. Experiments with Individual Rh123-loaded Brain Mitochondria—Experiments with mitochondrial suspension treated with Ca2+ pulses provided valuable insight into the ability of mitochondria to withstand Ca2+ insult. However, this type of experiment requires a relatively high amount of purified mitochondria (in our hands, 30 μg of protein/assay) and correspondingly high nonphysiological concentrations of Ca2+ (50–300 μm in a 0.3-ml volume). In addition, submillimolar ADP or ATP prevented Ca2+-induced depolarization as well as swelling in this type of experiment (not shown). The use of individual brain mitochondria loaded with Rh123 to monitor Δψ helped to overcome these problems. Fig. 2a shows a representative fluorescence image of isolated brain mitochondria loaded with Rh123 in nonquenching mode. A similar approach was used previously with liver and brain mitochondria (48Huser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 49Vergun O. Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3358-3366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Prior to Ca2+ application, mitochondria maintained a stable Δψ (Fig. 2b). Perfusion with a solution containing 1 mm ATP and 0.5 μm of free Ca2+ (calculated using MaxChelator software Webmaxc Standard by C. Patton) caused depolarization in most of the mitochondria. In many mitochondria, perfusion with Ca2+ led to rapid fluctuations of Δψ, as previously observed (53Vergun O. Reynolds I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment, 1 μm carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone was applied to collapse the Δψ completely. The Ca2+-induced depolarization of mitochondria might be a consequence of the mPT (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Blalchy-Dyson E. Di Lisa F. Forte M.A. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2077-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Indeed, CsA antagonized Ca2+-induced depolarizations, linking them to the mPT (Fig. 2c). Li+ robustly protected mitochondria against Ca2+-induced depolarization (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2, e and f, summarizes these results, showing averaged traces for each representative experiment. Thus, the experiments with individual mitochondria substantiated the observations made in Ca2+-pulse experiments with mitochondrial suspension. In both cases, Li+ desensitized mitochondria to Ca2+ and antagonized the mPT. Slow Ca2+ Infusion—Although collapse of the Δψ appears to be the main outcome of the mPT (12Bernardi P. Krauskopf A.

https://openalex.org/W2024057198,"Cyclin D2 plays an important role in regulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation by cytokines and is implicated in oncogenesis of various hematopoietic malignancies. However, mechanisms regulating cyclin D2 stability and its expression level have remained to be known. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-3 signaling stabilizes cyclin D2 by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) through Janus kinase2-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in hematopoietic 32Dcl3 cells. On the other hand, osmotic stress was shown to induce a rapid proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2, which was mediated by activation of p38. GSK3β and p38 was demonstrated to phosphorylate cyclin D2 on Thr280 in vitro, while a cyclin D2 mutant with this residue substituted with Ala was found to be resistant to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation in 32Dcl3 cells. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway or induction of osmotic stress also caused a rapid proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2 in primary leukemic or myeloma cells. These results indicate that cyclin D2 expression in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells is regulated by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation that is triggered by Thr280 phosphorylation by GSK3β or p38, which is induced by inhibition of the PI3K pathway or by osmotic stress, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1970867404,"The alternative reading frame (ARF) mRNA encodes two pro-death proteins, the nucleolar p19ARF and a shorter mitochondrial isoform, named smARF (hsmARF in human). While p19ARF can inhibit cell growth by causing cell cycle arrest or type I apoptotic cell death, smARF is able to induce type II autophagic cell death. Inappropriate proliferative signals generated by proto-oncogenes, such as c-Myc and E2F1, can elevate both p19ARF and smARF proteins. Here, we reveal a novel means of regulation of smARF protein steady state levels through its interactions with the mitochondrial p32. The p32 protein physically interacts with both human and murine smARF, and colocalizes with these short isoforms to the mitochondria. Remarkably, knocking down p32 protein levels significantly reduced the steady state levels of smARF by increasing its turn over. As a consequence, the ability of ectopically expressed smARF to induce autophagy and to cause mitochondrial membrane dissipation was significantly reduced. In contrast, the protein levels of full-length p19ARF, which mainly resides in the nucleolus, were not influenced by p32 depletion, suggesting that p32 exclusively stabilizes the mitochondrial smARF protein. Thus the interaction with p32 provides a means of specifically regulating the expression of the recently identified autophagic inducer, smARF, and adds yet another layer of complexity to the multifaceted regulation of the ARF gene."
https://openalex.org/W1976068547,"LYL1, a member of the class II basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors, is aberrantly expressed in a fraction of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we generated transgenic mice ubiquitously overexpressing LYL1 using a construct expressing full-length cDNA driven by a human elongation factor 1α promoter. Four independent lines exhibiting high LYL1 expression were established. Of these transgenic mice, 96% displayed loss of hair with a short kinked tail. Furthermore, 30% of them developed malignant lymphoma, with an average latent period of 352 days. In these mice, histological examination revealed tumor cell infiltration in multiple organs and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the infiltrated tumor cells were either CD3 or CD45R/B220-positive; fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis indicated that each tumor consisted either of mainly CD4, CD8 double-positive T cells or mature B cells; the clonality of LYL1-induced lymphoma was confirmed by T-cell receptor rearrangement and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement analyses. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis and luciferase assay suggested that excess LYL1 blocked the dimerization of E2A and thus inhibited the regulatory activity of E2A on the CD4 promoter. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression of certain E2A/HEB target genes was downregulated. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that aberrant expression of LYL1 plays a role in lymphomagenesis."

Single and multiple turnover rapid scanning stopped-flow experiments have been conducted from pH 6.8–9.2 and 5–35 °C, and the results, interpreted within the framework of the recently solved crystal structures, allow refined characterization of the central kinetic and chemical steps of the reaction cycle.

Mehta P.K. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Ferreira G.C. Zhang J.S. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 2002; 48: 827-833PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schulze J.O.

Many organisms, including animals and some bacteria, are known to encode two genetically distinct ALAS genes. In animals one of these genes is expressed exclusively in developing erythrocytes, and mutations in the human erythroid-specific ALAS are correlated with hereditary X-linked sideroblastic anemia, a blood disorder characterized by iron-overloaded, heme-deficient red cells (4Bottomley S.S. Greer J.F. Lukens J. Rodgers J.N. Paraskevas G.M. Glader R.B. Wintrobe’s Clinical Hematology. 2004: 1011-1033Google Scholar). PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a wide variety of reactions, including transaminations, decarboxylations, racemizations, and retro-aldol cleavages (5Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 6Toney M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of cases the biochemical versatility of PLP can be rationalized in terms of a single property of the cofactor, the potential to act as an electron sink, and stabilize negative charge at the α-carbon of the substrate amino acid. Electrons from cleaved bonds of the covalently bound substrate can delocalize into the conjugated pyridine ring system to form quinonoid intermediates, which are often sufficiently stable to be spectroscopically observable and are characterized by strong absorption maxima of ∼500 nm. These and other changes in the spectroscopic properties of the PLP cofactor during partial or complete reaction cycles can provide important insights into the chemical and kinetic properties of these enzymes. The generally accepted chemical mechanism of ALAS is outlined in Scheme 1 (7Kikuchi G. Kumar A. Talmage P. Shemin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1214-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zaman Z. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This reaction mechanism appears unnecessarily complex, because decarboxylation of glycine followed by condensation with succinyl-CoA to generate ALA directly would represent a more straightforward synthesis. This possibility is negated, however, by experimental data indicating that the initial and final steps of the chemical mechanism involve proton transfers from and to the amino acid α-carbon, in analogy to aminotransferases (9Zaman Z. Jordan P.M. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Akhtar M. Abboud M.M. Barnard G. Jordan P. Zaman Z. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol.

The existence of the α-amino-β-ketoadipate intermediate (IV) has not been definitively confirmed, but the occurrence of the corresponding intermediate in both amino-oxononanoate synthase (12Kerbarh O. Campopiano D.J. Baxter R.L. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2006; : 60-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ketobutyrate ligase (13Schmidt A. Sivaraman J. Li Y. Larocque R. Barbosa J.A. Smith C. Matte A. Schrag J.D. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), enzymes that are structurally and mechanistically homologous with ALAS, suggest it is on the ALAS reaction pathway. Notwithstanding this supporting evidence, the mechanistically unusual sequential cleavage of not one but two bonds to the amino acid substrate α-carbon is another factor casting doubt on the accuracy and sufficiency of Scheme 1. Cleavage of two α-carbon bonds is particularly difficult to reconcile with the stereoelectronic control hypothesis explaining the remarkable reaction-type specificity of PLP-dependent enzymes (6Toney M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Dunathan H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Based on earlier work by Corey (15Corey R.A.E.J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 6269-6278Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar), Dunathan proposed that in order for efficient electron delocalization into the conjugated ring system to occur the bond to be cleaved must be oriented perpendicular to the plane of the PLP ring (14Dunathan H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This orthogonal orientation most closely aligns the sigma orbitals of the bond to be cleaved with the pi orbitals of the conjugated ring system, and because these orbitals must coalesce and rehybridize in the transition state, the said orientation would theoretically provide a pathway with lowered activation energy by bringing the reactants part way along the reaction coordinate toward the transition state. The contour and magnitude of the free energy changes associated with adoption of this stereoelectronic orientation are as yet unknown, but experimental (16Fogle E.J. Liu W. Woon S.T. Keller J.W. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16392-16404Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and computational (17Tsai M.D. Weintraub H.J. Byrn S.R. Chang C. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3183-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) studies have yielded estimates of 3–8 kcal/mol, corresponding to rate accelerations of up to a millionfold. In order for sequential cleavage of two of the glycine α-carbon bonds to occur in strict adherence with Dunathan’s hypothesis, the stereochemistry involved in the ALAS mechanism described by Scheme 1 would imply torsion about the aldimine linkage of ∼60° at some point during the time interval between formation of the two quinonoid intermediates. Alternatively, decarboxylation of the reaction intermediate (IV) might initially occur through the β-keto group rather than into the cofactor ring, as has been suggested for amino-oxononanoate synthase (18Alexeev D.

Chem. 2006; 4: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or ALAS may represent a notable exception to Dunathan’s hypothesis. Resolution of these ambiguities would provide insights not only into the ALAS catalytic mechanism, but also the scope and stringency of Dunathan’s stereoelectronic control hypothesis. A model for catalysis by ALAS involving interconversion between “open” and “closed” conformations has been proposed based on kinetic data (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been suggested that a portion of the intrinsic binding energy for the second substrate, succinyl-CoA, is sacrificed to shift the equilibrium toward the closed conformation where catalysis occurs, and turnover is limited by reversion to the open conformation, which is associated with release of ALA from the enzyme. The recently solved crystal structures of the Rhodobacter capsulatus ALAS holoenzyme, along with structures in which glycine or succinyl-CoA are bound at the active site, appear to be remarkably consistent with this kinetically derived model (20Astner I. Schulze J.O. van den Heuvel J. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3166-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The active site is located at the bottom of a channel at the interface between the subunits, and a short stretch of highly conserved amino acids near the C terminus closes over the active site in the substrate-bound structures but adopts a more open conformation in one subunit of the holoenzyme structure. The structures suggest that this “loop” closes over the active site and locks succinyl-CoA in the proper juxtaposition for catalysis and, subsequently, opens to allow ALA dissociation. The succinyl-CoA-bound structure indicates that molecular recognition of this substrate includes interactions that bridge the apposing enzyme domains and apparently stabilize the closed conformation. The ALAS active site contains distinct features that should help further clarify the catalytic mechanism. The PLP cofactor is oriented such that the plane of the pyridinium ring is nearly perpendicular to the active site channel, and the pro-R proton of bound glycine faces down toward the protein core perpendicular to the plane of the cofactor ring and toward the side chain of the catalytic lysine residue, whereas the carboxyl group is oriented ∼30° out of the plane of the cofactor ring. The side of the cofactor ring facing the active site channel is not entirely solvent-exposed, because it is overlaid by a histidine residue that forms part of a conserved network of hydrogen bonds that bridge the pyridinium ring nitrogen of the cofactor through four amino acid side chains to the thioester carbonyl of succinyl-CoA (Fig. 1). This carbonyl is conserved in the product ALA and appears to be required to form a quinonoid intermediate, based on the absence of a quinonoid upon binding of aminopentanoate, an ALA analog in which the carbonyl carbon is saturated (21Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44660-44669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The observation that these two potential electron sinks are bridged by a conserved hydrogen bonding network suggests the possibility of a functional connectivity. The kinetic mechanism involves ordered binding of glycine and succinyl-CoA, followed by formation of a quinonoid intermediate, and product release, which is rate-determining (8Nandi D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8872-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44660-44669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that single turnover stopped-flow experiments might allow discrimination of the two putative quinonoid intermediates and provide a basis for detailed characterization of the intermediate steps of the catalytic cycle (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44660-44669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the chemistry and kinetics of the transient reaction steps involved in conversion of substrates into products, and reconcile the available structural and kinetic data with Dunathan's hypothesis, we have conducted single and multiple turnover stopped-flow experiments under conditions of varying pH or temperature. The results have been interpreted within the framework of the recently solved crystal structures and support important refinements to the chemical and kinetic mechanisms. Reagents—The following reagents were from Sigma: DEAE-Sephacel, β-mercaptoethanol, PLP, bovine serum albumin, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate, NAD+, thiamin pyrophosphate, succinyl-CoA, ALA-hydrochloride, HEPES free acid, and the bicinchoninic acid protein determination kit. Glycerol, mono- and dibasic potassium phosphate, disodium EDTA dihydrate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, glycine, [2-2H2]glycine, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Fisher. Ultrogel AcA-44 was from IBF Biotechnics. SDS-PAGE reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Overexpression, Purification, Storage, Handling, and Analysis of mALAS-2—The overexpression, purification, storage, handling, and analysis of mALAS-2 were conducted as described previously (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard, from which the extinction coefficient for the purified enzyme was estimated as 46,000 liter mol–1 cm–1 at 278 nm. Reported enzyme concentrations are based on a monomeric molecular mass of 56,523 kDa, as calculated from the primary amino acid sequence (22Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic measurements were conducted using an OLIS model RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The dead time of this instrument is ∼2 ms, and the observation chamber optical path length is 4.0 mm. Scans covering the wavelength region 320–550 nm were acquired at a rate of 1000 scans per second. For reactions longer than 3–4 s, the collected scans were averaged to yield either 62.5 or 31.25 scans per second to condense the resulting data files to a size suitable for global fit analyses. In all cases the resulting data files contained 3000–4000 total spectral scans. An external water bath was utilized to control the temperature of the syringes and observation chamber, and the temperature at the syringes and observation chamber was determined with a Fisherbrand –20 to 110 °C thermometer. The concentrations of reactants loaded into the syringes were always 2-fold greater than that reported, such that the reported concentrations represent the final concentrations present in the stopped-flow cell compartment after mixing. Observed rate constants were determined by Robust Global Fitting of the acquired spectral data, using the single value decomposition software provided by OLIS, Inc. (17Tsai M.D. Weintraub H.J. Byrn S.R. Chang C. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3183-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Alexeev D. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Kerbarh O. Sawyer L. Tomczyk N. Watt R. Webster S.P. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2006; 4: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Quality of fits was judged by analysis of the calculated residuals, and the simplest mechanism adequate to accurately describe the experimental data was used. Single turnover data were modeled using a three-kinetic-step mechanism as described by Reaction 1, whereas multiple turnover data were modeled using a two-step kinetic mechanism as described by Reaction 2. A→kobs1B→kobs2C→kobs3D1 A→kobs1B→kobs2C2 For each set of experimental conditions the observed rate constants were determined from three or more replicate experiments, and the reported values represent the average and standard error of measurement for each experimental condition. Estimation of both forward and reverse rate constants was accomplished by modeling single wavelength kinetic traces at 510 nm with KinTekSim kinetic simulation software (23Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The eight interior rate constants were allowed to float, while the KD values were held constant as determined separately (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Single Turnover pH Variation Experiments—Single turnover stopped-flow pH studies were conducted at 30 °C under a constant set of background conditions with the buffer and pH as the only variables. One syringe was filled with a solution containing 100 μm purified mALAS-2, 260 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm buffer, whereas the other syringe contained 20 μm succinyl-CoA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm buffer. The buffers utilized were: MES, pH 6.0–6.5; MOPS, pH 6.6–7.0; HEPES, pH 7.1–7.8; TAPS, pH 7.9–8.5; and AMPSO, pH 8.6–9.2. These conditions yielded a solution of 100 μm mALAS-2-glycine complex reacting with an equivalent volume of a solution containing 20 μm succinyl-CoA such that the final concentrations in the observation chamber were 50 μm mALAS-2-glycine complex, 10 μm succinyl-CoA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm buffer. The presence of glycerol was essential to maintain enzyme solubility at lower pH values. Multiple Turnover pH Variation Experiments—Multiple turnover stopped-flow pH studies were conducted at 20 °C. Again, the only variables were the buffer and pH. One of the syringes was loaded with a solution containing 80 μm mALAS-2, 260 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm buffer, whereas the other syringe contained 200 μm succinyl-CoA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 mm buffer. Upon mixing equivalent volumes from each of the two syringes the final concentrations of enzyme and substrates in the observation chamber were halved such that the reaction observed was between 40 μm mALAS-2-glycine complex and 100 μm succinyl-CoA. The buffers and pH ranges were the same as described for the single turnover experiments. For both single and multiple turnover experiments the shots from each set of conditions were collected into a clean waste syringe, and the final pH was verified by direct reading using an Accumet AR15 pH meter. The syringes and observation chamber were flushed with 3–4 syringe volumes of purified water between each set of experimental conditions to remove residual buffer between experiments. pH determinations were conducted at the same temperature as that used in the stopped-flow experiments. Apparent pKa values for quinonoid intermediate formation and the first step of quinonoid intermediate decay were determined by fitting the observed rate constants as a function of pH to Equation 1 using SigmaPlot graphing software, kobs=A(1+10pH−pKa)+B3 where kobs is the observed rate constant, A is the theoretical difference in the observed rate constants associated with the protonated and deprotonated species, pKa is the pH at which the ionizing group is 50% protonated, and B is the rate of reaction when the ionizing group is 100% deprotonated. Single Turnover Temperature Variation Studies—Single turnover temperature variation studies were conducted using conditions identical to those described for the single turnover pH studies, with the pH held constant at 8.1 and the temperature varied from 5 to 35 °C in 5 °C increments. A pH of 8.1 was considered to represent a reasonable compromise between the low signal amplitudes observed at lower pH values and the extended reaction times required at higher pH values, as seen in Fig. 3. The formation of condensate on the stopped-flow cell at low temperatures was prevented by purging the observation chamber with nitrogen during the experiments. Thermodynamic Activation Parameters—Temperature dependence data were fit to the Arrhenius equation (Equation 2), ln(kobs)=−EaR1T+ln(A)4 where Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and A is the frequency factor. Activation energies were calculated by multiplying the slopes of the Arrhenius plots by the negative reciprocal of the gas constant. Enthalpies of activation were then obtained using the activation energy and Equation 3, where ΔH‡ is the enthalpy of activation. ΔH‡=Ea−RT5 Observed free energies of activation were determined separately at 30 °C and pH 7.5 using Equation 4, which relates the free energy of activation to the observed rate constant. ΔG‡=−RTln(kobsh/kBT)6 Where ΔG‡ is the observed free energy of activation, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and h is Planck’s constant. Observed entropies of activation were estimated using Equation 5 and the derived free energies and enthalpies of activation as described above. ΔS‡=−ΔG‡−ΔH‡T7 Kinetic Isotope Effects with Dideuteroglycine—Single turnover studies to determine the kinetic isotope effects resulting from substitution of glycine with dideuteroglycine were conducted at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. One syringe contained 200 μm enzyme and 320 mm glycine (or dideuteroglycine) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol, whereas the other syringe contained 40 μm succinyl-CoA in the same buffer. Glycine or dideuteroglycine was added last, and the experiments were conducted immediately thereafter. Structural Analyses—The protein data base files 2BWN, 2BWO, and 2BWP, corresponding to the holoenzyme, succinyl-CoA bound, and glycine-bound R. capsulatus ALAS crystal structures, were used as models for the mALAS-2 catalytic core (20Astner I. Schulze J.O. van den Heuvel J. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3166-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Superpositioning of crystal structures and hydrogen bond determinations were accomplished using Deepview/Swiss-PdbViewer software (24Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4505) Google Scholar, 25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar). Modeling of the α-amino-β-ketoadipate intermediate into the active site was accomplished using PyMOL software 4W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. and drawing the α-amino-β-ketoadipate intermediate such that the hydrogen bonds to the succinylmoiety of succinyl-CoA were preserved in the corresponding atoms of the intermediate. The major spectral change observed during single turnover stopped-flow absorbance studies was the formation and decay of a quinonoid intermediate with an absorbance maximum of ∼510 nm. During early pilot experiments a variety of kinetic mechanisms was examined as prospective models for fitting the global data, with the goal of ascertaining the simplest kinetic mechanism that accurately described the experimental data. The single turnover kinetic profiles were found to be best described by the three-step sequential mechanism represented by Reaction 1. The three reaction steps were visually observable in single wavelength traces of quinonoid intermediate formation and decay, as illustrated in Fig. 2, which is from a representative single turnover experiment at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. In Fig. 2A, the time course at 510 nm was overlaid with the global fit of the spectral data at the same wavelength using Reaction 1. The reaction was observed to involve a single kinetic step of quinonoid intermediate formation followed by two decay steps. Other early experiments indicated the rate and amplitude of the second step of quinonoid intermediate decay was dependent upon glycine concentration, a result that was interpreted as a reflection of competitive binding between the ALA produced during the single turnover, which binds relatively tightly and forms a quinonoid intermediate, and glycine, which does not bind tightly and does not form a quinonoid intermediate. To ensure that the second step of quinonoid intermediate decay accurately approximated the rate of ALA release from the enzyme, excess glycine was essential to trap the enzyme in the glycine-bound form at the reaction end point. In the experiments reported here the concentration of glycine was maintained at seven or more times the spectrophotometrically determined dissociation constant, whereas the concentration of ALA formed was never more than approximately one-half the dissociation constant. The calculated spectra for each of the four kinetic species from the global fitting are graphed in Fig. 2B. The starting and ending spectra were similar, whereas the two intermediary spectra, corresponding to the two kinetic intermediates, differed primarily in the magnitude of quinonoid absorbance. The global fit indicated that the quinonoid intermediate arose from the 420 nm peak with an isosbestic point at ∼442 nm. A video of the time course entitled “mALAS-2 single turnover” is provided as supplemental data. The first 5 s of the modeled time courses for each of the four species indicate that the two intermediates were fully formed within 250 and 1600 ms, respectively. The observed rate constants for the three steps of the reaction were 5.3 ± 0.6/s, 2.8 ± 0.3/s, and 0.074 ± 0.005/s. The pH dependence of the single turnover reaction kinetics at 30 °C was investigated. These studies indicated that pH changes had substantial effects on the observed rate constants for quinonoid intermediate formation and the first step of quinonoid decay, whereas the second step of quinonoid decay was relatively pH-independent over the range tested (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3A representative 510 nm single-wavelength kinetic traces were extracted and overlaid with the best global fit to the spectral data at this wavelength. The observed rate constants for all three kinetic steps increased as the pH was lowered, although only the first step of quinonoid intermediate decay could be accurately described by Equation 1 for an acid-catalyzed reaction involving transfer of a single proton. This set of experiments suggested quinonoid intermediate formation was also acid-catalyzed, but the small proportion of data points associated with this kinetic phase, particularly at lower pH values where the signal amplitude was also low, led to large standard errors. Additionally, it was not possible to estimate an acid-catalyzed end point for quinonoid intermediate formation, due to increasing instability of the enzyme as the pH was dropped below 7.0. The single turnover pH dependence of the three phases are plotted in Fig. 3B. A fit of the first step of quinonoid decay to Equation 1 resulted in an apparent kinetic pKa of 8.1 ± 0.1. This value was virtually identical to the previously determined apparent spectroscopic pKa for Lys-313-catalyzed abstraction of the C-4 pro-R proton of bound ALA to form a quinonoid intermediate (11Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The difficulties associated with accurate determination of the pH dependence of quinonoid formation were overcome by switching to multiple turnover conditions with excess succinyl-CoA at 20 °C. Under multiple turnover conditions quinonoid intermediate formation is followed by a single step representing decay into the steady state (19Hunter G.A. Ferreira"

https://openalex.org/W2026452577,"Many tumors have chronically elevated activity of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways, caused largely by oncogenic mutation of PI 3-kinase itself or loss of the opposing tumor suppressor lipid phosphatase, PTEN. Several PI 3-kinase-dependent feedback mechanisms have been identified that may affect the sensitivity of upstream receptor signaling, but the events required to initiate an inhibited state have not been addressed. We show that in a variety of cell types, loss of PTEN via experimental knockdown or in tumor cell lines correlates with a block in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/insulin signaling, without affecting the sensitivity of platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor signaling. These effects on IGF/insulin signaling include a reduction of up to five- to tenfold in IGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation, a failure to activate the ERK kinases and, in some cells, reduced expression of insulin receptor substrate 1, and both IGF1 and insulin receptors. These data indicate that chronically elevated PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling to the degree seen in many tumors causes a selective loss of sensitivity in IGF1/insulin signaling that could significantly reduce the selective advantage of deregulated activation of IGF1/IGF1-R signaling in tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2104354950,"The INK4A locus encodes two tumor suppressor genes, p16INK4A and p14ARF, transcribed using alternative exons 1α or 1β spliced onto the same exons 2 and 3. Both p16INK4A and p14ARF are capable of inhibiting the cell-cycle progression, albeit in different manner; p16INK4A is phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (pRB) dependent while p14ARF is p53-dependent. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel variant of p16INK4A, termed p16γ, in a primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient sample and a neuroblastoma cell line, which was expressed at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Cloning and sequencing of the p16γ cDNA revealed that p16γ was identical to p16INK4A, except that it contained an in-frame insertion of 197 bp between exons 2 and 3. p16γ expression was detected in the majority of p16INK4A-expressing primary T-ALL and B-ALL patient samples and other p16INK4A-expressing tumor samples, but was only barely detectable in some normal mononuclear cells and other non-tumor samples. Structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism confirmed that p16γ, like p16INK4A, is also an ankyrin-repeat protein. Functional analysis of p16γ revealed that p16γ protein interacted with cyclin D-dependent kinase4 and inhibited its kinase activity. Using a luciferase reporter assay, the transfection of p16γ repressed the E2F response, the downstream target of pRB, with an efficacy equivalent to that of p16INK4A. Moreover p16γ, like p16INK4A, induced cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1, and inhibited cell growth in colony formation assay."
https://openalex.org/W1964070982,"Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of proteins is mostly mediated by specific interaction between transport receptors of the importin β family and signal sequences present in their cargo. While several signal sequences, in particular the classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) recognized by the heterodimeric importin α/β complex are well known, the signals recognized by other importin β-like transport receptors remain to be characterized in detail. Here we present the systematic analysis of the nuclear import of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Asr1p, a nonessential alcohol-responsive Ring/PHD finger protein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus upon alcohol stress. Nuclear import of Asr1p is constitutive and mediated by its C-terminal domain. A short sequence comprising residues 243–280 is sufficient and necessary for active targeting to the nucleus. Moreover, the nuclear import signal is conserved from yeast to mammals. <i>In vitro</i>, the nuclear localization signal of Asr1p directly interacts with the importins Kap114p, Kap95p, Pse1p, Kap123p, or Kap104p, interactions that are sensitive to the presence of RanGTP. <i>In vivo</i>, these importins cooperate in nuclear import. Interestingly, the same importins mediate nuclear transport of histone H2A. Based on mutational analysis and sequence comparison with a region mediating nuclear import of histone H2A, we identified a novel type of NLS with the consensus sequence R/K<i>xx</i>L(<i>x</i>)<i><sub>n</sub></i>V/Y<i>xx</i>V/I<i>x</i>K/R<i>xxx</i>K/R that is recognized by five yeast importins and connects them into a highly efficient network for nuclear import of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979299534,"We have recently shown that E1A protein of human adenovirus downregulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and induces apoptosis in head and neck (HNSCC) and lung cancer cells independently of their p53 status. E1A has five isoforms of which the major ones E1A12S and E1A13S regulate transcription of cellular genes by binding to transcriptional modulators such as pRB, CtBP, p300 and p400. In this study, we have identified E1A12S isoform to have the highest effect on EGFR suppression and induction of apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Similar to Ad5, E1A12S from human adenovirus types 2, 3, 9 and 12 suppressed EGFR, whereas E1A12S of adenovirus types 4 and 40 had no effect on EGFR expression. Using deletion mutants of E1A12S we have shown that interaction of E1A with p400, but not p300 or pRB, is required for EGFR suppression and apoptosis. Inhibition of p400 by short hairpin RNA confirmed that HNSCC cells with reduced p400 expression were less sensitive to E1A-induced suppression of EGFR and apoptosis. p300 function was shown to be dispensable, as cells expressing E1A mutants that are unable to bind p300, or p300 knockout cells, remained sensitive to E1A-induced apoptosis. In summary, this study identifies p400 as an important mediator of E1A-induced downregulation of EGFR and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023855399,"Vinexin is an adaptor protein supposed to play pivotal roles in various cellular events such as cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, signaling and gene expression. Despite the possible importance, physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of vinexin are largely unknown. In addition, although vinexin was reported to be phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), physiological significance of the phosphorylation remains to be elucidated. Here we carried out characterization of endogenous vinexin and found that it was enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells and focal adhesions of spread cells. In the analyses using ERK-phosphorylated vinexin-specific antibody, the phosphorylation signal was also detected at the leading edges of migrating cells and at cell periphery of spreading cells, whereas only faint signal was observed at focal adhesions of well-spread cells. We then established LNCaP cell lines stably expressing GFP-fused vinexinβ or two mutants at Ser189 that mimic the ERK-phosphorylated or -unphosphorylated vinexinβ. Based on the analyses using the lines, the phosphorylation was likely to inhibit the cell spreading and migration. On the other hand, anchorage-independent cell growth was inhibited by unphosphorylated vinexinβ. Taken together, ERK-mediated phosphorylation of vinexinβ is strongly suggested to occur in a spatio-temporally regulated manner and play important roles in cell spreading, migration and anchorage-independent growth."

Here, we show that SCP-x is processed on the peroxisomal surface to liberate a short C-terminal product of 12.9 kDa. This fragment has DNA binding activity in vivo and in vitro, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, DNA-protein pull-down, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and luciferase reporter activity.

Billheimer J.T. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10660-10668Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Ohba T. Rennert H. Pfeifer S.M. He Z. Yamamoto R. Holt J.A. Billheimer J.T. Strauss III, J.F. Genomics. 1994; 24: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).The 58.9-kDa SCP-x is post-translationally cleaved to produce a 46-kDa N-terminal fragment that localizes in the peroxisomal matrix, where it acts as a 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase, and a 13.2-kDa C-terminal fragment containing SCP-2. The cleavage itself occurs on the peroxisomal surface, even though an extraperoxisomal cleavage has also been proposed (1Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal targeting is provided by the last three amino acids (AKL) on the C-terminal tail of SCP-x acting as a peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1). 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting sequence; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; LDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; mβ-CD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal deleted; CND, N- and C-terminal deleted. 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting sequence; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; LDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; mβ-CD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; NTD, N-terminal domain; CTD, C-terminal deleted; CND, N- and C-terminal deleted. The PTS1 is also removed, most likely following the initial N-terminal cleavage, thereby releasing the 12.9-kDa mature form of SCP-2 (1Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A similar processing of the 15.4-kDa pro-SCP-2 has been suggested by immunocytochemistry; however, biochemical proof in vivo and in vitro is lacking.Different aspects of cholesterol metabolism and distribution have been shown to regulate the production of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), a 38–43-amino acid-long peptide that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, one of the most common forms of age-associated disorders (8Puglielli L. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, the possible role of intracellular cholesterol carriers (including SCP-2) in the regulation of Alzheimer disease neuropathology has not yet been evaluated.Here, we show that SCP-x undergoes post-translational processing on the peroxisomal surface liberating a short C-terminal product of 12.9 kDa that acts as a transcription factor. The generation of this fragment is tightly controlled by pro-SCP-2, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of SCP-x processing. Deletion mutant clones of pro-SCP-2 indicate that this novel regulatory function requires a peroxisomal targeting sequence at the C terminus and a 20-amino acid leading sequence at the N terminus. The transcriptionally active 12.9-kDa SCP-x product is able to translocate to the nucleus where it activates transcription of CD147, the regulatory subunit of the γ-secretase complex. Expression of pro-SCP-2 abolished the activation of the transcriptionally active 12.9-kDa SCP-2 and shut down the transcription of CD147. This resulted in a 3–5-fold increase in γ-secretase activity in vitro and in vivo and increased production of Aβ. In addition to its transcription regulatory function, pro-SCP-2 translocates cholesterol to the cell surface and has a major impact on the intracellular cycling of cholesterol. However, in contrast to its transcription regulatory function, neither the peroxisomal targeting sequence at the C terminus nor the 20-amino acid leading sequence at the N terminus is required for the cholesterol carrier function of the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, cell culture techniques, Western blot analysis, Aβ determination by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in vitro determination of β- and γ-secretase activities, and statistical analysis were described previously (9Costantini C.

Primer sequences are available upon request.Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-SCP-x/SCP-2 (generous gift from Dr. F. Schroeder), anti-APP C-terminal (Chemicon), anti-PS1 N-terminal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CD147 (Chemicon), anti-Nicastrin (Santa Cruz), anti-Aph-1 (Chemicon), anti-Pen-2 (Zymed Laboratories), anti-Notch intracellular domain (Cell Signaling), anti-SREBP-2 (BD-Biosciences), anti-Myc (Sigma), and anti-actin (Cell Signaling).Incorporation of Acetate into Cholesterol and Oleate into Cholesterol Esters—The rate of acetate incorporation into cholesterol in living cell cultures was determined as described previously (12Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On day 1, cell monolayers (60–70% confluency) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine lipoprotein-deficient serum (LDS; produced as described before (2Puglielli L. Rigotti A. Greco A.V. Santos M.J. Nervi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). On day 2, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and switched to medium containing 5% LDS and 0.5 mm [14C]acetate. The specific activity of radiolabeled acetate (∼400 cpm/pmol) was kept constant throughout all of the experiments. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells were harvested for the analysis of cellular [14C]cholesterol, as described above.For the incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl [14C]oleate, the experiments were essentially performed as described above with the difference that radiolabeled oleate was preincubated with medium containing LDS and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min before being added to the cell monolayers.LDL Radiolabeling and Uptake—LDL (density 1.025–1.063 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of fetal bovine serum as described (13Brissette L. Charest M.C. Falstrault L. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Before isolation, the serum was adjusted to 0.01% EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Isolated LDL were then labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether following incubation with LDS and gentle rotation for 32 h at 37 °C (14Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the labeled lipoproteins were reisolated by ultracentrifugation, filtered with 0.22-μm filters, and used immediately. The specific activity of lipoprotein labeled in cholesterol ester was ∼5700 cpm/μg of protein. Radiolabeled LDL were added to serum-free cultures at 20 μg/ml concentration for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the surface, and counted on a liquid scintillation counter.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—H4 cells were cultured in complete medium in 150-mm Petri dishes until ∼70% confluent. The cells were then fixed by the addition of 280 μl of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma) to 10 ml of culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, harvested, and processed for ChIP using a commercially available kit (Active Motif). SCP-2-DNA immune complexes were precipitated with a polyclonal antibody against SCP-x/pro-SCP-2. PCR was carried out using primer sets centered on the 5′-untranslated region of the CD147 promoter (15Guo H. Majmudar G. Jensen T.C. Biswas C. Toole B.P. Gordon M.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 220: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Liang L. Major T. Bocan T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Fractions—Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described by Shetty and Idell (17Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13771-13779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected as cytosolic proteins.Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the protocol of Das et al. (18Das S. Ward S.V. Tacke R.S. Suske G. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3244-3253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture) followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Cell suspensions were gently pipetted up and down; the lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain nuclear pellets. Nuclear pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer (lacking Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture) and then resuspended in 2 volumes of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture). The nuclei were extracted by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min; the resultant supernatant fraction was used as a nuclear extract.Biotin-Streptavidin Pull-down Assay—One microgram of biotin double-stranded DNA was used in pull-down assays performed as described previously (19Ragione F.D. Cucciolla V. Criniti V. Indaco S. Borriello A. Zappia V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23360-23368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The probe used, corresponding to positions -492 to +10 of the human CD147 promoter, was incubated with 500 μg of nuclear and total cell extracts for 20 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor. Following the incubation, 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were added to the reaction and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Prior to this step, 300 μl of the original streptavidin-agarose bead preparation were preadsorbed with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and 50 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were washed three times and resuspended in 300 μl of the binding buffer. The protein-DNA-streptavidin-agarose complex was washed three times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS loading buffer. The samples were then separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel system (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot.EMSA—The EMSA for SCP-2 was performed using the Lightshift Chemiluminesent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of the CD147 promoter were labeled using the biotin 3′ end labeling kit (Pierce) and incubated with an affinity-purified 12.9-kDa mature form of SCP-2 for 30 min. Additionally, increasing concentrations (50×, 100×, and 300×) of the unlabeled probe were added to confirm specificity of the interaction. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a 6% retardation gel (Invitrogen) containing 0.5× Tris borate (TBE) and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE prior to visualization according to the manufacturer.Luciferase Reporter Assay—The ChIP-positive promoter fragments corresponding to region 3 and part c of Fig. 4A were cloned into a promoterless pGL3 plasmid (Promega). H4 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the promoter-reporter construct as well as the empty vector along with 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection with a dual luciferase kit (Promega) and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Co-transfected Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency.Antisense Treatment—Phosphodiester oligonucleotides, including scp-x antisense (3′-acgtcggtacaggagaag-5′) and sense (5′-tgcagccatgtcctcttc-3′), were synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center and purified on reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (10Costantini C. Scrable H. Puglielli L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both oligonucleotides were designed to overlap the start codon of scp-x and used at 10 μm final concentration. Treatment was started 5 days before the experiment, and the oligonucleotides were added every day.RESULTSPro-SCP-2 Regulates the Enzymatic Activity of γ-Secretase—We initially wanted to assess whether the cholesterol binding/carrier function of pro-SCP-2 was able to affect Aβ metabolism. Accordingly, we decided to characterize the effect that the stable transfection of pro-SCP-2 had on cellular cholesterol metabolism. Fig. 1A shows that, when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, pro-SCP-2 enhanced the translocation of cholesterol from the ER to the PM, resulting in a parallel increase of sterols in cholesterol-rich domains (also called lipid rafts) (Fig. 1B). The continual removal of cholesterol from the ER membrane caused the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), an ER membrane-based transcription factor that controls cholesterol levels in the ER membrane and regulates both biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol (20Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). As a consequence, we also observed an increase in both receptor-mediated internalization of extracellular lipoproteins (Fig. 1D) and acetate incorporation into the mevalonic pathway (Fig. 1E). These events led to a ∼3-fold increase in the levels of total cell cholesterol (Fig. 1F); however, no overall effect was observed on cholesterol distribution between the pool of free and ester derivatives (Fig. 1G). Therefore, the above results confirm the ability of pro-SCP-2 to stimulate the cycling of intracellular cholesterol, producing major changes in cholesterol metabolism and distribution (schematically shown in Fig. 1H; see also Refs. 1Gallegos A.M.

C99 and C83 are proteolytic intermediates resulting from β and α cleavage of APP, respectively. They also act as the immediate substrates for γ cleavage, which is the final proteolytic step for the generation of Aβ from the C99 fragment of APP (8Puglielli L. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 21Puglielli L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; doi: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.01.010PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in C99 was paralleled by an increase in Aβ generation/secretion (Fig. 2B), suggesting a direct effect on γ, rather than β, cleavage of APP. This last conclusion is also supported by the fact that pro-SCP-2 affected the steady-state levels of both C99 and C83. No overall effect was observed on the Aβ42/Aβtotal ratio (Fig. 2B), excluding any apparent interference with the affinity of γ secretase for its immediate substrate, C99.FIGURE 2pro-SCP-2 regulates the expression levels of CD147, the regulatory subunit of γ secretase.

Two different pro-SCP-2-expressing clones are shown. E, the C-terminal fragment of Notch (NICD), generated by γ cleavage of Notch, was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the cytosolic fraction of control and pro-SCP-2-expressing cells prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Wb) analysis.

It is worth remembering that APPC105 mimics C99 and acts as γ (but not β) substrate (11Puglielli L. Konopka G. Pack-Chung E. Ingano L.A. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. Chang T.Y. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 22Puglielli L. Ellis B.C. Saunders A.J. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19777-19783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When expressed in H4-APP751 cells, pro-SCP-2 reduced the steady-state levels of both C99 and C83 (Fig. 2C), confirming the results obtained with CHO cells (Fig. 2A). The dramatic decrease in APPC105 levels following expression in H4-APPC105 cells (Fig. 2D) further demonstrates the ability of pro-SCP-2 to activate γ cleavage of APP. This conclusion was also confirmed by the increased levels of the Notch intracellular C-terminal domain, another product of γ cleavage, observed in the cytosol of H4 cells following pro-SCP-2 expression (Fig. 2E), and by the ability of the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-3,5-difluorophenacetyl]-l-alanyl-S-phenylglycine methyl ester (DAPM) to restore the levels of APPC105 (Fig. 2F). Finally, in vitro analysis of γ-secretase activity from CHAPSO-solubilized membranes showed a ∼3-fold increase in pro-SCP-2-expressing cells, compared with control (Fig. 2G). No effect was observed on the in vitro activity of the β-secretase BACE1 (data not shown).Analysis of the steady-state levels of the different members of the γ-secretase complex (PS1, Nicastrin, Aph-1, Pen-2, and CD147) revealed a marked decrease in the levels of both the low and high glycosylated forms of CD147 (Fig. 2H), the regulatory subunit of the enzymatic complex (23Zhou S. Zhou H. Walian P.J. Jap B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7499-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). No apparent effect was observed on the levels of PS1, Nicastrin, Aph-1, or Pen-2. As expected, N-[N-3,5-difluorophenacetyl]-l-alanyl-S-phenylglycine methyl ester (DAPM) inhibited the enzymatic activity of the γ-secretase complex but did not affect the expression levels of CD147 (Fig. 2F).Therefore, the above results indicate that pro-SCP-2 can impact on γ-secretase activity by affecting the steady-state levels of CD147. Interestingly, normalization of cholesterol levels (Fig. 3A) with either methyl β-cyclodextrin (mβ-CD), a cell-impermeable sterol binding molecule, or LDS, failed to normalize the steady-state levels of CD147 (Fig. 3, B and C) or the in vitro activity of γ-secretase (Fig. 3, D and E).FIGURE 3Neither the expression levels of CD147 nor the in"
