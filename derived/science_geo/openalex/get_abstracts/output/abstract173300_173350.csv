https://openalex.org/W2017399882,"The auditory system encodes sound by decomposing the amplitude signal arriving at the ear into multiple frequency bands whose center frequencies and bandwidths are approximately exponential functions of the distance from the stapes. This organization is thought to result from the adaptation of cochlear mechanisms to the animal's auditory environment. Here we report that several basic auditory nerve fiber tuning properties can be accounted for by adapting a population of filter shapes to encode natural sounds efficiently. The form of the code depends on sound class, resembling a Fourier transformation when optimized for animal vocalizations and a wavelet transformation when optimized for non-biological environmental sounds. Only for the combined set does the optimal code follow scaling characteristics of physiological data. These results suggest that auditory nerve fibers encode a broad set of natural sounds in a manner consistent with information theoretic principles."
https://openalex.org/W2045059362,"We have identified parameters which define a causal role of HPV16 in head and neck cancer. Twenty-eight tumours which were typed positive for HPV16 DNA, were comprehensively analysed for expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7, the status of the p53 gene, and the protein status of pRb and p16(INK4a). In a subset of cases, we have searched for integrated viral DNA, and have determined the genomic status of the E6 gene. Expression of E6/E7 was found in 12 tumours most of which were derived from the oropharynx, whereas p53 mutations were present in 13 tumours from various sites. The tumours either carried p53 mutations but did not express E6/E7, or they did express E6/E7 but were p53-wild-type. Coexistence of E6/E7 expression with a mutated p53 was found in only one case. Strikingly, in most p53-mutated tumours without E6/E7 expression, we found the E6 gene to be disrupted. E6/E7 expression was associated with reduced pRb and overexpressed p16(INK4a). Viral-cellular fusion transcripts were found in two cases. Our data demonstrate that HPV16 DNA-positivity in head and neck cancers is not indicative of a causal role. A causal role of HPV16 in head and neck cancer is defined by: E6/E7 expression, viral integration with an intact E6 gene, and perturbation of pRb cell cycle control. Mostly, the p53 gene is wild-type."
https://openalex.org/W2071622027,"3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a central role in activating the AGC subfamily of protein kinases. In particular, PDK1 plays an important role in the regulation of Akt/PKB survival pathway by phosphorylating Akt on Thr308. Here we show that UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), a drug now in clinical trials and with a unique fingerprint pattern, induced dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt, resulting in the turn-off of the survival signals and the induction of apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that UCN-01-mediated Akt inactivation was caused by inhibiting upstream Akt kinase PDK1 (IC50=33 nM) both in vitro and from cells, but not by suppressing Akt itself or phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase. UCN-01-induced PDK1 inhibition was also observed in in vivo murine and human tumor xenografts. Overexpression of active form of Akt diminished the cytotoxic effects of UCN-01, suggesting that UCN-01 may in part exert its cytotoxicity by inhibiting PDK1-Akt survival pathway. Because UCN-01 has already proved to have potent anti-tumor activity in vivo, PDK1-Akt survival pathway is a new, attractive target for cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2326787949,"PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs) respond to many cellular stresses including viral infection, heat shock, arsenic and oncogenes and have been implicated in the regulation of p53-dependent replicative senescence and apoptosis. Recently, the hMre11/Rad50/NBS1 repair complex, involved in Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) repair, was found to colocalize within PML NBs, suggesting a role for these nuclear sub-domains in the DNA repair signalling pathway. We report here that in normal human fibroblasts, after ionizing radiation (IR), the PML NBs are modified and recognize sites of DNA breaks (ssDNA breaks and DSBs). Eight to 12 h after radiation PML NBs associate with hMre11 Ionizing Radiation-Induced Foci (IRIF), and subsequently with p53 within discrete foci. The PML, hMre11 and p53 colocalizing structures mark sites of DSBs as identified by immunolocalization with anti phosphorylated histone gamma-H2AX. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ionizing radiation induces the stable association of p53 with hMre11 and PML. These results suggest that the PML NBs are involved in the recognition and/or processing of DNA breaks and possibly in the recruitment of proteins (p53 and hMre11) required for both checkpoint and DNA-repair responses."

https://openalex.org/W2325720000,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mitogen for hepatocytes, but it is not clear whether HGF stimulates or inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis. We previously reported that HGF transgenic mice under the metallothionein gene promoter developed benign and malignant liver tumors spontaneously after 17 months of age. To elucidate the role of HGF in hepatocarcinogenesis, diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was administered to HGF transgenic mice. HGF overexpression accelerated DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, often accompanied by abnormal blood vessel formation. In this study, 59% of transgenic males (versus 20% of wild-type males) and 39% of transgenic females (versus 2% of wild-type females) developed either benign or malignant liver tumors by 48 weeks (P<0.005, P<0.001, respectively). Moreover, 33% of males and 23% of female transgenic mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while none of the wild-type mice developed HCC (P<0.001, P<0.005, respectively). Enhanced kinase activity of the HGF receptor, Met, was detected in most of these tumors. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was up-regulated in parallel with HGF transgene expression. Taken together, our results suggest that HGF promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through the autocrine activation of the HGF-Met signaling pathway in association with stimulation of angiogenesis by HGF itself and/or indirectly through VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2058014966,"Sp1 binding sites have been identified in enhancer/promoter regions of several growth and cell cycle regulated genes, and it has been shown that Sp1 is increasingly phosphorylated in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interactions of Sp1 with proteins involved in control of cell cycle and tumor formation have been reported. Here we show that expression of Sp1 protein predominates in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in epithelial cells. This is achieved by proteasome-dependent degradation. Inhibition of endogeneous Sp1 activity by a dominant-negative Sp1 mutant was associated with a cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, a strongly reduced expression of cyclin D1, the EGF-receptor and increased levels of p27Kip1. We have thus identified Sp1 as an important regulator of the cell cycle in G1 phase."

https://openalex.org/W2321461291,"In this study, we investigated the functional role of the localization of human OTR in caveolin-1 enriched membrane domains. Biochemical fractionation of MDCK cells stably expressing the WT OTR-GFP indicated that only minor quantities of receptor are partitioned in caveolin-1 enriched domains. However, when fused to caveolin-2, the OTR protein proved to be exclusively localized in caveolin-1 enriched fractions, where it bound the agonist with increased affinity and efficiently coupled to Galpha(q/11). Interestingly, the chimeric protein was unable to undergo agonist-induced internalization and remained confined to the plasma membrane even after prolonged agonist exposure (120 min). A striking difference in receptor stimulation was observed when the OT-induced effect on cell proliferation was analysed: stimulation of the human WT OTR inhibited cell growth, whereas the chimeric protein had a proliferative effect. These data indicate that the localization of human OTR in caveolin-1 enriched microdomains radically alters its regulatory effects on cell growth; the fraction of OTR residing in caveolar structures may therefore play a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2329628902,"p8 is a stress-induced DNA-binding protein, biochemically related to the architectural chromatin binding HMG protein family and whose function is presently unknown. We obtained fibroblast from mice lacking p8 and found that p8 is involved in cell growth regulation and in apoptosis. p8(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grow more rapidly than p8(+/+) MEFs. This might be explained by the higher intracellular level and activity of the Cdk2 and Cdk4 observed in p8(-/-) MEFs, which in turn may result, at least in part, from the concomitant decrease observed in the amount of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. We also report that p8 mRNA expression is strongly activated in fibroblasts after cell growth arrest induced by serum deprivation or confluence. As expected, MEFs expressing p8 arrest their growth more rapidly after serum deprivation than MEFs lacking p8, which strongly suggests that p8 over-expression is implicated in cell growth arrest. On the other hand, p8(+/+) MEFs are more sensitive than p8(-/-) MEFs to the apoptosis induced by adriamycin treatment. p53 might be involved, as p8 expression increases its intracellular amount and trans-activation capacity. Finally, demonstration that p53 is a negative trans-activator of p8 suggests the presence of a complex autoregulatory loop. In conclusion, p8 is a cell growth inhibitor that facilitates apoptosis induced in fibroblasts by DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1997582408,"Gfi-1 is a nuclear zinc finger protein with the activity of a transcriptional repressor and the ability to predispose for the development of T-cell lymphoma when expressed constitutively at high levels. Whereas thymic T-cell precursors express endogenous Gfi-1, mature peripheral T-cells lack Gfi-1 but upregulate its expression transiently after antigenic stimulation and activation of Erk1/2 demonstrating a role of Gfi-1 in T-cell activation. Here we show that constitutive expression of Gfi-1 accelerates S phase entry of primary, resting T-cells upon antigenic stimulation. In addition, high level Gfi-1 expression inhibits phorbol ester induced G1 arrest and activation induced cell death in Jurkat T-cells. We demonstrate that these effects of Gfi-1 concur with lower absolute levels and hyperphosphorylation of the pocket protein pRb. Moreover, phorbol ester induced expression of the negative cell cycle regulator p21(WAF1) is blocked in the presence of Gfi-1. These findings suggest that Gfi-1 contributes to T-cell lymphomagenesis by overriding a late G1 cell cycle checkpoint which controls activation induced death and S phase entry of T-cells."

https://openalex.org/W2333888126,"The tumour suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Tumour derived p53 mutants are usually transcriptionally inactive, but some mutants retain the ability to transactivate a subset of p53 target genes. In addition to simple loss of function, some p53 mutants may be carcinogenic through a dominant negative mechanism. Aiming at a more general classification of p53 mutants into predictive functional categories it is important to determine (i) which p53 mutants are dominant, (ii) what features characterize dominant mutants and (iii) whether dominance is target gene specific. The ability of 71 p53 mutants to inhibit wild type p53 was determined using a simple yeast transcriptional assay. Approximately 30% of the mutants were dominant. They preferentially affect highly conserved amino acids (P<0.005), which are frequently mutated in tumours (P<0.005), and usually located near the DNA binding surface of the protein (P<0.001). Different tumour-derived amino acid substitutions at the same codon usually have the same dominance phenotype. To determine whether the ability of p53 mutants to inhibit wild type p53 is target gene specific, the dominance towards p21, bax, and PIG3 binding sites was examined. Approximately 40% of the 45 mutants examined were dominant for the p21 (17/45) or PIG3 (20/45) responsive elements and 71% (32/45) were dominant for the bax responsive element. These differences are statistically significant (p21 vs bax, P<0.003; bax vs PIG3, P<0.02, Fisher's exact test) and defined a hierarchy of dominance. Finally, we extended the analysis to a group of mutants isolated in BRCA-associated tumours, some of which retained wild type level of transcription in yeast as well as in human cells, but show gain of function in transformation assays. Since transformation assays require transdominant inhibition of the endogenous wild type allele, one possible explanation for the behaviour of the BRCA-associated mutants is that they adopt conformations able to bind DNA alone but not in mixed tetramers with wild type p53. The yeast data do not support this explanation, because all BRCA-associated mutants that behaved as wild type in transcription assay were recessive in dominance assays."

https://openalex.org/W2046481261,"p53 exerts its tumor suppressor effects by activating genes involved in cell growth arrest and programmed cell death. The p53 target genes inducing growth arrest are well defined whereas those inducing apoptosis are not fully characterized. Proapoptotic activity of p53 was shown to involve several genes like Bax, Noxa and Puma, which may function in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and caspase 9 to form the apoptosome. Genetic and cellular data indicate that Apaf-1 deficiency abrogates the apoptotic effect of p53 and substitutes for p53 loss in promoting tumor formation. Here we show that Apaf-1, the mammalian homologue of C. elegans CED4, is a direct target of p53 as demonstrated by gel shift analysis of the target site sequence in the presence of p53 and by Apaf-1 promoter-luciferase assays. We also show that the p53 activation of the Apaf-1 luciferase construct can be enhanced by the putative tumor suppressor gene product, Zac-1, a transcription factor that has previously been shown to inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Zac-1 is a possible direct target of p53 since the sequence upstream to the first coding exon of Zac-1 contains a p53 recognition site and the luciferase construct containing this region is activated by p53. These results suggests the existence of a tightly controlled self amplifying mechanism of transcriptional activation leading to apoptosis by p53."
https://openalex.org/W2017756185,"Many human cancers have been associated with the deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). However, the individual contribution of receptor-associated signaling proteins in cellular transformation and metastasis is poorly understood. To examine the role of RTK activated signal transduction pathways to processes involved in cell transformation, we have exploited the oncogenic derivative of the Met RTK (Tpr–Met). Unlike other RTKs, twin tyrosine residues in the carboxy-terminal tail of the Met oncoprotein and receptor are required for all biological and transforming activities, and a mutant lacking these tyrosines is catalytically active but non transforming. Using this mutant we have inserted oligonucleotide cassettes, each encoding a binding site for a specific signaling protein derived from other RTKs. We have generated variant forms of the Tpr–Met oncoprotein with the ability to bind individually to the p85 subunit of PI3′K, PLCγ, or to the Grb2 or Shc adaptor proteins. Variants that recruit the Shc or Grb2 adaptor proteins generated foci of morphologically transformed fibroblast cells and induced anchorage-independent growth, scattering of epithelial cells and experimental metastasis. In contrast, variants that bind and activate PI3′K or PLCγ failed to generate readily detectable foci. Although cell lines expressing the PI3′K variant grew in soft-agar, these cells were non metastatic. Using this unique RTK oncoprotein model, we have established that Grb2 or Shc dependent signaling pathways are sufficient for cell transformation and metastatic spread."
https://openalex.org/W2335535901,"Cdc25 activates maturation promoting factor (MPF) and promotes mitosis by removing the inhibitory phosphate from the Tyr-15 of Cdc2 in human cells. In this study, we searched the interacting protein(s) of human Cdc25C using the yeast two-hybrid screen and identified proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an interacting partner of Cdc25C. The interaction between Cdc25C and PCNA was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses using human T cell line, Jurkat, further revealed that Cdc25C interacted with PCNA transiently when cells began to enter mitosis. Immunofluorescence analysis also showed that Cdc25C and PCNA were transiently co-localized in the nucleus at the beginning of M phase. Together with the previous observations of the interaction between various cdc/cyclin and PCNA, our findings strongly suggested a potential role of PCNA at the G2 to M phase transition of cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2016822667,"The helix-loop-helix protein Id-1 is a dominant negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, and plays a key role in the control of breast epithelial cell growth, invasion and differentiation. Previous investigations in our laboratory have shown that Id-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in highly aggressive and invasive human breast cancer cells in comparison to non-transformed or non-aggressive cancerous cells, and that this loss of regulation is mediated by a 2.2-kb region of the human Id-1 promoter. Here we show that a 31 bp sequence within this 2.2-kb promoter, located 200 bp upstream of the initiation of transcription, is responsible for the constitutive expression of Id-1 in metastatic human breast cancer cells. Using gel shift experiments, we identified a high molecular weight complex present only in non-aggressive breast cancer cells cultured in serum-free medium and which appear to be necessary for proper Id-1 repression. In contrast, nuclear extracts from highly aggressive and metastatic cell lines do not contain this large molecular weight complex. Using DNA affinity precipitation assays (DAPA), we show that this complex contains SP-1, NF-1, Rb and HDAC-1 proteins. On the basis of these findings, we propose a mechanism for the loss of regulation of Id-1 promoter in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2078889074,"Retinoic acid (RA) supplementation suppresses ethanol-enhanced hepatocyte hyperproliferation in rats; however, little is known about the mechanism(s). Here, we investigated whether RA affects the protein kinase signaling pathways in the liver tissues of rats fed with a high dose of ethanol for a prolonged period of time (6 months). Results show that there were greater levels of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated c-Jun protein, but not total JNK protein, in livers of ethanol-fed rats vs those of controls. Moreover, ethanol feeding to rats increased the levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK-4) and decreased the levels of mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in liver tissue. However, hepatic levels of phosphorylated-p38 protein and total-p38 protein were not altered by the ethanol treatment. In contrast, all-trans-RA supplementation at two doses in ethanol-fed rats greatly attenuated the ethanol-induced hepatic phosphorylation of MKK-4, phosphorylated-JNK and c-Jun proteins. The level of MKP-1 was increased in ethanol-fed rats supplemented with all-trans-RA. Further, ethanol-induced hepatocyte hyperproliferation, measured by immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, were markedly decreased by all-trans-RA supplementation. Interestingly, hepatic apoptosis in the liver of ethanol-fed rats after 6 months of treatment decreased significantly. This decrease of hepatic apoptosis in ethanol-fed rats was prevented by all-trans-RA supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. The results from these studies indicate that restoration of RA homeostasis is critical for the regulation of JNK-dependent signaling pathway and apoptosis in the liver of ethanol-fed rats."
https://openalex.org/W2321599954,"Extensive studies of primary tumors and tumor derived cell lines revealed that inappropriate activation of specific STATs (particularly of STAT3 and STAT5) occurs with high frequency in a wide variety of human cancers. We reported recently that the melanoma inducing EGFR-related receptor Xmrk specifically induces constitutive activation of STAT5 in fish melanoma cells. However, little is known about the role of STAT5 in solid tumours in general and its function in melanoma in particular. Recent examinations suggest that activated STAT signalling participates in oncogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. As an initial approach to understanding the consequences of Xmrk induced STAT5 signalling we used the well characterized pro B-cell line Ba/F3 as a sensitive system to analyse mitogenic as well as anti-apoptotic signalling. We identified STAT5 activation as being involved in both growth and survival signalling triggered by the Xmrk kinase possibly due to STAT5 induced expression of pim-1 and bcl-x. We also found a new mechanism of activation of STAT5 by receptor tyrosine kinases, whereby direct interaction of the receptor kinase domain with the STAT protein in a phosphotyrosine independent way led to activation of STAT5 in terms of DNA binding and target gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1983811413,"Classically, the functional product of coding genes is a protein whose synthesis is directed by an mRNA-template. However, in the last few years several genes yielding an mRNA-like non-coding RNA as a functional product have been identified. In most cases these transcripts are synthesized by the RNA polymerase II, capped, spliced and polyadenylated, like classical mRNA. These latter have non-conserved open reading frames and seem to be untranslated. Consequently, it has been proposed and admitted that these genes act at the RNA level, and are so-called 'riboregulators'. H19 belongs to this class of gene and its role remains a matter of debate: for some authors it is an oncogene, for others a tumour suppressor. Here, we demonstrate, using a proteomic approach, that an H19 overexpression in human cancerous mammary epithelial cells stably transfected with genomic DNA containing the entire H19 gene is responsible for positively regulating at the post-transcriptional level the thioredoxin, a key protein of the cellular redox metabolism. Interestingly, this protein accumulates in many cancerous tissues, such as breast carcinomas in which we have also demonstrated an overexpression of the H19 gene."

https://openalex.org/W2062590182,"The Kaposi's Sarcoma associated Herpes virus (KSHV) encodes two genes with the potential to affect the activity of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Open reading frame (orf) 72 encodes a D type cyclin (kcyc) that can elicit p16INK4a resistant cdk activity and orf73 encodes the latency associated nuclear antigen (LNA) that can bind Rb and neutralize E2F regulation. This indicates that, like papilloma and adenovirus associated malignancies, those associated with KSHV are defective with respect to their Rb pathway. To address this we investigated whether KSHV associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) derived cell lines are resistant to growth inhibition by p16INK4a. We provide evidence that ectopic expression of p16INK4a in these cells causes an Rb dependent G1 cell cycle block. Importantly, endogenous p16INK4a expression is not detected in six PEL derived cell lines and four primary PEL samples and examination of the p16INK4a locus shows deletion in two out of six and hypermethylation in four out of six PEL lines. Treatment of the latter with the demethylating agent 5′-aza-2′ deoxycytidine leads to re-expression of p16INK4a protein. Taken together these results suggest that p16INK4a loss may be a cellular change frequently associated with PEL. They furthermore argue that despite the presence of KSHV DNA and expression of a latent gene program Rb function is intact in PEL."
https://openalex.org/W1995745824,"Important roles have been suggested for caspase-8, caspase-9 and Apaf-1 in controlling tumor development and their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Methylation and deletion of Apaf-1 and CASP8 results in the loss of their expression in melanoma and neuroblastoma, respectively, while CASP9 localization to 1p36.1 suggests it is a good candidate tumor suppressor. The status of CASP9 and Apaf-1 expression in numerous neuroblastoma cell lines with/without amplified MYCN and chromosome 1p36 loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) was therefore examined to test the hypothesis that one or both of these genes are tumor suppressors in neuroblastoma. Although CASP9 is included in the region encompassing 1p36 LOH in all neuroblastoma cell lines examined, the remaining CASP9 allele(s) express a functional caspase-9 enzyme. Apaf-1 is also expressed in all neuroblastoma tumor cell lines examined. Thus, the CASP9 or Apaf-1 genes do not appear to function as tumor suppressors in MYCN amplified neuroblastomas. However, ∼20% of the neuroblastoma cell lines with methylated CASP8 alleles are also highly resistant to staurosporine (STS)- and radiation-induced cell death, presumably because cytochrome c is not released from mitochondria. This suggests that a second, smaller sub-group of MYCN amplified neuroblastoma tumors exists with defect(s) in apoptotic signaling components upstream of caspase-9 and Apaf-1. Since no consistent differences in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Bax expression were seen in the STS- and radiation-resistant neuroblastomas, it suggests that a unique mitochondrial signaling factor(s) is responsible for the defect in cytochrome c release in this sub-group of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2036872037,"We have previously shown that the binding site for GTPase activating protein of Ras (RasGAP) in the PDGF beta-receptor, Tyr771, is phosphorylated to a much lower extent in the heterodimeric configuration of PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors, compared to the PDGF beta-receptor homodimer. The decreased recruitment of the RasGAP to the receptor leads to prolonged activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, which could explain the increase in mitogenicity seen upon induction of heterodimers. The molecular mechanism underlying these differences was investigated. We could show that the loss of phosphorylation of Tyr771 was dependent on presence of intact binding sites for the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 on the PDGF beta-receptor. Thus, in PDGF receptor mutants in which binding of SHP-2 was lost, a higher degree of phosphorylation of Tyr771 was seen, while other phosphorylation sites in the receptor remained virtually unaffected. Thus, SHP-2 appears to play an important role in modulating phosphorylation of Y771, thereby controlling RasGAP recruitment and Ras/MAP kinase signaling in the heterodimeric configuration of the PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1969836383,"Bcl-2 is the prototype of a family of genes that prevent apoptosis. However, several reports indicate that Bcl-2 may also act as a cell cycle modulator. In several human tumors, Bcl-2 expression correlates with a more favorable prognosis and lower tumor proliferative activity. We have shown that Bcl-2 expression delays liver tumor development in transgenic mice even when the gene is turned on shortly before the time of tumor development. We hypothesized that Bcl-2 may delay liver tumorigenesis by interfering with hepatocyte proliferation. To test whether Bcl-2 expression may act on hepatocyte replication we studied liver regeneration in Bcl-2 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates. DNA replication was delayed by approximately 8 h in Bcl-2 transgenic mice compared to the timing of the response in wild-type littermates. Cyclin D expression showed no alterations in the regenerating liver of Bcl-2 transgenic mice. In contrast, there was a delay in the expression of p107, cyclin E and in the activity of cyclin E/cdk 2 activity. These results show that Bcl-2 expression delays cell cycle progression in hepatocytes and suggests that it acts at a step involving cyclin E and p107."
https://openalex.org/W2314812172,"Knowledge of inherited and sporadic mutations in known and candidate cancer genes may influence clinical decisions. We have developed a mutation scanning method that combines thermostable EndonucleaseV (Endo V) and DNA ligase. Variant and wild-type PCR amplicons are generated using fluorescently labeled primers, and heteroduplexed. Thermotoga maritima (Tma) EndoV recognizes and primarily cleaves heteroduplex DNA one base 3' to the mismatch, as well as nicking matched DNA at low levels. Thermus species (Tsp.) AK16D DNA ligase reseals the background nicks to create a highly sensitive and specific assay. The fragment mobility on a DNA sequencing gel reveals the approximate position of the mutation. This method identified 31/35 and 8/8 unique point mutations and insertions/deletions, respectively, in the p53, VHL, K-ras, APC, BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes. The method has the sensitivity to detect K-ras mutations diluted 1 : 20 with wild-type DNA, a p53 mutation in a 1.7 kb amplicon, and unknown p53 mutations in pooled DNA samples. EndoV/Ligase mutation scanning combined with PCR/LDR/Universal array proved superior to automated DNA sequencing for detecting p53 mutations in colon tumors. This technique is well suited for scanning low-frequency mutations in pooled samples and for analysing tumor DNA containing a minority of the unknown mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2334242116,"The EWS family of genes is involved in numerous chromosomal translocations that are characteristic of a variety of sarcomas. A recently described member of this group is desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), which is characterized by a recurrent t(11;22)(p13;q12) translocation that fuses the 5′ exons of the EWS gene to the 3′ exons of the WT1 gene. The originally described chimera comprises exons 1–7 of EWS and exons 8–10 of WT1. We have previously reported that the WT1 protein represses the expression of the IGF-I receptor gene, whereas the EWS(1–7)-WT1(8–10) fusion protein activates IGF-I receptor gene expression. It has recently become apparent that EWS-WT1 chimeras produced in DSCRT are heterogeneous as a result of fusions of different regions of the EWS gene to the WT1 gene. We have recently characterized additional EWS-WT1 translocations that involve the juxtaposition of EWS exons 7 or 8 to WT1 exon 8, and an EWS-WT1 chimera that lacks EWS exon 6. The chimeric transcription factors encoded by these various translocations differ in their DNA-binding characteristics and their ability to transactivate the IGF-I receptor promoter. These data suggest that the molecular pathology of DSRCT is more complex than previously appreciated, and that this diversity may provide the foundation for predictive genotype-phenotype correlations in the future."

https://openalex.org/W1995138089,"Cyclin A2 is predominantly, but not exclusively, localized in the nucleus from G1/S transition onwards. It is degraded when cells enter mitosis after nuclear envelope breakdown. We previously showed that a fusion protein (S2A) between the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen protein and a non-degradable fragment of human cyclin A2 (Δ152) resides in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, escapes degradation and transforms normal rat fibroblasts. The present study investigates whether cytoplasmic cyclin A2 may play a role in oncogenesis. We show that the sequestration of non-degradable cyclin A2-Δ152 by a cellular ER targeting domain (PRL-A2) leads to cell transformation when coexpressed with activated Ha-ras. REF52 cells constitutively expressing PRL-A2 are found to have a high incidence of multinucleate giant cells, polyploidy and abnormal centrosome numbers, giving rise to the nucleation of multipolar spindles. Injection of these cells into athymic nude mice causes tumors, even in the absence of a cooperating Ha-ras oncogene. These results demonstrate that, independently of any viral context, an intracellular redistribution of non-degradable cyclin A2 is capable of deregulating the normal cell cycle to the point where it promotes aneuploidy and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2321135911,"Previously we have reported that deregulated expression of c-myc in normal and leukemic myeloid cells blocked differentiation and, concomitantly, induced p53-independent apoptosis. Here, we show that this morbidity was due to premature recruitment of the Fas/CD95 cell death pathway which normally operates to induce apoptosis at the end of the terminal myeloid differentiation program. Analysis of the regulated components of this pathway revealed that IL6-mediated induction of differentiation resulted in rapid cell surface expression of CD95 receptor. Deregulated c-myc prevented the downregulation of CD95 ligand by maintaining its transcription, but caused premature downregulation of c-FLIP. First, the Type II (mitochondria-dependent, bcl-2-sensitive) and, then, the Type I (mitochondria-independent, bcl-2-insensitive) pathway were activated. Stable exogenous c-FLIP expression completely rescued the apoptotic phenotype. Furthermore, when the deregulated c-myc transgene was stably transduced into bone marrow cells from Fas(lpr/lpr) (CD95 receptor mutant) and FasL(gld/gld) (CD95 ligand mutant) mice, cell death was significantly suppressed relative to c-myc-transduced wild type bone marrow cells upon induction of differentiation. These data indicate that c-myc-mediated apoptosis associated with blocks in myeloid differentiation is dependent on the Fas/CD95 pathway. Our findings offer important new insights into understanding how deregulated c-myc alters normal blood cell homeostasis, and how additional mutations might promote leukemogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2315715938,"Mismatch repair deficiency is known to contribute to elevated rates of mutations, particularly at mono- and dinucleotide repeat sequences. However, such repeats are often missing from the coding regions of endogenous genes. To determine the types of mutations that can occur within an endogenous gene lacking highly susceptible repeat sequences, we examined mutagenic events at the 2.3 kb mouse Aprt gene in kidney cell lines derived from mice deficient for the PMS2 and MLH1 mismatch repair proteins. The Aprt mutation rate was increased 33-fold and 3.6–20-fold for Mlh1 and Pms2 null cell lines, respectively, when compared with a wild-type kidney cell line. For the Pms2 null cells this increase resulted from both intragenic events, which were predominantly base-pairs substitutions, and loss of heterozygosity events. Almost all mutations in the Mlh1 null cells were due to base-pair substitutions. A:T→G:C transitions (54% of small events) were predominant in the Pms2 null cells whereas G:C→A:T transitions (36%) were the most common base-pair change in the Mlh1 null cells. Interestingly, 4–9% of the spontaneous mutant alleles in the mismatch repair deficient cells exhibited two well-separated base-pair substitution events. The percentage of mutant alleles with two and occasionally three base-pair substitutions increased when the Pms2 and Mlh1 null cells were treated with ultraviolet radiation (15–21%) and when the Mlh1 null cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (35%). In most cases the distance separating the multiple base-pair substitutions on a given allele was in excess of 100 base-pairs, suggesting that the two mutational events were not linked directly to a single DNA lesion. The significance of these results is discussed with regards to the roles for the PMS2 and MLH1 proteins in preventing spontaneous and genotoxin-related mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2029376207,"The mammalian proto-oncogene Cbl and its cellular homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (Sli-1) and Drosophila (D-Cbl) are negative regulators of some growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Herein we show that Cbl can negatively regulate another signaling molecule, namely theSrc-family kinase Hck by targeting it for degradation. Hck-mediated cellular transformation of murine fibroblasts is reverted by ectopic expression of a membrane-anchored allele of Cbl as assessed by the cellular morphology, suppression of anchorage independent growth, and an overall reduction in the total tyrosine phosphorylation levels within the cells. The expression of Cbl at the plasma membrane targets both Hck and itself for ubiquitination and degradation, requiring an intact RING finger. Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome prevents the degradation of Hck correlating with an increase in the phosphotyrosine levels within the cells. Activated Hck and membrane-anchored Cbl are present in similar subcellular localizations and co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that their interaction is required for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, both constitutively active and kinase-inactive Hck interact with and are targeted for degradation by Cbl. This work illustrates alternate means to regulate Src-family kinases, and suggests that Cbl may be able to suppress many signaling pathways that are activated in various proliferative syndromes including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2317669872,"Growth factors of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family control the differentiation of neuronal cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Intracellular signalling of these growth factors is, at least in part, mediated by activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Here, we demonstrate that GDNF triggering inhibits the proliferation of the embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1. This anti-proliferative effect is accompanied by down-regulation of the SSEA-3 antigen, a marker typical of undifferentiated NT2/D1 cells. We show that these effects are mediated by activation of RET signalling. The block of RET by a kinase-deficient dominant negative mutant impairs GDNF-dependent growth inhibition, whereas the adoptive expression of a constitutively active RET, the RET-MEN2A oncogene, promotes effects similar to those exerted by GDNF. We show that RET signalling increases the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 in NT2/D1 cells. Both DNA synthesis inhibition and SSEA-3 down-regulation are prevented if p27kip1 expression is blocked by an antisense construct, which demonstrates that RET-triggered effects are mediated by p27kip1."
https://openalex.org/W2085765428,"Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are transformed erythroid precursors that are held in an immature and proliferating state but can be induced to differentiate in vivo by treatment with a variety of chemical agents such as N, N-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). To investigate the role of Myb proteins in maintaining MEL cells in an immature and proliferating state we have produced stable transfectants in the C19 MEL cell line that contain a dominant interfering Myb allele (MEnT) under the control of an inducible mouse metallothionein I promoter. When expression of MEnT protein was induced with ZnCl2, the stable transfectants differentiated with kinetics that were similar to wild type C19 MEL cells treated with HMBA, including induction of alpha-globin mRNA expression, assembly of hemoglobin and growth arrest. Expression of endogenous c-myb and c-myc was also decreased in response to MEnT. Expression of mad-1 mRNA was rapidly increased in response to expression of MEnT resulting in a shift from predominantly c-Myc/Max complexes to predominantly Mad/Max containing complexes. These results strongly suggest that C19 MEL cells are held in an immature and proliferating state by a pathway that is dependent on Myb activity."
https://openalex.org/W1979846314,"We have analysed the importance of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in tumor development. In a transgenic mouse model (Tyrp1-Tag) tumors form in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), invade surrounding tissues, and metastasize to lymph node and spleen. To address whether RPE tumor formation is dependent on FGF2, we generated FGF2-deficient mice. Such mice appeared healthy and exhibited no impairment of growth or development. Tyrp1-Tag transgenic mice, which are lacking FGF2 (FGF2−/−) developed RPE tumors that metastasize to spleen and lymph nodes. Tumor growth and survival rate are identical to Tyrp1-Tag transgenic littermates expressing FGF2. Cell lines were isolated from RPE tumors of wild-type and FGF2-deficient mice. They grow in culture, are pigmented and form vascularized tumors, when injected subcutaneously into nude mice of either FGF2−/− or FGF2+/+ genetic background. Kinetics of tumor growth was identical and independent of presence of FGF2. Together, these results demonstrate that FGF2 is not essential for tumor formation of the RPE thus suggesting that tumor growth in general may not be dependent on FGF2."
https://openalex.org/W2313169456,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces the breakdown of cell junction and the dispersion of colonies of epithelial cells, providing a model system for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of one of the important aspects of tumorogenesis. We have previously reported that the SH2-domain-containing inositol 5'phosphatase (SHIP)-1 binds to c-Met, and potentiated HGF-mediated branching tubulogenesis. In this study, we describe the establishment of MDCK cell lines which express MycHis-tagged SHIP-1 at different levels. Expression of SHIP-1 in MDCK cells at a high level resulted in cell morphology characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal like transition; cells lost cortical actin, developed actin stress fibers and gained spontaneous motility without treatment of HGF. When the level of MycHis-tagged SHIP-expression was relatively low, transfectants partially lost cortical actin and phalloidin stained puncta appeared at cell-cell junctions even in the absence of HGF. The treatment of MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059, did not influence SHIP-1 mediated alteration of adherens-junction of MDCK cells, while, phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3)- kinase inhibitor, LY294002, drastically reduced SHIP-1 mediated phenotype. Furthermore, expression of a mutant SHIP-1 lacking catalytic activity in MDCK cells did not alter the cortical actin distribution and HGF-mediated MAP and Akt kinase-phosphorylation, but suppressed HGF induced cell dispersion, suggesting that phosphatase activity is important for cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell dispersion."

https://openalex.org/W2316222584,"The distribution of oxidative damage to bases such as 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua), was determined at the nucleotide level of resolution using the ligation-mediated PCR technique. Administration of a renal carcinogen, ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA), is known to induce oxidative stress and subsequent formation of 8-OH-Gua in the kidney. Whole genomic DNA was isolated from the rat kidney with or without Fe-NTA treatment and then digested with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). As a target, we focused on the gene of a DNA repair enzyme for thymine glycol, Nth 1. Cleaved signals were found in exon 1 and exon 3, but not exon 5. Nucleosomes in these regions, enriched in damaged nucleotides, were highly accessible to micrococcal nuclease, especially in the kidney. Taking into account the function of the protein segment encoded by these regions, we discussed the molecular mechanism of the restricted formation of the damaged nucleotides."
