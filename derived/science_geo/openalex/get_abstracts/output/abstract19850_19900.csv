https://openalex.org/W2095256251,"Emotional responses such as fear are rapidly acquired through classical conditioning. This report examines the neural substrate underlying memory of acquired fear. Rats were classically conditioned to fear both tone and context through the use of aversive foot shocks. Lesions were made in the hippocampus either 1, 7, 14, or 28 days after training. Contextual fear was abolished in the rats that received lesions 1 day after fear conditioning. However, rats for which the interval between learning and hippocampal lesions was longer retained significant contextual fear memory. In the same animals, lesions did not affect fear response to the tone at any time. These results indicate that fear memory is not a single process and that the hippocampus may have a time-limited role in associative fear memories evoked by polymodal (contextual) but not unimodal (tone) sensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2024142216,"The three-dimensional solution structure of the complex between calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) and a 26-residue synthetic peptide comprising the CaM binding domain (residues 577 to 602) of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, has been determined using multidimensional heteronuclear filtered and separated nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two domains of CaM (residues 6 to 73 and 83 to 146) remain essentially unchanged upon complexation. The long central helix (residues 65 to 93), however, which connects the two domains in the crystal structure of Ca(2+)-CaM, is disrupted into two helices connected by a long flexible loop (residues 74 to 82), thereby enabling the two domains to clamp residues 3 to 21 of the bound peptide, which adopt a helical conformation. The overall structure of the complex is globular, approximating an ellipsoid of dimensions 47 by 32 by 30 angstroms. The helical peptide is located in a hydrophobic channel that passes through the center of the ellipsoid at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with its long axis. The complex is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions which, from the CaM side, involve an unusually large number of methionines. Key residues of the peptide are Trp4 and Phe17, which serve to anchor the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the peptide to the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of CaM, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that a number of peptides that bind CaM with high affinity share this common feature containing either aromatic residues or long-chain hydrophobic ones separated by a stretch of 12 residues, suggesting that they interact with CaM in a similar manner."

https://openalex.org/W1998433450,"A membrane polypeptide involved in K+ transport in a higher plant was cloned by complementation of a yeast mutant defective in K+ uptake with a complementary DNA library from Arabidopsis thaliana. A 2.65-kilobase complementary DNA conferred ability to grow on media with K+ concentration in the micromolar range and to absorb K+ (or 86Rb+) at rates similar to those in wild-type yeast. The predicted amino acid sequence (838 amino acids) has three domains: a channel-forming region homologous to animal K+ channels, a cyclic nucleotide-binding site, and an ankyrin-like region."
https://openalex.org/W2170886436,"Molecular phylogenies of eukaryotic organisms imply patterns of biological and environmental history that can be tested against the geological record. As predicted by sequence comparisons, Precambrian rocks show evidence of episodic increases in biological diversity and atmospheric oxygen concentrations. Nonetheless, complete integration of the two records remains elusive and may require that the earliest macroscopic organisms be recognized as extinct experiments in eukaryotic multicellularity."
https://openalex.org/W1559464451,"The structural properties of fibroblast heparan sulfate (HS) that are necessary for it to bind strongly to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been investigated using bFGF affinity chromatography. Specific enzymic and chemical scission of HS, together with chemical N-desulfation, revealed that N-sulfate groups and iduronate-2-sulfates (IdoA(2-OSO3)) were essential for the interaction. bFGF-affinity chromatography of sulfated oligosaccharides released from HS by treatment with heparitinase led to the identification of an oligosaccharide component (oligo-H), seven disaccharides in length, with a similar affinity for bFGF as the parent molecule. Heparinase treatment of this fraction abolished the high affinity binding to bFGF. Analysis of oligo-H indicated that 74% of the disaccharide units had the structure IdoA(2-OSO3)alpha 1,4GlcNSO3; the remainder comprised N-acetylated and N-sulfated units, the majority of which were devoid of O-sulfate groups. Oligo-H was fully degraded to disaccharides by treatment with nitrous acid. These results indicate that the sequence of oligo-H is as shown below. delta GlcA beta 1,4GlcNSO3 alpha 1,4[IdoA(2-OSO3)alpha 1,4GlcNSO3]5 alpha 1, 4IdoA alpha 1,4GlcNAc Sulfated oligosaccharides of similar size but with a lower affinity for bFGF had a reduced concentration of IdoA(2-OSO3) but significant quantities of GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) and GlcNAc(6-OSO3). The data indicate a primary role for contiguous sequences of IdoA(2-OSO3)alpha 1,4GlcNSO3 in mediating the high affinity binding between fibroblast HS and bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1525435128,"A protein that greatly stimulates the multiple peptidase activities of the 20 S proteasome (also known as macropain, the multicatalytic protease complex, and 20 S protease) has been purified from bovine red blood cells and from bovine heart. The activator protein was a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and had a native molecular weight of approximately 180,000. This protein, which we have termed PA28, regulated all three of the putatively distinct peptidase activities displayed by each of two functionally different forms of the proteasome. This regulation usually included both an increase in the maximal reaction velocity and a decrease in the concentration of substrate required for half-maximal velocity and indicated that PA28 acted as a positive allosteric effector of the proteasome. PA28 failed, however, to stimulate the hydrolysis of large protein substrates such as casein and lysozyme. These results suggested that the hydrolysis of protein substrates occurred at a site or sites distinct from those that hydrolyzed small peptides and that the regulation of the two processes could be uncoupled. Evidence for direct binding of PA28 to the proteasome was obtained by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. PA28 may play an important regulatory role in intracellular proteolytic pathways mediated by the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2156071334,"Using temperature- and proteolytically sensitive derivatives to inactivate the function of the yeast TATA-binding protein (TBP) in vivo, we investigated the requirement of TBP for transcription by the three nuclear RNA polymerases in yeast cells. TBP is required for RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription from promoters containing conventional TATA elements as well as functionally distinct promoters that lack TATA-like sequences. TBP is also required for transcription of the U6 snRNA and two different tRNA genes mediated by RNA pol III as well as transcription of ribosomal RNA mediated by RNA pol I. For all promoters tested, transcription decreases rapidly and specifically upon inactivation of TBP, strongly suggesting that TBP is directly involved in the transcription process. These observations suggest that TBP is required for transcription of all nuclearly encoded genes in yeast, although distinct molecular mechanisms are probably involved for the three RNA polymerase transcription machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2007048730,"The human progesterone receptor form B (hPR-B) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae together with a specific reporter plasmid. To understand the mechanism underlying antagonist ligand activity, libraries of hormone binding domain (HBD)-mutated hPR-B molecules were prepared. A mutant receptor was identified that had lost the ability to bind either progesterone or R5020; it could still bind RU486 and, surprisingly, fully activated transcription in the presence of this ""antagonist"" and other antiprogestins. When this receptor mutant was assayed in mammalian cells, RU486 again demonstrated agonistic activity. Sequence analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype was due to truncation of the carboxy (C)-terminal 42 aa. We conclude that amino acids in the extreme C-terminal region are required for the receptor to bind progesterone, while antagonists bind to a site located more N-terminal of the HBD. Our results suggest that the extreme C-terminal region of the receptor contains an inhibitory function that silences receptor transactivation in the absence of agonist and in the presence of antagonist.The function of the hormone-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor was examined in a yeast cell system and in mammalian HeLa cells using mutant receptors, progesterone, the progesterone agonist R502, and the antagonists RU-486, Org31806, and Org31376. The hormone-binding domain, located on the carboxy terminal of the peptide, is known to initiate a conformational change in the receptor upon binding an agonist or antagonist, then shedding of associated proteins including the heat shock protein, dimerization of the receptor, and finally, binding to DNA, leading to transcription. Binding of a progesterone antagonist such as RU-486 elicits all these events except transcription. First the progesterone receptor was inserted in yeast with a plasmid, and a set of mutants were generated, using beta galactosidase as an indicator. A mutant progesterone receptor, U-P1, was selected for mechanistic studies, that binds and was activated by antagonists, but was inactive with progesterone. This receptor had a deletion at base 2636, resulting in a shift of reading frame so that a stop codon 36 nucleotides downstream caused truncation of 54 amino acids at the C-terminus and addition of 12 novel amino acids. Western blot analysis confirmed the expected molecular weight. The mutant receptor was active with RU-486, suggesting that the C-terminus may be responsible for poor transcription with RU-486, suggesting in normal receptors. 2 other truncated mutants were inactive with progesterone. These data suggested that the terminal 42 amino acids of the progesterone receptor are needed to bind progesterone, and that the antagonist is contacting different amino acids than the native receptor, possibly inducing a different conformational change. The activity of the UP-1 mutant was also confirmed in HeLa cells, with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter system. The results were interpreted to mean that progesterone agonists and antagonists contact at least some different amino acids in the hormone binding domain of the receptor, and that the conformational changes resulting from binding these agents are different. It appears that the C-terminus of the receptor contains an inhibitory domain which, when removed, turns antagonists into agonists."

https://openalex.org/W1995275795,"A form of learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia, long-term sensitization of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex, results in the formation of new synaptic connections between the presynaptic siphon sensory neurons and their target cells. These structural changes can be mimicked, when the cells are maintained in culture, by application of serotonin, an endogenous facilitating neurotransmitter in Aplysia. A group of cell surface proteins, designated Aplysia cell adhesion molecules (apCAM's) was down-regulated in the sensory neurons in response to serotonin. The deduced amino acid sequence obtained from complementary DNA clones indicated that the apCAM's are a family of proteins that seem to arise from a single gene. The apCAM's are members of the immunoglobulin class of cell adhesion molecules and resemble two neural cell adhesion molecules, NCAM and fasciclin II. In addition to regulating newly synthesized apCAM, serotonin also altered the amount of preexisting apCAM on the cell surface of the presynaptic sensory neurons. By contrast, the apCAM on the surface of the postsynaptic motor neuron was not modulated by serotonin. This rapid, transmitter-mediated down-regulation of a cell adhesion molecule in the sensory neurons may be one of the early molecular changes in long-term synaptic facilitation."
https://openalex.org/W1987169929,"The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin varies linearly with the chemical potential of water in the bathing medium, as seen from the osmotic effect of several neutral solutes, namely sucrose, stachyose, and two polyethyleneglycols (molecular weights of 150 and 400). The data, analyzed either by Wyman linkage equations or by Gibbs-Duhem relations, show that approximately 60 extra water molecules bind to hemoglobin during the transition from the fully deoxygenated tense (T) state to the fully oxygenated relaxed (R) state. This number, independent of the nature of the solute, agrees with the difference in water-accessible surface areas previously computed for the two conformations. The work of solvation in allosteric regulation can no longer go unrecognized."
https://openalex.org/W2035749731,"The long-term facilitation of synaptic efficacy that is induced by serotonin in dissociated cell cultures of sensory and motor neurons of Aplysia is accompanied by the growth of new synaptic connections. This growth is associated with a down-regulation in the sensory neuron of Aplysia cell adhesion molecules (apCAMs). To examine the mechanisms of this down-regulation, thin-section electron microscopy was combined with immunolabeling by gold-conjugated monoclonal antibodies specific to apCAM. Within 1 hour, serotonin led to a 50% decrease in the density of gold-labeled complexes at the surface membrane of the sensory neuron. This down-regulation was achieved by a heterologous, protein synthesis-dependent activation of the endosomal pathway, which leads to internalization and apparent degradation of apCAM. The internalization is particularly prominent at sites where the processes of the sensory neurons contact one another and may act there to destabilize process-to-process contacts that normally inhibit growth. In turn, the endocytic activation may lead to a redistribution of membrane components to sites where new synapses form."
https://openalex.org/W2012030402,"A specific premessenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle in the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans was studied with electron microscope tomography during translocation from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. The RNP particle consists of a thin RNP fiber tightly folded into a ribbon, which is bent into a ring-like structure. Upon translocation through the pore, the particle is first orientated in a specific manner at the pore entrance, and subsequently the bent ribbon is gradually straightened and transported through the pore with the 5' end of the RNA in the lead. Concomitantly, the elementary RNP fiber constituting the ribbon is gradually unpacked and will appear more or less extended on the cytoplasmic side of the pore complex. The ordered nature of the process suggests a specific recognition of the RNP particle at the nuclear pore."
https://openalex.org/W1522234390,"Prolonged incubation of protein with reducing sugar proceeds through a series of reactions involving early stage products to the advanced glycation end products with fluorescence, brown color, and cross-linking. Known collectively as the Maillard reaction, these changes have been suggested as factors in diabetic complications and the aging process. The early stage products have been demonstrated in vivo, but evidence for the presence in vivo of the advanced glycation end products has been limited. We sought to provide immunochemical evidence by the preparation and use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to these end products (Horiuchi, S., Araki, N., and Morino, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7329-7332) as probes to identify and quantitate such compounds in human lens crystallins. Neither of the antibodies reacted with extracts from infant lenses, but fractions from adult lenses showed a significant reactivity, correlating with lens age. Our findings provide the first immunochemical evidence that human lens crystallins contain advanced glycation end products and that these products increase with tissue age."
https://openalex.org/W1999738251,"Transcription extracts prepared from yeast that are deficient in the TATA-binding protein (TBP or TFIID) are also impaired in specific promoter recognition by all three nuclear RNA polymerases (pol I, II, and III). Specific initiation can be rescued by the addition of purified recombinant TBP, demonstrating that pol I, II, and III all require this factor. A mutation of TBP has been identified that will function with pol I but not with pol II or III. Conversely, another mutation, which inactivates TATA element binding in vitro, will function with pol I and III promoters but is inactive for a pol II promoter. Thus, it is possible to identify TBP variants that will only function on different subsets of all nuclear promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2035015033,"A novel 150 kd protein expressed on the surface of mesenchymal cells of mouse embryonic tissues was identified. A monoclonal antibody to this molecule inhibited various processes of epithelial morphogenesis, such as hair follicle growth and lung epithelial tubular formation, in organ cultures of these tissues. Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding this protein revealed that it had 289 amino acids with a hydrophobic stretch at the C-terminus. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the cDNA of this protein expressed the exogenous 150 kd protein on their surface. When lung epithelial cells were cocultured with these transfected cells, they showed normal tubular morphogenesis, but not with untransfected NIH 3T3 cells. These results indicate that this protein, termed epimorphin, plays a central role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2104148968,"Each recombination event mediated by the Flp recombinase is the sum of four strand breakage and reunion reactions executed in two steps of two-strand exchanges. The reaction requires four Flp monomers. The key catalytic residue in Flp is Tyr-343. Arg-191, His-305, and Arg-308 appear to facilitate the cleavage and exchange steps of recombination. These four residues constitute the invariant tetrad of the Int family site-specific recombinases. Complementation tests between ""step-arrest"" mutants of Flp suggest that each Flp protomer harbors a ""fractional active site."" Hybrid ""half site-recombinase"" complexes reveal that efficient catalysis occurs when the Arg-His-Arg triad is present on one Flp monomer and the active site Tyr on a second monomer. Strand cleavage by an Flp monomer occurs virtually exclusively on the half site to which its partner protein is bound (cleavage in trans), and almost never on the half site to which it is bound (cleavage in cis). Trans-cleavage by Flp can provide a means for functionally exchanging Flp monomers between two DNA partners. Such a mechanism would be germane to recombination, since cleavage and rejoining in cis can only restore the parental substrate configuration and cannot yield recombinants."
https://openalex.org/W1586044662,"We purified a novel ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a Clostridium limosum strain isolated from a lung abscess and compared the exoenzyme with Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3. The C. limosum exoenzyme has a molecular weight of about 25,000 and a pI of 10.3. The specific activity of the ADP-ribosyltransferase is 3.1 nmol/mg/min with a Km for NAD of 0.3 microM. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the tryptic peptides revealed about 70% homology with C3. The novel exoenzyme modifies selectively the small GTP-binding proteins of the rho family in human platelet membranes presumably at the same amino acid (asparagine 41) as known for C3. Recombinant rhoA and rhoB serve as substrates for C3 and the C. limosum exoenzyme. Whereas recombinant rac1 protein is only marginally ADP-ribosylated by C3 or by the C. limosum exoenzyme in the absence of detergent, in the presence of 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate rac1 is modified by C3 but not by the C. limosum exoenzyme. Recombinant CDC42Hs protein is a poor substrate for C. limosum exoenzyme and is even less modified by C3. The C. limosum exoenzyme is auto-ADP-ribosylated in the presence of 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate by forming an ADP-ribose protein bond highly stable toward hydroxylamine. The data indicate that ADP-ribosylation of small GTP-binding proteins of the rho family is not unique to C. botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase but is also catalyzed by a C3-related exoenzyme from C. limosum."

Their broad functional importance is reflected by their presence in a wide variety of phyla extending from Echinodermata through higher vertebrates.

https://openalex.org/W1969527771,"We placed a specific inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) under the control of a prestalk-specific promoter. Cells containing this construct form normally patterned slugs, but under environmental conditions that normally trigger immediate culmination, the slugs undergo prolonged migration. Slugs that eventually enter culmination do so normally but arrest as elongated, hairlike structures that contain neither stalk nor spore cells. Mutant cells do not migrate to the stalk entrance when codeveloped with wild-type cells and show greatly reduced inducibility by DIF, the stalk cell morphogen. These results suggest that the activity of PKA is necessary for the altered pattern of movement of prestalk cells at culmination and their differentiation into stalk cells. We propose a model whereby a protein repressor, under the control of PKA, inhibits precocious induction of stalk cell differentiation by DIF and so regulates the choice between slug migration and culmination."
https://openalex.org/W2024499420,"A eukaryotic chromosomal origin of replication was identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By several criteria, including map position, deletion analysis, and a synthetic form of saturation mutagenesis, the origin co-localized with the HMR-E silencer, which is a DNA element that represses transcription of the adjacent genes. A specific site within the silencer was required for both initiation of chromosomal replication and for repression of transcription. This analysis directly demonstrates that initiation of eukaryotic chromosomal replication is dependent on specific sequence elements and that a particular element can act in both initiation of chromosomal replication and regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1543387243,"A gene sequence (TSC-22) that is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 was isolated by differential screening of a lambda gt10 cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of mouse osteoblastic cells treated with TGF-beta 1 for 2 h. TSC-22 gene expression was transcriptionally activated by TGF-beta 1. It was also induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, serum, cholera toxin, or dexamethasone, but not appreciably by epidermal growth factor. Its induction was rapid and transient, reaching a peak 2 h after TGF-beta 1 treatment, and was resistant to cycloheximide like that of c-jun. The nucleotide sequences of TSC-22 cDNA showed no homology with any known gene sequence. The open reading frame and in vitro translation product indicated that the gene encodes a polypeptide of 143 amino acids with a molecular mass of 18 kDa that contains a putative leucine zipper structure. Polyclonal antibody was raised against TSC-22 protein expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the antibody detected a 18-kDa protein in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of [35S]Met-labeled cells. These results indicate that the TSC-22 gene is a new member of the family of early response genes, and encodes a small polypeptide that is a putative transcriptional regulator."

Some or all octopine-inducible genes are regulated by a protein called OccR. Primer extension analysis showed that OccR protein represses the occR gene and both represses and activates the occQ operon, which is divergently transcribed from occR. These promoters initiate transcription 46 bp apart. This regulatory system was reconstituted in vitro using purified OccR protein and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. OccR binds with high affinity to a single site overlapping these promoters. Octopine shortens the DNAase I footprint of OccR and increases the gel mobility of OccR-DNA complexes by relaxing an OccR-incited DNA bend."

https://openalex.org/W2026700085,"The spinal cord of early zebrafish embryos contains a small number of neuronal classes whose growth cones all follow stereotyped, cell-specific pathways to their targets. Two classes of spinal neurons make cell-specific turns at or near the ventral midline of the spinal cord, which is occupied by a single row of midline floor plate cells. We tested whether these cells guide the growth cones by examining embryos missing the midline floor plate cells due either to laser ablation of the cells or to a mutation (cyc-1). In these embryos the growth cones followed both normal and aberrant pathways once near the ventral midline. This suggests that normally the midline floor plate cells do provide guidance cues, but that these cues are not obligatory."
https://openalex.org/W2169277564,"The yeast KAR1 gene is required for spindle pole body (SPB) duplication and nuclear fusion. We determine here that KAR1-beta-galactosidase hybrid proteins localize to the outer face of the SPB. Remarkably, after SPB duplication, the hybrid protein was found associated with only one of the two SPBs, usually the one that enters the bud. Using an ndc1 mutant, which forms a defective SPB at the nonpermissive temperature, we found that the hybrid was exclusively associated with the ""new"" SPB. Two regions of KAR1 contribute to its localization; an internal 70 residue region was necessary and sufficient to localize hybrids to the SPB, and the hydrophobic carboxyl terminus localized proteins to the nuclear envelope. The localization domains correspond to two functional domains required for SPB duplication. We suggest that KAR1 is anchored to the nuclear envelope and interacts with at least one other SPB component during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1556683789,"The membrane-impermeant bis-mannose photolabel 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis-(D-mannos- 4-yloxy)-2- propylamine (ATB-BMPA) has been used to study the development of an intracellular pool of glucose transporters in 3T3-L1 cells. The subcellular distributions of the transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT4 were determined by comparing the labeling obtained in cells in which the impermeant reagent only had access to the cell surface and the labeling obtained in digitonin-permeabilized cells. ATB-BMPA labeling showed that only GLUT1 was present in preconfluent fibroblasts and that most of the transporters were distributed to the cell surface. In preconfluent fibroblasts, the 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport activity was approximately 5 times higher than in confluent fibroblasts. ATB-BMPA labeling showed that the decrease in transport as cells reached confluence was associated with a decrease in the proportion of GLUT1 distributed to the cell surface. The sequestration of these transporters was associated with the development of an insulin-responsive transport activity which increased by approximately 2.5-fold compared with unstimulated confluent cells. ATB-BMPA labeling showed that insulin stimulation resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in surface GLUT1 so that about one-half of the available transporters became recruited to the cell surface. Measurements of the changes in the distribution of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 throughout the differentiation of confluent fibroblasts into adipocytes showed that both transporters were sequestered in parallel. Basal levels of transport and photolabeling remained low throughout the differentiation period when the total pool of transporters (GLUT1 plus GLUT4) was increased by approximately 5-fold. These results suggest that the sequestration process was present before new transporters were synthesized. Thus, the sequestration mechanism develops in confluent growth-arrested fibroblasts although the capacity to sequester additional transporters may increase as differentiation proceeds."
https://openalex.org/W1945141852,"[3H]Meproadifen mustard, an affinity label for the noncompetitive antagonist site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), specifically alkylates the AChR alpha-subunit when the acetylcholine-binding sites are occupied by agonist (Dreyer, E. B., Hasan, F., Cohen, S. G., and Cohen, J. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13727-13734). In this report, we identify the site of alkylation within the alpha-subunit as Glu-262. AChR-rich membranes from Torpedo californica electric organ were reacted with [3H]meproadifen mustard in the presence of carbamylcholine and in the absence or presence of nonradioactive meproadifen to define specific alkylation of the noncompetitive antagonist site. Alkylated alpha-subunits were isolated and subjected to chemical or enzymatic cleavage. When digests with CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid or 70% formic acid were fractionated by gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), specifically labeled material was recovered in the void volume fractions. Based upon NH2-terminal sequence analysis, for both digests, the void volume fractions contained a fragment beginning at Gln-208 before the M1 hydrophobic sequence, whereas the sample from the digest in trifluoroacetic acid also contained as a primary sequence a fragment beginning at Thr-244 and extending through the M2 hydrophobic sequence. Sequence analysis revealed no release of 3H for the sample from digestion in formic acid, whereas for the trifluoroacetic acid digest, there was specific release of 3H in cycle 19, which would correspond to Glu-262. This site of alkylation was confirmed by isolation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC of a specifically labeled fragment from an endoproteinase Lys-C digest of the alkylated alpha-subunit. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed release of 3H at cycle 20 from a fragment beginning at Met-243 and extending into the M3 hydrophobic sequence. Because [3H]meproadifen mustard contains, as its reactive group, a positively charged quaternary aziridinium ion, Glu-262 of the alpha-subunit is identified as a contributor to the cation-binding domain of the noncompetitive antagonist-binding site and thus of the ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1522354664,"The gene coding for glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb), the alpha subunit of platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa is an early and specific marker of the megakaryocytic lineage. Thus, studies on the regulation of this gene may provide helpful information on the mechanisms controlling cell specificity and differentiation in this lineage. The promoter region of this gene was isolated and analyzed to understand its tissue-specific transcriptional activity. A region extending from nucleotides -414 to -554 was found to be extremely important for the promoter function. Deletion of this region results in a 70% decrease of the promoter activity, as measured in CAT assays. This region has the properties of an enhancer. It is able to activate a heterologous promoter, in a distance- and orientation-independent manner, in both megakaryocytic and erythroid cells. This enhancer contains binding sites for nuclear factors and mutation of these sites, individually or together, abolish the enhancer activity. These nuclear factors are present in megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lineages, but they are absent in the other tested cells. One of the sites, named domain D, contains a TTATC motif that may interact with the transcription factor GATA1, active in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. These results indicate that the promoter of a megakaryocytic gene contains a tissue specific enhancer, active in both the erythroid and the megakaryocytic lineages, and may implicate the erythroid factor GATA1."
https://openalex.org/W1481041888,"The soluble dimeric beta-galactoside-binding lectin (subunit molecular mass, approximately 14 kDa) of bovine heart muscle, in common with the 14-kDa lectins of several other animal species, displays carbohydrate-binding activity when it is in the reduced state, but the purified lectin loses this activity upon oxidation. In the present study, the presence of any post-translational modification and the mechanism of the oxidative inactivation have been investigated by analyses of the reduced and oxidized forms of the purified bovine lectin by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) of tryptic and peptic peptides. By ESI-MS, the molecular mass of the reduced lectin is determined to be 14,654.6 +/- 0.9 Da, and that of the oxidized lectin is 14,649.3 +/- 1.1 Da. These masses correspond to the amino acid sequence of the protein with the cysteines having free sulfhydryl groups in the reduced state and forming disulfide bonds in the oxidized state. There is no evidence of post-translational modification in either lectin form except for monoacetylation already predicted for alanine at the blocked N-terminal end. Pronounced differences in charge distribution in the electrospray ionization mass spectra of the reduced and oxidized lectin, reflecting a change in the number of accessible protonation sites in the oxidized protein, are consistent with the protein being held in an altered conformation by covalent bonding. The results of LSIMS analyses of tryptic and peptic peptides in conjunction with Edman sequencing indicate that disulfide bonding occurs predominantly between Cys2 and Cys130, Cys16 and Cys88, and Cys42 and Cys60. There is no evidence of oxidation of Trp68. These results, taken together with observations that almost the complete polypeptide chain is necessary for the functional integrity of the carbohydrate recognition domain (Abbott, W. M., and Feizi, T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5552-5557) point to intramolecular disulfide bonding with a change in protein folding and conformation as the mechanism of oxidative inactivation of the purified bovine lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1592523755,"Cleavage of yeast invertase by alpha-chymotrypsin produced a number of small glycopeptides that were highly active as elicitors of ethylene biosynthesis and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in suspension-cultured tomato cells. Five of these elicitors were purified and their amino acid sequence determined. They all had sequences corresponding to known sequences of yeast invertase, and all contained an asparagine known to carry a N-linked small high mannose glycan. The most active glycopeptide elicitor induced ethylene biosynthesis and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase half-maximally at a concentration of 5-10 nM. Structure-activity relationships of the peptide part were analyzed by further cleavage of a defined glycopeptide elicitor with various proteolytic enzymes. Removal of the C-terminal phenylalanine enhanced the elicitor activity, whereas removal of N-terminal arginine impaired it. A glycopeptide with the peptide part trimmed to the dipeptide arginine-asparagine was still fully active as elicitor. Glycopeptides with identical amino acid sequences were further separated into fractions differing in the oligosaccharide side chain. A given peptide had high elicitor activity when carrying a glycan with 10-12 mannosyl residues (Man10-12GlcNAc2), a 3-fold lower activity when carrying Man9GlcNAc2 and a 100-fold lower activity when carrying Man8GlcNAc2. The oligosaccharides, released by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H from the pure glycopeptide elicitors, acted as suppressors of elicitor-induced ethylene biosynthesis and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. A series of such oligosaccharides in the size range of Man8-13GlcNAc was purified. The structure and composition of the purified oligosaccharides corresponded to the known small high mannose glycans of yeast invertase as verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 600 MHz. The highest suppressor activities were obtained with the oligosaccharides containing 10-12 mannosyl residues (Man10-12GlcNAc). The oligosaccharide Man8 GlcNAc was ineffective as a suppressor. Thus, the structural requirements for the free oligosaccharides to act as efficient suppressors were the same as for the oligosaccharide side chains of the glycopeptides for high elicitor activity. We propose that the glycan suppressors bind to the same recognition site as the glycopeptide elicitors without inducing a response."
https://openalex.org/W1517380923,"Eukaryotic polypeptides containing COOH-terminal-CXXX sequences can be posttranslationally modified by isoprenylation of the cysteine residue via a thioether linkage, proteolytic removal of the three terminal amino acids, and alpha-carboxyl methylation of the cysteine residue. Through the development of an indirect coupled assay, we have identified three in vitro activities in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of the three COOH-terminal amino acids of the synthetic peptide substrate N-acetyl-KSKTK[S-farnesyl-Cys]VIM. One of these is the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y. Using a mutant strain deficient in this enzyme, we find evidence for an additional soluble activity as well as for a membrane-associated activity. These latter activities are candidates for roles in the physiological processing of isoprenylated protein precursors. They are both insensitive to inhibitors of serine and aspartyl proteinases but are sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and 0.5 mM ZnCl2. The soluble activity appears to be a metalloenzyme, inhibitable by 2 mM o-phenanthroline but not by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide, whereas the membrane-associated enzyme is inhibitable by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide but not 2 mM o-phenanthroline. We show that the membrane-bound protease is not an activity of the membrane-bound methyltransferase, because protease activity is observed in membrane preparations that lack the STE14-encoded methyltransferase. The soluble activity appears to be a novel carboxypeptidase of approximately 110 kDa that catalyzes a processive removal of amino acids from the COOH terminus from both the farnesylated and non-farnesylated substrate, but not from three other unrelated peptides. Finally, we find no evidence for non-vacuolar membrane or soluble activities that catalyze the ester hydrolysis of N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine methyl ester."
https://openalex.org/W1539874414,"The equilibrium and kinetic properties of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) binding to a range of cell types have been compared. When binding was examined at 4 degrees C, the majority of cells were found to express a single class of high affinity LIF receptor (KD = 20-100 pM; ka = 2-8 x 10(8) min-1 M-1; kd = 0.0004-0.0011 min-1). In contrast, certain activated macrophage populations expressed apparently independent classes of high and low affinity LIF receptor. The low affinity receptors differed from the high affinity receptors in terms of the dissociation rate of the receptor-ligand complex (KD = 1-2 nM; ka = 3-7 x 10(8) min-1 M-1; kd = 0.30-0.67 min-1). At 37 degrees C, the interaction of LIF with its high affinity receptor was more complicated, since occupied LIF receptors were internalized more rapidly than unoccupied receptors, internalized LIF was hydrolyzed and released from the cell, and new receptors were synthesized and expressed on the cell surface. Interestingly, when membranes were prepared from cells that expressed only high affinity receptors, both high and low affinity receptors were detected, while after detergent solubilization of membranes only low affinity receptors were apparent. These results are discussed in terms of a structural model for the LIF receptor in which interaction of a low affinity binding subunit and a second nonbinding subunit is required for the generation of the high affinity receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1554781559,"Cytochrome P-450BM-3 is a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid omega-hydroxylase with two domains. Functional and primary structure analyses of the hemo- and flavoprotein domains of cytochrome P-450BM-3 and the corresponding microsomal cytochrome P-450 system have shown that these proteins are highly homologous. Prior attempts to reconstitute the fatty acid hydroxylation function of cytochrome P-450BM-3, utilizing the two domains, obtained either by trypsinolysis or by recombinant methods, were unsuccessful. In this paper, we describe the reconstitution of the fatty acid hydroxylation activity of cytochrome P-450BM-3 utilizing the recombinantly produced flavoprotein domain (Oster, T., Boddupalli, S. S., and Peterson, J. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 22718-22725) and its hemoprotein counterpart. The rate of fatty acid-dependent oxygen consumption was shown to be linear when increasing concentrations of the hemoprotein domain are added to a fixed concentration of the flavoprotein domain and vice versa. The combination of the hemo- and flavoprotein domains in a ratio of 20:1 respectively, in the reaction mixture, results in the transfer of 80% of the reducing equivalents from NADPH for the hydroxylation of palmitate at 25 degrees C. The ratio of the regioisomeric products obtained for lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids was similar to that obtained with the holoenzyme form of cytochrome P-450BM-3. The reconstitution of the fatty acid omega-hydroxylase activity, using the soluble domains of cytochrome P-450BM-3, without added factors such as lipids, may be useful for structure/function comparisons to their eukaryotic counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1820248332,"c-Myc is a nuclear phosphoprotein which contains both a leucine zipper and a helix-loop-helix dimerization motif. These are adjacent to a basic region believed to make specific contacts with DNA upon dimerization. We report the purification of full-length c-Myc to near homogeneity from two independent eukaryotic systems: the baculovirus overexpression system using an insect cell host, and Chinese hamster ovary cells containing heat-inducible c-myc genes. The DNA binding capabilities of these preparations were characterized. Both preparations contain two distinct activities that bind specifically to sequences with a core of CACGTG. The Myc protein is solely responsible for one of these binding activities. Specific sequences that bound to c-Myc were selected from a large pool of random DNA sequence. Sequencing of individual binding sites selected by this procedure yielded a 12-base consensus, PuACCACGTGCTC, for c-Myc binding. Both protein preparations additionally demonstrated a distinct complex, containing both c-Myc and a copurifying 26-29-kDa protein, that bound to DNA with higher affinity than Myc alone. Selection of specific DNA sequences by this complex revealed a consensus binding site similar to the 12-base consensus described above. These data demonstrate that c-Myc isolated from eukaryotic cells is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding and further refine the optimal sequence for c-Myc binding. These protein preparations should prove useful in further characterizing the biochemical properties of c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W1518854779,"Kinetic studies of Morris 7777 hepatoma mitochondrial NAD(P) malic enzyme were consistent with an ordered mechanism where NAD adds to the enzyme before malate and dissociation of NADH from the enzyme is rate-limiting. In addition to its active site, malate apparently also associates with a lower affinity with an activator site. The activator fumarate competes with malate at the activator site and facilitates dissociation of NADH from the enzyme. The ratio of NAD(P) malic enzyme to malate dehydrogenase activity in the hepatoma mitochondrial extract was found to be too low, even in the presence of known inhibitors of malate dehydrogenase, to account for the known ability of NAD(P) malic enzyme to intercept exogenous malate from malate dehydrogenase in intact tumor mitochondria (Moreadith, R.W., and Lehninger, A.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6215-6221). However, NAD(P) malic enzyme may be able to intercept exogenous malate because according to the present results, it can associate with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which could localize NAD(P) malic enzyme in the vicinity of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The activity levels of some key metabolic enzymes were found to be different in Morris 7777 mitochondria than in liver or mitochondria of other rapidly dividing tumors. These results are discussed in terms of differences among tumors in their ability to utilize malate, glutamate, and citrate as respiratory fuels."
https://openalex.org/W1549608820,"G proteins are active as long as GTP is bound to the alpha subunit. Activation ends when GTP is cleaved to GDP that then stays bound to the active site. Agonist-liganded receptors allow formation of the active state by decreasing the affinity of alpha subunits for GDP allowing exchange of GDP for GTP. Since receptors interact with the C terminus of the alpha subunits, we tested whether deletion of the C terminus could mimic activation by receptors. Three deletions and one point mutation at the C terminus of alpha o were engineered in alpha o cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction, transcribed into RNA, and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The ability of in vitro synthesized protein to bind guanine nucleotide was inferred from analysis of native tryptic cleavage patterns, while the ability of the proteins to associate with beta gamma was measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Deletion of 14 amino acids, alpha oD[341], from the C terminus causes a large decrease in GDP affinity, with little or no change in guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate affinity. When GTP is present, alpha oD[341] remains in the activated conformation because exchange of GTP for GDP is rapid. Deletion of 10 amino acids, alpha oD[345], lowers GDP affinity, but less dramatically than in alpha oD[341]. Deletion of 5 amino acids, alpha oD[350], or mutation of Arg-349 to proline alpha oR[349P] has no detectable effects on GDP affinity. Deletion of up to 10 amino acids from the C terminus does not prevent formation of alpha beta gamma heterotrimers. We propose that the C terminus of the alpha subunit is a mobile region that blocks dissociation of GDP. Agonist-liganded receptors may move it aside to allow release of GDP, exchange for GTP, and activation of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1596721279,"The active site nucleophile of the beta-glucosidase of Agrobacterium faecalis has recently been identified by the use of inhibitors. A combination of site-directed and in vitro enzymatic mutagenesis was carried out on the beta-glucosidase to probe the structure of the active site region. Forty-three point mutations were generated at 22 different residues in the region surrounding the active site nucleophile, Glu358. Only five positions were identified which affected enzyme activity indicating that only a few key residues are important to enzyme activity, thus the enzyme can tolerate a number of single residue changes and still function. The importance of Glu358 to enzymatic function has been confirmed and other residues important to enzyme structure or function have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2029441241,"Teraethylammonium ion (TEA+)blocks voltage-gated K+ channels by acting at two sites located at opposite ends of the aqueous pore. This allowed us to test two predictions made by models of ion permeation, namely that K+ channels can be simultaneously occupied by multiple ions and that the ions repel each other. We show that externally applied TEA+ antagonize block by internal TEA+ and vice versa. The antagonism is less than predicted for competitive binding, hence TEA+ may occupy both sites simultaneously. External TEA+ and internal TEA+ reduce each others affinity 4-to 5-fold. In addition, K+ antagonizes block by TEA+ at the opposite side of the membrane, and external TEA+ antagonizes is block by internal Ba2+. The antagonism between ions applied at opposite sides of the membrane may be common to all cations binding to K+ channels."

https://openalex.org/W1527930273,"The insertion of a protein into a lipid bilayer usually involves a short signal sequence and can occur either during or after translation. A light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) is synthesized in the cytoplasm of plant cells as a precursor and is post-translationally imported into chloroplasts where it subsequently inserts into the thylakoid membrane. Only mature LHCP is required for insertion into the thylakoid. To define which sequences of the mature protein are necessary and sufficient for thylakoid integration, fusion and deletion proteins and proteins with internal rearrangements were synthesized and incubated with isolated thylakoids and stroma. No evidence is found for the existence of a short signal sequence within LHCP, and, with the exception of the amino terminus and a short lumenal loop, the entire mature protein with consecutively ordered alpha-helices is required for insertion into thylakoid membranes. The addition of positive charges into stromal but not lumenal segments permits the insertion of mutant LHCPs into isolated thylakoids. Replacement of the LHCP transit peptide with the transit peptide from plastocyanin has no effect on LHCP insertion and does not restore insertion of the lumenal charge addition mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1511315912,"Anti-metatype antibodies have been described as antibodies which recognize ligand-induced conformational changes in the antibody variable region. Additionally, anti-metatype antibodies, produced by multiple immunizations with liganded high affinity monoclonal anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20, enhanced the lifetime of monoclonal antibody 4-4-20-fluorescein complex. To better understand the mechanism of the delayed dissociation rate, deuterium oxide was used to probe the liganded active site. The rate and extent of deuterium oxide-mediated fluorescence enhancement of bound ligand served to monitor the conformational dynamics of the active site in the presence and absence of anti-metatype antibodies. Results showed that anti-metatype antibodies reduced the rate and extent of deuterium oxide-mediated fluorescence enhancement of 4-4-20, a single-chain derivative of 4-4-20 (consisting of the variable domains and a polylinker), and idiotypically related monoclonal anti-fluorescein antibodies suggesting that anti-metatype stabilized the liganded active site. Size exclusion liquid chromatography was utilized to isolate the liganded antibody-anti-metatype complex. Liganded single chain antibody 4-4-20 was mixed with 10-fold molar excess anti-metatype Fab fragments, and a major complex eluted with an apparent M(r) 249,000. The apparent molecular weight of this complex inferred that one liganded single chain antibody was bound by five antimetatype Fab fragments. Spectral analysis confirmed these results and the characteristic delayed rate of ligand dissociation was also observed for the isolated complex. The results suggest that anti-metatype antibodies stabilize the liganded conformation by forming a large, stable, macromolecular complex."
https://openalex.org/W1589230976,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of the myelin membrane exhibit heterogeneity with respect to metabolic turnover rate (Miller, S. L., Benjamins, J. A., and Morell, P. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4025-4037). To test the hypothesis that this is due to differential turnover of individual molecular species (which differ in acyl chain composition), we have examined the relative turnover of individual molecular species of myelin PC and PE. Phospholipids were labeled by injection of [2-3H]glycerol into the brains of young rats. Myelin was isolated at 1, 15, and 30 days post-injection, lipids were extracted, and phospholipid classes were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The PC and PE fractions were hydrolyzed with phospholipase C, and the resulting diacylglycerols were dinitrobenzoylated and fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The distribution of radioactivity among individual molecular species was determined. The labeled molecular species of myelin PC were 16:0-16:0, 16:0-18:0, 16:0-18:1, and 18:0-18:1, with most of the label present in 16:0-18:1 and 18:0-18:1. Changes in distribution of label with time after injection indicated that 16:0-18:1 turned over more rapidly than 18:0-18:1. The labeled molecular species of myelin PE were 18:0-20:4, 18:1-18:1, 16:0-18:1, 18:0-18:2, and 18:0-18:1. As with myelin PC, 16:0-18:1 (and 18:1-18:1) turned over more rapidly than 18:0-18:1. The relative turnover of individual molecular species of PC in the microsomal fraction from forebrain was also examined. The molecular species profile was different from myelin PC, but again, 16:0-18:1 turned over more rapidly than the other molecular species. Thus, within the same membrane, individual molecular species of a phospholipid class are metabolized at different rates. Comparison of our results with previous studies of turnover of molecular classes of phospholipids indicates that in addition to polar head group composition (Miller et al., 1977), fatty acid composition is very important in determining the metabolic fate of a phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1578106319,"Exposure of mammalian cells to a variety of agents leads to the activation of pre-existing proteins and the induction of specific genes. We have recently described the appearance of a specific DNA-binding protein in nuclei from cells exposed to ionizing radiation (Singh, S. P., and Lavin, M. F. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 5279-5285). This protein is present in the cytoplasm of unperturbed cells and is apparently translocated to the nucleus in response to radiation damage. We describe here the purification and characterization of this specific DNA-binding protein. Purification involved the use of affinity chromatography employing a multimeric form of the DNA-binding motif conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. Three DNA-binding species were recognized by UV-cross-linking and South-Western analysis. The major species or that with the highest affinity was approximately 70 kDa in size. DNase-1 footprint analysis revealed a single binding site in the kappa immunoglobulin gene enhancer and in a putative control sequence upstream from the c-myc gene. At salt concentrations as high as 1 M, up to 40% of the DNA-binding activity was maintained and the Kd was calculated to be 1.205 x 10(-6) M-1. Binding activity was found to be modulated by phosphorylation. Removal of phosphate groups from the protein resulted in a major loss of binding activity. It is not clear at this stage whether the factor(s) described here plays a role in transcription control or a more general DNA-processing role in response to radiation damage."
https://openalex.org/W1571040374,"Stepwise reconstitution of the subunits of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli offers insights into the organization and function of this multisubunit assembly. A highly processive, holoenzyme-like activity can be generated when the gamma complex, in the presence of ATP and a primed template, activates the beta subunit to form a preinitiation complex, and this is then followed by addition of the core polymerase. Further analysis of early replicative complexes has now revealed: 1) that the gamma complex can stably bind a single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB)-coated template, 2) that neither SSB coating of the template nor a proper primer terminus is required to form the preinitiation complex, and 3) that the gamma complex stabilizes the preinitiation complex in the presence of ATP and destabilizes it in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). Based on these findings, a sequence of stages can be formulated for an activation of the beta subunit that enables it to bind the template-primer and thereby interact with the core to create a processive polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1534977381,"The protease from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was chemically synthesized by automated solid-phase technology as an NH2-terminally extended derivative, capped with biotin. Biotin-linker-(SIV protease (1-99)): the linker segment, Gly-Gly-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ala-Ala, corresponds to the amino acid sequence preceding that of the protease in the SIV gag/pol precursor polyprotein. Accordingly, the Ala-Pro bond joining the octapeptide linker to the protease constitutes a site naturally cleaved by the protease during viral maturation. This strategy for synthesis was designed to facilitate purification of the biotinylated protein derivative from a complex mixture of reaction products by avidin/agarose-affinity chromatography and to provide the means for autocatalytic removal of the biotin-linker segment. As anticipated, folding of the full-length construct leads to activation of the enzyme and excision of the desired 99-residue SIV protease (overall yield, approximately). The specificity of the synthetic SIV protease toward a number of well characterized protein substrates was the same as observed for the nearly identical enzyme from human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2 protease) and distinct from that of the more disparate HIV-1 protease. The same functional ordering with respect to the human retroviral proteases was reflected in Ki values observed with a number of protease inhibitors. Thus, the folded synthetic SIV protease shows patterns of specificity and susceptibility to inhibition that are in accord with what would be expected based upon its degree of structural similarity to proteases from HIV-1 and HIV-2."
https://openalex.org/W1527573551,"2-Keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase, which catalyzes the reversible cleavage of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, yielding pyruvate plus glyoxylate, has been purified from extracts of bovine kidney to apparent homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and meniscus depletion sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The enzyme from this source has a native and a subunit mass of 144 and 36 kDa, respectively; the pH-activity optimum is 8.8. Rather than being stimulated, aldolase activity is inhibited to varying degrees by added divalent metal ions, whereas a number of metal ion-chelating agents have no effect. An absolute requirement for added thiol compounds could not be shown, but 2-mercaptoethanol enhances activity 2-fold, and added Hg2+ as well as p-mercuribenzoate or dithiodipyridine markedly inhibit catalysis. Incubation of the enzyme with either pyruvate or glyoxylate in the presence of NaBH4 causes extensive loss of aldolase activity concomitant with stable binding of approximately 1.0-1.5 mol of 14C-labeled substrate/mol of enzyme. The circular dichroism spectrum for native aldolase is characteristic of an alpha-helix; incubation of the enzyme with glyoxylate has no effect on this spectrum, but it is considerably altered by pyruvate. Bovine kidney aldolase shows no stereospecificity in catalyzing the aldol cleavage of the two optical isomers of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, and although it also catalyzes the beta-decarboxylation of oxalacetate, its decarboxylase/aldolase activity ratio is lower than that seen with the pure enzyme from either bovine liver or Escherichia coli."
