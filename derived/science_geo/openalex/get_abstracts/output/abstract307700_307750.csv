https://openalex.org/W4232314910,"Ultrasound causes high-energy chemistry. It does so through the process of acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. During cavitational collapse, intense heating of the bubbles occurs. These localized hot spots have temperatures of roughly 5000 degrees C, pressures of about 500 atmospheres, and lifetimes of a few microseconds. Shock waves from cavitation in liquid-solid slurries produce high-velocity interparticle collisions, the impact of which is sufficient to melt most metals. Applications to chemical reactions exist in both homogeneous liquids and in liquid-solid systems. Of special synthetic use is the ability of ultrasound to create clean, highly reactive surfaces on metals. Ultrasound has also found important uses for initiation or enhancement of catalytic reactions, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases."
https://openalex.org/W2074247901,"Observed atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and data on the partial pressures of CO2 in surface ocean waters are combined to identify globally significant sources and sinks of CO2. The atmospheric data are compared with boundary layer concentrations calculated with the transport fields generated by a general circulation model (GCM) for specified source-sink distributions. In the model the observed north-south atmospheric concentration gradient can be maintained only if sinks for CO2 are greater in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere. The observed differences between the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface waters of the Northern Hemisphere and the atmosphere are too small for the oceans to be the major sink of fossil fuel CO2. Therefore, a large amount of the CO2 is apparently absorbed on the continents by terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1964324511,"Soot generated from diesel fuel in a combustion tube is characterized by microanalysis, x-ray diffraction, chemical reactivity, and nuclear magnetic resonance to address the recent proposal of the significance of carbon clusters in soot. The data support a traditional model of soot as polynuclear aromatic compounds rather than as clusters of carbon atoms with minimal edge site density. The amounts of noncarbon atoms in the soot (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur) are commensurate with the edge density of the crystallites (2 by 2 nanometers) inferred from diffraction. The chemistry of soot, in being reduced by potassium metal and alkylated by alkyl iodides, is that known for aromatic compounds and not that anticipated for materials such as graphite, with a small fraction of carbon atoms on edges."

https://openalex.org/W2011572188,"It is well substantiated that the absorption spectra of complex molecules may be sharpened, and in many cases the vibrational and rotational details brought out, by refrigeration of the absorbing material to the temperature of liquid nitrogen or lower. This principle seems of great potential utility for the characterization and differentiation of compounds of biological interest heretofore indistinguishable by their absorption characteristics, and conceivably for the solution of cytochemical problems. However, the techniques that have been employed have only limited application to polar compounds. We have therefore developed new techniques with which we have undertaken a study of the absorption spectra of a number of purines, pyrimidines, amino acids, proteins, etc. at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77Â° K)."
