https://openalex.org/W3217661335,"In the coronavirus efficacy (COVE) phase 3 clinical trial, vaccine recipients were assessed for neutralizing and binding antibodies as correlates of risk for COVID-19 disease and as correlates of protection. These immune markers were measured at the time of second vaccination and 4 weeks later, with values reported in standardized World Health Organization international units. All markers were inversely associated with COVID-19 risk and directly associated with vaccine efficacy. Vaccine recipients with postvaccination 50% neutralization titers 10, 100, and 1000 had estimated vaccine efficacies of 78% (95% confidence interval, 54 to 89%), 91% (87 to 94%), and 96% (94 to 98%), respectively. These results help define immune marker correlates of protection and may guide approval decisions for messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines and other COVID-19 vaccines."

Using transplantation of wild-type (WT) neurons, we show that Aβ enters WT grafts, and that this is accompanied by microglia infiltration. Manipulation of microglia function reduced Aβ deposition within grafts. Furthermore, in vivo imaging identified microglia as carriers of Aβ pathology in previously unaffected tissue. Our data thus argue for a hitherto unexplored mechanism of Aβ propagation."

No study to date has reported upon risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who inject drugs. Methods and findings Between October, 2020 and June, 2021, participants aged ≥18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month underwent interviews and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Binomial regressions identified correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Results Of 386 participants, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 36.3% (95% CI: 31.5%-41.1%); 92.1% had detectable IgM antibodies. Only 37.5% had previously been tested. Seroprevalence did not differ by country of residence. None tested RNA-positive. Most (89.5%) reported engaging in ≥1 protective behavior [e.g., facemasks (73.5%), social distancing (46.5%), or increasing handwashing/sanitizers (22.8%)]. In a multivariate model controlling for sex, older age, and Hispanic/Latinx/Mexican ethnicity were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as was engaging in sex work (AdjRR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.18–2.27) and having been incarcerated in the past six months (AdjRR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.97–2.27). Comorbidities and substance using behaviors were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Conclusions In this community-based study of people who inject drugs in the San Diego-Tijuana border region, over one third were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, exceeding estimates from the general population in either city. We found no evidence that substance use behaviors were associated with an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but observed that circumstances in the risk environment, notably sex work and incarceration, were independently associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Our findings suggest that a binational policy response to COVID-19 mitigation is warranted beyond the closure of the U.S.-Mexico border. Furthermore, decriminalizing sex work and drug use could reduce the burden of COVID-19 among people who inject drugs."

https://openalex.org/W3216264997,"Abundant secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in the mucus, breast milk, and saliva provides immunity against infection of mucosal surfaces. Pre-pandemic breast milk samples containing SIgA have been reported to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2; however, it remains unknown whether SIgA showing the cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-2 exists in saliva. We aimed to clarify whether SIgA in saliva cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 subunit in individuals who have not been infected with this virus. The study involved 137 (men, n = 101; women, n = 36; mean age, 38.7; age range, 24–65 years) dentists and doctors from Kanagawa Dental University Hospital. Saliva and blood samples were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunochromatography for IgG and IgM, respectively. We then identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed to be PCR-negative and IgM-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactivity of IgA-positive saliva samples with SARS-CoV-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike recombinant protein (S1-mFc) covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive IgA-positive individuals was 46.7%, which correlated negatively with age (r = –0.218, p = 0.01). The proportion of IgA-positive individuals aged ≥50 years was significantly lower than that of patients aged ≤49 years (p = 0.008). SIgA was purified from the saliva of patients, which could partially suppress the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor. This study demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive SIgA in the saliva of individuals who had never been infected with the virus, suggesting that SIgA may help prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3216569903,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth technologies were used in the primary health care setting in New Brunswick as a means to continue providing care to patients while following public health guidelines. This study aimed to measure these changes and examine if they improved timely access to primary care. A secondary goal was to identify which telehealth technologies were deemed sustainable by primary care providers. Methods This was a comparative study on the use of telehealth technology before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between April 2020 and November 2020, 114 active primary care providers (family physicians or nurse practitioners) responded to the online survey. Results The findings illustrated an increase in the use of telehealth technologies. The use of phone consultations increased by 122%, from 43.9% pre-pandemic to 97.6% during the pandemic ( p &lt; 0.001). The use of virtual consultation (19.3% pre-pandemic vs. 41.2% during the pandemic, p &lt; 0.001), emails and texts also increased during the pandemic. Whereas the more structural organizational tools (electronic medical charts and reservation systems) remained stable. However, those changes did not coincide with a significant improvement to timely access to care during the pandemic. Many participants (40.1%) wanted to keep phone consultations, and 21.9% of participants wanted to keep virtual consultations as part of their long-term practice. Interpretation The observed increase in the use of telehealth technologies may be sustainable, but it has not significantly improved timely access to primary care in New Brunswick."
https://openalex.org/W3213781013,"The dual roles of H2S as an endogenously synthesized respiratory substrate and as a toxin raise questions as to how it is cleared when the electron transport chain is inhibited. Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) catalyzes the first step in the mitochondrial H2S oxidation pathway, using CoQ as an electron acceptor, and connects to the electron transport chain at the level of complex III. We have discovered that at high H2S concentrations, which are known to inhibit complex IV, a new redox cycle is established between SQOR and complex II, operating in reverse. Under these conditions, the purine nucleotide cycle and the malate aspartate shuttle furnish fumarate, which supports complex II reversal and leads to succinate accumulation. Complex II knockdown in colonocytes decreases the efficiency of H2S clearance while targeted knockout of complex II in intestinal epithelial cells significantly decreases the levels of thiosulfate, a biomarker of H2S oxidation, to approximately one-third of the values seen in serum and urine samples from control mice. These data establish the physiological relevance of this newly discovered redox circuitry between SQOR and complex II for prioritizing H2S oxidation and reveal the quantitatively significant contribution of intestinal epithelial cells to systemic H2S metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3216415322,"Abstract Genetic defects in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) can result in neurological disease triggered by toxic activity of the single-strand-break sensor protein PARP1. However, the mechanism(s) by which this toxic PARP1 activity triggers cellular dysfunction are unclear. Here we show that human cells lacking XRCC1 fail to rapidly recover transcription following DNA base damage, a phenotype also observed in patient-derived fibroblasts with XRCC1 mutations and Xrcc1 −/− mouse neurons. This defect is caused by excessive/aberrant PARP1 activity during DNA base excision repair, resulting from the loss of PARP1 regulation by XRCC1. We show that aberrant PARP1 activity suppresses transcriptional recovery during base excision repair by promoting excessive recruitment and activity of the ubiquitin protease USP3, which as a result reduces the level of monoubiquitinated histones important for normal transcriptional regulation. Importantly, inhibition and/or deletion of PARP1 or USP3 restores transcriptional recovery in XRCC1 −/− cells, highlighting PARP1 and USP3 as possible therapeutic targets in neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W3216323777,"Heme is an essential cofactor for enzymes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthesis in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Heme also binds to and destabilizes Bach1, a transcription regulator that controls expression of several groups of genes important for glycolysis, ETC, and metastasis of cancer cells. Heme synthesis can thus affect pathways through which cells generate energy and precursors for anabolism. In addition, increased heme synthesis may trigger oxidative stress. Since many cancers are characterized by a high glycolytic rate regardless of oxygen availability, targeting glycolysis, ETC, and OXPHOS have emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that enhancing heme synthesis through exogenous supplementation of heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) suppresses oxidative metabolism as well as glycolysis and significantly reduces proliferation of both ovarian and breast cancer cells. ALA supplementation also destabilizes Bach1 and inhibits migration of both cell types. Our data indicate that the underlying mechanisms differ in ovarian and breast cancer cells, but involve destabilization of Bach1, AMPK activation, and induction of oxidative stress. In addition, there appears to be an inverse correlation between the activity of oxidative metabolism and ALA sensitivity. Promoting heme synthesis by ALA supplementation may thus represent a promising new anti-cancer strategy, particularly in cancers that are sensitive to altered redox signaling, or in combination with strategies that target the antioxidant systems or metabolic weaknesses of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3116606779,"Introduction The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented challenges for the medical staff worldwide, especially for those in hospitals where COVID-19-positive patients are hospitalized. The announcement of COVID-19 hospital restrictions by the Japanese government has led to several limitations in hospital care, including an increased use of physical restraints, which could affect the care of elderly dementia patients. However, few studies have empirically validated the impact of physical restraint use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of regulatory changes, consequent to the pandemic, on physical restraint use among elderly dementia patients in acute care hospitals. Methods In this retrospective study, we extracted the data of elderly patients (aged &gt; 64 years) who received dementia care in acute care hospitals between January 6, 2019, and July 4, 2020. We divided patients into two groups depending on whether they were admitted to hospitals that received COVID-19-positive patients. We calculated descriptive statistics to compare the trend in 2-week intervals and conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to validate the changes in the use of physical restraint. Results In hospitals that received COVID-19-positive patients, the number of patients who were physically restrained per 1,000 hospital admissions increased after the government’s announcement, with a maximum incidence of 501.4 per 1,000 hospital admissions between the 73rd and 74th week after the announcement. Additionally, a significant increase in the use of physical restraints for elderly dementia patients was noted ( p = 0.004) in hospitals that received COVID-19-positive patients. Elderly dementia patients who required personal care experienced a significant increase in the use of physical restraints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Understanding the causes and mechanisms underlying an increased use of physical restraints for dementia patients can help design more effective care protocols for similar future situations."

https://openalex.org/W3217035653,"Present day risk assessment on the spreading of airborne viruses is often based on the classical Wells-Riley model assuming immediate mixing of the aerosol into the studied environment. Here, we improve on this approach and the underlying assumptions by modeling the space-time dependency of the aerosol concentration via a transport equation with a dynamic source term introduced by the infected individual(s). In the present agent-based methodology, we study the viral aerosol inhalation exposure risk in two scenarios including a low/high risk scenario of a ""supermarket""/""bar"". The model takes into account typical behavioral patterns for determining the rules of motion for the agents. We solve a diffusion model for aerosol concentration in the prescribed environments in order to account for local exposure to aerosol inhalation. We assess the infection risk using the Wells-Riley model formula using a space-time dependent aerosol concentration. The results are compared against the classical Wells-Riley model. The results indicate features that explain individual cases of high risk with repeated sampling of a heterogeneous environment occupied by non-equilibrium concentration clouds. An example is the relative frequency of cases that might be called superspreading events depending on the model parameters. A simple interpretation is that averages of infection risk are often misleading. They also point out and explain the qualitative and quantitative difference between the two cases-shopping is typically safer for a single individual person."
https://openalex.org/W3214806733,"Efforts to control the spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic include drastic measures such as isolation, social distancing, and lockdown. These restrictions are accompanied by serious adverse consequences such as forgoing of healthcare. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of forgone care for a variety of healthcare services during a two-month COVID-19 lockdown, using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization. A cross-sectional study using computerized phone interviews was conducted with 302 Israeli Jewish participants aged 40 and above. Almost half of the participants (49%) reported a delay in seeking help for at least one needed healthcare service during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Among the predisposing factors, we found that participants aged 60+, being more religious, and reporting higher levels of COVID-19 fear were more likely to report forgone care than younger, less religious and less concerned participants. Among need factors, a statistically significant association was found with a reported diagnosis of diabetes, with participants with the disease having a considerably higher likelihood of forgone care. The findings stress the importance of developing interventions aimed at mitigating the phenomenon of forgoing care while creating nonconventional ways of consuming healthcare services. In the short term, healthcare services need to adapt to the social distancing and isolation measures required to stanch the epidemic. In the long term, policymakers should consider alternative ways of delivering healthcare services to the public regularly and during crisis without losing sight of their budgetary consequences. They must recognize the possibility of having to align medical staff to the changing demand for healthcare services under conditions of health uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W3217652173,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major public health issue globally. Preventive health measures against COVID-19 can reduce the health burden significantly by containing the transmission. A few research have been undertaken on the effectiveness of preventive strategies such as mask use, hand washing, and keeping social distance in preventing COVID-19 transmission. The main aim of this study was to determine the association of the preventive measures with the reduction of transmission of COVID-19 among people. Data was collected during January 06, 2021 to May 10, 2021 from 1690 participants in Bangladesh. A validated questionnaire was used to collect both the online and offline data. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association among the variables. The prevalence of COVID-19 was 11.5% (195 of 1690) among the population. Age, gender, occupation and monthly income of the participants were significantly associated with the likelihood of following the preventive measures. The risk of infection and death reduced significantly among the participants following preventive measures (p = .001). The odds of incidence was lower among the participants using masks properly (OR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01-0.43), maintaining social distances (OR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.33), avoiding crowded places (OR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02-0.19) and hand shaking (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.09-0.41). This study suggests that preventive health measures are significantly associated with the reduction of the risk of infection of COVID-19. Findings from this study will help the policymakers to take appropriate steps to curb the health burden of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3214833467,"Self-management is a promising approach to improve quality of life after stroke. However, evidence for the appropriateness and effectiveness of self-management for stroke survivors with aphasia is limited. This article reports on the process used to develop a supported self-management intervention for stroke survivors with aphasia (SSWA) using co-production and behaviour change theory. Preparatory research included systematic reviews, and qualitative interviews and focus groups with SSWA, family members and speech and language therapists (SLTs).We conducted six, 2 hour long intervention development workshops with key stakeholders. The workshops were informed by principles of co-production and the intervention development process outlined by the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). We also incorporated the findings of our preparatory research within workshops. Each workshop included an introduction, 1-2 co-production tasks and time for feedback at the end of the session. Data were analysed on an ongoing basis so that findings could be used to feed in to subsequent workshops and intervention development.Workshop participants (n = 12) included; SSWA (n = 5), family members (n = 3) and SLTs (n = 4). Together, participants engaged with accessible and participatory co-production tasks which aligned with the BCW framework. Participants engaged in discussion to define self-management in behavioural terms (behavioural diagnosis) and to identify what needed to change to support self-management. Participant's co-produced solutions for supporting self-management and discussed options to implement these in practice. Prototype materials were generated by the research team and evaluated by participants. Intervention functions and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were mapped to the solutions generated by participants by the research team, after the final workshop. A supported self-management intervention for SSWA was developed which will be delivered by SLTs through community stroke services.This paper reports the process we used to integrate co-production work with behaviour change theory to develop a complex self-management intervention. This is of relevance for researchers looking to harness the strengths of co-production methods and theory in intervention design. Future research will feasibility test the supported self-management intervention developed. This paper provides transparency to our intervention development process which will help others to better interpret the findings of our feasibility work."
https://openalex.org/W3217075749,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a specific form of lung damage caused by different infectious and non-infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2, leading to severe respiratory and systemic inflammation. To gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms behind ALI and to identify core elements of the regulatory network associated with this pathology, key genes involved in the regulation of the acute lung inflammatory response ( Il6 , Ccl2 , Cat , Serpine1 , Eln , Timp1 , Ptx3 , Socs3 ) were revealed using comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of whole-genome microarray datasets, functional annotation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), reconstruction of protein-protein interaction networks and text mining. The bioinformatics data were validated using a murine model of LPS-induced ALI; changes in the gene expression patterns were assessed during ALI progression and prevention by anti-inflammatory therapy with dexamethasone and the semisynthetic triterpenoid soloxolone methyl (SM), two agents with different mechanisms of action. Analysis showed that 7 of 8 revealed ALI-related genes were susceptible to LPS challenge (up-regulation: Il6 , Ccl2 , Cat , Serpine1 , Eln , Timp1 , Socs3 ; down-regulation: Cat ) and their expression was reversed by the pre-treatment of mice with both anti-inflammatory agents. Furthermore, ALI-associated nodal genes were analysed with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lung cancers. The overlap with DEGs identified in postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients revealed genes ( Saa1 , Rsad2 , Ifi44 , Rtp4 , Mmp8 ) that (a) showed a high degree centrality in the COVID-19-related regulatory network, (b) were up-regulated in murine lungs after LPS administration, and (c) were susceptible to anti-inflammatory therapy. Analysis of ALI-associated key genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas showed their correlation with poor survival in patients with lung neoplasias ( Ptx3 , Timp1 , Serpine1 , Plaur ). Taken together, a number of key genes playing a core function in the regulation of lung inflammation were found, which can serve both as promising therapeutic targets and molecular markers to control lung ailments, including COVID-19-associated ALI."

It is therefore necessary to conduct an environmental safety performance evaluation for promoting geo-tourism development. In order to identify and figure out the factors influencing the tourists' environmental safety perception, an index system was established based on six principles of Crime Prevention Through environment design (CPTED) theory. A Questionnaire was adopted for data collection, and the overall evaluation value and concrete index scores at all levels were obtained via the fuzzy comprehensive analysis and Importance-Performance analysis. Empirical results show that: (1) tourists' perception of environmental safety performance in Shilin Park from high to low was: image and maintenance, Natural Surveillance, territoriality, Access control, Activity support and target hardening; (2) The sub-factors influencing tourists' safety perception mostly include electronic monitoring device, Lighting system, Public safety management, Road layout, environmental sanitation; While attention should be paid on the following aspects including park service center, inter-personal surveillance, surrounding environment, unobstructed view, parking lot, Signpost, for they are considered as high-importance items with relatively poor performance. Based on the analysis, three optimization measures were proposed, including optimizing the layout and design of each space, strengthening the deterrent force of the park and maintaining a good environmental image. This research provides useful suggestions for Geopark decision-makers on determining the priority of Geopark spatial planning and management, as well as achieving the optimal allocation of resources to promote the sustainable development of Geopark."
https://openalex.org/W3216374661,"Metastatic lung cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. Dissemination of cancer cells can be facilitated by various agonists within the tumor microenvironment, including by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). We postulate that Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), which integrate signaling cues driving cell migration, are critical effectors in metastatic cancer. Specifically, we addressed the hypothetical role of ARHGEF17, a RhoGEF, as a potential effector of Gβγ in metastatic lung cancer cells responding to LPA. Here, we show that ARHGEF17, originally identified as a tumor endothelial marker, is involved in tumor growth and metastatic dissemination of lung cancer cells in an immunocompetent murine model. Gene expression-based analysis of lung cancer datasets showed that increased levels of ARHGEF17 correlated with reduced survival of patients with advanced-stage tumors. Cellular assays also revealed that this RhoGEF participates in the invasive and migratory responses elicited by Gi protein-coupled LPA receptors via the Gβγ subunit complex. We demonstrate that this signaling heterodimer promoted ARHGEF17 recruitment to the cell periphery and actin fibers. Moreover, Gβγ allosterically activates ARHGEF17 by the removal of inhibitory intramolecular restrictions. Taken together, our results indicate that ARHGEF17 may be a valid potential target in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer."

Studies have suggested that numeracy is correlated to financial outcomes, suggesting its relevance to financial decisions. However, almost all research on numeracy has been conducted in high-income countries in Europe and North America. Our analyses suggest that low numeracy is much more common in low-income countries, thus potentially threatening the financial well-being of the world's poorest. We analyzed data from the Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, which assessed basic numeracy in 141 countries, including 21 low-income, 34 lower middle income, 43 upper middle income, and 43 high-income countries. Numeracy was associated with being among the poorest 20% of one's country, and with difficulty living on one's income, even after accounting for income, education, and demographics. These findings underscore the importance of worldwide numeracy education."
https://openalex.org/W3217288028,"Most studies on elephant vocal communication have focused on the low-frequency rumble, with less effort on other vocalization types such as the most characteristic elephant call, the trumpet. Yet, a better and more complete understanding of the elephant vocal system requires investigating other vocalization types and their functioning in more detail as well. We recorded adult female Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) at a private facility in Nepal and analyzed 206 trumpets from six individuals regarding their frequency, temporal and contour shape, and related acoustic parameters of the fundamental frequency. We also tested for information content regarding individuality and context. Finally, we recorded the occurrence of non-linear phenomena such as bifurcation, biphonation, subharmonics and deterministic chaos. We documented a mean fundamental frequency ± SD of 474 ± 70 Hz and a mean duration ± SD of 1.38 ± 1.46 s (Nindiv. = 6, Ncalls = 206). Our study reveals that the contour of the fundamental frequency of trumpets encodes information about individuality, but we found no evidence for trumpet subtypes in greeting versus disturbance contexts. Non-linear phenomena prevailed and varied in abundance among individuals, suggesting that irregularities in trumpets might enhance the potential for individual recognition. We propose that trumpets in adult female Asian elephants serve to convey an individual's identity as well as to signal arousal and excitement to conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W3217244356,"In yeast and human cells many of the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are required for the stabilisation and productive processing of rRNA precursors. Functional coupling of r-protein assembly with the stabilisation and maturation of subunit precursors potentially promotes the production of ribosomes with defined composition. To further decipher mechanisms of such an intrinsic quality control pathway we analysed here the contribution of three yeast large ribosomal subunit r-proteins rpL2 (uL2), rpL25 (uL23) and rpL34 (eL34) for intermediate nuclear subunit folding steps. Structure models obtained from single particle cryo-electron microscopy analyses provided evidence for specific and hierarchic effects on the stable positioning and remodelling of large ribosomal subunit domains. Based on these structural and previous biochemical data we discuss possible mechanisms of r-protein dependent hierarchic domain arrangement and the resulting impact on the stability of misassembled subunits."
https://openalex.org/W3217663140,"An infinite-horizon, multidimensional optimization problem with arbitrary yet finite periodicity in discrete time is considered. The problem can be posed as a set of coupled equations. It is shown that the problem is a special case of a more general class of contraction problems that have unique solutions. Solutions are obtained by considering a vector-valued value function and by using an iterative process. Special cases of the general class of contraction problems include the classical Bellman problem and its stochastic formulations. Thus, our approach can be viewed as an extension of the Bellman problem to the special case of nonautonomy that periodicity represents, and our approach thereby facilitates consistent and rigorous treatment of, for example, seasonality in discrete, dynamic optimization, and furthermore, certain types of dynamic games. The contraction approach is illustrated in simple examples. In the main example, which is an infinite-horizon resource management problem with a periodic price, it is found that the optimal exploitation level differs between high and low price time intervals and that the solution time paths approach a limit cycle."

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of return to work (RTW) among women on sick leave due to long-term neck/shoulder and/or back pain.This was a prospective cohort study with a 1-year follow-up. The study participants were recruited from a local Swedish Social Insurance Agency register and had all been on sick leave for ≥ 1 month due to long-term (≥ 3 months) neck/shoulder and/or back pain. Data on predictors and outcome were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 208 women aged 23-64 years were included at baseline, and 141 responded at the 1-year follow-up. Cluster analyses were performed to identify one predictor from each cluster for use in the regression model.At the 1-year follow-up, 94 of the 141 women had RTW and 47 had not. Women who engaged in more coping through increasing behavioral activities (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.25) and those who more strongly believed they would return to the same work within 6 months (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10-1.37) had an increased probability of RTW. Receiving more social support outside work (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92) decreased the odds of RTW at the 1-year follow-up.Behavioral activities, beliefs about returning to the same work, and social support outside work were predictors of RTW at the 1-year follow-up. Healthcare professionals should consider these predictors in their efforts to prevent prolonged sick leave and to promote RTW in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3215011317,"At present, global immunity to SARS-CoV-2 resides within a heterogeneous combination of susceptible, naturally infected and vaccinated individuals. The extent to which viral shedding and transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is an important determinant of the rate at which COVID-19 achieves endemic stability. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding, and seroconversion rates were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus, although at lower amounts. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parker's Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles. Observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible."
https://openalex.org/W3215259018,"Background No medical treatment has proven efficacy for acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF), and this syndrome has a very high mortality. Based on data indicating humoral autoimmune processes are involved in IPF pathogenesis, we treated AE-IPF patients with an autoantibody reduction regimen of therapeutic plasma exchange, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. This study aimed to identify clinical and autoantibody determinants associated with survival after autoantibody reduction in AE-IPF. Methods Twenty-four(24) AE-IPF patients received the autoantibody reduction regimen. Plasma anti-epithelial autoantibody titers were determined by HEp-2 indirect immunofluorescence assays in 22 patients. Results Mean age of the patients was 70 + 7 years old, and 70% were male. Beneficial clinical responses that occurred early during therapy were a favorable prognostic indicator: supplemental O 2 flows needed to maintain resting S a O 2 &gt;92% significantly decreased and/or walk distances increased among all 10 patients who survived for at least one year. Plasma anti-HEp-2 autoantibody titers were ~-three-fold greater in survivors compared to non-survivors (p&lt;0.02). Anti-HEp-2 titers &gt;1:160 were present in 75% of the evaluable one-year survivors, compared to 29% of non-survivors, and 10 of 12 patients (83%) with anti-HEP-2 titers &lt;1:160 died during the observation period (Hazard Ratio = 3.3, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.02–10.6, p = 0.047). Conclusions Autoantibody reduction therapy is associated with rapid reduction of supplemental oxygen requirements and/or improved ability to ambulate in many AE-IPF patients. Facile anti-epithelial autoantibody assays may help identify those most likely to benefit from these treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3215548232,"Ceylon cinnamon, which was regarded as a luxury spice during ancient times, has been consumed for its medicinal properties and health benefits for thousands of years. For centuries, Arabian traders controlled the European cinnamon trade through limited supplies from a country which they did not reveal. Content marketing analysis and chemical profiling of value-added products of Ceylon cinnamon in the global marketplace are proposed to investigate the clean status of the product labels. In the present study, a mixed-method approach was employed to investigate the labels of 6 types of value-added forms of cinnamon; i.e. quills, powder, tea, breakfast cereals, confectionery and bakery and nutraceuticals which are used in USA, UK, Mexico, Japan and products of Sri Lankan cinnamon exporters. Two hundred and seventy-six labels were analyzed to find out the aspects of clean status, transparency and authenticity. Key label claims of the cinnamon products lie within the bounds of cleaner, healthy, nutritional and sustainable attributes. Consumer perception lies within ingredients, nutritional value, country of origin and claim on safety and quality standards and certification. The value chain transparency, ethical rules (species mislabeling), and chemical profile of the pharmaceutical, confectionery and fragrance industry inputs were ignored. The best claim and competitive advantage of the Ceylon cinnamon; an ultra-low level (<0.01 mg/g Dry Weight) of Coumarin, were rarely indicated in labels. Lack of clean labels and traceability lagged Ceylon cinnamon in the 40 international markets while Cassia cinnamon (Coumarin content 2.23 mg/g DW), a major competitor of Ceylon cinnamon appears in the market with dirty labels. Millennials and upper-middle-class female consumers in their active ages, place a high demand on Ceylon cinnamon. Today's tech-savvy global consumers of Ceylon cinnamon use market intelligence frequently for identifying product authenticity. Well equipped clean labels were found to be demanded by the modern cinnamon consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3215770021,"Purpose Allergens present in the feces or frass of cockroaches can cause allergic sensitization in humans. The use of fecal and frass extracts for immunotherapy has been previously investigated but has not yet been fully standardized. Here, we treated cockroaches with ampicillin to produce extracts with reduced amounts of total bacteria. Methods We performed targeted high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA to compare the microbiomes of ampicillin-treated and untreated (control) cockroaches. RNA-seq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ampicillin-treated cockroaches. Results Analysis of the microbiome revealed that alpha diversity was lower in the ampicillin-treated group than in the control group. Beta diversity analysis indicated that ampicillin treatment altered bacterial composition in the microbiome of cockroaches. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that almost all bacteria were removed from ampicillin-treated cockroaches. RNA-seq analysis revealed 1,236 DEGs in ampicillin-treated cockroaches (compared to untreated cockroaches). Unlike bacterial composition, the DEGs varied between the two groups. Among major allergens, the expression of Bla g 2 decreased significantly in ampicillin-treated cockroaches (compared to untreated group). Conclusions In this study, the reduced level of allergens observed in cockroaches may be related to lower amounts of total bacteria caused by treatment with antibiotics. It is possible to make a protein extract with few bacteria for use in immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3216002960,"This study determined the association between respiratory symptoms and death from respiratory causes over a period of 45 years. In four cohorts of random samples of Norwegian populations with 103,881 participants, 43,731 persons had died per 31 December 2016. In total, 5,949 (14%) had died from respiratory diseases; 2,442 (41%) from lung cancer, 1,717 (29%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1,348 (23%) pneumonia, 119 (2%) asthma, 147 (2%) interstitial lung disease and 176 (3%) other pulmonary diseases. Compared with persons without respiratory symptoms the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for lung cancer deaths increased with score of breathlessness on effort and cough and phlegm, being 2.6 (95% CI 2.1-3.2) for breathlessness score 3 and 2.1 (95% CI 1.7-2.5) for cough and phlegm score 5. The HR of COPD death was 6.4 (95% CI 5.4-7.7) for breathlessness score 3 and 3.0 (2.4-3.6) for cough and phlegm score 5. Attacks of breathlessness and wheeze score 2 had a HR of 1.6 (1.4-1.9) for COPD death. The risk of pneumonia deaths increased also with higher breathlessness on effort score, but not with higher cough and phlegm score, except for score 2 with HR 1.5 (1.2-1.8). In this study with >2.4 million person-years at risk, a positive association was observed between scores of respiratory symptoms and deaths due to COPD and lung cancer. Respiratory symptoms are thus important risk factors, which should be followed thoroughly by health care practitioners for the benefit of public health."
https://openalex.org/W3216680414,"Liver cirrhosis and features of muscle or adipose tissues may affect the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). We aimed to evaluate the impact of body composition parameters and liver cirrhosis on the severity of AP in patients with alcohol-induced AP (AAP).Patients with presumed AAP who underwent CT within one week after admission were retrospectively enrolled. L3 sectional areas of abdominal fat and muscle, and mean muscle attenuations (MMAs) were quantified. The presence of liver cirrhosis was determined using clinical and CT findings. Factors potentially associated with moderately severe or severe AP were included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.A total of 242 patients (47.0 ± 12.6 years, 215 males) with presumed AAP were included. The mild and moderately severe/severe (MSS) groups included 137 (56.6%) and 105 patients (43.4%), respectively. Patients in the MSS group had higher rates of liver cirrhosis, organ failure, and local complications. Among body composition parameters, mean MMA (33.4 vs 36.8 HU, P<0.0001) and abdominal muscle mass (126.5 vs 135.1 cm2, P = 0.029) were significantly lower in the MSS group. The presence of liver cirrhosis (OR, 4.192; 95% CI, 1.620-10.848) was found to be a significant risk factor for moderately severe or severe AP by multivariable analysis.The results of this study suggest that liver cirrhosis has a significant impact on the severity of AAP. Of the body composition parameters examined, MMA and abdominal muscle mass showed potential as promising predictors."
https://openalex.org/W3216822570,"Bovine brucellosis induces abortion in cows, produces important economic losses, and causes a widely distributed zoonosis. Its eradication was achieved in several countries after sustained vaccination with the live attenuated Brucella abortus S19 vaccine, in combination with the slaughtering of serologically positive animals. S19 induces antibodies against the smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS), making difficult the differentiation of infected from vaccinated bovines. We developed an S19 strain constitutively expressing the green fluorescent protein (S19-GFP) coded in chromosome II. The S19-GFP displays similar biological characteristics and immunogenic and protective efficacies in mice to the parental S19 strain. S19-GFP can be distinguished from S19 and B. abortus field strains by fluorescence and multiplex PCR. Twenty-five heifers were vaccinated withS19-GFP (5×109 CFU) by the subcutaneous or conjunctival routes and some boosted with GFP seven weeks thereafter. Immunized animals were followed up for over three years and tested for anti-S-LPS antibodies by both the Rose Bengal test and a competitive ELISA. Anti-GFP antibodies were detected by an indirect ELISA and Western blotting. In most cases, anti-S-LPS antibodies preceded for several weeks those against GFP. The anti-GFP antibody response was higher in the GFP boosted than in the non-boosted animals. In all cases, the anti-GFP antibodies persisted longer, or at least as long, as those against S-LPS. The drawbacks and potential advantages of using the S19-GFP vaccine for identifying vaccinated animals in infected environments are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3217048679,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) comprises a heterogeneous group of neuropathies affecting upper motor neurons and causing progressive gait disorder. Mutations in the gene SPG3A/atlastin-1 (ATL1), encoding a dynamin superfamily member, which utilizes the energy from GTP hydrolysis for membrane tethering and fusion to promote the formation of a highly branched, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), account for approximately 10% of all HSP cases. The continued discovery and characterization of novel disease mutations are crucial for our understanding of HSP pathogenesis and potential treatments. Here, we report a novel disease-causing, in-frame insertion in the ATL1 gene, leading to inclusion of an additional asparagine residue at position 417 (N417ins). This mutation correlates with complex, early-onset spastic quadriplegia affecting all four extremities, generalized dystonia, and a thinning of the corpus callosum. We show using limited proteolysis and FRET-based studies that this novel insertion affects a region in the protein central to intramolecular interactions and GTPase-driven conformational change, and that this insertion mutation is associated with an aberrant prehydrolysis state. While GTPase activity remains unaffected by the insertion, membrane tethering is increased, indicative of a gain-of-function disease mechanism uncommon for ATL1-associated pathologies. In conclusion, our results identify a novel insertion mutation with altered membrane tethering activity that is associated with spastic quadriplegia, potentially uncovering a broad spectrum of molecular mechanisms that may affect neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W3217125761,"Wasting in children under-five is a form of acute malnutrition, a predictor of under-five child mortality and of increased risk of future episodes of stunting and/or wasting. In India, national estimates of wasting are high compared to international standards with one in five children found to be wasted. National surveys are complex logistical operations and most often not planned or implemented in a manner to control for seasonality. Collection of survey data across differing months across states introduces seasonal bias. Cross-sectional surveys are not designed to collect data on seasonality, thus special methods are needed to analyse the effect of data collection by month. We developed regression models to estimate the mean weight for height (WHZ), prevalence of wasting for every month of the year for an average year and an overall weighted survey estimates controlling for the socio-demographic variation of data collection across states and populations over time. National level analyses show the mean WHZ starts at its highest in January, falls to the lowest in June/August and returns towards peak at year end. The prevalence of wasting is lowest in January and doubles by June/August. After accounting for seasonal patterns in data collection across surveys, the trends are significantly different and indicate a stagnant period followed by a decline in wasting. To avoid biased estimates, direct comparisons of acute malnutrition across surveys should not be made unless seasonality bias is appropriately addressed in planning, implementation or analysis. Eliminating the seasonal variation in wasting would reduce the prevalence by half and provide guidance towards further reduction in acute malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3217258246,"Horseshoes influence how horses' hooves interact with different ground surfaces, during the impact, loading and push-off phases of a stride cycle. Consequently, they impact on the biomechanics of horses' proximal limb segments and upper body. By implication, different shoe and surface combinations could drive changes in the magnitude and stability of movement patterns in horse-jockey dyads. This study aimed to quantify centre of mass (COM) displacements in horse-jockey dyads galloping on turf and artificial tracks in four shoeing conditions: 1) aluminium; 2) barefoot; 3) GluShu; and 4) steel. Thirteen retired racehorses and two jockeys at the British Racing School were recruited for this intervention study. Tri-axial acceleration data were collected close to the COM for the horse (girth) and jockey (kidney-belt), using iPhones (Apple Inc.) equipped with an iOS app (SensorLog, sample rate = 50 Hz). Shoe-surface combinations were tested in a randomized order and horse-jockey pairings remained constant. Tri-axial acceleration data from gallop runs were filtered using bandpass Butterworth filters with cut-off frequencies of 15 Hz and 1 Hz, then integrated for displacement using Matlab. Peak displacement was assessed in both directions (positive 'maxima', negative 'minima') along the cranio-caudal (CC, positive = forwards), medio-lateral (ML, positive = right) and dorso-ventral (DV, positive = up) axes for all strides with frequency ≥2 Hz (mean = 2.06 Hz). Linear mixed-models determined whether surfaces, shoes or shoe-surface interactions (fixed factors) significantly affected the displacement patterns observed, with day, run and horse-jockey pairs included as random factors; significance was set at p<0.05. Data indicated that surface-type significantly affected peak COM displacements in all directions for the horse (p<0.0005) and for all directions (p≤0.008) but forwards in the jockey. The largest differences were observed in the DV-axis, with an additional 5.7 mm and 2.5 mm of downwards displacement for the horse and jockey, respectively, on the artificial surface. Shoeing condition significantly affected all displacement parameters except ML-axis minima for the horse (p≤0.007), and all displacement parameters for the jockey (p<0.0005). Absolute differences were again largest vertically, with notable similarities amongst displacements from barefoot and aluminium trials compared to GluShu and steel. Shoe-surface interactions affected all but CC-axis minima for the jockey (p≤0.002), but only the ML-axis minima and maxima and DV-axis maxima for the horse (p≤0.008). The results support the idea that hoof-surface interface interventions can significantly affect horse and jockey upper-body displacements. Greater sink of hooves on impact, combined with increased push-off during the propulsive phase, could explain the higher vertical displacements on the artificial track. Variations in distal limb mass associated with shoe-type may drive compensatory COM displacements to minimize the energetic cost of movement. The artificial surface and steel shoes provoked the least CC-axis movement of the jockey, so may promote greatest stability. However, differences between horse and jockey mean displacements indicated DV-axis and CC-axis offsets with compensatory increases and decreases, suggesting the dyad might operate within displacement limits to maintain stability. Further work is needed to relate COM displacements to hoof kinematics and to determine whether there is an optimum configuration of COM displacement to optimise performance and minimise injury."
https://openalex.org/W3214779321,"The circadian gene expression rhythmicity drives diurnal oscillations of physiological processes that may determine the injury response. While outcomes of various acute injuries are affected by the time of day at which the original insult occurred, such influences on recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) are unknown. We report that mice receiving moderate, T9 contusive SCI at ZT0 (zeitgeber time 0, time of lights on) and ZT12 (time of lights off) showed similar hindlimb function recovery in the Basso mouse scale (BMS) over a 6 week post-injury period. In an independent study, no significant differences in BMS were observed after SCI at ZT18 vs. ZT6. However, the ladder walking test revealed modestly improved performance for ZT18 vs. ZT6 mice at week 6 after injury. Consistent with those minor effects on functional recovery, terminal histological analysis revealed no significant differences in white matter sparing at the injury epicenter. Likewise, blood-spinal cord barrier disruption and neuroinflammation appeared similar when analyzed at 1 week post injury at ZT6 or ZT18. Therefore, locomotor recovery after thoracic contusive SCI is not substantively modulated by the time of day at which the neurotrauma occurred."
https://openalex.org/W3215016419,"Wireless networks are among the fundamental technologies used to connect people. Considering the constant advancements in the field, telecommunication operators must guarantee a high-quality service to keep their customer portfolio. To ensure this high-quality service, it is common to establish partnerships with specialized technology companies that deliver software services in order to monitor the networks and identify faults and respective solutions. A common barrier faced by these specialized companies is the lack of data to develop and test their products. This paper investigates the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are state-of-the-art generative models, for generating synthetic telecommunication data related to Wi-Fi signal quality. We developed, trained, and compared two of the most used GAN architectures: the Vanilla GAN and the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Both models presented satisfactory results and were able to generate synthetic data similar to the real ones. In particular, the distribution of the synthetic data overlaps the distribution of the real data for all of the considered features. Moreover, the considered generative models can reproduce the same associations observed for the synthetic features. We chose the WGAN as the final model, but both models are suitable for addressing the problem at hand."
https://openalex.org/W3215023436,"A highly reduced extrinsic pathway coagulation model (8 ODEs) under flow considered a thin 15-micron platelet layer where transport limitations were largely negligible (except for fibrinogen) and where cofactors (FVIIa, FV, FVIII) were not rate-limiting. By including thrombin feedback activation of FXI and the antithrombin-I activities of fibrin, the model accurately simulated measured fibrin formation and thrombin fluxes. Using this reduced model, we conducted 10,000 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for ±50% variation of 5 plasma zymogens and 2 fibrin binding sites for thrombin. A sensitivity analysis of zymogen concentrations indicated that FIX activity most influenced thrombin generation, a result expected from hemophilia A and B. Averaging all MC simulations confirmed both the mean and standard deviation of measured fibrin generation on 1 tissue factor (TF) molecule per μm 2 . Across all simulations, free thrombin in the layer ranged from 20 to 300 nM (mean: 50 nM). The top 2% of simulations that produced maximal fibrin were dominated by conditions with low antithrombin-I activity (decreased weak and strong sites) and high FIX concentration. In contrast, the bottom 2% of simulations that produced minimal fibrin were dominated by low FIX and FX. The percent reduction of fibrin by an ideal FXIa inhibitor (FXI = 0) ranged from 71% fibrin reduction in the top 2% of MC simulations to only 34% fibrin reduction in the bottom 2% of MC simulations. Thus, the antithrombotic potency of FXIa inhibitors may vary depending on normal ranges of zymogen concentrations. This reduced model allowed efficient multivariable sensitivity analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3215900266,"Loss of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a biomarker of a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype and is related to progression, metastasis, and poor outcomes in several cancers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (OvCa). Epithelial and stromal Cav-1 expression were quantified in serous OvCa and benign ovarian tissue in two, independent cohorts-one quantified expression using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the other using multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) with digital image analysis designed to target CAF-specific expression. Cav-1 expression was significantly downregulated in OvCa stroma compared to non-neoplastic stroma using both the IHC (p = 0.002) and IF (p = 1.8x10-13) assays. OvCa stroma showed Cav-1 downregulation compared to tumor epithelium with IHC (p = 1.2x10-24). Conversely, Cav-1 expression was higher in OvCa stroma compared to tumor epithelium with IF (p = 0.002). There was moderate correlation between IHC and IF methods for stromal Cav-1 expression (r2 = 0.69, p = 0.006) whereas there was no correlation for epithelial expression (r2 = 0.006, p = 0.98). Irrespective of the staining assay, neither response to therapy or overall survival correlated with the expression level of Cav-1 in the stroma or tumor epithelium. Our findings demonstrate a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression in ovarian serous carcinomas. Studies are needed to replicate these findings and explore therapeutic implications, particularly for immunotherapy response."
https://openalex.org/W3215925109,"With the continuing increase in online communications, virtual proximity as well as physical proximity has become a common way to connect individuals. Virtual proximity refers to the psychological closeness felt by people based on their participation in a virtual space. Hence, augmenting physical proximity with virtual types is believed to enhance connectivity within social networks, and applications that consider both types have the capability to provide new forms of interaction. However, despite the importance of their coexistence, these proximity concepts have been studied separately or are being integrated using diverse terminologies that often lead to misunderstandings. Furthermore, although some applications reflect the two proximity types (e.g., location-based services), there is no metric of comparison. This paper proposes the concept of augmented proximity (AP), which combines physical and virtual forms into a network analogous to one of mixed reality (MR). The concept provides a clear distinction between physical and virtual proximity using a single quantitative value. Using this concept, a formal taxonomy is established to compare and evaluate AP-based networks. The taxonomy consists of three dimensions that can be analyzed using graph theory, including the extent of connectivity degree, diffusion effect, and extent of perceived closeness. Furthermore, using the services underlying AP-based network, the proposed taxonomy can be applied to evaluate the suitability of the services as an indicator for comparison. The results show that one of the two services has a higher taxonomy-based value, and a reasonable basis for selecting one based on proximity is established. This study suggests that AP will play an important role as a quantitative indicator in developing and comparing applications that consider proximity in both virtual and physical modes."
https://openalex.org/W3216118287,"Switching from the healthy stage to the uncontrolled development of tumors relies on complicated mechanisms and the activation of antagonistic immune responses, that can ultimately favor the tumor growth. We introduce here a mathematical model intended to describe the interactions between the immune system and tumors. The model is based on partial differential equations, describing the displacement of immune cells subjected to both diffusion and chemotactic mechanisms, the strength of which is driven by the development of the tumors. The model takes into account the dual nature of the immune response, with the activation of both antitumor and protumor mechanisms. The competition between these antagonistic effects leads to either equilibrium or escape phases, which reproduces features of tumor development observed in experimental and clinical settings. Next, we consider on numerical grounds the efficacy of treatments: the numerical study brings out interesting hints on immunotherapy strategies, concerning the role of the administered dose, the role of the administration time and the interest in combining treatments acting on different aspects of the immune response. Such mathematical model can shed light on the conditions where the tumor can be maintained in a viable state and also provide useful hints for personalized, efficient, therapeutic strategies, boosting the antitumor immune response, and reducing the protumor actions."
https://openalex.org/W3216060482,"It is well known that numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) closely relate to the physiological and pathological processes of human diseases and can serves as potential biomarkers. Therefore, lncRNA-disease associations that are identified by computational methods as the targeted candidates reduce the cost of biological experiments focusing on deep study furtherly. However, inaccurate construction of similarity networks and inadequate numbers of observed known lncRNA-disease associations, such inherent problems make many mature computational methods that have been developed for many years still exit some limitations. It motivates us to explore a new computational method that was fused with KATZ measure and space projection to fast probing potential lncRNA-disease associations (namely KATZSP). KATZSP is comprised of following key steps: combining all the global information with which to change Boolean network of known lncRNA-disease associations into the weighted networks; changing the similarities calculation into counting the number of walks that connect lncRNA nodes and disease nodes in bipartite graphs; obtaining the space projection scores to refine the primary prediction scores. The process to fuse KATZ measure and space projection was simplified and uncomplicated with needing only one attenuation factor. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) experimental results showed that, compared with other state-of-the-art methods (NCPLDA, LDAI-ISPS and IIRWR), KATZSP had a higher predictive accuracy shown with area-under-the-curve (AUC) value on the three datasets built, while KATZSP well worked on inferring potential associations related to new lncRNAs (or isolated diseases). The results from real cases study (such as pancreas cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer) further confirmed that KATZSP is capable of superior predictive ability to be applied as a guide for traditional biological experiments."

The Bayesian estimators are obtained using two objective priors know as Jeffreys and reference priors. We proved that obtained reference prior is also a matching prior for both parameters, i.e., the credibility intervals have accurate frequentist coverage, while the Jeffreys prior returns unbiased estimates for the parameters.

https://openalex.org/W3216567257,"To examine the usefulness of red channel fundus imaging to detect the ischemic status in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).Ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus images were obtained from 42 eyes with CRVO. Twenty-one eyes were ischemic, and 21 eyes were non-ischemic. Rubeosis was found in 11 ischemic eyes. UWF images were split into red and green channels using ImageJ software. Both the color and red channel images were used to predict the presence or absence of ischemia when examined by masked graders. The sensitivity and specificity of UWF imagings for the detection of ischemia were calculated in Group A (total 42 eyes), Group B (32 eyes excluding non-rubeotic ischemic CRVO) and Group C (31 eyes excluding rubeotic ischemic CRVO), respectively. Moreover, a linear mixed model was conducted to investigate the relationship between the type of images and the accuracy of prediction in each group.No significant difference in the sensitivity of color fundus imaging was seen between Group A and Group B. By contrast, a significant difference in the sensitivity of red channel imaging was seen between Group A and Group B (p = 0.031). The accuracies of the predictions were not associated with the type of image in Group A and Group B, but were significantly associated in Group C (p = 0.026).UWF red channel imaging enabled more accurate detection of the ischemic status, compared with color fundus images, especially in non-rubeotic CRVO eyes."

However, studies exploring the determinants of EIBF and prelacteal feeding are limited in Ghana. The study was conducted to assess the prevalence and determinants of EIBF and prelacteal feeding in Northern Ghana.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 508 mothers with infants aged 0-24 months in the Sagnarigu Municipality of Northern Ghana. The quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from Ghana's demographic and health survey. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent determinants of EIBF and prelacteal feeding.The prevalence of EIBF and prelacteal feeding was 72% and 21%, respectively. The independent positive determinants of EIBF were partner support to breastfeed [adjusted Odds ratio (AOR): 1.86, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.09-3.17] and exposure to breastfeeding information during pregnancy (AOR = 1.63 (95% CI: 1.01-2.64). Lower odds of EIBF were observed among mothers from extended family (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41-0.95). Regarding prelacteal feeding, negative determinants were having a normal weight baby (AOR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27-0.90), exposure to breastfeeding information during pregnancy (AOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.92), while experiencing delayed onset of lactation was a risk factor for prelacteal feeding practice (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.41-3.94).In this study, EIBF was slightly higher than the 2030 global target on EIBF with widespread prelacteal feeding practice. Health programs aimed at improving EIBF should focus on the women partners, nutrition counselling, and support to mothers from the extended family. In the same vein, programs aimed at discouraging prelacteal feeding practice should also target women at risk, such as those with low birthweight babies and women experiencing delayed lactation onset."

The study participants were categorized according to whether they lived alone, which was confirmed via questionnaire, and had cognitive impairment, which was defined as having a Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese score ≤23. Nutritional status was evaluated using the serum albumin level. The fat-free mass index (FFMI) was calculated based on anthropometric and body composition measurements. A logistic regression model with the outcome of a low serum albumin level (serum albumin <4 g/dL) and low FFMI (<16 kg/m2 in men and <14 kg/m2 in women) were used to analyze the data.The percentages of participants in the living alone (-)/cognitive impairment (-) group, the living alone (+)/cognitive impairment (-) group, the living alone (-)/cognitive impairment (+) group, and the living alone (+)/cognitive impairment (+) group were 54.8%, 37.3%, 5.6%, and 2.3%, respectively. Compared to the living alone (-)/cognitive impairment (-) group, the living alone (+)/cognitive impairment (+) group was more likely to have a low serum albumin level (adjusted odds ratio = 3.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.31 to 7.33) and low FFMI (adjusted odds ratio = 2.79, 95% confidence interval = 1.10 to 7.06) after adjusting for potential confounders.Cognitively impaired older adults living alone had poorer nutrition than cognitively normal and cohabitating persons in this study.

https://openalex.org/W3217806731,"The clinical features by declining lung function remain uncharacterized in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) patients. We investigated the clinical characteristics of CPA patients based on spirometric impairments (restrictive spirometric pattern [RSP] and obstructive spirometric pattern [OSP]) and their severity. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of CPA patients who underwent pulmonary function tests from March 2017 to February 2020. We used Global Lung Initiative 2012 equations with lower limit of normal. The clinical characteristics of patients with RSP were compared to those with OSP. Additionally, RSP patients' characteristics were analyzed according to forced vital capacity (FVC) tertile, and OSP patients' characteristics were analyzed according to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) tertile. Among the 112 patients with CPA (52 [46%] with RSP and 60 [54%] with OSP), body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with RSP than in those with OSP (17.6 kg/m2 versus 20.3 kg/m2; P = 0.003), and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease was more frequently observed in patients with RSP than in those with OSP (28.8% versus 11.7%; P = 0.004). Additionally, for patients with RSP, younger age and bilateral pulmonary lesions were more frequently observed in the first tertile group than in the other groups (P for trend: 0.025 and 0.001, respectively). For patients with OSP, low BMI, paracavitary infiltrates, and elevated WBC count were more frequently observed in the first tertile group than in the other groups (P for trend: < 0.001, 0.011, and 0.041, respectively). Differences in the clinical features of CPA patients were identified according to heterogeneous spirometric patterns and their severity.

https://openalex.org/W3192494051,"The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (Rhizophagus intraradices) in the amelioration of the water deficit-mediated negative influence on the growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidant system in Euonymus maackii Rupr. was examined. E. maackii seedlings were subjected to 5 water deficit levels, soil water contents of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% field capacity (FC), and 2 inoculation treatments, with and without AM inoculation. The water deficit increasingly limited the seedling height, biomass accumulation in shoots and roots, chlorophyll content, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with an increasing water deficit level. In addition, water deficit stimulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), in both shoots and roots, except under 20% FC conditions. E. maackii seedlings under all water deficit conditions formed symbiosis well with AM fungi, which significantly ameliorated the drought-mediated negative effect, especially under 40% and 60% FC conditions. Under 40% to 80% FC conditions, AM formation improved seedling growth and photosynthesis by significantly enhancing the biomass accumulation, chlorophyll content and assimilation. Mycorrhizal seedlings showed better tolerance and less sensitivity to a water deficit, reflected in the lower SOD activities of shoots and roots and CAT activity of shoots under 40% and 60% FC conditions. Downregulation of the antioxidant system in mycorrhizal seedlings suggested better maintenance of redox homeostasis and protection of metabolism, including biomass accumulation and assimilation. All the results advocated the positive role of R. intraradices inoculation in E. maackii against a water deficit, especially under 40% FC, which suggested the distinct AM performance in drought tolerance and the potential role of the combination of E. maackii-AM fungi in ecological restoration in arid regions."
https://openalex.org/W3215521550,"Light fidelity (LiFi) uses different forms of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), including DC biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM). In DCO-OFDM, the use of a large DC bias causes optical power inefficiency, while a small bias leads to higher clipping noise. Hence, finding an appropriate DC bias level for DCO-OFDM is important. This paper applies machine learning (ML) algorithms to find optimum DC-bias value for DCO-OFDM based LiFi systems. For this, a dataset is generated for DCO-OFDM using MATLAB tool. Next, ML algorithms are applied using Python programming language. ML is used to find the important attributes of DCO-OFDM that influence the optimum DC bias. It is shown here that the optimum DC bias is a function of several factors including, the minimum, the standard deviation, and the maximum value of the bipolar OFDM signal, and the constellation size. Next, linear and polynomial regression algorithms are successfully applied to predict the optimum DC bias value. Results show that polynomial regression of order 2 can predict the optimum DC bias value with a coefficient of determination of 96.77% which confirms the effectiveness of the prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3215746673,"In this paper, a mathematical model based on spherical differential unit cell is proposed as a model for studying seasonal freeze-thaw soil space infinitesimal differential unit cell. From this model, the basic equations of permafrost moisture and heat flow motion are directly derived, then the linked equations form the permafrost water-heat coupled transport model. On this basis, the one-dimensional seasonal permafrost water-heat transport equation is derived. The model reduces the original spatial three-variable coordinate system (parallel hexahedron) into a coupled equation with a single spherical radius (R) as the independent variable, so the iterations of the numerical simulation algorithm is greatly reduced and the complexity is decreased. Finally, the model is used to simulate the seasonal freeze-thaw soil in the ShiHeZi region of Xinjiang, China. The principle of the simulation is to collect the soil temperature and humidity values of the region in layers and fixed-points using a homemade freeze-thaw soil sensor, after that we solve it by numerical calculation using MATLAB. The analysis results show that the maximum relative error of the model we proposed is 4.36, the minimum error is 0.98, and the average error is 2.515. The numerical simulation results are basically consistent with the measured data, then the proposed model is consistent with the matching states of permafrost moisture content and soil temperature in the region at different times. In addition, the experiments also demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3216800233,"Since the 1990s, universities have faced a push toward output commercialization that has been seen as a potential threat to the public science model. Much less attention has been given to the enduring nature of internal organizational features in academia and how they shape the pursuit of traditional scholarly activities. This article exploits four waves of representative, random-sample survey evidence from agricultural and life science faculty at the 52 major U.S. land-grant universities, spanning 1989-2015, to examine faculty attitudes/preferences, tenure and promotion criteria, output, and funding sources. Our findings demonstrate that faculty attitudes toward scientific research have remained remarkably stable over twenty-five years in strongly favoring intrinsic and public science goals over commercial or extrinsic goals. We also demonstrate the faculty's positive attitudes toward science, an increased pressure to publish in top journals and secure increasingly competitive grants, as well as declining time for science. These trends suggest a reconsideration of university commercialization strategies and a recommitment of universities and their state and federal funders toward fostering public agricultural and life science research."
https://openalex.org/W3217550694,"As part of significant mental health reform, the Community Mental Health Rehabilitation Service (CMHRS) was implemented in rural South Australia. The CMHRS is a 10-bed mental health residential program offering rehabilitative mental health support to rural residents.To analyse the CMHRS service delivery model and its impact on recovery outcomes for consumers.A mixed method, realist evaluation approach was utilised. A purposive sample of CMHRS staff (n = 6) and consumers (n = 8) were recruited. Consumer recovery was measured using the RAS-DS (on admission and discharge). Participants' perspectives of the service were gained via one staff focus group (n = 6) and individual semi-structured interviews (consumers n = 6; staff n = 2). Pre-post RAS-DS scores were analysed using paired t-tests/Wilcoxon paired-signed rank test, with qualitative data analysed thematically.Significant positive increases in RAS-DS total scores were observed at discharge, supported by the qualitative themes of (re)building relationships and social connections and recovering health and wellbeing. Contextual factors (e.g. staffing) and program mechanisms (e.g. scheduling) impacting on service implementation were identified.Maintaining a rehabilitation recovery-focused approach, balanced with an appropriately trained multi-disciplinary team, are vital for maximising positive consumer outcomes.This realist evaluation identifies critical factors impacting rural mental health rehabilitation service delivery."
