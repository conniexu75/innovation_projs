https://openalex.org/W2053091009,"Survey questions often probe respondents for quantitative facts about events in their past: ""During the last 2 weeks, on days when you drank liquor, about how many drinks did you have?"" ""During the past 12 months, how many visits did you make to a dentist?"" ""When did you last work at a full-time job?"" are all examples from national surveys. Although questions like these make an implicit demand to remember and enumerate specific autobiographical episodes, respondents frequently have trouble complying because of limits on their ability to recall. In these situations, respondents resort to inferences that use partial information from memory to construct a numeric answer. Results from cognitive psychology can be useful in understanding and investigating these phenomena. In particular, cognitive research can help in identifying situations that inhibit or facilitate recall and can reveal inferences that affect the accuracy of respondents' answers."

By in situ hybridization histochemistry, IGF I (somatomedin C) and IGF II messenger RNAs were localized to connective tissues or cells of mesenchymal origin in 14 organs and tissues from human fetuses. IGF messenger RNAs were localized to perisinusoidal cells of liver, to perichondrium of cartilage, to sclera of eye, and to connective tissue layers, sheaths, septa, and capsules of each organ and tissue. All of the hybridizing regions are comprised predominantly of fibroblasts or other cells of mesenchymal origin. Because these cells are widely distributed and anatomically integrated into tissues and organs, they are ideally located for production of IGFs, which may exert paracrine effects on nearby target cells."

The gene is expressed at high levels in the original tumor and its derived cell line and is located at chromosome 12 position (q13 to q14.3). The gli gene is a member of a select group of cellular genes that are genetically altered in primary human tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1981348164,"This review discusses reasons why animal cancer tests cannot be used to predict absolute human risks. Such tests, however, may be used to indicate that some chemicals might be of greater concern than others. Possible hazards to humans from a variety of rodent carcinogens are ranked by an index that relates the potency of each carcinogen in rodents to the exposure in humans. This ranking suggests that carcinogenic hazards from current levels of pesticide residues or water pollution are likely to be of minimal concern relative to the background levels of natural substances, though one cannot say whether these natural exposures are likely to be of major or minor importance."
https://openalex.org/W295780,"The x-ray crystallographic structure of the heterodimeric plant toxin ricin has been determined at 2.8-A resolution. The A chain enzyme is a globular protein with extensive secondary structure and a reasonably prominent cleft assumed to be the active site. The B chain lectin folds into two topologically similar domains, each binding lactose in a shallow cleft. In each site a glutamine residue forms a hydrogen bond to the OH-4 of galactose, accounting for the epimerimic specificity of binding. The interface between the A and B chains shows some hydrophobic contacts in which proline and phenylalanine side chains play a prominent role."
https://openalex.org/W1648812418,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a biologically active phospholipid synthesized by a variety of cell types upon appropriate stimulation. PAF is a potent hypotensive factor and it activates platelets and inflammatory cells at concentrations as low as 10(-10) M. Removal of the acetyl moiety at the sn-2 position abolishes the biological activity and this reaction is catalyzed by a specific acetylhydrolase present in plasma and animal tissues. Ultracentrifugation in density gradients showed that 30% of the activity is associated with high density lipoproteins and 70% with low density lipoproteins. We have purified the plasma low density lipoprotein-associated activity to near homogeneity using a rapid assay based on the separation of [3H]acetate from 1-O-alkyl-2-[3H]acetyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine on disposable reversed-phase columns. The enzyme was purified by 25,000-fold and approximately 10% of the starting activity was recovered. Plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase has an apparent molecular weight of 43,000, does not require calcium, has preference for micellar versus monomeric substrate, and exhibits surface dilution kinetics. The purified protein has an apparent Km of 13.7 microM and a Vmax of 568 mumol/h/mg with micellar PAF. It can act both on 1-O-alkyl and 1-acyl substrates and on ethanolamine analogs of PAF. However, the enzyme has a marked preference for the sn-2 acetyl residue and therefore can be considered as a specific PAF-acetylhydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W2035046572,"A new class of excitatory premotor interneurons that are important in the generation of locomotion in the lamprey has now been described. In the isolated spinal cord, these neurons act simultaneously with their postsynaptic motoneurons during fictive swimming. They are small and numerous, and they monosynaptically excite both motoneurons and inhibitory premotor interneurons. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials are depressed by an antagonist of excitatory amino acids. These interneurons receive reticulospinal input from the brain stem and polysynaptic input form skin afferents. A model of the network underlying locomotion based on the synaptic interactions of these neurons can now be proposed for the lamprey."

https://openalex.org/W2030315227,"Transcriptional enhancement is a general mechanism for regulation of gene expression in which particular proteins bound to specific DNA sequences stimulate the efficiency of initiation from linked promoters. One such protein, the glucocorticoid receptor, mediates enhancement in a glucocorticoid hormone-dependent manner. In this study, a region of the 795-amino acid rat glucocorticoid receptor that is active in transcriptional enhancement was identified. The active region was defined by expressing various receptor deletion mutants in stably and transiently transfected cells and examining the regulated transcription of hormone-responsive genes. Mutant receptors lacking as many as 439 amino-terminal amino acids retained activity, as did those with as many as 270 carboxyl-terminal amino acids deleted. This suggests that the 86-amino acid segment between the most extensive terminal deletions, which also includes sequences required for specific DNA binding in vitro, is sufficient for enhancer activation. In fact, a 150-amino acid receptor fragment that encompasses this segment mediates constitutive enhancement."

https://openalex.org/W2087197097,"To investigate whether the temporal cortex of a nonprimate species contains cells responsive to the sight of faces, a study was made in conscious sheep of the responses of neurons in this brain region to the sight of faces. Of 561 cells from which responses were recorded, 40 responded preferentially to faces. Different categories of these cells were influenced by dominance (presumably indicated by the presence and size of horns), breed and familiarity, and threatening faces such as those of humans and dogs. These results demonstrate that cells that respond preferentially to faces are present in the temporal cortex of a nonprimate species, and that the responses of these cells are influenced by factors relevant to social interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1993212786,"We have isolated a gene that is very rapidly induced at the transcriptional level by DIF--a low molecular weight, diffusible factor necessary for stalk cell differentiation in Dictyostelium cells developing in vitro. The gene encodes a protein containing an N-terminal signal peptide preceding approximately 70 tandem repeats of a highly conserved 24 amino acid sequence with a high cysteine content. These features suggest it is an extracellular structural protein. During normal development, the gene is maximally expressed in the slug, in which the mRNA is very highly enriched in prestalk over prespore cells. The gene is not detectably expressed until the tipped aggregate stage, several hours later than prespore genes, suggesting that prespore cell differentiation precedes prestalk cell differentiation. The demonstration that DIF induces a gene normally only expressed in the prestalk zone of the slug provides strong evidence that DIF is a Dictyostelium morphogen."
https://openalex.org/W1988456383,"The increases in the intracellular concentrations of inorganic phosphate and hydrogen ion accompanying fatigue of skeletal muscle appear to be the most important metabolic changes associated with the decrease in contractile force. Experiments on chemically skinned single fibers from rabbit psoas muscle with pH ranging between 6 and 7.25 demonstrate that the depression of maximal calcium-activated force by inorganic phosphate correlates nicely with the concentration of the acidic (diprotonated) species. Therefore, in addition to the well-known depressant effect on the contractile machinery of lowering pH per se, any decrease of intracellular pH associated with fatigue further depresses force production by converting more of the total inorganic phosphate within the cell to the inhibitory diprotonated form."

https://openalex.org/W2016683567,"S-49 mouse lymphoma cells undergo lysis when treated with glucocorticoids; the mechanism of this effect is not understood. A protein was detected in the plasma membrane of these cells by means of direct immunofluorescent labeling with a monoclonal antibody to the soluble glucocorticoid receptor. Cellular heterogeneity in the content of this glucocorticoid receptor-like molecule was evident. By immunoadsorption to antibody-coated tissue culture plates, the cells were separated into populations positive (100%) and depleted (38%) for this membrane antigen. Gel electrophoresis, specific immunoblot, and autoradiographic (binding of [3H]dexamethasone mesylate) analysis of the membrane proteins from the membrane antigen-positive group revealed multiple protein bands ranging in size from 85 to 145 kilodaltons. Furthermore, comparison of the glucocorticoid sensitivity of these groups of cells showed complete lysis of the membrane antigen-positive cells and only partial lysis of the antigen-deficient group, which suggests that the lysis response of cells to glucocorticoids is mediated by a glucocorticoid receptor-like molecule located in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1996017319,"A recently developed assay for somatic cell mutations was used to study survivors of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. This assay measures the frequency of variant erythrocytes produced by erythroid precursor cells with mutations that result in a loss of gene expression at the polymorphic glycophorin A (GPA) locus. Significant linear relations between variant frequency (VF) and radiation exposure were observed for three different variant cell phenotypes. The spontaneous and induced VFs agree with previous measurements of radiation-induced mutagenesis in other systems; this evidence supports a mutational origin for variant cells characterized by a loss of GPA expression and suggests that the GPA assay system may provide a cumulative dosimeter of past radiation exposures. VFs for some survivors differ dramatically from the calculated dose response, and these deviations appear to result primarily from statistical fluctuations in the number of mutations in the stem-cell pool. These fluctuations allow one to estimate the number of long-lived hemopoietic stem cells in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1546585911,"Etioplasts of 4.5-day-old dark-grown barley synthesize and accumulate most of the membrane and nearly all the soluble polypeptides of mature chloroplasts of light-grown seedlings. Etioplasts do not synthesize a limited set of chloroplast-encoded polypeptides which are major constituents of chloroplast thylakoid membranes: two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I (68 and 65 kDa), two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem II (47 and 43 kDa), and a 32-kDa polypeptide which has now been identified as the psbA gene product. Throughout development in the dark, etioplasts were unable to synthesize the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and II or the psbA gene product despite the presence of significant transcript levels for psbA and psaA-psaB (encode for photosystem I chlorophyll apoproteins). Light was not required for the synthesis of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit with the highest rate of large subunit synthesis occurring in young dark-grown seedlings. Illumination of 4.5-day-old dark-grown barley rapidly induced the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins and the psbA gene product at a time when transcript levels for psbA and psaA-psaB did not increase appreciably. Therefore, during the early stages of light-induced development the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and psbA gene product is regulated at the translational level. With continued chloroplast development in the light, the synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I and II decline rapidly as does the synthesis of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. The decline in polypeptide synthesis correlated with a decline in rbcL and psaA-psaB transcript levels and a light-dependent decline in plastid rRNA content. In contrast, synthesis of the psbA gene product was maintained throughout light-induced chloroplast development which correlated with the maintenance of psbA transcript levels. However, light is not strictly required for psbA transcript accumulation since psbA transcript levels increased slightly with continued plastid development in dark-grown seedlings."

It permits electron microscopic visualization of single antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fab') by covalently linking an 11-atom gold cluster to a specific residue on each Fab' such that the antigenic specificity and capacity are preserved. The distance of the gold cluster from the antigen is a maximum of 5.0 nanometers when the undecagold-Fab' probe is used as an immunolabel."
https://openalex.org/W1971165489,"Many mutations leading to human disease are the result of single DNA base pair changes that cannot be identified by Southern analysis. This has prompted the development of alternative assays for point mutation detection. The recently described ribonuclease A cleavage procedure, with a polyuridylic acid-paper affinity chromatography step, has been used to identify the mutational lesions in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) messenger RNAs of patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Distinctive ribonuclease A cleavage patterns were identified in messenger RNA from 5 of 14 Lesch-Nyhan patients who were chosen because no HPRT Southern or Northern blotting pattern changes had been found. This approach now allows HPRT mutation detection in 50 percent of the cases of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The polyuridylic acid-paper affinity procedure provides a general method for analysis of low abundance messenger RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1509409430,"Levels of transferrin mRNA were measured by hybridization to transferrin cDNA in extracts from various areas of rat brain and other tissues. The highest concentrations of transferrin mRNA were found in the liver and the choroid plexus of the lateral and third ventricles. Lower concentrations were observed in the medulla and thalamus, choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum, pituitary, testis, placenta, stomach, spleen, kidney, muscle, and heart. Yolk sac, small intestine, and adrenal glands did not contain detectable transferrin mRNA levels. The size of transferrin mRNA was the same in liver, brain, and testis. Upon incubation of choroid plexus pieces with [14C]leucine in vitro, about 4% of the radioactive protein secreted into the medium was found to be transferrin. Together with previous data (Dickson, P.W., Howlett, G.J., and Schreiber, G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8214-8219; Dickson, P.W., Aldred, A.R., Marley, P.D., Bannister, D., and Schreiber (1986) J.

https://openalex.org/W1966127363,"A cycloheximide-sensitive protein responsive to adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate has been postulated to participate in the regulation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity in steroidogenic tissues. Such a steroidogenesis activator polypeptide (SAP) had been isolated from rat adrenocortical tissue and partially characterized. Now a polypeptide with comparable chromatographic behavior and biological activity has been purified from the rat H-540 Leydig cell tumor in quantities sufficient for amino acid sequencing. The activator contains 30 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 3215. The synthetic construct based on this sequence is virtually equipotent with native H-540 tumor SAP in an adrenal mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage assay. Hormonal regulation of the intracellular concentration of this activator may control the rate of cholesterol metabolism in steroidogenic organs."

https://openalex.org/W2078492018,"Environmental policy-making has become more dependent on formal, quantitative risk assessment because of increasing attention to the prevention of human health damage from toxic chemicals. Risk assessment helps set priorities for regulation of the very large numbers of chemicals that are of potential concern and helps direct limited social and government resources against the most significant risks. Although the scientific basis for risk assessment is often uncertain and the public and its representatives have often been confused by its use in regulatory decisions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently uses a variety of risk assessment techniques to set priorities, tailor regulations, and make decisions at particular sites. The Environmental Protection Agency also attempts to make the practice of risk assessment more consistent throughout the agency and to improve public understanding of the meaning of risk assessment and risk management."
https://openalex.org/W1532200755,"Abstract Sustained flight in the moth, Manduca sexta, necessitates lipid mobilization and transport to flight muscle, a process mediated by the adipokinetic hormone. An adult specific high density lipophorin (lipoprotein, HDLp-A, Mr = 7.68 X 10(5)) accepts diacylglycerol from the fat body, increasing in size and decreasing in density, to give a low density lipophorin (lipoprotein, LDLp, Mr = 1.56 X 10(6)). During this process, several molecules of the small apolipoprotein, apolipophorin III (apoLp-III), are added to the two molecules originally present in HDLp-A. A study of the time course of adipokinetic hormone-induced loading of diacylglycerol onto HDLp-A, using the analytical ultracentrifuge and gel filtration, suggests that a lipoprotein of density intermediate between HDLp-A and LDLp was formed transiently. Analysis of lipoproteins separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation in the course of the loading process indicates that apoLp-III is added more rapidly than diacylglycerol and that it changes its conformation on the surface as more diacylglycerol is added. Taken together with the known properties of apoLp-III, a prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of 3, we suggest that initially apoLp-III adds to the expanded hydrophobic surface of the lipoprotein with its short axis parallel to the surface and that apoLp-III subsequently unfolds to cover a greater area of hydrophobic surface. Exchange experiments with labeled apoLp-III showed that the two apoLp-III molecules in HDLp-A do not exchange with free apoLp-III, even when the lipoprotein passed through a loading and unloading cycle, suggesting a structural role for apoLp-III in HDLp-A."
https://openalex.org/W2061146036,"Although certain gold [Au(I)] compounds have been used effectively in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for some years, the molecular basis for such therapeutic action has been unclear. One possible mechanism of the action of Au(I) compounds is that they protect unsaturated membrane lipids and proteins against oxidative degradation caused by activated phagocytes that are not properly regulated. In this study it has been shown that superoxide ion (O-2.), a product of activated phagocytes, can be oxidized to electronically excited singlet oxygen (O12Δg), an agent that is capable of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acid derivatives. It has also been shown that antiarthritic Au(I) compounds are effective deactivators of O12Δg with quenching constants on the order of 107 M-1 sec-1."
https://openalex.org/W1995281747,"Knowing the nature and magnitude of health and safety risks is helpful in setting priorities as well as in making decisions about pursuing recreational activities, foods, jobs, and other aspects of everyday living. ""Risk-risk"" situations require a choice among risky alternatives. ""How safe"" situations involve a more general choice as to how much of other desired activities to sacrifice for increased safety. ""How safe"" situations are inherently more difficult to manage, because they are subject to fuzzy thinking and rhetoric. The large uncertainties of current estimates must be conveyed explicitly to arrive at sensible decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2164069060,"We have investigated the influence of transmembrane pH gradients across large unilamellar vesicle membranes on the transbilayer distributions of simple lipids with weak base and weak acid characteristics. Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid labeling results consistent with a rapid and complete migration of stearylamine and sphingosine to the inner monolayer of the large unilamellar vesicles are observed when the large unilamellar vesicles' interior is acidic. Alternatively, when the vesicle interior is basic, oleic and stearic acid cannot be removed by external bovine serum albumin, indicating a localization in the inner monolayer. Moreover, effects corresponding to the decrease in external surface charge predicted upon the migration of stearylamine or stearic acid to the inner monolayer are readily detected employing ion exchange chromatography. These results are consistent with transbilayer distributions of these agents dictated by a Henderson-Hasselbach equilibrium. The possible implications for metabolic regulation by pH gradients, as well as factors giving rise to phospholipid transbilayer asymmetry, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1539050811,"We have investigated the steps by which retinol, released from plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP), enters the cells and is accumulated for the most part as a retinyl-ester, only a small fraction of it being present as a complex with cytoplasmic retinol-binding protein (CRBP). For this purpose, we have developed a cell-free system composed of plasma membrane-enriched fractions from bovine retinal pigment epithelium which selectively incorporates exogenous vitamin A when presented as a retinol-RBP complex. Upon incubation in the presence of [3H]retinol-RBP, isolated plasma membrane fractions take up and esterify retinol. A 4-fold reduction of total vitamin A incorporation is observed in conditions which specifically inhibit retinyl-ester formation, thus indicating that the two processes of retinol uptake and esterification are functionally coupled. Evidence is presented that retinol bound to a plasma membrane receptor sharing functional and structural similarities with CRBP is the actual substrate for esterification. Vitamin A accumulation seems to require retinol esterification to allow the recycling of a limited number of free, plasma membrane-associated, retinol receptors. Mobilization of retinol stored as a membrane-bound retinyl-ester is mediated by a membrane-associated hydrolase activity selectively controlled by the level of apo-CRBP which acts as a carrier for the released retinol. Up to 90% of membrane-bound vitamin A is released upon incubation in the presence of apo-CRBP (11 microM) with concomitant formation of retinol-CRBP. The overall process, in which retinol never needs to leave its binding proteins, allows the accumulation of vitamin A in the form of a membrane-bound retinyl-ester and its regulated mobilization as a retinol-CRBP complex."
https://openalex.org/W1595277447,"The mechanism of inhibition of estrogen synthetase (P-450arom) by 19R- and 19S-isomers of 10-oxiranyl-and 10-thiiranyl-4-estrene-3,17-dione was investigated using human placental microsomes and purified enzyme preparations. The 19R-isomers were potent inhibitors and exhibited affinities 36-fold (10-oxirane) and 80-fold (10-thiirane) greater than the respective 19S-isomers. Kinetic experiments showed that inhibition by the 19R-isomers is competitive with respect to substrate; inhibition constants for the (19R)-10-oxirane (Ki = 10 nM) and the 19R-10-thiirane (Ki = 2 nM) indicate that each binds with greater affinity than the androgen substrates androstenedione and testosterone. Inhibition time courses and kinetic data were consistent with high affinity, reversible binding. Spectral titrations of microsomal preparations and purified P-450arom showed that binding of the 19R-isomers shifts the Soret maximum of the ferric enzyme to 411 nm (10-oxirane) or 425 nm (10-thiirane); addition of excess androstenedione reversed the spectral changes, producing the high spin form of the enzyme with a Soret peak at 393 nm. These spectral shifts suggest that the oxygen atom of the 10-oxirane and the sulfur atom of the 10-thiirane are bound to the heme iron in the inhibitor complexes. These results suggest that the high affinities of the inhibitors arise from their dual interaction with the androgen binding site and with the heme. Coordination of the C19 heteroatom to the heme indicates that C19 of androgen substrates may be positioned sufficiently close to the heme to allow direct attack by an iron-bound oxidant. Stereoselective binding of the 19R-isomers by P-450arom further suggests that the heme is likely to be positioned above C1 and C2 of the A ring."
https://openalex.org/W1541324220,"Abstract RNA from a rat liver tumor (Morris hepatoma 5123tc) was used to construct cDNAs together comprising the complete coding sequence of rat oncomodulin mRNA. Information obtained from these cDNAs as well as from primer extension analysis gave a deduced length for the complete oncomodulin mRNA of approximately 680 nucleotides (excluding the poly(A) tail) including a 5'-untranslated region of 97 +/- 2 nucleotides, a 324-nucleotide-coding sequence and a 259-nucleotide 3'-noncoding region. Comparison of the oncomodulin cDNA sequence with those coding for other members of the calcium-binding protein family shows little homology with the exception of a recently reported parvalbumin cDNA where the oncomodulin and parvalbumin nucleotide sequences are 59% identical in the protein-coding region. RNA blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA from normal adult rat liver gave no evidence of oncomodulin expression in this tissue. A single RNA species was detected, however, in RNA extracts from the hepatoma and from rat and human placentas. A probe prepared from one of the rat oncomodulin cDNAs hybridized with a single DNA species in restriction digests of hepatoma and normal DNA from rat and sequences in DNA of humans and other mammals. A 38-nucleotide sequence spanning the 5'-untranslated region and the first seven codons of the oncomodulin cDNA, was far less homologous than was the same region of a parvalbumin cDNA, to a chicken calmodulin cDNA sequence coding for the first calcium-binding domain. The oncomodulin gene appears to have diverged more from that of calmodulin than has the parvalbumin gene."

Each of the antibodies was found to inhibit transcription from the rpoD heat shock promoter to a different extent. Extensive homology at the protein level has been observed between various sigma factors. The monoclonal antibodies to sigma 32 were tested for the ability to cross-react with sigma 70 on Western blots. None of the antibodies reacted with electroblotted sigma 70. The sigma 32 content was examined in total cell extracts during heat shock Levels of sigma 32 were found to increase approximately 4-fold over pre-heat shock levels at five min after temperature upshift. These levels remained slightly elevated above pre-heat shock levels at 10 and 15 min after temperature upshift."
https://openalex.org/W1581359855,"Binding of an iodide ion to horseradish peroxidase was studied by following the hyperfine-shifted proton nuclear magnetic resonance signals of the enzyme. For the enzyme in an iodide-free solution, the spectra of hyperfine-shifted methyl region were only slightly affected by varying pH. In the presence of iodide (200 mM), however, both chemical shifts and line widths of the heme peripheral 1- and 8-methyl proton signals were markedly affected by the pH change from 7 to 4 and broadened at pH 4. From the change in peak heights of these signals at various concentrations of iodide, the dissociation constant of the iodide to the enzyme was calculated to be about 100 mM at pH 4.0. The peak derived from the proximal histidyl imidazole N epsilon-H proton was not perturbed by the addition of 200 mM iodide at pH 4.0 and 7.1. The rate of oxidation of iodide with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the enzyme was increased with decreasing pH, indicating the participation of an ionizable group with the pKa value of 4.0. Optical difference spectrum studies showed that iodide exerts no effect both at pH 4.0 and 7.4 on the binding affinity of resorcinol which is associated with the enzyme in the vicinity of the heme peripheral 8-CH3 group. These results suggest that an iodide ion binds to the enzyme at almost equal distance from the heme peripheral 1- and 8-methyl groups at the distal side of the heme and that the interaction becomes stronger in acidic medium with protonation of the ionizable group with the pKa value of 4.0."
https://openalex.org/W1544960225,"A procedure for the purification of the enzyme bile acid:CoA ligase from guinea pig liver microsomes was developed. Activity toward chenodeoxycholate, cholate, deoxycholate, and lithocholate co-purified suggesting that a single enzyme form catalyzes the activation of all four bile acids. Activity toward lithocholate could not be accurately assayed during the earlier stages of purification due to a protein which interfered with the assay. The purified ligase had a specific activity that was 333-fold enriched relative to the microsomal cell fraction. The purification procedure successfully removed several enzymes that could potentially interfere with assay procedures for ligase activity, i.e. ATPase, AMPase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and bile acid-CoA thiolase. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the purified ligase gave a single band of approximately 63,000 Mr. A molecular size of 116,000 +/- 4,000 daltons was obtained by radiation inactivation analysis of the ligase in its native microsomal environment, suggesting that the functional unit of the ligase is a dimer. The purified enzyme was extensively delipidated by adsorption to alumina. The delipidated enzyme was extremely unstable but could be partially stabilized by the addition of phospholipid vesicles or detergent. However, such additions did not enhance enzymatic activity. Kinetic analysis revealed that chenodeoxycholate, cholate, deoxycholate, and lithocholate were all relatively good substrates for the purified enzyme. The trihydroxy bile acid cholate was the least efficient substrate due to its relatively low affinity for the enzyme. Bile acid:CoA ligase could also be solubilized from porcine liver microsomes and purified 180-fold by a modification of the above procedure. The final preparation contains three polypeptides as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three peptides range in size from 50,000 to 59,000, somewhat smaller than the guinea pig enzyme. The functional size of the porcine enzyme in its native microsomal environment was determined by the technique of radiation inactivation analysis to be 108,000 +/- 5,000 daltons. Thus, the functional form of the porcine enzyme also appears to be a dimer."

Analysis of salivary mRNAs and liver DNA by molecular cloning, DNA sequence determinations, and Northern and Southern blot hybridization revealed several closely related CRP mRNAs and at least 10 CRP-related genes. We further analyzed two CRP mRNAs of 850 and 920 nucleotides and the gene encoding the larger CRP mRNA. The two mRNAs contain the same 69-base repeats in their coding regions and are identical in their 5'- and 3'-untranslated tracts. However, they differ in the number of contiguous repeats (four versus five) and a segment at the 3' end of the coding region which encodes closely related but unique COOH termini of the CRPs. These structural features suggest a recent gene conversion. The CRP gene analyzed is divided into three exons that encode (i) 5'-untranslated tract and signal sequence, (ii) secreted polypeptide, and (iii) 3'-untranslated tract, respectively. CRP mRNA contains two open reading frames. The longer open reading frame encodes a CRP precursor with a signal sequence of 17 amino acids, four to five contiguous repeats of 23 amino acids, and a variable COOH region that begins with two segments related to the contiguous repeats. Immunochemical analysis of salivary gland slices with antisera raised against peptides corresponding to two regions of the larger open reading frame revealed intense staining only of the serous cells of the submandibular glands. 35S-Labeled oligonucleotides complementary to CRP mRNA specifically hybridized to the same cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554539977,"A hepatic fibrogenic factor (HFF) isolated from fibrotic rat livers has previously been shown to stimulate the transcription of type I procollagen genes in cultured fibroblasts (Raghow, R., Gossage, D., Seyer, J. M., and Kang, A.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12718-12723). To test if the expression of other collagen genes was similarly affected by the fibrogenic factor, we measured the rates of types I, III, and V procollagen synthesis in two different cell lines after treatment with HFF. The effect of fibrogenic factor on types I and III procollagens was tested in rat fibroblasts, while a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line was used to evaluate the effect of HFF on type V procollagen synthesis. Incubation with rat fibroblasts resulted in a 3-4-fold stimulation of the synthesis of both types I and III procollagens in a time-dependent manner. The stimulated rates of types I and III procollagen synthesis accompanied an increase in the steady-state levels of their corresponding mRNAs. When A204 cells, which are derived from a rhabdomyosarcoma and exclusively synthesize type V procollagen, were incubated with the fibrogenic factor, a 3-4-fold stimulation of the synthesis of both pro-alpha 1(V) and pro-alpha 2(V) chains was seen. Using a cDNA probe for pro-alpha 2(V), we also observed that there was a 2-3-fold increase in the steady-state level of pro-alpha 2(V) mRNA in A204 cells after treatment with the fibrogenic factor. In both rat fibroblasts and A204 cells the steady-state levels of beta-actin mRNA were minimally affected by fibrogenic factor, suggesting that the procollagen genes were preferentially affected. Since types I, III, and V collagens are present in the normal liver and accumulate aberrantly in the fibrotic liver, we suggest that fibrogenic factor may play an important role in determining the altered collagen composition of the fibrotic liver. Based on these data, we also speculate that the regulation of the biosynthesis of a variety of procollagens in diverse cell types by HFF possibly occurs by a common mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1532040890,"The thyroid hormone nuclear receptor is a chromatin-associated protein regulating expression of specific genes. Acetylation of nucleosomal core histones is thought to be one of the factors regulating transcriptional activity of chromatin, and it is suggested that this reaction negatively regulates thyroid hormone receptor levels in GH1 cells (Samuels, H.H., Stanley, F., Casanova, J., and Shao, T. C. J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2499-2508). In the present study, we found that n-butyrate, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase, increases thyroid hormone receptor levels in three distinct non-pituitary cells without changing binding affinity. This effect appeared within 30 min and reached a plateau (240% of control) after a 6-h treatment, before important cellular functions were affected. This effect was time-dependent, dose-dependent, reversible, and paralleled the changes in the electrophoretic mobilities of histones H3 and H4. n-Butyrate prolonged the receptor half-life, and this prolongation corresponded to the increase of receptor levels. Thyroid hormone did not reduce its own receptor levels or influence the effect of n-butyrate. Considering the difference between GH1 cells and non-pituitary cells in the regulation of thyroid hormone receptor levels, our observations, together with those of Samuels et al., suggest the possibility that the acetylation of chromatin-associated proteins has a physiological significance in the regulation of thyroid hormone nuclear receptor levels."
https://openalex.org/W1605323525,"Reports to date have led to the conclusion that there are isozymes for 5-aminolevulinate synthase in the liver and erythroid tissue of chicken. Indeed, the existence of a multigene family for chicken 5-aminolevulinate synthase has been proposed. We find no evidence to support these proposals. In this work we show that 5-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA from chicken liver and reticulocytes is identical as determined by RNase mapping and primer extension studies and that the 5-aminolevulinate synthase protein from these tissues is the same size as judged by immunoblot analysis. We also show that a single mRNA species for 5-aminolevulinate synthase is present in chicken liver, reticulocytes, brain, and heart and an avian erythroblastosis virus-transformed chicken erythroblast cell line. Southern analysis shows the presence of only one gene copy for 5-aminolevulinate synthase in the chicken haploid genome. Overall, these results lead to the conclusion that in chickens 5-aminolevulinate synthase is encoded by a unique gene and is expressed as a single mRNA species in all tissues."
