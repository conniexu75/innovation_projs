https://openalex.org/W2079555774,"Male rats were exposed to prenatal or postnatal stress, or both. The prenatally stressed males showed low levels of male copulatory behavior and high rates of female lordotic responding. Postnatal stress had no effect. The modifications are attributed to stress-mediated alterations in the ratio of adrenal to gonadal androgens during critical stages of sexual differentiation. Specifically, it appears that stress causes an increase in the weak adrenal androgen, androstenedione, from the maternal or fetal adrenal cortices, or from both, and a concurrent decrease in the potent gonadal androgen, testosterone."

Group differences are present at birth, and are probably related to variations in autonomic reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2070478425,"Single olfactory bulb units were studied in two macrosmatic species of rodents under conditions intended to preserve the cyclical stimulation which normally accompanies nasal breathing. Patterns of unit activity related to the inhalation cycle were observed in all animals, often in the absence of specific stimuli, and could not be explained in simple mechanical terms. Distinctive changes in these patterns occurred in response to certain odors, and were generally independent of changes in the overall firing frequency. These findings indicate that a change in the overall firing frequency of unit discharges is neither a necessary nor sufficient measure of responsiveness to odors in the rodent olfactory bulb, and that stimulus-specific temporal distributions of unit firing may be involved in olfacto-endocrine activities."

https://openalex.org/W2057771365,The amino acid sequence of urinary beta(2)-microglobulin has been partially determined and found to be related to the constant region of IgG immunoglobulin heavy chain. beta(2)-Microglobulin is present in normal individuals. Its gene may have evolved from an immunoglobulin gene by the use of an unusually located start signal for initiating synthesis of the polypeptide.
https://openalex.org/W2084945985,"The capacity of lymphoid cells from nonsensitized mice to lyse antibody-coated target erythrocytes in vitro does not require the presence of thymus-derived or thymus-dependent lymphocytes. Thus, spleen cells from thymus-deprived mice and spleen cell populations from which thymus-dependent lymphocytes had been removed were fully competent to mediate destruction of antibody-coated target cells. However, prior treatment of spleen cell populations with antibody to kappa chains diminished this function, suggesting a role for bone marrow-derived lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1965105179,"We examined the amount of theta rhythm (4 to 9 hertz) in cortical electroencephalograms of rats for 30 minutes after training in one-trial tasks. Some animals received electroconvulsive shock after training. The amount of theta in the electroencephalogram after training was positively correlated with the degree of subsequent retention of a footshock, whether animals had received electroconvulsive shock or not."

https://openalex.org/W1485395806,"Abstract Highly purified preparations of superoxide dismutase obtained from bovine erythrocytes and green peas inhibited the catalytic activity of intestinal tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase at any stage of reaction. On the contrary, superoxide dismutase failed to inhibit hepatic and pseudomonad tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases during the steady state of reaction. With hepatic and pseudomonad enzymes, however, a prolonged lag period was observed when dismutase was added to the reaction mixture prior to the start of reaction. Further experiments with superoxide anion, produced by electrolytic reduction of molecular oxygen, indicated that superoxide anion may be involved in the catalytic mechanism of intestinal enzyme while it reductively activates pseudomonad and hepatic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2008871145,"Human subjects can learn to control the relation between their systolic blood pressure and heart rate when they are given feedback and reward for the desired pattern of blood pressure and heart rate. They can learn to integrate these functions (increase or decrease both jointly), or to a lesser degree, differentiate them (raise one and simultaneously lower the other). The extent of this learning is predicted by a behavioral and biological model that explains specificity of learning in the autonomic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1986091186,Dimethyl sulfoxide added to cultures first treated with 5-iododeoxyuridine increased C-type virus production approximately tenfold in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. 5-Iododeoxyuridine followed by dimethyl sulfoxide also activated a similar C-type virus in a metastatic tumor from a bronchial node taken from a 52-year-old male.
https://openalex.org/W2089001017,"Hypoglycin A, the causative agent of the Jamaican vomiting sickness, produced a marked increase in concentration of isovaleric acid in the plasma of rats, when administered in a single dose. alpha-Methylbutyric acid, a position isomer, also accumulated. The use of hypoglycin A reproduced some features of human isovaleric acidemia. Accumulation of these branched pentanoic acids may be another factor contributing to the pathogenesis of the Jamaican vomiting sickness."
https://openalex.org/W2012403210,"Lipid peroxidation of liver and kidney microsomes induces a highly characteristic sequence of morphological changes typified by detachment of ribosomes and formation of large aggregates of vesicles bound together by dense amorphous material and myelin figure-like debris. The trilaminar structure of the membrane is, however, retained even after complete peroxidation, though its spacing may be increased. The aggregates resemble lysosomal lipofuscin pigment as well as the membranous aggregates of endoplasmic reticulum seen in the liver after carbon tetrachloride poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W1966479831,"Electron microscopy of rat hepatocytes revealed a diurnal variation in the relative amounts of endoplasmic reticulum structures and regional differences in their distribution within the hepatic lobule. The diurnal changes in smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum structures were compared with the diurnal changes in the hepatic microsomal enzyme hexobarbital oxidase. In the control group, at the time when enzyme activity was maximum, the amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum was also maximum and vice versa. When the enzyme rhythm was abolished, as in blinded rats, the diurnal rhythm in the endoplasmic reticulum was also abolished."
https://openalex.org/W2005425447,"An enzymatic activity (procollagen peptidase), capable of converting the biosynthetic precursor procollagen to collagen at neutral pH, has been identified in rat and chick calvarial bone. Limited proteolysis of procollagen with chymotrypsin resulted in a similar transformation. The activity in bone can be demonstrated in vitro despite inhibition of new collagen synthesis by cycloheximide. Preservation of the collagen precursor in preparations extracted with acetic acid results from inhibition of the enzymatic activity at low pH."
https://openalex.org/W1978315112,"Present confusion that equates the presence of a biological effect with a deleterious implication ignores several concepts. To believe that a single molecule's presence in a cell implies a definite potential for deleterious effect disregards stochastic considerations. To believe that such molecules cause an undesirable effect disregards the presence of multiplicity of interferring substances. Such thinking also does not take into account the fact that the dose of a foreign atom may be related to the probability of its interacting with an available active site, or that similar probability governs the answers to the question of whether interactions will occur at discrete topographical loci upon a structural or functional molecule (or on a possible precursor). While the construction of stochastically sound model is remote, the reasonableness of the hierachy of cellular element concentrations as these relate to metabolic function suggests that a threshold for biological activity exists within a cell at 10(4) atoms. The cellular organism operates within a quantitative rate limit that transcends any statements having only qualitative bases. Thus concepts concerning encroachments on response capabilities over a lifespan are inadequate descriptors of biological activity in the absence of quantitative qualifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2151638395,"An analysis of experimental findings indicates that the induction of a mammary neoplasm in the Sprague-Dawley rat is dependent on the action of radiation on more than one cell. Although a linear relation between incidence and x-ray dose might be consistent with available data, such a relation would be fortuitous and linear extrapolation to lower doses is unjustified."

https://openalex.org/W2124452606,"Human bone marrow lymphoid cells, particularly when enriched with plasma cells, as in multiple myeloma, respond to pokeweed mitogen and to antiserum to immunoglobulin but not to phytohemagglutinin. Cells of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia of the bursal deficient type failed to respond to either pokeweed or to the antiserum to immunoglobulin. Leukocytes of the agammaglobulinemia patients however responded in a normal fashion to phytohemagglutinin. Just as the in vitro response to phytohemagglutinin is taken as an index of the thymus-dependent system, the in vitro response to both antiserum to immunoglobulin and pokeweed may be considered an index for the bursaldependent system. Human bone marrow, therefore, contains bursal cells and probably very few or no thymus cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517095082,"Abstract The non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, utilize fructose via a pathway initiated by an enzyme system that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to the 1-hydroxyl of fructose. Two protein fractions, both required for phosphorylating activity, were separated. One is tightly associated with the membrane fraction, while the other, found in this fraction in the crude extract, was solubilized by extraction with water, and exhibits a molecular weight near 200,000. The enzyme system differs from the P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems isolated from other bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2024341430,"The total uptake of [(3)H]thymidine by the mouse parotid gland, kidney, and duodenum exhibits a circadian rhythm. A single injection of isoproterenol changes the phasing and amplitude of these rhythms. Depending on the organ, there are certain points in the circadian time structure when isoproterenol stimulates or inhibits the uptake of thymidine; at other time points there is no difference between the responses to isoproterenol and to saline."
https://openalex.org/W1987706210,The rate of (35)S incorporation into cerebroside sulfate in cultures of embryo mouse spinal cord shows a rapid acceleration at the time of myelin formation. Exposure of cultures to dilute serum from rabbits with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis results in almost complete inhibition of sulfatide synthesis. Within 24 hours after replacement of inhibiting medium with normal medium there is an increase in sulfatide synthesis followed by myelination.
https://openalex.org/W1970597731,"Rat mammary carcinoma (R3230AC) which does not regress after ovariectomy has a markedly reduced amount of cytoplasmic estradiol binding protein. Cytoplasm from the tumor fails to interact with estradiol sufficiently to permit estradiol binding to tumor chromatin. This defect can be corrected in vitro by substituting cytoplasm, containing the binding protein, from rat uterus, thus permitting estradiol binding to tumor chromatin. The results indicate that the hormonal autonomy of this carcinoma is due to a lack of estradiol binding protein and not to the inability of estradiol to interact with the cell genome."
https://openalex.org/W2061349650,"Rats performing a lever-pressing response for water reward in an operant situation, when compared with control groups, showed an increase in brain norepinephrine metabolism. One control group included rats which were handled and deprived of water in the same way as the experimental group but were not trained to perform the operant task. We conclude that performance in an operant situation affects norepinephrine metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1991823205,The ethical issues of population control as they arise in government decision-making are analyzed and a structure for examining these issues along with some possible solutions developed. 3 values have had a predominant role in the West: freedom justice and security-survival with freedom holding primacy. Given this ranking of values governments must act to implement individual freedom through voluntary family planning programs. To introduce programs that go beyond family planning it must 1st be shown that family planning has been adequately tried and has failed (a proposition so far not established). The choice of a program that goes beyond family planning should be a positive incentive program that respects freedom of choice and a coercive program should be used only as a last resort. In general the more coercive a program the more stringent should be the conditions necessary to justify and regulate it. To allow the right of free choice is to take a risk which is justified only by the high value of that rig ht which cannot be posited on utilitarian considerations.

Impairment of catalytic efficiency can only be documented in opalescent test solutions in which the insecticides are present in excess of their solubility limit. These slowly forming precipitates occlude enzyme from solution and furnish a physical explanation of the supposed inhibition. The amounts occluded depend, among other things, on the conformational and topographical characteristics of the particular carbonic anhydrase molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1556557647,"Abstract The presence of deoxycytidylate deaminase in extracts of Lactobacillus acidophilus has been confirmed. The partially purified enzyme is specifically stimulated by deoxycytidine triphosphate (Km = 1.7 x 10-7 m) and inhibited by deoxythymidine triphosphate (Ki = 1.7 x 10-6 m). Activation by the positive effector is probably mediated through a change in the interaction of the substrate (deoxycytidylate) with the enzyme, since deoxycytidine triphosphate influences the Michaelis constant, the Hill coefficient, and the shape of the substrate-saturation curve, but it has no effect on the maximal velocity of the reaction."
