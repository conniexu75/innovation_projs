https://openalex.org/W2151206192,"In chloride-secretory epithelia, the basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) is thought to play a major role in transepithelial Cl− and fluid transport. Similarly, in marginal cells of the inner ear, NKCC1 has been proposed as a component of the entry pathway for K+ that is secreted into the endolymph, thus playing a critical role in hearing. To test these hypotheses, we generated and analyzed an NKCC1-deficient mouse. Homozygous mutant (Nkcc1−/−) mice exhibited growth retardation, a 28% incidence of death around the time of weaning, and mild difficulties in maintaining their balance. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly reduced in both heterozygous and homozygous mutants, indicating an important function for NKCC1 in the maintenance of blood pressure. cAMP-induced short circuit currents, which are dependent on the CFTR Cl− channel, were reduced in jejunum, cecum, and trachea of Nkcc1−/− mice, indicating that NKCC1 contributes to cAMP-induced Cl− secretion. In contrast, secretion of gastric acid in adult Nkcc1−/− stomachs and enterotoxin-stimulated fluid secretion in the intestine of suckling Nkcc1−/− mice were normal. Finally, homozygous mutants were deaf, and histological analysis of the inner ear revealed a collapse of the membranous labyrinth, consistent with a critical role for NKCC1 in transepithelial K+ movements involved in generation of the K+-rich endolymph and the endocochlear potential.

NKCC1 mediates the coupled electroneutral transport of 1 Na+, 1 K+, and 2 Cl− ions across the plasma membrane (4Kaplan M.R. Mount D.B. Delpire E. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 649-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), driven by the inwardly directed Na+ and Cl− gradients that occur under physiological conditions. It has a broad tissue distribution (1Delpire E. Rauchman M.I. Beier D.R. Hebert S.C. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25677-25683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Payne J.A.

Regulation of cell volume is a major function of NKCC1 (3Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in vascular endothelial cells, it may play an important role in controlling cytosolic concentrations of Cl− and K+ during agonist stimulation (10O'Neill W.C. Steinberg D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C267-C274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, it is restricted to basolateral membranes (11Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Brown D. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and there is strong pharmacological evidence that it provides an entry pathway for ions that are secreted across the apical membrane. Studies of tissue samples of wild-type and CFTR-deficient mice have shown that cAMP-induced Cl− secretion in intestinal and nasal epithelial cells is sharply inhibited by treatment with bumetanide, an inhibitor of NKCC1 (13Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Gabriel S.E. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that basolateral Cl− uptake via NKCC1 is important in maintaining CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion across the apical membrane. There is recent evidence that NKCC1 might also provide a basolateral Cl− entry mechanism that is required for the maintenance of high levels of HCl secretion by gastric parietal cells (14Soybel D.I. Gullens S.R. Maxwell F. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C242-C249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is generally thought to be dependent on Cl−/HCO3− exchange. In the inner ear, NKCC1 is expressed at high levels on the basolateral membrane of marginal cells of the stria vascularis (15Crouch J.J. Sakaguchi N. Lytle C. Schulte B.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Sakaguchi N. Crouch J.J. Lytle C. Schulte B.A. Hearing Res. 1998; 118: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). K+ secretion by marginal cells is responsible for the high concentrations of K+ in the endolymph and for the endocochlear potential, which is eliminated by perilymphatic or systemic application of bumetanide or furosemide (17Kusakari J. Ise I. Comegys T.H. Thalmann I. Thalmann R. Laryngoscope. 1978; 88: 12-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sewell W.F. Hearing Res. 1984; 14: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Rybak L.P. Whitworth C. Acta Otolayngol. 1986; 101: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations and the ototoxicity of loop diuretics (20Brown R.D. Feldman A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1978; 18: 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggest that NKCC1 contributes to the high rates of K+ uptake needed to maintain K+ currents across the apical membrane of the marginal cell and that NKCC1 plays a critical role in hearing. Many of the conclusions regarding the functions of NKCC1 in secretory epithelial tissues are based on studies in which loop diuretics have been used as inhibitors. However, these compounds inhibit other members of the cation-coupled cotransporter family, such as the apical Na-K-2Cl cotransporter of the thick ascending limb and isoform 1 of the KCl cotransporter (7Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and the existence of additional members of this family is a distinct possibility (21Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III., B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the physiological functions of NKCC1, we have prepared a mouse line carrying a null mutation in the nkcc1 gene (locus Slc12a2) and have performed an initial analysis of the phenotype. Nkcc1 genomic clones were isolated from a strain 129/SvJ mouse phage library and partially characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction analysis using primers based on mouse NKCC1 cDNA sequences (1Delpire E. Rauchman M.I. Beier D.R. Hebert S.C. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25677-25683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting vector, MJK+KO, which was described in previous studies (22Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 23Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), contained both the neo Rgene for positive selection of targeted ES cells and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene for negative selection. A 2.7-kb Not I-Eco RV fragment, beginning in intron 3 (with the Not I site originating in the vector cloning site) and terminating at codon 401 in exon 6, was inserted 3′ to the neo R gene in the targeting vector; a 4.2-kb Eco RV/Bam HI fragment, beginning with codon 402 and extending to near the end of intron 8, was inserted 5′ to the neo R gene. Generation and identification of targeted ES cells, blastocyst-mediated transgenesis, and breeding of chimeric mice and their ES cell-derived agouti offspring were carried out as described previously (22Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The probes used for Southern blot analysis, generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Nkcc1 gene sequences, were a 1.7-kb outside probe extending from the beginning of exon 9 to the end of exon 10 and a 1.0-kb inside probe spanning the region from exon 4 to exon 5. ES cells were first analyzed using the 1.7-kb probe, which contained sequences from outside the region used in preparing the targeting construct, and then cells that appeared to be correctly targeted were confirmed by analysis with the 1.0-kb inside probe. DNA from tail biopsies was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using the probes described above or by polymerase chain reaction. For polymerase chain reaction genotyping, three primers were included in the reaction mixture. Forward (5′-GGAACATTCCATACTTATGATAGATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCACCTTTGCTTCCCACTCCATTCC-3′) primers corresponding to sequences from the 5′- and 3′-ends of exon 6, respectively, amplified a 105-base pair product from the wild-type gene. For the mutant gene, a reverse primer (5′-GACAATAGCAGGCATGCTGG-3′), complementary to sequences from the untranslated region of the neo R gene, and the forward primer from the 5′-end of exon 6 amplified a 156-base pair product. For growth curves of young animals, mice of all three genotypes from six heterozygous matings were weighed at 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following birth. For adult animals, 7.5-week-old (5 mice of each genotype) and age-matched 10–15-week-old (21 Nkcc1−/−, 14 Nkcc1+/−, and 22 Nkcc1 +/+) mice were weighed. Data presented in the growth curve included Nkcc1−/− mice that died around the time of weaning; exclusion of these mice, which tended to be slightly smaller in body weight than surviving mutants, had little noticeable effect on the growth curve. A histological survey of tissues from 15–17-day-old Nkcc1 +/+, Nkcc1+/− and Nkcc1−/− mice (two of each genotype) was performed using tissues that were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon from 3-week-old (two of each genotype) and 8-week-old (five of each genotype) Nkcc1 +/+ and Nkcc1−/− mice were prepared for detailed light and transmission electron microscopy as described previously (23Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Intestinal segments from 15–21-day-old Nkcc1 +/+and Nkcc1−/− mice (7 of each genotype) were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in plastic, sectioned, and stained with toluidine blue or fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Morphometry of the intestinal epithelium was determined by measuring villus tip enterocytes for the height of the brush border, height of both apical and basolateral cytoplasm (relative to the position of the nuclei), total epithelial cell height, width of the lamina propria, and total villus width. Intact inner ears were isolated from 4–5-week-old Nkcc1 +/+ and Nkcc1−/− mice (two of each genotype) that were perfused for 5 min with 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium-cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3. The inner ears were decalcified in EDTA, postfixed in buffered 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in plastic. Serial 1- and 2-μm sections were cut with a diamond knife and stained with toluidine blue. Sections of ears from one Nkcc1 +/+ and 3 Nkcc1−/− mice were prepared in a similar manner but were not decalcified in EDTA. Adult mice of all three genotypes were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of inactin (100 μg/g of body weight) and ketamine (50 μg/g of body weight), and mean arterial pressure was determined using a femoral artery catheter as described previously (24Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin, STa, was reconstituted to 10 μg/ml in sterile saline, with 1% Evan's Blue dye added as a tracer. 1 μg of STa was administered to 4-day-old suckling mice by intragastric injection (25Giannella R.A. Infect. Immun. 1976; 14: 95-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were allowed to suckle until toxin administration, but not afterward. After 3 h incubation at room temperature, mice were euthanized, and the entire intestinal tract from proximal duodenum to distal colon was excised. The weights of the fluid-filled intestine and remaining carcass were measured, and the gut weight to carcass weight ratio was determined. Animals into which STa was injected successfully were identified by their blue-stained stomachs. Electrical potential difference measurements were performed under short-circuit current (ISC) recording conditions. Freshly isolated jejunum and cecum from 12–16-week-old mice were mounted in voltage-clamped Ussing chambers (13Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Gabriel S.E. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Clarke L.L. Harline M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G259-G267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and bathed in standard Ringer solution for 20 min to record basal ISC. Next, the ISC response resulting from addition of 10 μm forskolin (bilateral) was recorded for 20 min, followed by a recording of the ISCresponse after addition of 100 μm bumetanide to the serosal side. ISC responses were also measured using cultured tracheal epithelial cells from both genotypes. Epithelial cells from tracheal ring explants were cultured to confluency on permeable collagen matrix supports as described previously (27Clarke L.L. Burns K.A. Bayle J.-Y. Boucher R.C. Van Scott M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L519-L525PubMed Google Scholar). Tracheal epithelial monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers and bathed in standard Ringer solution for 20 min while basal ISC was recorded. ISC responses following the consecutive addition of 10 μm amiloride (luminal), 10 μm forskolin (bilateral), and 100 μmbumetanide (serosal) were recorded for 5, 10, and 10 min, respectively, following each addition. Forskolin-stimulated ISC responses for intestinal segments and cell monolayers were normalized to tissue area. Wild-type and homozygous mutant mice were fasted for 4 h, injected subcutaneously with histamine HCl (2 μg/g of body weight), and euthanized 15 min later. Dissection of stomachs, transfer of stomach contents to 2 ml of nitrogen-saturated normal saline, and measurement of pH was carried out as described previously (23Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from stomach, small intestine, cecum, colon, brain, lung, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle of 4-week-old mice using Tri-ReagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Each tissue sample was pooled from three mice. Northern blots were prepared and hybridized as described previously (22Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), using rat or mouse cDNA probes for NKCC1, NHE3, CFTR, AE2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. ABR measurements of avertin-anesthetized 5–8-week-old Nkcc1 +/+, Nkcc1+/−, and Nkcc1−/− mice were recorded as described previously (28Erway L.C. Willott J.F. Archer J.R. Harrison D.E. Hearing Res. 1993; 65: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) using three subcutaneous electrodes, one inserted under each ear and one at the top of the skull. The mice were positioned between high frequency transducers in a sound-attenuated chamber, and sound stimuli were directed into the ear by tubing. The ABR was computer-averaged (time-locked with onset of 128–1024 stimuli, at 20/s) out of the continuous electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic activity. The ABR peak amplitudes were averaged in the 0.5–8.0 μV range; the electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic activity ranged to >30 μV but averaged <0.5 μV due to their randomness with regard to onset of the acoustic stimuli. All electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic activity that exceeded 30 μV was rejected from the averaging technique. The sound stimuli used were a 0.1-ms broad band click and 3-ms pure tones of 8, 16, and 32 kHz at 20–100 db. The threshold of hearing was defined as the minimum sound intensity, in db, required to elicit a characteristic waveform. Statistical significance was determined by single-factor analysis of variance, analysis of variance-protected Bonferroni's test, or unpaired t test where appropriate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. To disrupt the gene encoding NKCC1, we used a construct in which the neo R gene was inserted into exon 6 (Fig.1 A). Targeted ES cells were identified by Southern blot analysis similar to that shown in Fig.1 B and used for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis. Chimeric mice derived from two ES cell clones transmitted the mutant gene to their offspring, and these mice were bred to establish NKCC1-deficient mouse lines. Matings of heterozygous mice yielded live offspring of all three genotypes (Fig. 1 B). Northern blot analysis using probes corresponding to coding sequences from regions 3′ (Fig.1 C) and 5′ to the neo R insertion site (data not shown) demonstrated that expression of the 6.5-kb Nkcc1 mRNA was reduced in Nkcc1+/− tissues and eliminated in Nkcc1−/− tissues. Genotype analysis of 560 offspring from heterozygous matings showed that wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant offspring were born in approximately a 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio (30% +/+; 46% +/−; 24% −/−). Relative to both wild-type and heterozygous mice, Nkcc1−/− mice experienced growth retardation (Fig. 2) that was readily apparent within 1 week of birth and particularly severe during the third week of life. At weaning on day 21, Nkcc1−/− mice (5.5 ± 0.3 g) were significantly smaller than both wild-type (12.8 ± 0.3 g) and heterozygous (12.8 ± 0.2 g) mice. Homozygous mutants gained weight well after weaning; however, they remained smaller as adults (∼80% of wild-type mice) and, in general, had less body fat. Extrapolation of the growth patterns to their day of birth suggested that there was little, if any, growth retardation of Nkcc1−/− mice in utero. To further test for the possibility of in utero growth retardation, 12 offspring from a heterozygous mating were removed by Caesarian section on postcoital day 17 and weighed. No significant difference in body weight was observed in this small sample of mice (Nkcc1 +/+ and Nkcc1+/− mice, 0.64 ± 0.02 g, n = 8; Nkcc1−/− mice, 0.64 ± 0.01 g, n = 4). Nkcc1 −/−mice frequently exhibited unusual head postures, in which the head was tilted to one side or tilted upward and backward with the nose held high. The mutants also exhibited circling behavior accompanied by a tendency to engage in rapid spinning, which persisted throughout the life of the animal. In some instances, Nkcc1−/− mice engaged in repetitive circling in a vertical direction, in which they climbed the underside of the downward sloping end of the cage top, where food was placed, moved upside down along the underside of the cage top, dropped to the floor and ran back to the sloping end of the cage top to continue the process. While spinning, mutant mice sometimes lost their balance, but quickly righted themselves. Loss of balance occurred occasionally when the mutants were walking in a straight line. A histological survey of sections from brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, eye, and pancreas of 15–17-day-old Nkcc1 +/+, Nkcc1+/−, and Nkcc1−/− mice revealed no significant lesions, with the exception of a single homozygous mutant in which cells of the choroid plexus were vacuolated and swollen. However, the choroid plexus of another young mutant appeared normal, and no abnormalities were observed in the choroid plexus of two adult mutant mice that were examined. Although gross histological abnormalities were not observed in the intestinal tract of young mutant mice that appeared relatively healthy, abnormal intestinal histopathology was observed among homozygous mutants that sickened or died around the time of weaning (discussed below). Also, in enterocytes of one of the sick homozygous mutant mice, there appeared to be very little cytoplasm between the nucleus and the basal surface of the cell when compared with enterocytes of an age-matched wild-type mouse. To assess the significance of this observation, morphometry of the intestinal epithelium of viable young (21 days of age or less) and adult (8 weeks old) Nkcc1 +/+ and Nkcc1−/− mice was performed. For the adult mice, there were no significant differences between the two genotypes in any of the measurements (described under “Experimental Procedures”). For the young mice, there were significant differences in total epithelial cell height (Nkcc1−/−, 21.2 ± 1.4 μm, n = 8; Nkcc1 +/+, 25.3 ± 1.2 μm, n = 11; p < 0.03) and in the height of the basal cytoplasm (Nkcc1−/−, 3.59 ± 0.39 μm, n = 8;Nkcc1 +/+, 5.01 ± 0.33 μm, n = 11; p < 0.01). Almost 30% of Nkcc1−/− mice died just before or just after weaning at 21 days of age (Fig. 3). The animals were active and seemed fully viable one day and then were found dead in their cages the next day, suggesting a rapid onset of morbidity and then death. We were able to identify and examine seven Nkcc1−/− mice between the ages of 18 and 26 days that had hunched backs, were relatively immobile, and seemed to be near death. All of the mice showed evidence of bleeding in the intestine, and one mouse had a fecal blockage of the large intestine. Fig. 4 shows a 23-day-old mutant that exhibited bleeding in the cecum and a severe blockage of the colon (Fig. 4, A and B) and a 26-day-old mouse that exhibited bleeding in the small intestine and cecum (Fig.4 C). The cecum of Nkcc1−/− mice often had a worm-like appearance (Fig. 4 C) similar to that described for CFTR-deficient mice (29Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Malouf N.N. Boucher R.C.

A 21-day-old heterozygous mouse was found dead with blood in the lumen of its cecum, a blocked colon, and enteric intussusception, a condition in which part of the small intestine prolapses into the lumen of an adjacent region (Fig.4 F). Like homozygous mutants, its cecum had an extension with a coiled, worm-like appearance (see Fig. 4 F). Fig.5 shows the intestinal tract and sections through the cecum of an 18-day-old null mutant that was identified while still alive but in a morbid state; it died naturally just before it was examined. Bleeding throughout the small intestine was observed, and a large focal hemorrhage was visible in the intact cecum (Fig.5 A). Blood was within both the lumen of the cecum (Fig.5 B) and the interstitium (Fig. 5 C and D), and in some regions, there were pools of blood (Fig.5 D). There was no evidence of a significant inflammatory response. These observations raise the possibility that a defect in the circulatory system might have contributed to the increased death rate of null mutants. NKCC1 has been found in both endothelial cells (10O'Neill W.C. Steinberg D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C267-C274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular smooth muscle (30Owen N.E. Ridge K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C629-C636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that NKCC1 deficiency might cause a vascular defect. Blood pressures of anesthetized mice were measured using a femoral artery catheter (Fig.6). Relative to that of wild-type mice (91.8 ± 3.9 mm Hg, n = 5), mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced in both Nkcc1+/− (77.7 ± 4.1 mm Hg, n = 6) and Nkcc1−/− (68.6 ± 2.8 mm Hg, n = 6) mice. As an initial test of secretory function in the intestinal tract, the suckling mouse secretion assay was performed to determine whether cGMP-mediated secretion was impaired in the intestine of Nkcc1−/− mice. Injection of E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin STa into the stomachs of 4–5-day-old mice normally induces fluid accumulation in the intestinal lumen, yielding an increased gut weight/carcass weight (G/C) ratio.

TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 are widely distributed and encode K+-selective channels with a characteristic weak inward rectification (8Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TASK-1 lacks intrinsic voltage sensitivity and is thus a pure background K+-selective channel. Moreover, TASK-1 is extremely sensitive to variations of extracellular pH in a narrow physiological range, with 90% of the maximum current recorded at pH 7.7 and only 10% at pH 6.7 (9Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). TASK-2, another background K+ channel recently isolated from human kidney, shares the external pH sensitivity of TASK-1 (10Reyes R. Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Salinas M. Farman N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Unlike the other 4TMS/2P channels, TASK-2 is almost absent from the brain and is mainly expressed in the kidney. Murine TREK-1 is widely distributed with a strong expression in the brain and in the heart (1Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is activated by membrane stretch, by AA as well as inhalational anesthetics, while it is inhibited by a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M.

Nature Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TREK-1 shares the properties of the Aplysia S-type K+ channel, which is involved in presynaptic facilitation underlying a simple form of learning (14Belardetti F. Siegelbaum S.A.

In the present report, we demonstrate that the AA-sensitive mechano-gated K+ channel TREK-1 is opened by intracellular acidosis. Mutagenesis experiments identify the carboxyl-terminal region of TREK-1 as critical for the integration of both mechanical and acidic stimuli. The cDNA cloning, mutational strategy, cell culture, transfection, and electrophysiology procedures have been previously described elsewhere (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M.

Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 7Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with the DEAE dextran procedure. The positive cells were visualized using the anti-CD8 antibody-coated bead method (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Mutant TREK-1 Δ46 was deleted at Thr-368, Δ89 at Thr-322, Δ100 at Arg-311, Δ103 at Gly-308, and Δ113 at Val-298. The chimera TRAAK/TREK-1 contained the core of TRAAK (truncated at Gly-255) and the carboxyl terminus of TREK-1 (Gly-293 to Thr-368). For whole cell experiments, bath solution (EXT) contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH, and pipette solution (INT) contained 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with KOH. The EXT K+-rich solution contained 150 mm KCl instead of 150 mm NaCl. The HCO3− solution used to induce intracellular acidosis (31Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was made by substituting 90 mmNaCl with 90 mm NaHCO3. A K+-rich HCO3− solution was made by substituting 90 mm KCl with 90 mm KHCO3. For cell-attached experiments, the EXT solution contained 150 KCl instead of 150 NaCl, and the pipette contained the EXT solution (150 NaCl). To induce intracellular acidosis, 90 mm KHCO3 was substituted for KCl (31Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CO2-rich solution was prepared by bubbling pure CO2 in an EXT KCl solution (containing 25 mm HCO3− instead of 10 mm Hepes) for 10 min (pH 6.0). The NH4Cl prepulse EXT solution contained 20 mm NH4Cl substituting for 20 mm KCl. For inside-out experiments, the pipette solution was EXT, and the bath solution was INT. For acidic (pH 5.0–6.0) INT solutions, Hepes was substituted with Mes, and for basic (pH 8.0) INT solution, Hepes was substituted with Tris. Hepes INT solutions at both acidic and basic pH gave similar results (not shown). Mechanical stimulation was applied through an open loop pressure generating system and monitored at the level of the patch pipette throughout the experiment by a calibrated pressure sensor. This system provides a stable pressure pulse (16Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Pressure-effect relationships were fitted with Boltzmann equations. AA was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 100 mm, flushed with argon, and kept at −20 °C for 1 week. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. TREK-1 cDNA was transiently transfected in COS cells, and channel activity was recorded using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. In a cell voltage-clamped at 0 mV, AA superfusion induces a strong outward current (Fig.1 A). In the same cell, repetitive application of 90 mmHCO3−, which produces intracellular acidification (31Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Frelin C. Vigne P. Ladoux A. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), mimics AA stimulation (5.5 ± 0.5-fold increase, n = 29 at 0 mV). Both AA and HCO3− are ineffective on control mock-transfected cells (0.5 ± 0.4, n = 7) (Fig.1 B). Moreover, substitution of 90 mm NaCl by an equivalent concentration of sodium gluconate does not mimic the activation of TREK-1 by NaHCO3 (n = 6). The I-V curve of the current induced by HCO3− shows a prominent outward going rectification in physiological K+ conditions and reverses at the predicted EK+ value of −80 mV (Fig. 1 C). When external Na+ is substituted with K+, the reversal potential shifts to 0 mV, and the I-V curve remains outwardly rectifying (Fig. 1 D). AA similarly activates TRAAK, while HCO3− is ineffective (0.9 ± 0.1, n = 17) (Fig. 1 E). The activation of TREK-1 by the addition of HCO3− is also observed at the single channel level in the cell-attached patch configuration (n = 13) (Fig.2 A). In this configuration, the pH of the external solution bathing channels under recording is clamped by the pipette medium (pH 7.2), and channel modulation is expected to be due to intracellular effects. In this experiment, the activity of the mechano-gated channel TREK-1 is recorded both at atmospheric pressure and during the application of a −66 mm Hg pressure stimulation (Fig. 2 A, inset). At atmospheric pressure, channel activity (NPo) is very low (0.80 ± 0.22, n = 27). Both the resting and the pressure-induced activities are reversibly stimulated by the HCO3− addition (Fig. 2 A). Superfusion of a CO2-rich solution, which also produces a strong intracellular acidification (32Frelin C. Vigne P. Ladoux A. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), leads to TREK-1 opening in the cell-attached patch configuration (n = 15) (Fig.2 B). Again, both basal and stretch-induced activities are strongly stimulated. The current induced by CO2 is outwardly rectifying and reverses at −80 mV (Fig. 2 B, inset). Another classical approach to alter pHi-regulated mechanisms is the NH4Cl prepulse technique, which relies on the greater membrane permeability for NH3 than for NH4+ ions (32Frelin C. Vigne P. Ladoux A. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The addition of NH4Cl (producing intracellular alkalinization) does not affect TREK-1 channel activity, while washout of NH4Cl (producing intracellular acidosis) strongly stimulates TREK-1 channel activity (n = 6) (Fig.2 C). The current activated by NH4Cl withdrawal similarly displays a strong outward rectification (Fig. 2 C). The effects of intracellular acidification were also studied on excised inside-out patches expressing TREK-1 (Fig.3). Channel activity was recorded at both atmospheric pressure and during membrane stretch. Gradual intracellular acidification from 7.2 to 5.0 induces channel opening at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 3, A and B). NPo is strongly increased, while the single channel conductance is gradually decreased by internal acidosis (Fig. 3 B). Half-maximal activation is induced at pHi 6.0, and a drop of 0.7 pHi unit already produces a significant increase in channel activity (Fig.3 B). A −42 mm Hg stretch induces a robust channel opening at intracellular pH between 7.2 and 6.0, although it fails to further open TREK-1 at pHi 5.0 (Fig. 3 A). The pressure-activity relationship of TREK-1 is presented in Fig.3C. At physiological intracellular pH 7.2, the pressure-activity relationship is described by a Boltzmann function with a pressure required for half-maximal activity (P0.5) of −36.8 ± 2.1 mm Hg (n = 13). Progressive lowering in pHi gradually shifts the P0.5 toward positive values, leading to constitutive channel activity under atmospheric pressure at pHi 5.0 (Fig. 3, C and D). Half-maximal effect is observed at pH 5.9 (Fig. 3 D). The modulation of channel activity by intracellular acidification was studied on deleted TREK-1 mutants in the inside-out patch configuration. We used a protocol including two acidic steps to pHi 6.0 and 5.0 at both atmospheric pressure and during a −66 mm Hg stretch (Fig. 4, B–D). Lowering internal pH from 7.2 to 6.0 reversibly induces TREK-1 wild type opening at atmospheric pressure and slightly potentiates channel activity during stretch (Fig.4 B). Lowering internal pH to 5.0 further opens TREK-1 at atmospheric pressure with no additional effect at −66 mm Hg. Deletion of the N-terminal region of TREK-1 does not alter pHi sensitivity or mechano-gating (n= 5; data not shown). However, serial deletion of the C terminus progressively impairs TREK-1 activation by pHi (Fig.4 E). Like TREK-1 wild type, at atmospheric pressure, Δ46 is opened at pH 6.0 and 5.0 (Fig. 4 E, second panel), while the next deletion inward, Δ89, lacks activation at pH 6.0 and is only mildly opened at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4, C and E, third panel). Activation of Δ89 by a membrane stretch of −66 mm Hg is strongly potentiated at both pH 6.0 and pH 5.0 (Fig. 4, C and E, third panel). Δ100 is only weakly activated at atmospheric pressure by pH 5.0, and channel activity induced by a −66 mm Hg stretch is only enhanced at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4 E, fourth panel). Δ103 is not opened at atmospheric pressure by internal acidification at either pH 6.0 or pH 5.0, and stimulation of the stretch-induced activity is only observed at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4, D and E, fifth panel). No channel activity is detected with Δ113 at both pressures and at all pH conditions tested (n = 7). Progressive deletion of the cytosolic region of TREK-1 shifts the pressure-activity curve toward more negative values, leading to less sensitive mutant channels (Fig. 5, A–C). For instance, the relationship for Δ103 is about 60 mm Hg more negative compared with that of TREK-1 at pH 7.2 (Figs.3 C and 5 C). Lowering pHi to 6.0 and then 5.0 gradually shifts the relationship toward more positive values and strongly stimulates channel activity elicited by pressure (Figs.4 D and 5 C). Unlike TREK-1, TRAAK, the other stretch- and AA-sensitive member of the 4TMS/2P K+ channel family (P0.5 = −46 ± 2 at pH 7.2; n = 7) is quite insensitive to intracellular acidosis (Figs. 1 E and6, A and D). However, the high pHi sensitivity of TREK-1 can be transferred to TRAAK when the proximal C-terminal regions are exchanged (Fig. 6, B, C, and E). As observed for TREK-1, internal acidosis shifts the pressure-activity curve toward positive values, resulting in the opening of the TRAAK/TREK-1 chimera at atmospheric pressure (P0.5 = −40 ± 3, n = 7; P0.5 = −32 ± 5, n = 4; P0.5 = −26 ± 3, n = 4, at pH 7.2, 6.0, and 5.0, respectively). Moreover, HCO3− superfusion induces a strong stimulation of the whole cell membrane current of the TRAAK/TREK-1 chimera (3.8 ± 0.4, n = 10), although it has no effect on TRAAK (0.9 ± 0.1, n= 17) (Fig. 1 E). Mammalian mechano-gated K+ channels have been previously described in atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes, in neurons from mesencephalic and hypothalamic areas of the brain as well as in kidney (17Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Kim D. Duff R.A.

Negative pressure applied to cell-attached patches activates K+ channels (17Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Kim D. Duff R.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Kim D.H. Sladek C.D. Aguadovelasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pressure to induce half-maximal activation is between −12 and −18 mm Hg at +40 mV. I-V curves are outwardly rectifying, and single channel conductances are 94 and 143 picosiemens at +60 mV in symmetrical K+ for cardiac and brain cells, respectively. Openings induced by stretch are typically bursty and flickery. The probability of these channels to open at a fixed pressure is voltage-dependent with a higher opening at depolarized potentials. Both cardiac and neuronal channels are similarly opened by AA and other lipophilic compounds in the micromolar range (17Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Kim D. Duff R.A. Circ.

AA activation is found in cells treated with cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors, indicating that AA itself can directly activate these channels. Unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, and docosahexaenoic acids) but not saturated fatty acids also activate these channels. A very important property of these native mechano-gated arachidonic-sensitive K+ channels is that they are also stimulated by lowering cytoplasmic pH over the range 7.2–5.6 (17Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Kim D.H. Sladek C.D. Aguadovelasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the channels are more sensitive to pressure at acidic intracellular pH. Two recently cloned 4TMS/2P channels, TREK-1 and TRAAK (1Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

Both channels are activated by shear stress, cell swelling, and membrane stretch (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

Moreover, TREK-1 and TRAAK are opened by AA, linoleic, linolenic, and docosahexaenoic acids but are resistant to saturated fatty acids (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

The single channel conductance of about 100 pS at +50 mV in symmetrical K+, the outward going rectification, the bursty and flickery openings, and the voltage dependence are identical to described endogenous channels (2Patel A.J.

Sladek C.D. Aguadovelasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mechano-gated K+ channel TREK-1 is opened, like native cardiac and neuronal mechano-sensitive K+ channels (17Kim D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Kim D. Duff R.A. Circ.

(Lond.). 1995; 484: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), by intracellular acidosis. The mechanism by which pHivariations activate TREK-1 involves a shift of the pressure-activity curve toward positive pressures, leading to constitutive channel opening at atmospheric pressure under mild internal acidosis. The acidic stimulation of TREK-1 was seen in whole cell (mediated by HCO3−), cell-attached (mediated by HCO3−, CO2, and NH4Cl prepulse), and excised inside-out patch configuration (internal acidification), suggesting that protons directly affect channel activity. To our knowledge, TREK-1 is the only cloned K+ channel reported so far to be directly opened by intracellular acidosis. TRAAK is significantly (p < 0.05) less sensitive to stretch (P0.5 = −46 ± 2 mm Hg) (16Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) compared with TREK-1 (P0.5 = −36 ± 2 mm Hg). It is also much less sensitive to pHi variations. This is a major difference between the two channels, which can now be used to ascribe a native AA- and mechanosensitive K+ channel to TREK-1 rather than to TRAAK. Another major difference between TREK-1 and TRAAK is the lack of inhibition by cAMP (7Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-333 in the carboxyl terminus of TREK-1 is responsible for the cAMP-induced down-modulation (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The possibility that intracellular acidosis mediates TREK-1 opening via an interaction with the protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is not present in the TRAAK structure, is ruled out, since Δ89, which lacks Ser-333 and is not sensitive to cAMP, remains stimulated by low pHi. Deletion and chimeric analysis indicate that the pHi-sensitive region of TREK-1 is located in the carboxyl-terminal region between Val-298 and Thr-368 (Δ113–Δ46 region). Further deletion in this carboxyl-terminal region impairs activation by stretch, AA, and pHi, demonstrating its critical importance for channel function (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to pHi is conferred to TRAAK when the proximal carboxyl terminus of TREK-1 is exchanged with TRAAK, demonstrating that the region between Δ46 and the fourth TMS is necessary and sufficient to provide pH sensitivity. Progressive deletions of the carboxyl terminus of TREK-1 show that pHisensitivity as well as mechano-gating is gradually altered. These results indicate that the whole segment (Val-298 to Thr-368) is probably involved in acidic and stretch modulation and that several amino acids may indeed be involved. TREK-1 is modulated by a variety of mechanical stimuli such as stretch, swelling, and shear stress and by a variety of chemical stimuli including AA, ligands producing cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, and acidic stimuli (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nature Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). TREK-1 is therefore an example of molecular integrator. Furthermore, mechanical activation of TREK-1 is enhanced by intracellular acidosis, demonstrating that a response to one type of stimulus alters the sensitivity to others. By integrating multiple stimuli, TREK-1 probably fulfills an essential physiological function in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Under physiological conditions, effectors of TREK-1 activity are probably stretch, AA, and neurotransmitters or hormones that increase intracellular cAMP (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that activation of TREK-1 by acidification of the intracellular medium is an important physiological stimulus, although one cannot eliminate transient variations below pHi 7.0 (33Takahashi K.I. Copenhager D.R. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protection against an exaggerated cellular Ca2+ invasion is one of the important roles of several types of K+ channels (34Weiss J.N. Venkatesh N. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 3: 499-505Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24 Suppl. 4: 1-5Google Scholar). This has been particularly well established for the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa2+ channels of the BK type) as well as for ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) (36Heurteaux C. Lauritzen I. Widmann C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 37Heurteaux C. Bertaina V. Widmann C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ invades a cell, one of the ways to resist further Ca2+ invasion (which would be deleterious), from voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and/or through NMDA receptors, is hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization puts the cell membrane potential far from the threshold of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel activation and favors the NMDA receptor-associated Ca2+-permeable channel blockade by Mg2+. It has been particularly well demonstrated that, when hypoxia, anoxia, or/and hypoglycemia occur, the associated decrease of intracellular ATP and the related increase of intracellular ADP result in the activation of KATP channels (34Weiss J.N. Venkatesh N. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 3: 499-505Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24 Suppl. 4: 1-5Google Scholar, 39Fosset M. De Weille J.R.

This activation produced by inhibition of the energetic metabolism is protective in tissues where the channel is expressed such as in the heart or brain (35Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24 Suppl. 4: 1-5Google Scholar). In conditions of intracellular acidification, which would occur in many physiopathological situations such as brain or heart ischemia, opening of TREK-1 (KHi channel mode) may fulfill a similar protective role. TREK-1 channels in the KHi channel mode could work in concert with KCa2+ (BK type) and KATP channels. Cellular swelling, which also accompanies ischemia (42Patel A.J. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3117-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), would increase the effect of intracellular acidification on the activity of the TREK-1 channel (2Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Ischemia in heart and brain is associated with a major K+ efflux (34Weiss J.N. Venkatesh N. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 3: 499-505Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24 Suppl. 4: 1-5Google Scholar, 43Shivkumar K. Deutsch N.A. Lamp S.T. Khuu K. Goldhaber J.I. Weiss J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This efflux is supposed to be through K+ channels that open under these conditions (34Weiss J.N. Venkatesh N. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1993; 3: 499-505Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar,35Lazdunski M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24 Suppl. 4: 1-5Google Scholar). However, specific blockers of KCa2+channels or of KATP channels do not eliminate this efflux (43Shivkumar K. Deutsch N.A. Lamp S.T. Khuu K. Goldhaber J.I. Weiss J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44Schaeffer P. Lazdunski M. Brain Res. 1990; 539: 155-158Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TREK-1 channels may thus constitute an important pathway for this K+ efflux. We are grateful to M. Jodar and D. Doume for excellent technical assistance."

To determine the physiological role of CD36, we examined effects of its overexpression in muscle, a tissue that depends on FA for its energy needs and is responsible for clearing a major fraction of circulating FA. Mice with CD36 overexpression in muscle were generated using the promoter of the muscle creatine kinase gene (MCK). Transgenic (MCK-CD36) mice had a slightly lower body weight than control litter mates. This reflected a leaner body mass with less overall adipose tissue, as evidenced by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Soleus muscles from transgenic animals exhibited a greatly enhanced ability to oxidize fatty acids in response to stimulation/contraction. This increased oxidative ability was not associated with significant alterations in histological appearance of muscle fibers. Transgenic mice had lower blood levels of triglycerides and fatty acids and a reduced triglyceride content of very low density lipoproteins. Blood cholesterol levels were slightly lower, but no significant decrease in the cholesterol content of major lipoprotein fractions was measured. Blood glucose was significantly increased, while insulin levels were similar in the fed state and higher in the fasted state. However, glucose tolerance curves, determined at 20 weeks of age, were similar in control and transgenic mice. In summary, the study documented, in vivo, the role of CD36 to facilitate cellular FA uptake.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). CD36 mRNA is also a marker of preadipocyte differentiation, and its early induction, is paralleled with an increase in membrane FA transport (4Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, CD36 has been identified as a causal gene at the peak of linkage for defects in FA and glucose metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (13Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M. Mann C.J. Shoulders C.C. Graf D. St. Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), a rodent model of insulin resistance. There is indirect evidence to support the role of CD36 in muscle FA uptake. In rats, expression is higher in oxidative as opposed to glycolytic muscles (14Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar), and there is good correlation between CD36 levels and relative rates of FA transport (15Luiken J.J.F.P. Turcotte L.P. Bonen A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, several studies, using an iodinated FA derivative, BMIPP (16Caveliers V. Franken P.R. Lin Q. Mokler F.T. Luo H. Knapp Jr., F.F. J. Nucl. Med. 1998; 39: 1672-1675PubMed Google Scholar), reported an association between defective myocardial FA uptake, hypertrophic cardiac myopathy, and deficiency of CD36 (17Kashiwagi H. Tomiyama Y. Nozaki S. Honda S. Kosugi S. Shiraga M. Nakagawa T. Nagao N. Kanakura Y. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

To directly assess the role of CD36 in mediating muscle FA uptake, in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model with overexpression of CD36 targeted to muscle tissues. Muscle is a primary FA consumer and derives a large fraction of the energy needed from FA oxidation. In addition, the role that muscle mass plays in FA clearance and in FA-mediated development of insulin resistance is well established (19Jucker B.M. Rennings A.J. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10464-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on this, we hypothesized that if CD36 determined FA uptake and utilization by muscle, its overexpression in this tissue should play a uniquely important role in regulating metabolism in general. We report that muscle-targeted overexpression of CD36 was associated with enhanced muscle FA oxidation and with alterations in body fat and in blood levels of FA, triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. The [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from ICN. The nylon (Hybond N+) membranes and the enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection system (ECL) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Enzymes for RNA and DNA manipulation and the random-primed kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RNA STAT-60 kit was from Tel-Test Inc. (Friendswood, TX). The polyclonal CD36 antibody was generated in rabbits against rat adipocyte CD36, and the monoclonal antibody against human CD36 was a kind gift from Dr. Narendra Tandon. Kodak films, FA, and all other chemical products were from Sigma. Cloning was performed according to Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A 1.7-kb DNA fragment, containing 1.3 kb of rat CD36 coding sequence and the polyadenylation signal, were cloned in pBluescript under the control of the regulatory sequences (3.3 kb) of the mouse creatine kinase gene (MCK). The procedure was as described by Levak-Frank et al. (21Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) for muscle over expression of lipoprotein lipase. The linear MCK-CD36 minigene, prepared by cutting the plasmid with Hin dIII and Sal I, was injected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs from superovulated females of the FVB line that had been mated with males from the same genetic background. Microinjected eggs were transferred into the oviducts of surrogate females. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot screening of genomic DNA from tail biopsies. The DNA was digested with Pst I and probed with radiolabeled 1.3-kb CD36 cDNA. Mice homozygotes for the transgene (identified by litters that screened 100% positive) were generated. Preliminary tests showed similar blood profiles of homozygotes and heterozygotes, and only heterozygotes were used for the experiments reported in this study. Controls (negative for the transgene) were derived from the litter of heterozygote parents. In some cases the mice (transgenic and controls) used for experiments were from the same litter. In other cases, they were from different litters but were matched for age, sex and, whenever possible, litter size. Mice were used for studies between 16 and 20 weeks of age. Tissues were excised from euthanized mice, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples (100 mg) were Dounce-homogenized in STAT-60 buffer, as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) and using the RNA STAT-60 kit. The RNA, electrophoresed on denaturing agarose gel, was transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes and probed with randomly primed32P-labeled DNA probes (106 cpm/ml) (4Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as internal standard. Muscle or heart tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold TES buffer (20 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 250 mm sucrose). The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000 × g) to yield a pellet P1 and a supernatant, S1. P1 was layered on 38% sucrose and centrifuged at 86,000 ×g to pellet out mitochondria and nuclei (P2). The band at the interphase was harvested, diluted (1:7) in TES buffer, and centrifuged at 350,000 × g to yield a total microsomal pellet (P3). Samples from both P1 and P3 (20–50 μg of protein) were subjected to electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) followed by transfer to a nylon-supported nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, the membrane was incubated with anti-CD36 antibody (2 h, 1:1000 dilution), washed, then incubated (1 h, 1:10,000) with secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Detection of immune complex was according to the directions of the ECL kit. Control and MCK-CD36 mice, age- and sex-matched and derived from the same litter or from litters of similar size, were used for magnetic resonance imaging. All studies used a Varian UnityInova equipped with a 400 MHz magnet. Mice, anesthetized with 14 mg of ketamine-1.8 mg of xylazine/100 g, were immersed, rostral end up, half-way in a tube of2H2O to give an axially oriented cylinder of nearly uniform bulk magnetic susceptibility. Single or multislice images (field of view (3 cm)2, slice thickness 1 mm, matrix (128)2, repetition time/echo time 1000/20 ms) were obtained with interslice spacings of 1 mm. These parameters yield images that are somewhat “T1-weighted.” Tissues, quickly rinsed in saline, were immersed in embedding medium (EMS, Fort Washington, PA). Staining with Oil Red O and with hematoxylin were done by American Histolab Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). For electron microscopy, rinsed tissues were fixed (24 h) in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, all at 4 °C. After a brief buffer wash, samples were fixed (1 h, 4 °C) in 4% osmium tetroxide in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Epon. Sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed with lead citrate and viewed in a Jeol 1200EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV. The soleus muscle isolated from each hindlimb was incubated in vitro (30o, 95/5% O2/CO2) in 1.5 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, containing 4% FA-free bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose, and 0.3 mmpalmitate (9–10-3H, 3 mCi/vial). One muscle was studied at rest (30 min) while the other, from the same animal, was made to contract (20 tetani/min for 30 min) by electrical stimulation (150 ms trains of 0.1-ms impulses (20–40 V; 60 Hz). Oxidized palmitate was estimated from the 3H2O produced in 0.5 ml of incubation medium after separation from labeled substrate; 2.5 ml of methanol:chloroform (2:1) and 1 ml of 2 m KCl:HCl were added and followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous phase (1 ml) was treated once more, and an aliquot (0.5 ml) was taken for counting. FA incorporation into lipid was determined after extraction of the incubated muscle (24Dyck D.J. Peters S.J. Glatz J. Gorski J. Keizer H. Kiens B. Liu S. Richter E.A. Spriet L.L. van der Vusse G.J. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E340-E351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dyck D.J. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E888-E896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thin layer chromatography (silica GF 250 microns, Analtech, Newark, DE) of the extract (50 μl). Control and transgenic mice were fed a chow diet ad libitum. Blood was taken from fed or 12-h fasted animals into EDTA-rinsed capillaries, and plasma was immediately prepared. Cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were determined using enzymatic kits from Sigma. FFA were measured using the Wako kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) and insulin using a kit from Linco Research Inc. (St. Louis, MO). For lipoprotein determination, plasma was pooled after centrifugation of blood samples (1000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and subjected to ultracentrifugation (36,000 rpm, SW 41 rotor, 48 h, 12 °C) in a saline potassium bromide gradient (26Goulinet S. Chapman M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 943-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were collected by density (grams/milliliter); very low density lipoproteins and intermediate density lipoproteins (VLDL + IDL), d< 1.018; low density lipoproteins (LDL), 1.018 <d < 1.063; high density lipoproteins (HDL), 1.063 < d < 1.210). Following a 4-h fast, mice were injected via a lateral tail vein with 100 μl of d-glucose solution (1 mg/g of body weight). Blood was obtained from a small blunt cut of the tip of the tail and glucose was measured using a Precision Q.I.D. monitoring system before (0) and 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose administration (27Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Shepherd P.R. Bliss J.L. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows a Southern blot of DNA from animals positive for the CD36 minigene, while signal was undetectable in DNA from controls. Controls were animals negative for the transgene and were derived from heterozygote parents. B and C show that muscle tissues from transgenic animals exhibited enhanced expression of CD36 mRNA (3–4-fold) and protein (2–4-fold) as compared with control littermates. mRNA levels for lipoprotein lipase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were examined, as internal controls, in muscle tissues from control and transgenic mice and found not be altered. Tissues other than muscle (adipose, liver) from MCK-CD36 mice did not show alterations in CD36 expression (data not shown). MCK-CD36 mice developed normally with no incidence of disease noted, but they exhibited smaller body weight than littermate controls during the first 6 months of growth. For male mice (Fig.2 A), the difference ranged from 13 to 15% and was significant throughout the 14 week growth curve. It was of smaller magnitude for females and significant only during early growth (Fig. 2 B). Litter size, which can determine pup nutrition and early development, was taken into consideration in the weight comparison by matching liter size distribution in both groups. Magnetic resonance images of control and transgenic mice derived from the same litter or from similar size litters showed that the MCK-CD36 mice had less overall body fat (Fig.3 A). The mice sets compared were matched for age (16–20 weeks) and sex. The difference in body fat content was apparent at all image levels taken from the abdomen region to the tail of the animal. Distribution of fat tissue did not appear to be altered. Fig. 3 B compares images of calves from control (panel a) and MCK-CD36 (panel b) 16-week-old male mice. The region of interest spectrum from the MCK-CD36 leg shows a lipid/water ratio of 2% as compared with 7% in the case of the control (Fig. 3 C). These spectra are expanded in Fig.3 D. Light microscopic examination of muscle tissues from control and transgenic mice showed similar fiber structure and organization and no evidence of neutral lipid depots in cross-sections of myocardium or skeletal muscle, stained with Oil Red O. Electron microscopy on two sets of samples from cardiac and skeletal muscles identified no changes in appearance of cell organelles or in number of mitochondria. Palmitate oxidation by soleus muscle, incubated in vitro, was compared for a group of control and MCK-CD36 mice (16–20 weeks old). Oxidation by the muscle at rest was similar for both groups. It increased in response to stimulation-induced contraction. The increase averaged 1.9-fold in muscles from control mice, which was in line with previous observations (24Dyck D.J. Peters S.J. Glatz J. Gorski J. Keizer H. Kiens B. Liu S. Richter E.A. Spriet L.L. van der Vusse G.J. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E340-E351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dyck D.J. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E888-E896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the increase averaged 5.6-fold in MCK-CD36 muscles, indicating a greatly enhanced capacity to increase FA oxidation in response to contraction (TableI). The magnitude of the increase varied between MCK-CD36 mice, most likely reflecting differences in degree of CD36 overexpression. Despite this variability, in all cases, soleus muscles from transgenic mice exhibited a higher ability to oxidize FA in response to contraction than the corresponding muscles from matched controls. FA incorporation into cellular lipids (monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids) did not show significant differences between the two groups .Table IComparison of palmitate oxidation and incorporation into lipids by soleus muscles from control and MCK-CD36 miceControlMCK-CD36RestContractionRestContractionnmol/g muscle/30 minnmol/g muscle/30 minOxidation15.1 ± 5.228.8 ± 2.522.2 ± 3.9114.01-ap < 0.05, n = 6, four males and two females in each group. ± 42.8TG87.3 ± 13.798.3 ± 14.876.1 ± 12.481.2 ± 4.5DG14.2 ± 1.917.8 ± 0.813.0 ± 1.412.9 ± 1.8MG1.3 ± 0.131.3 ± 0.101.2 ± 0.171.1 ± 0.09PL15.4 ± 1.517.2 ± 2.314.4 ± 1.313.7 ± 1.2Control and transgenic mice were 16–20 weeks old and were derived from similar size litters.

Plasma triglycerides (TG) were about 30% (p < 0.001) lower in transgenic mice (TableII). Fasting lowered TG in control and transgenic mice to a similar extent so the difference between the groups persisted (p < 0.001). The decrease in blood TG in MCK-CD36 mice was pronounced in the VLDL fraction, which lost 40% of its TG content (Fig. 4). Smaller decreases were noted in other lipoprotein fractions.Table IIPlasma levels of triglycerides (TG), fatty acids (FFA), cholesterol (Ch), glucose (Glc), and Insulin (Ins) in control and MCK-CD36 miceFastedFedControlMCK-CD36ControlMCK-CD36TG (mg/dl)137.6 ± 10.882.3 ± 3.82-ap < 0.001, n = 12 for control and transgenic mice in both fed and fasted states.173.6 ± 13.1115.7 ± 5.22-ap < 0.001, n = 12 for control and transgenic mice in both fed and fasted states.FFA (mEq/liter)1.04 ± 0.090.70 ± 0.062-bp < 0.01, n = 8 for fasted control and MCK-CD36 mice.0.76 ± 0.060.67 ± 0.032-cp < 0.05, n = 10 for fed control and MCK-CD36 mice.Ch (mg/dl)147.4 ± 4.1130.5 ± 6.22-dp < 0.05, n = 12.Glc (mg/dl)118.7 ± 7.5171.7 ± 6.82-ep < 0.001, n = 14 for fasted control and MCK-CD36 mice.152.0 ± 7.8206.8 ± 11.22-fp < 0.005, n = 10 for fed control and MCK-CD36 mice.Ins (ng/dl)0.20 ± 0.0280.36 ± 0.0302-gp < 0.05, n = 6.0.38 ± 0.0500.49 ± 0.097Mice (16–20 weeks old) were fasted for 12 h.

Open table in a new tab Mice (16–20 weeks old) were fasted for 12 h. Blood was collected from the tail vein into EDTA-coated capillary tubes and centrifuged to separate out plasma, which was used to assay TG, FFA, Ch, Glc, and Ins. Control and transgenic mice were either from the same litter or from similar size litters of parents heterozygotes for the transgene. Plasma FA (Table II) were lower in transgenic mice with the difference most apparent after an overnight fast (p < 0.01) as FA increased with fasting in controls but not in transgenic mice. Plasma cholesterol (Table II) was slightly lower (about 11%) in transgenic mice as compared with control litter mates (p < 0.05). Cholesterol levels were not significantly changed by fasting, so data were pooled. No significant change was measured in cholesterol content of lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) from transgenic mice (data not shown). In contrast to the decreases observed in all blood lipids, glucose levels were increased by about 30% in transgenic mice (Table II) in both the fed and fasted states. Insulin levels were not significantly different in fed mice but increased about 2-fold after an overnight fast (Table II). However, MCK-CD36 mice, tested at 20 weeks of age, did not exhibit clear signs of poor glucose tolerance. As shown in Fig.5, following an intravenous glucose load (1 mg/g), plasma glucose levels peaked and then declined in a similar fashion in control and MCK-CD36 mice. This study examined the metabolic effects of overexpressing CD36 in muscle tissues. Several conclusions can be drawn from the findings. First, CD36 expression determines FA utilization by a tissue, in this case muscle. Second, CD36 level in muscle can impact lean body mass and blood lipids, most notably FA and triglycerides. Third, CD36 expression, by determining muscle FA utilization, can modulate glucose and insulin levels. The main conclusion of the studies described is that CD36, in vivo, functions as a transporter of long chain FA by muscle, and the transport step rate-limits and determines FA utilization. Muscle overexpressing CD36 had an increased capacity for uptake and oxidation of blood FA, which reduced the FA available for hepatic triglyceride synthesis. As a result, MCK-CD36 mice exhibited lower levels of total and VLDL triglycerides and a general decrease in body fat. FA oxidation by muscle from control animals increased 1.9-fold in response to contraction while that from transgenics increased 5.6-fold. The increase in control muscles is consistent with the previous finding that long term (7 days), low frequency-stimulated muscle contraction produced 2-fold increases in both membrane CD36 expression and FA transport across sarcolemmal vesicles (14Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). The larger increase (5.6-fold) in FA oxidation by muscle overexpressing CD36 indicates that oxidation is rate-limited by FA uptake at the plasma membrane. So increasing transport capacity allows parallel increases in oxidative capacity. Although CD36 overexpression did not alter FA oxidation by the resting soleus, this may reflect the fact that resting muscle, in vitro, is under little tension, and its FA metabolism may be low enough so as not to be limited by uptake, a situation unlikely to be encountered physiologically. FA oxidation by the resting soleus in our studies was lower than estimates obtained from CO2release by the mixed muscles of the perfused hindlimb (28Turcotte L.P. Petry C. Kiens B. Richter E.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1788-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (0.5 nmol/g/min versus about 2 nmol/g/min). An alternative explanation is that most of the CD36 pool in muscle at rest is intracellular and is recruited by contraction into the plasma membrane, as was demonstrated for the glucose transporter, Glut4 (29Dohm G.L. Dudek R.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 441: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, no other evidence suggests such a mechanism. The data in soleus muscle highlight a tight coupling between FA transport and oxidation. CD36 overexpression increased palmitate oxidation by contracting muscle but not its esterification into neutral lipids, which is consistent with findings from the magnetic resonance imaging and histology indicating no increase and possibly a decrease in intramuscular lipid depots in muscle from transgenic mice (Fig. 3). FA esterification may increase when oxidation is impaired or when it is over saturated by FA supply. Accumulation of FA-acyl-intermediates may then stimulate triglyceride synthesis, possibly at the level of the key enzyme, diglyceride acyltransferase. The findings in transgenic MCK-CD36 mice add to an increasing body of evidence supporting the role of CD36 in FA transport. The protein, purified from adipose tissue, bound long chain FA in vitro (30Baillie A.G.S. Coburn C.T. Abumrad N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Expression of the coding sequence of FAT/CD36 in the sense and antisense orientation in mammalian cells (fibroblasts and preadipocytes, respectively) resulted in the expected changes in FA transport (31, 32,). Important recent evidence was contributed with generation of mice null for CD36 by Febbraio et al. (33Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F.A. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The mice exhibited a lipid profile, which was opposite to the one observed in MCK-CD36 mice, with significant increases in blood FA, TG, and cholesterol. Isolated adipocytes from CD36 null mice lacked the high affinity saturable component of FA transport. The increase in blood glucose levels in MCK-CD36 mice may have reflected the combined effects of FA-induced sparing of glucose utilization by muscle as well as those resulting from possible alterations in insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production. FA stimulate basal insulin secretion at the same time that they decrease beta cell insulin stores (34Bollheimer L.C. Skelly R.H. Chester M.W. Mc Garry J.D. Rhodes C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In muscle tissues, FA inhibit insulin stimulation of glucose transport and phosphorylation (35Roden M. Price T.B. Perseghin G. Petersen K.F. Rothman D.L. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2859-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). It would appear that resistance to insulin was not the underlying cause for the hyperglycemia and for the 2-fold higher insulin in fasted transgenic mice at the age we tested them (20 weeks). However, it remains to be determined if MCK/CD36 mice will develop glucose intolerance as they advance in age or as they are challenged by high fat diets. In addition, since susceptibility to these effects is dependent on the mouse strain, strains other than FVB will also have to be examined (36Harlan D.M. Barnett M.A. Abe R. Pechhold K. Patterson N.B. Gray G.S. June C.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 816-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is interesting to point out two lines of evidence that suggest a link between CD36 expression and insulin responsiveness. A causal genetic linkage between deficiency in CD36 and symptoms of insulin resistance was recently noted in SH rats (13Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M. Mann C.J. Shoulders C.C. Graf D. St. Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Also, many insulin-sensitizing drugs are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and strong CD36 inducers (11Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 37Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), and one of the earliest and most notable effects of these drugs in diabetic animals is a drop in blood FA (38Burant C.F. Sreenan S. Hirano K. Tai T.A. Lohmiller J. Lukens J. Davidson N.O. Ross S. Graves R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The findings with MCK-CD36 mice are likely to be relevant to the human situation. CD36 deficiency is prevalent in 0.3–1% of the population. The most common cases involve one nucleotide (1159) insertion in codon 317, which leads to a frameshift and the appearance of a premature stop codon (17Kashiwagi H. Tomiyama Y. Nozaki S. Honda S. Kosugi S. Shiraga M. Nakagawa T. Nagao N. Kanakura Y. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and one amino acid substitution (Cys478 to Thr) (39Kashiwagi H. Tomiyama Y. Honda S. Kosugi S. Shiraga M. Nagao N. Sekiguchi S. Kanayama Y. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previous reports documented an association between deficiency in CD36, defective myocardial FA uptake and certain forms of heart disease in humans (17Kashiwagi H. Tomiyama Y. Nozaki S. Honda S. Kosugi S. Shiraga M. Nakagawa T. Nagao N. Kanakura Y. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Tanaka T. Okamoto F.

Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Presence of numerous polymorphisms in the CD36 gene, which was documented in spontaneously hypertensive rats (13Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D. Norsworthy P.J. Wahid F.N. Al-Majali K.M. Trembling P.M. Mann C.J. Shoulders C.C. Graf D. St. Lezin E. Kurtz T.W. Kren V. Pravenec M. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Stanton L.W. Scott J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), may apply to the human situation. As we learn more about the metabolic effects of alterations in CD36 expression, it is likely that such alterations may underlie some disorders of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. For example, subjects with CD36 deficiency may have abnormalities in their ability to sustain endurance exercise. On the other hand, they might be more resistant to the negative effects of high fat diets such as obesity and atherosclerosis. In summary, this study documented the role of CD36 in membrane FA uptake by muscle and the role of uptake in regulating muscle FA utilization. Alterations in these processes were shown to impact the metabolic profile and lean mass of the animal. Tissue-targeted manipulation of CD36 expression in mice may provide unique models to examine the link between FA utilization, obesity, atherosclerosis, and insulin responsiveness of glucose metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2057818847,"Three glutathione peroxidase homologs (YKL026C, YBR244W, and YIR037W/HYR1) were found in the Saccharomyces Genome Database. We named them GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3, respectively, and we investigated the function of each gene product. The gpx3Δ mutant was hypersensitive to peroxides, whereas null mutants of the GPX1 and GPX2 did not show any obvious phenotypes. Glutathione peroxidase activity decreased approximately 57 and 93% in the gpx3Δ and gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutants, respectively, compared with that of wild type. Expression of the GPX3 gene was not induced by any stresses tested, whereas that of the GPX1 gene was induced by glucose starvation. The GPX2 gene expression was induced by oxidative stress, which was dependent upon the Yap1p. The TSA1 (thiol-specific antioxidant) gene encodes thioredoxin peroxidase that can reduce peroxides by using thioredoxin as a reducing power. Disruption of the TSA1 gene enhanced the basal expression level of the Yap1p target genes such as GSH1, GLR1, and GPX2 and that resulted in increases of total glutathione level and activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase. However, expression of the TSA1 gene did not increase in the gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutant. Therefore, de novo synthesis and recycling of glutathione were increased in the tsa1Δ mutant to maintain the catalytic cycle of glutathione peroxidase reaction efficiently as a backup system for thioredoxin peroxidase. Three glutathione peroxidase homologs (YKL026C, YBR244W, and YIR037W/HYR1) were found in the Saccharomyces Genome Database. We named them GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3, respectively, and we investigated the function of each gene product. The gpx3Δ mutant was hypersensitive to peroxides, whereas null mutants of the GPX1 and GPX2 did not show any obvious phenotypes. Glutathione peroxidase activity decreased approximately 57 and 93% in the gpx3Δ and gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutants, respectively, compared with that of wild type.

Molecular oxygen is reduced to H2O through acceptance of four electrons. During the reduction of molecular oxygen, several reactive oxygen species are formed, i.e. acceptance of one, two, and three electrons to form, respectively, superoxide anion radical (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (HO⋅). These reactive oxygen species attack almost all cell components, DNA, protein, and lipid membrane, and they sometimes cause lethal damage to the cells. Among the reactive oxygen species, HO⋅ as well as perhydroxyl radical (HOO⋅) can extract bis-allylic hydrogen atom of unsaturated fatty acid (LH) to form lipid alkyl radical (L⋅) (1Aikens J. Dix T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15091-15098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The L⋅ is oxidized by molecular oxygen to generate a lipid peroxy radical (LOO⋅), and the LOO⋅ thus formed reacts with LH to give lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and L⋅. A radical chain reaction is then propagated. LOOH also belongs to the reactive oxygen species, and the occurrence of the LOOHs in biological membranes may be one of the major oxidative damages to the cells. Because reactive oxygen species are commonplace in aerobic organisms, they have enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic defense systems. For example, superoxide dismutase catalyzes disproportions of O⨪2to O2 and H2O2, and H2O2 thus formed is decomposed to H2O and O2 by catalase. H2O2 as well as LOOH are reduced to H2O and corresponding alcohol by glutathione peroxidase (GPx).1 Ascorbate can also work as a reductant for ascorbate peroxidase in plants (2Asada K. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 715-735Google Scholar). β-Carotene and tocopherol function as radical scavengers. Glutathione is also a major antioxidant in aerobic cells. However, it has been widely believed that microorganisms do not have peroxidases whose electron donor is glutathione. Microorganisms are believed to use cytochrome c as an electron donor for the peroxidase reaction (cytochrome c peroxidase). GPx has been thought to be evolutionarily acquired by mammals. However, we have demonstrated that yeasts have GPx and that glutathione plays a crucial role in the defense line against reactive oxygen species. For example, we have previously shown that catalase-deficient (ctt1Δ/cta1Δ) mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed almost the same sensitivity to H2O2 compared with that of wild type, although the gsh1-deficient mutant was hypersensitive to H2O2 and could not show an adaptive response to oxidative stress (3Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 4Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The GSH1 gene encodes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase which is a rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione biosynthesis. Additionally, we purified GPx from the yeast Hansenula mrakii (5Tran L.-T. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GPx of H. mrakii was found in both the cytoplasmic membrane and the inner membrane of mitochondria, which is an organelle where a large amount of reactive oxygen species are generated during oxygen respiration (6Inoue Y. Tran L.-T. Kamakura M. Izawa S. Miki T. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We isolated H. mrakii as a LOOH-resistant yeast by screening (7Inoue Y. Ichiryu T. Yoshikawa K. Tran L.-T. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3289-3293Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the LOOH-sensitive mutants derived from H. mrakii could not induce GPx under the oxidative stress conditions (8Inoue Y. Tran L.-T. Kimura A. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1993; 75: 229-231Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). From these backgrounds, we have been persuaded that yeasts also must have the functional GPx (9Inoue Y. Kimura A. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Agricultural and Biological Chemistry. 2. Research Signpost, Trivandrum1998: 29-39Google Scholar). We searched the Saccharomyces Genome Data base for mammalian GPx homologs, and we found three hypothetical open reading frames (YKL026C, YBR244W, and YIR037W). One of them, YIR037W, has been referred to the HYR1 (hydrogen peroxide resistance) gene in the data base (GenBankTM accession number U22446), although its function has not yet been identified. Here we name them GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3, respectively, and disrupt each gene to investigate the functions through analysis of their phenotypes with respect to the oxidative stress response. The TSA1 gene has been cloned as a thiol-specific antioxidant, which protects glutamine synthetase from oxidative inactivation in S. cerevisiae (10Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Tsa1p was found to have peroxidase activity in coupling with thioredoxin as a reducing power, i.e. thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) (11Chae H.Z. Kim I.-H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.G. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). TPxs have been discovered widely from various types of cells ranging from those of yeasts to mammals, and they constitute a large peroxiredoxin family (14Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 15Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar). TPx can reduce H2O2 and LOOH in the presence of thioredoxin in reduced form, and oxidized form of thioredoxin is reduced by thioredoxin reductase with NADPH (Fig.1). This catalytic cycle is similar to that of GPx, i.e. GPx reduces H2O2and LOOH in the presence of reduced glutathione, and oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide) is reduced by glutathione reductase by using NADPH as a reducing power. In both reaction cycles, NADPH is oxidized to NADP+, and NADP+ thus formed is reduced to NADPH by an action of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1). In this paper, we also investigate the correlation between the GPx system and the TPx system in oxidative stress response, and we demonstrate here that GPx is partially functioning as a backup system for TPx in S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae YPH250 (MAT a trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 ade2-101 ura3-52) was obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California, Berkeley, and was used as a wild type strain. All disruptants in this study were constructed on the basis of the strain YPH250. The GPX1 gene (YKL026C) was cloned by PCR using the primers as follows: GPHF-1, 5′-AGTTAATGTTGGATCCG CCCGGG GAGTTAA-3′, and GPHR-1, 5′-CGCCCTGAAGGTCGACCGTGTAAGAATCCT-3′. The GPHF-1 and GPHR-1 were designed to contain the Bam HI site and Sal I site (underlined), respectively. The PCR product containing the GPX1 gene (1924 bp) was treated with Bam HI and Klenow and cloned to pUC19 which was digested by Eco RI and Sph I and then treated by Klenow to yield pUGPH6. The plasmid (pUGPH6) was digested with Eco RI and Sph I, treated with Klenow, and then the HIS3 gene was inserted to yield pGPX1ΔHis3. The resultant plasmid was digested by Sma I (which was designed to contain in the PCR primer GPHF-1, italicized) and Xba I, and the gpx1Δ::HIS3 cassette was used to disrupt the GPX1 gene. The disruption allele was designated gpx1-Δ1::HIS3. The GPX2 gene (YBR244W) was amplified by the following two primers: GPIF-1, 5′-GTTACCGTTCCCCGGGTTGGTCGACTTGAT-3′, and GPIR-1, 5′-GATCAAGCGTGTCGACATGCAACAAGAGGC-3′. Both primers were designed to have the Sal I site (underlined). The PCR product containing the PGX2 gene (1873 bp) was digested with Sal I, treated by Klenow, and then cloned to pUC19 which was treated by Xba I, Hin cII, and Klenow to give pUGI4. The plasmid (pUGI4) was digested with Xba I and Sty I followed by treatment with Klenow, and the URA3 gene was inserted to give pGPX2ΔUra3. The resultant plasmid was digested with Bam HI and Sph I, and the gpx2Δ::URA3 cassette was used to disrupt the GPX2 gene. The disruption allele was designated gpx2-Δ1::URA3. The GPX3 gene (YIR037W/HYR1) was amplified by the following primers: GPJF-1, 5′-ATCTTTCTGCACCCGGGTGTCGACGACGCC-3′, and GPJR-1, 5′-CCTCGTACCCGCATGCTCCAGTATGGTGAA-3′. The GPJF-1 and GPJR-1 were designed to contain the Sal I site and Sph I site (underlined), respectively. The PCR product containing the GPX3 gene (2387 bp) was digested by Sal I and Sph I and cloned to the Sal I and Sph I site of pUC19 to yield pUGPJ6. The plasmid (pUGPJ6) was digested with Stu I and Eco RV, and the LEU2 gene was inserted to yield pGPX3ΔLeu2. The resultant plasmid was digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII, and the gpx3Δ::LEU2 cassette was used to disrupt the GPX3 gene. The disruption allele was designated gpx3-Δ1::LEU2. The TSA1 gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers: TSA1F, 5′-AAATCGAGAGACCACGGGATTCGACACTCT-3′, and TSA1R, 5′-GGACGATTGATACTGGTGTTTAGCGGTGGT-3′. The PCR product containing TSA1 gene (2764 bp) was digested with Eco RI and Pst I and then cloned to Eco RI/Pst I site of pUC19 (pUTSA1). The pUTSA1 was digested with Sal I and Apa I followed by treatment with Klenow, and the TRP1 gene was cloned to give pTSA1ΔTrp1. The resultant plasmid was digested with Eco RI and Pst I, and the tsa1Δ::TRP1 cassette was used to disrupt the TSA1 gene. The disruption allele was designated tsa1-Δ1::TRP1. The yap1Δ mutant (yap1-Δ1::HIS3) was constructed by using the plasmid pSM27 (16Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The YAP1-overexpressing strain was constructed as described previously (17Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in YPD medium until A610 reached 0.5 (approximately 5 × 106 cells/ml) and were diluted with sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution. Ten microliters of each sample was spotted onto YPD agar plate containing 4.0 mm H2O2 or 1.5 mm t-BHP, and incubated at 28 °C for 2 days. Cells were cultured in YPD medium until A610 reached approximately 1.0, collected by centrifugation, and washed with 0.85% NaCl solution. Cells were resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and disrupted with glass beads. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the resultant supernatants were used as cell extracts. GPx activity was measured in a reaction mixture (1.0 ml) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0 mm glutathione, 1.0 mm t-BHP, 0.16 mm NADPH, 1.0 mm NaN3, 0.24 unit/ml glutathione reductase (Oriental Yeast Co., Kyoto, Japan), and cell extracts. Before the addition of t-BHP, the reaction mixture was kept at 25 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of t-BHP. Decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (A340-sample) was measured for 1 min. Three different blanks were taken for each assay for GPx activity. 1) To eliminate glutathione-independent NADPH-oxidizing activity, glutathione was omitted from the complete reaction mixture (A340-GSH). 2) To eliminate peroxide-independent NADPH-oxidizing activity, Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide) which was used to dilute t-BHP was added to the reaction mixture instead of t-BHP (A340-Me2SO). 3) To eliminate non-enzymatic NADPH consuming activity, cell extracts were omitted from the complete reaction mixture (A340-EXTR). To obtain the GPx activity (A340-GPx) in cell extracts, the following equation was used:A340-GPx = (A340-sample) − ((A340-GSH) + (A340-Me2SO) + (A340-EXTR)). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of glutathione per min at 25 °C. Millimolar absorption coefficient 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 for NADPH was used. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). To see the effect of several environmental stresses on expression of the GPX genes, cells of S. cerevisiae YPH250 were cultured in YPD medium until A610 reached approximately 1.0, and then concentrated solutions of various agents were added. In the case of osmotic stress experiment, solid NaCl was added to the culture. For heat shock experiment, the culture was transferred immediately to an incubator preheated at 37 °C, and then the culture was continued. For glucose-starvation experiment, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 28 °C, washed once with sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution, resuspended in fresh YPD medium without glucose (YP medium), and incubated at 28 °C. After 30 min incubation under each stressed condition, total RNA was prepared according to the method of Schmitt et al. (19Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Each GPX gene was labeled by [α-32P]dCTP, using a kit (Takara Co., Kyoto, Japan), and used as a probe. To see the effect of Yap1p on expression of the GPX gene, cells were cultured in SD minimum medium with appropriate amino acids and bases until A610reached approximately 1.0, and the total RNA was prepared as described above. Cells were cultured in YPD medium to log phase, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. Cellular proteins (100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Anti-Yap1p antiserum raised in rabbit was used as the primary antibody, and anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) was used as the secondary antibody. Diaminobenzidine was used to visualize immunoreactive protein. Intracellular oxidation level of yeast was measured using the oxidant-sensitive probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (20Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Cells growing exponentially in SD minimum medium were collected and resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.01 mm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. After incubation at 28 °C for 15 min, cells were washed, resuspended in distilled water, and disrupted with glass beads by vortex mixer for 3 min. Cell extracts (50 μl) were mixed in 500 μl of distilled water, and fluorescence was measured with λEX = 490 nm and λEM = 524 nm using a Hitachi F-3000 spectrofluorometer. The value of λEM = 524 nm was normalized by protein in the mixture. The GSH1 promoter fragment (−800 to +33, +1 represents the adenine of translational initiation codon) containing the YRE was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TAATCTTATGAATCCCGGGGATTTTATCGG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACTCAAACCCGGGCAAAGGCGTGCCC-3′. Both primers were designed to contain the Sma I site (underlined), and the DNA fragment amplified by PCR was digested with Sma I and cloned into the Sma I site of pMC1871 containing the coding region of the lacZ (21Shapira S.K. Chou J. Richaud F.V. Casadaban M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), to yield pMC-GSH1lacZ. As a result of this construction, the first 11 amino acid residues of Gsh1p were fused to β-galactosidase whose first 8 amino acids were deleted. The GSH1-lacZ fragment in the pMC-GSH1lacZ was isolated by digestion with Sal I and cloned into the Sal I site of YCp50 (URA3 marker) to yield pCGSH1-lacZ. The transformants carrying this plasmid were cultured in SD minimum medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases without uracil at 28 °C for 16–20 h. A portion of the culture was transferred to a 200-ml flask containing 50 ml of YPD medium and cultured at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking until A610 reached approximately 1.0. In the case of stress experiments, H2O2 was added to final concentration of 0.2 mm, and culture was continued for another 60 min. Cell extracts were prepared as described above, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described by Miller (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). One unit of the activity was defined as the amount of enzyme increasing A420 × 1000 per min at 30 °C. pRS cup1 cp-GFP-YAP1 (23Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) was digested by Sac I and Xho I and cloned to the Sac I and Xho I site of pRS415 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid (pRS415GFP-YAP1) was transformed to the strains of wild type (YPH250) and tsa1Δ mutant, respectively. To visualize DNA, the cells were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. We searched the Saccharomyces Genome Data base for the homologs of mammalian GPx, and we found three candidates that share high sequence homology, i.e. YKL026C, YBR244W, and YIR037W. We named them GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3, respectively. Sequence data of the YIR037W was deposited to the GenBankTMby Budde and Stahl in 1995 2E. Budde and U. Stahl, unpublished data.and was referred to as the HYR1 (hydrogen peroxide resistance) gene (GenBankTM accession number U22446), although functional analysis of the HYR1/GPX3 gene product has not yet been reported thereafter. Fig.2 shows the alignment of the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence of each GPx homolog gene from S. cerevisiae and that of human GPx-I (25Mullenbach G.T. Tabrizi A. Irvine B.D. Bell G.I. Hallewell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been known that mammalian GPxs have a selenocysteine in their active site, and the codon corresponding to the selenocysteine is TGA which is usually used as a stop codon (25Mullenbach G.T. Tabrizi A. Irvine B.D. Bell G.I. Hallewell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of S. cerevisiae GPx homologs, cysteine was used instead of selenocysteine, and the cysteine residue was conserved in these three GPx homologs at the position of selenocysteine in human GPx-I. The amino acid sequence around the active site was conserved between mammalian GPx and yeast homologs, although identity in other regions was not so high compared with the region around the active site. Overall homology (identity) between mammalian GPx and yeast GPx homologs was approximately 36%. On the other hand, identity among yeast homologs was higher compared with mammalian GPx, and the values are 53% between Gpx1p and Gpx2p, 58% between Gpx1p and Gpx3p, and 74% between Gpx2p and Gpx3p. The molecular weight of a subunit of GPxs from mammalian sources is approximately 22 kDa, and the enzymes consist of a homotetramer (26Awasthi Y.C. Dao D.D. Lal A.K. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The molecular weights of Gpx1p, Gpx2p, and Gpx3p in S. cerevisiae were calculated to be 19,483.68, 18,405.25, and 18,640.61, respectively, which was somehow smaller than those of mammalian enzymes. We have previously purified GPx from a yeast H. mrakii (5Tran L.-T. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the enzyme was 28 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Because the GPx of H. mrakii was bound to the cell membrane and detergents were used to solubilize it, we could not determine the molecular weight of the native enzyme by a gel filtration. Thus, the subunit structure of the yeast enzyme has not yet been identified. Each GPx homolog gene was cloned by PCR, and gene disruptant was constructed in every combination, i.e. single disruptant (gpx1Δ, gpx2Δ, and gpx3Δ), double disruptant (gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ, gpx1Δ/gpx3Δ, and gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ), and triple disruptant (gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ). No synthetic lethality was observed in these mutants, and growth rate of them without stress was the same as that of wild type (results of the triple mutant are shown in Fig. 7 B). As shown in Fig.3, the gpx3Δ mutant was sensitive to H2O2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), which was used as a representative for LOOH, and both are substrate for GPxs from mammals. Disruption of the GPX1 or GPX2 alone or double disruption of them did not affect the sensitivity to peroxides, although disruption of the GPX3 gene in these genetic backgrounds enhanced the susceptibility.Figure 3Spot assay of gpxΔ mutants against peroxides. Detailed conditions for experiments are described under “Materials and Methods.” Photograph was taken after 2 days of incubation at 28 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether these GPx homolog genes actually correspond to glutathione peroxidase, the enzyme activity was measured. So far, there are several reports describing the GPx-like activity in S. cerevisiae, if the yeasts were cultured in the presence of Cu2+ or selenite (27Galiazzo F. Schiesser A. Rotilio G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Iizuka M. Murata K. Kimura A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 613-614Google Scholar). However, the GPx-like activity in such cases does not accurately reflect the GPx activity itself; contamination in the cell extracts with Cu2+ and selenite, both of which are redox-active metals, can mimic the GPx activity. It has been well known that the selenium-containing compound, 2-phenyl-1,2-benzselenazol-3(2H)-one (so called ebselen), can display GPx-like activity (29Muller A. Cadenas E. Graf P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 30Wendel A. Fausel M. Safayhi H. Tiegs G. Otter R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3241-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To measure the GPx activity correctly, we cultured the cells without the addition of any metals, and we carefully took three different blanks for each assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.4, the enzyme activity decreased approximately 57% in the gpx3Δ mutant, and it was only 7% in the gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ mutant compared with that of wild type strain. Together with the results of spot assay experiments (Fig. 3), the GPX3 gene product is thought to be the major GPx that scavenges peroxides in S. cerevisiae. The expression pattern of each GPX gene under several stress conditions was examined by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.5, the basal expression level of the GPX3 gene was constitutively high compared with those of other two GPX genes, although its expression was not induced by any environmental stresses tested. The expression level of the GPX1 gene was induced under the glucose-starved conditions. Menadione and 9,10-naphthoquinone, both are O⨪2-generating agents, and heat shock also slightly induced the expression of GPX1. Expression of the GPX2 gene was strongly induced by several oxidative stresses such as t-BHP, cumene hydroperoxide, and O⨪2-generating agents. Consequently the GPx activity was increased when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress (see Fig. 12 B).Figure 12Increase of the expression of Yap1p target gene in the tsa1Δ mutant is dependent upon the Yap1p.

Yap1p recognizes and binds to the specific DNA sequence termed YRE (Yap1p response element; optimum consensus sequence, 5′-TTA(C/G)TAA-3′) (33Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The GPX2 gene has three YRE sequences in its 5′-upstream region (620-bp upstream from the translational initiation ATG codon, TTAGTAA; 410-bp upstream, TTACTAA; and 253-bp upstream, TTAGTAA). To assess whether expression of the GPX2 gene is regulated by Yap1p, basal expression level of the GPX2 gene was measured in the yap1Δ mutant and in the YAP1-overexpressing strain. As shown in Fig. 6 A, basal expression level of the GPX2 gene decreased in the yap1Δ mutant, whereas it increased in the strain overexpressing the YAP1. Furthermore, no oxidative stress-induced expression of the GPX2 gene was observed in the yap1Δ mutant (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that expression of the GPX2 gene is under the control of Yap1p. Expression of the GPX1 gene was slightly induced by the O⨪2-generating agents (Fig. 5), although the copy number of Yap1p in the cells did not affect the basal expression level of it (Fig. 6 A). Additionally, no YRE-like sequence was found in the GPX1 promoter region; therefore, Yap1p is not likely to be involved in the regulatory mechanism of the GPX1 gene. Similarly, the expression level of the GPX3 gene did not change in the presence or absence of Yap1p in the cell (Fig. 6 A). The TSA1 gene (thiol-specific antioxidant) encodes a peroxidase whose electron donor is thioredoxin (TPx, thioredoxin peroxidase) (11Chae H.Z. Kim I.-H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2036708141,"A putative collagen-binding MSCRAMM, Ace, of Enterococcus faecalis was identified by searching bacterial genome data bases for proteins containing domains homologous to the ligand-binding region of Cna, the collagen-binding MSCRAMM from Staphylococcus aureus. Ace was predicted to have a molecular mass of 71 kDa and contains features characteristic of cell surface proteins on Gram-positive bacteria, including a LPXTG motif for cross-linking to the cell wall. The N-terminal region of Ace contained a region (residues 174-319) in which 56% of the residues are identical or similar when compared with the minimal ligand-binding region of Cna (Cna 151-318); the remainder of the Ace A domain has 46% similarity with the corresponding region of the Cna A domain. Antibodies raised against recombinant Ace A domain were used to verify the cell surface expression of Ace on E. faecalis. These antibodies also effectively inhibited the adhesion of enterococcal cells to a collagen substrate, suggesting that Ace is a functional collagen-binding MSCRAMM. Structural modeling of the conserved region in Ace (residues 174-319) suggested a structure very similar to that reported for residues 151-318 of the Cna collagen-binding domain in which the ligand-binding site was identified as a trench transversing a beta-sheet face (Symersky, J., Patti, J. M., Carson, M., House-Pompeo, K., Teale, M., Moore, D., Jin, L., DeLucas, L. J., Hook, M., and Narayana, S. V. L. (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 833-838). Biochemical analyses of recombinant Ace and Cna A domains supported the modeling data in that the secondary structures were similar as determined by CD spectroscopy and both proteins bound at multiple sites in type I collagen with micromolar affinities, but with different apparent kinetics. We conclude that Ace is a collagen-binding MSCRAMM on enterococci and is structurally and functionally related to the staphylococcal Cna protein."

Tetrahydrobiopterin and pterin analogs including 6-methyltetrahydrobiopterin (Scheme I) serve as redox-active cofactors of hydroxylases such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases (11Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 5: 1085-1093Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Kaufman S. Fischer D.B. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, New York.1974: 285-369Google Scholar). Tetrahydrobiopterin is also an important cofactor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). However, the role of this cofactor in the control of NOS activity is still unclear (13Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B.

Upon binding of the calcium/calmodulin complex, electrons flow from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain resulting in the activation of the enzyme. We recently have demonstrated that activation of the endothelial isoform of NOS (eNOS) under limited availability of BH4 leads to the generation of superoxide from the oxygenase domain by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism (16Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 35: 9220-9225Crossref Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Previous studies with the neuronal isoform (nNOS) showed that activation of the enzyme in the absence of l-arginine generates superoxide (17Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 301: 169-177Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the formation of superoxide was calcium/calmodulin-dependent, it was suggested that superoxide was formed at the oxygenase domain of nNOS (17Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 301: 169-177Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, by using genetically engineered nNOS constructs it has been shown that the reductase domain of nNOS generates superoxide, by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism (20Miller R.T. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the P450 reductase-like activity of the nNOS reductase domain is comparable to iNOS (21Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Nishida C. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1185-1189PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question of what regulates superoxide generation from the reductase domain of nNOS.The ability of NOS to reduce and/or release superoxide in one-electron reduction reactions with substrates such as cytochrome c, lucigenin, and nitro blue tetrazolium has precluded the use of superoxide assays that involve these compounds. Although superoxide dismutase-inhibitable inactivation of aconitase enzyme can be used to quantify superoxide, recent data indicate that peroxynitrite also can inhibit aconitase activity. Thus, it appears that electron spin resonance (ESR) technique remains as the only viable alternative to detect and to quantify superoxide generated from NOS. The spin-trapping technique using the newly developed phosphorylated spin trap, 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO) (22Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), has proven to be a potentially useful tool to detect and to quantify superoxide formation from eNOS (16Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 35: 9220-9225Crossref Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The spin trap DEPMPO does not inhibit NOS activity. The superoxide adduct of DEPMPO (i.e. DEPMPO-OOH) is 15 times more stable than that of 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N- oxide (DMPO), a more commonly used trap. In addition, unlike the superoxide adduct of DMPO, DEPMPO-OOH does not spontaneously decay to the corresponding DEPMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct (DEPMPO-OH). As a result, the steady state concentration of DEPMPO-OOH is higher than DMPO-OOH adduct at the same rate of superoxide generation. In order to conserve the spin trap and NOS enzyme, which are both expensive and scarce, we have utilized the loop gap resonator (23Froncisz W. Hyde J. J. Magn. Res. 1998; 43: 515-521Google Scholar). The loop gap resonator is a device that allows ESR measurements of exceedingly small reaction volumes (≅10 μl) which brings the sensitivity limit down from 250 to 2–5 pmol. This allows many more experiments to be performed with small amount of enzyme preparation.Evidence indicates that BH4 plays a critical role not only in increasing the rate of nitric oxide (⋅NO) (16Vásquez-Vivar J.

In this work, we investigated the effects of BH4 and BH4 analogs (Scheme I) on the generation of superoxide by nNOS using recombinant wild type BH4-free enzyme. Our results indicate that in the absence of l-arginine, BH4 inhibits the generation of superoxide without inhibiting NADPH consumption. In the presence of l-arginine, BH4 enhancesl-arginine binding and couples NADPH tol-arginine oxidation, which enhances ⋅NO generation. The effects of BH4 on superoxide generation by nNOS indicate that this cofactor may be essential to drive the synthesis ofl-citrulline by preventing the dissociation of the heme-ferrous dioxygen complex and by promoting the generation of the heme-peroxo species.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBovine Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (0.1 unit/mg) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) was obtained from Fluka Chemika-BioChemika.

Protein concentrations of nNOS and C331A-nNOS were determined, based on heme content, by reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra using an extinction coefficient of 100 mm−1 cm−1 for an absorbance difference between 444 and 475 nm. The average heme content of the protein was 80%.Biochemical AssaysnNOS ActivitynNOS activity was determined by quantifying the conversion of l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline as described previously (16Vásquez-Vivar J.

Briefly, nNOS (66.7 nm) was added to reaction mixtures (final volume, 0.20 ml) containing Hepes (50 mm, pH 7.4), DTPA (0.1 mm),l-[14C]arginine (0.1 mm, 0.625 μCi), NADPH (0.3–0.5 mm), calcium chloride (0.2 mm), calmodulin (20 μg/ml), BH4 (10 μm), GSH (100 μm), and bovine serum albumin (200 μg/ml). To stop the reaction, an aliquot of the reaction mixture (50 μl) was diluted in Hepes (50 mm, pH 5.5) containing EGTA (0.5 mm) and chilled on ice.l-[14C]Citrulline was isolated from the excess of l-[14C]arginine using a Dowex 50W-cation exchange column, and its concentration was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Hydrogen Peroxide MeasurementsGeneration of hydrogen peroxide by nNOS was quantified as described previously (24Heinzel B.

Briefly, 100 μl of H2SO4 (0.3 n) was added to aliquots (75 μl) of nNOS incubations mixtures followed by the sequential addition of 62.5 μl of ferrous ammonium sulfate (Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 6 mm) and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, 6 m). Absorbances were read at 480 nm, and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was calculated from calibration curves.NADPH Consumption by nNOSInitial rates of NADPH oxidation were determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. NADPH concentration was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Reactions were initiated by adding NADPH (∼0.18 mm) to reaction mixtures (final volume, 0.25 ml) containing nNOS (16.7 nm), DTPA (0.1 mm), l-arginine, BH4, and BH4 analogs in Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4).Electron Spin Resonance MeasurementsElectron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E-109 spectrometer operating at 9.03-GHz and 100-kHz field modulation equipped with a loop-gap resonator (22Frejaville C.

Typically samples were analyzed using a microwave power, 2 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 0.064 s; scan rate, 1.67 G/s; number of scans, 5 unless otherwise specified. nNOS was added to incubation mixtures (20 μl, final volume) containing DEPMPO, and the sample was examined after incubation for 1 min. Quantification of ESR data has an accuracy of ±5%.DISCUSSIONActivation of nNOS with calcium/calmodulin increases the rate of electron transfer between flavin cofactors of the reductase domain and also enhances the rate of reduction of the heme-iron group at the oxygenase domain (29Abu-Soud H.M.

Here we report, using a wild type BH4-free enzyme, that nNOS generates superoxide from both the reductase and oxygenase domains by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism.Mechanism of NOS CatalysisAs shown in Scheme II activation of molecular oxygen is one of the first steps in the catalytic cycle of NOS (31Leone A.M.

Purified nNOS contains a mixed population of high and low spin states of heme-iron [FeIII(H/L spin)]3+ (Scheme II). l-Arginine and/or BH4 binding to pterin-free nNOS promotes the transition from low to high spin (Scheme II, step I) that facilitates the reduction of heme-iron from ferric [FeIII]3+ to the ferrous form [FeII]2+ (Scheme II, step II) (23Froncisz W.

Oxygen binds to the ferrous-heme group, forming the ferrous-heme-dioxygen complex, [FeO2]2+, the most stable intermediate of the reaction cycle (Scheme II, step III).

Reduction of the heme-iron at the expense of NADPH establishes a cycle that results in the generation of superoxide (Fig. 1 and Fig. 6).Pterin-free enzyme efficiently binds BH4 to generate a form that exhibits spectral characteristics similar to those observed for the enzyme isolated from eukaryotic cells that contain tightly bound BH4 (25Gorren A.C.F.

Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reported that BH4 only decreases superoxide generation, using NOS from purified mammalian cell nNOS, at a concentration 1000-fold higher than that used in this study. The addition of 0.01–10 mmBH4, in the absence of a metal ion chelator, is likely to lead to artifactual spin-adduct formation (37Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DMPO-OOH radical adduct is unstable making the quantification of superoxide from nNOS more difficult (22Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 38Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Mártasek P. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Free Rad. Res. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The exact role of BH4 in NOS catalysis is a matter of intense debate in the literature. It has been established that BH4 promotes the transition of the heme group from low to high spin, stabilizes the conformation of the homodimer, and acts as an allosteric effector of NOS enhancing l-arginine binding (25Gorren A.C.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A combination of these effects may explain why BH4 prevented the inactivation of the enzyme during NADPH consumption in the absence of substrate (Fig. 6). It may be expected that BH4, by preventing the inactivation of the enzyme, should increase the generation of superoxide. However, superoxide formation was dramatically inhibited by very low amounts of BH4 (Figs. 2and 3). This decrease in superoxide formation cannot be attributed to a decrease in NADPH-dependent oxygen reduction by nNOS as the rate of NADPH oxidation and the formation of hydrogen peroxide were almost unaffected by the addition of BH4. The most plausible mechanism to explain the effect of BH4 on superoxide generation is that BH4 enhances the rate of reduction of the [FeIII-O2•]2+ complex to generate the peroxyl iron complex [FeIII-OOH]2+ (Scheme II, step VI). By this mechanism, the steady state concentration of the [FeIII-O2•]2+ is decreased, and superoxide generation is reduced (Fig. 3).In support of this mechanism, it has been recently proposed that BH4 participates in oxygen activation during the catalytic cycle of NOS mediating the one-electron reduction of the [FeIII-O2•]2+ to generate [FeIII-OOH]2+ (Scheme II, step VI) (35Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This mechanism indicates that increasing concentrations of BH4 would decrease the generation of superoxide in favor of the generation of the peroxyl iron intermediate [FeIII-OOH]2+, (Scheme II step VI). Dissociation of the [FeIII-OOH]2+species will result in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, which has been detected as the product of uncoupled oxygen reduction under limited BH4 and/or l-arginine concentrations (24Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 25Gorren A.C.F. List B. Schrammel A. Pitters E. Hemmens B. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16735-16745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This implies that hydrogen peroxide may be formed by nNOS by two different mechanisms depending on the availability of BH4. At low BH4 concentrations, nNOS will generate only superoxide that, by dismutation, will produce hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. In the presence of BH4, however, no superoxide will be formed, and the enzyme will generate hydrogen peroxide by a mechanism involving a two-electron reduction of oxygen.BH4 may participate in oxygen activation by two mechanisms. The first is that BH4 directly reduces the [FeIII-O⨪2]2+, by hydrogen atom donation or by electron transfer, to generate [FeIII-OOH]2+ and the highly reactive trihydrobiopterin radical (⋅BH3), which must be quickly reduced by reductase domain flavins (35Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Raman et al. (41Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) have suggested that for eNOS to utilize a radical intermediate, both BH4 and ⋅BH3 need to be protonated. Although the exact location of BH4 at the oxygenase domain of nNOS is unknown, by analogy to iNOS and eNOS, it is unlikely that BH4 can interact directly with the heme iron, favoring electron transfer rather than hydrogen abstraction (41Raman C.S.

Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism to explain the effects of BH4 on superoxide generation is that occupation of the BH4-binding site accelerates the flavin-dependent reduction of the [FeIII-O2•]2+ species to generate [FeIII-OOH]2+. To discriminate between these two possibilities, it would be necessary to detect the formation of the trihydrobiopterin radical under single turnover conditions.BH4 is essential to prime the enzyme for catalysis, and it is plausible to propose that it promotes the formation of a catalytically competent oxidation state of heme iron. Characterization of the product of two-electron oxidation of other hemeproteins indicates the presence of a tetravalent heme-iron with a full electron octect oxygen [FeIV=O]2+ (33Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 245-304Crossref Google Scholar). For some peroxidases, the extra electron necessary to render such configuration is donated by the porphyrin (P) or by adjacent amino acid residue (33Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 245-304Crossref Google Scholar). It is possible to speculate that the extra electron necessary to form the oxoferryl species ∔X[FeIV=O]3+ is drawn from BH4 which is coordinated to the heme propionate groups (41Raman C.S. Li H.

Moreover, PKC activation resulted in the in situ association and movement of RACK1 and βIIPKC to the same intracellular sites.

PKC is a family of 10 isozymes that are localized to specific intracellular sites in unstimulated cells. Upon activation, each PKC isozyme moves to a different intracellular site (2Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Localization of inactive or activated PKC isozymes is mediated, at least in part, by interaction with anchoring proteins (3Mochly-Rosen D.

In contrast, activated PKC isozymes are localized by binding to receptors for activated C kinase (RACKs). RACK1 specifically binds the active form of βIIPKC (7Mochly-Rosen D. Smith B.L. Chen C.H.

The RACK1 binding site on PKC is within the C2 region of the regulatory domain providing a direct protein-protein interaction (8Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Indeed, RACK1 belongs to the WD40 family of proteins, and the WD40 motif is implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (14Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptides derived from either PKC and/or RACK1 can alter PKC activity in vitro and in vivo (8Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

Although RACK1 binds activated PKC and is clearly important for PKC function, the mechanism by which RACK1 localizes βIIPKC to its site after activation is not understood. One prediction is that the anchoring protein RACK1 should always be localized to the same site that accepts βIIPKC after translocation. We therefore used confocal microscopy to determine whether RACK1 is co-localized with activated βIIPKC, whether RACK1 is localized to a specific organelle, and whether the intracellular localization of RACK1 changes in response to PKC activation. Here, we provide evidence that RACK1 is localized to different sites in unstimulated and stimulated cells and that PKC activation leads to movement of RACK1. Furthermore, PKC activation induces the association and co-localization of RACK1 with βIIPKC. Based on these results, we propose that RACK1 is a shuttling protein that localizes βIIPKC upon activation by shuttling the kinase to its appropriate subcellular site.

Cells were then treated with either 100 nm PMA for 10 min at 37 °C (b) or 500 nm NPA for 30 min at 37 °C (c). Cells were then stained, visualized, and scored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of translocated RACK1 and βIIPKC was defined as (the number of cells in which RACK1 or βIIPKC was translocated/the total number of cells) × 100.

The cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with ice-cold methanol for 3 min, and then washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were incubated for 2 h with 1% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton and incubated for 1.5 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500, Cappel), Texas Red, or Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse (IgM) antibodies (1:500, Cappel). Cells were washed an additional three times with cold PBS containing 0.1% Triton. Slides were mounted using Vectashield and viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope. The confocal images were processed using the computer programs NIH Image, version 1.61 (National Institutes of Health), and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). All the images shown are individual middle sections of projected Z-series. Co-localization of the pairs RACK1 and βIIPKC or mannosidase and βIIPKC was determined using the NIH Image program, version 1.61. Threshold was used to separate immunofluoresence pixels from background and to create binary images. The intensity values of each image were recorded. Pairs of binary images of RACK1 and βIIPKC or mannosidase and βIIPKC were multiplied and divided by 255 to generate a final merged image that could be visualized with an 8-bit gray scale. The intensity value of the final merged image was recorded. The percentage of RACK1 staining merged with βIIPKC staining was calculated using the following equation. The number of pixels with intensity value>0in the final merged imageThe number of pixels with intensity×100value>0 in RACK1 image Each image contained 20–100 cells. Movement of RACK1 and βIIPKC was scored by counting at least three random fields of cells (total of at least 100 cells per treatment) for staining of RACK1 and/or βIIPKC.

Cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml of the following protease inhibitors: soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and leupeptin. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The Triton-soluble material (supernatant) was precleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein G agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged and protein quantity was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of anti-βIIPKC antibody or anti-RACK1 antibody, together with approximately 0.5 mg of protein diluted in an equal volume of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (1× = 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin) and water to a total volume of 1 ml. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, 50 μl of protein G agarose was added and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The agarose resin was then washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with ice-cold PBS. The sample was centrifuged and sample buffer was added to the pellet fraction. The sample was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut at approximately 50 kDa and probed with monoclonal anti-RACK1 antibodies (lower part) (1:500) and polyclonal anti-βIIPKC antibodies (upper part) (1:250). Immunoreactivity was detected using a chemiluminescent reaction (2.5 mm luminol and 400 μm p- coumaric acid). Recombinant RACK1 (125 ng) was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Unbound material was removed, and the membrane was incubated in overlay block (0.2 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol) for 1 h at room temperature. In a separate tube, βIIPKC (1 μg of purified recombinant SF9-expressed protein) was incubated in the presence of 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.8 μg/DAG, and 1 mm calcium in overlay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 0.2 mNaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 12 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and in the presence or absence of PKC inhibitors (12 nm bisindolylmaleimide HCl, 10 μm DECA, 50 nm calphostin C, and 660 nm chelerythrin chloride). The mixture was incubated for 15 min while being rotated at room temperature and then added to immobilized RACK1 for additional rotation of 15 min. Unbound material was removed, and the membrane was given three 10-min washes in overlay wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 12 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Binding of βIIPKC was detected using anti-βIIPKC polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz, 1:500) followed by enhanced chemiluminescent reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and proccessed using the STORM system (Molecular Dynamics). In order to determine whether RACK1 is co-localized with activated translocated (moved) βIIPKC, we first established the localization of RACK1 in CHO cells using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.1 a, RACK1 was localized to a perinuclear structure in unstimulated cells. Next, we determined the localization of βIIPKC in CHO cells. As shown in Fig.2 a, βIIPKC is localized to the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells. Activation by a phorbol ester (PMA) induced βIIPKC to move from the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 a) to a site that resembles the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2 b) and not the perinuclear structure where RACK1 is found (Fig.1 a). This structure was identified as the Golgi apparatus by double-staining of cells with anti-βIIPKC antibodies (Fig.2 d) and anti-mannosidase antibodies (Golgi marker) (Fig.2 e). Colocalization of βIIPKC with the Golgi marker was confirmed by performing image analysis on the merged image as described under “Experimental Procedures.” βIIPKC (Fig. 2 d) co-localized with mannosidase (Fig. 2 e) as shown in the merged image (Fig. 2 f). Because RACK1 in unstimulated cells is localized to the perinucleus (Fig. 1 a) and is not localized to the Golgi apparatus, where translocated (moved) activated βIIPKC is found (Fig. 2 b), RACK1 is not always localized to the same site as βIIPKC. We next determined whether RACK1 is always localized to a specific organelle. Specifically, we asked whether RACK1 is always localized to perinuclear structures in CHO cells, regardless of the activation state of the cell. CHO cells that stably express the dopamine D2L receptor (CHO/D2L) were treated with either PMA or with the dopamine D2 agonist NPA, and RACK1 localization was determined. PKC activation either directly with PMA or by NPA activation of the D2 receptor induced the movement of RACK1 from perinuclear structures (Fig. 1 a) to a different site (Fig. 1 b and c). In another cell line, NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma cells, RACK1 was also localized to different intracellular sites before (Fig. 1 e) and after PKC activation (Fig. 1 f). In NG108-15 cells PKC activation induced RACK1 to move to yet unidentified cytosolic structures and to neurites (Fig. 1 f). Therefore, RACK1 is not localized to a specific organelle, and activation of PKC leads to movement of RACK1. If RACK1 movement is dependent on PKC activation via phosphatidylinositol-derived second messengers, then a PLC inhibitor should inhibit RACK1 movement induced by activation of the D2L receptor. Indeed, movement of both RACK1 (Fig.3 a) and βIIPKC (Fig.3 b) was inhibited when CHO/D2L cells were pretreated with the PLC inhibitor ET18OCH3 prior to activation with NPA. As expected, ET18OCH3 did not inhibit PMA-induced movement of βIIPKC or of RACK1 (Fig. 3), because phorbol esters bypass PLC signaling and directly activate PKC. Therefore, RACK1 movement is dependent on PLC activation, suggesting that under physiologic conditions, the generation of second messengers is required not only for the movement of βIIPKC but also for movement of RACK1. PKC activation induced movement of both RACK1 and βIIPKC (Figs. 1 and2). We therefore determined whether RACK1 and βIIPKC become co-localized to the same site after PKC activation. CHO/D2L cells were incubated in the absence and presence of PMA or NPA and stained for both RACK1 and βIIPKC. The images were merged in order to detect co-localization, and image analysis was performed. As shown in Fig.4, a and d, in unstimulated cells, approximately 60% of RACK1 and βIIPKC were not co-localized. Upon PKC activation, RACK1 and βIIPKC moved to the same site, and their intracellular staining patterns merged to more than 70% (Fig. 4, b–d). In CHO cells, PKC activation induced βIIPKC to move to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2, d–f). To confirm that RACK1 also localized to the Golgi apparatus upon PKC activation, we stained cells with anti-RACK1 antibodies together with the specific Golgi marker BODIPY FL C5-ceramide. As shown in Fig. 4, e and f, RACK1 co-localized with the Golgi marker after PKC activation. Thus, PKC activation induces the co-localization of RACK1 and βIIPK and the movement of both proteins from different sites to the same locations. The co-localization of RACK1 and βIIPKC after PKC activation, observed by immunofluoresence (Fig. 4), suggests that the two proteins associate with each other in cells. To explore this possibility, we determined whether the two proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated and whether PKC activation is required for their association. βIIPKC was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated, PMA-treated, or NPA-treated cells using anti-βIIPKC antibodies, and we determined whether RACK1 was co-immunopre"
https://openalex.org/W2020844485,"In this work, we analyzed the role of the PI3K-p70 S6 kinase (S6K) signaling cascade in the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation. We found that inhibitors of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway (PD98059) and the PI3K-p70 S6K pathway (wortmannin, Ly294002, and rapamycin) all block thymidine incorporation stimulated by fetal calf serum in the resting mouse endothelial cell line 1G11. The action of rapamycin can be generalized, since it completely inhibits the mitogenic effect of fetal calf serum in primary endothelial cell cultures (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and another established capillary endothelial cell line (LIBE cells). The inhibitory effect of rapamycin is only observed when the inhibitor is added at the early stages of G0-G1progression, suggesting an inhibitory action early in G1. Rapamycin completely inhibits growth factor stimulation of protein synthesis, which perfectly correlates with the inhibition of cell proliferation. In accordance with its inhibitory action on protein synthesis, activation of cyclin D1 and p21 proteins by growth factors is also blocked by preincubation with rapamycin. Expression of a p70 S6K mutant partially resistant to rapamycin reverses the inhibitory effect of the drug on DNA synthesis, indicating that rapamycin action is via p70 S6K. Thus, in vascular endothelial cells, activation of protein synthesis via p70 S6K is an essential step for cell cycle progression in response to growth factors.

However, in response to the appropriate stimuli, quiescent endothelium can produce new vessels in a process known as angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature) (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). This happens in normal situations such as embryonic development and wound healing and during the female reproductive cycle. However, activated blood vessel growth is found in many diseases, such as tumor progression, diabetic retinopathy, and arthritis (2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last few years, several studies have led to the discovery of inducers and inhibitors of the angiogenic process. Fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2 (also known as aFGF and bFGF, respectively) and vascular endothelial growth factor are among the inducers, whereas thrombospondin-1, angiostatin, and endostatin are inhibitors. However, the signaling mechanisms regulated by these agents that control the reversible growth arrest state of endothelial cells are not well understood. Two signaling cascades have emerged as major players in the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic response: the Ras-p42/p44 MAPK1 cascade and the PI3K-p70 S6 kinase (S6K) cascade. Both pathways are initiated at the level of the plasma membrane after activation of growth factor receptors and integrins. The Ras-p42/p44 MAPK module implicates activation of the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein p21ras and the sequential activation of a series of protein kinases: Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-p42/p44 MAPK (3Cobb M.H.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, p42/p44 MAPKs are cytoplasmic, but after stimulation by growth factors, both isoforms translocate to the nucleus, a key step in growth signaling (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). p42/p44 MAPKs phosphorylate several transcription factors, such as members of the Ets family, thereby controlling the expression of cell cycle-regulated genes (6Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is one of the multiple genes that are positively controlled by the p42/p44 MAPK cascade (7Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), and its induction is essential for the progression to S phase (8Sherr C.J.

Activation of PI3K by growth factors leads to the production of 3′-phosphorylated inositols that act as second messengers for pleckstrin homology domain-containing signaling molecules, such as Akt/PKB (10Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K seems to be required for cell growth but in a cell type- and stimulus-dependent manner. Failure to activate p110 PI3K prevents reinitiation of DNA synthesis in response to platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor in NIH3T3 cells (12Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A.

Two downstream signaling pathways have been described for PI3K, Akt-GSK3 and p70/p85 S6K, which can be distinguished by their sensitivity to the drug rapamycin (10Domin J.

They are controlled by FRAP/mTOR, the target of rapamycin. p70/p85 S6K is activated by all mitogenic stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters, and plays an essential role in controlling the translation machinery (18Chou M.M.

In this work, we analyzed the contribution of PI3K-p70/p85 S6K in the control of vascular endothelial cell growth. We have found that inhibitors of the PI3K-p70/p85 S6K completely block mitogenesis in these cells and that the mechanism implicates the inhibition of protein synthesis.

Mouse brain capillary endothelial LIBE cells were obtained from Dr. Claesson-Welsh (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) and were cultivated as previously described (21Viñals F.

Positive clones were selected on the basis of resistance to puromycin (10 μg/ml) and confirmed by Western blot with an antibody against Myc. The studies were performed using different independent clones of 1G11-p70S6K WT and 1G11-p70S6KE389D3E cells. 1G11 cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 48 h and deprived of growth factors for 24 h in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium. Cells were then stimulated with fresh DMEM medium containing 20% FCS and 0.25 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (3 mm final concentration). After 20 h of incubation, cells were fixed and washed twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). The precipitated material was solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. When indicated, cells were incubated in presence of thymidine for 24, 36, or 48 h before fixation. Results are expressed as a percentage of the maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of FCS alone. 1G11 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and rendered quiescent by FCS starvation for 24 h. Cells were rinsed with DMEM and [3H]leucine (l-leucine 2,3,4,5-3H-labeled), 2 μCi/ml, 0.8 mm final concentration) was added with or without 20% FCS in 250 μl of DMEM. After 12 h of stimulation, cells were fixed and washed twice with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%). The precipitated material was solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation.

Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and Ly294002 (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by measurement of DNA synthesis. Thymidine incorporation was increased 50-fold in FCS-stimulated cells. Preincubation with wortmannin or Ly294002 strongly inhibited FCS-stimulated thymidine incorporation (Fig.1 A). Treatment with wortmannin or Ly294002 specifically prevented PI3K activation, measured by the phosphorylation state of two downstream targets of PI3K, Akt and p70 S6K (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). These results indicate that activation of PI3K is essential for G0/G1to S phase progression of 1G11 vascular endothelial cells.Figure 2PD98059 and rapamycin inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis in 1G11 cells. A, 1G11 quiescent cells were preincubated for 15 min in the presence or in the absence of 50 μm PD98059, 15 μm Ly294002, or 10 nm rapamycin, and DNA synthesis was measured as described.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Given the effect of PI3K inhibitors on DNA synthesis in endothelial cells, next we studied the effect of rapamycin (a specific inhibitor of p70 S6K activation by inhibition of its activator FRAP/mTOR) on thymidine incorporation stimulated by 20% FCS. In parallel, we evaluated the importance of p42/p44 MAPK activation by using an inhibitor of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), PD98059. Preincubation with 50 μmPD98059 before stimulation resulted in 80% inhibition of thymidine incorporation, while preincubation with 10 nm rapamycin completely inhibited the mitogenic effect of FCS (Fig.2 A). The same result was obtained by measuring bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in the presence of rapamycin (70% inhibition). Furthermore, the addition of rapamycin to exponentially proliferating 1G11 cells diminished the total cell number by 65% after 4 days in the presence of the drug (data not shown). The inhibition of p70 S6K activity was revealed by the lack of shift in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 B) and by measuring phosphorylation of a S6 peptide (data not shown). The specificity of this inhibition is confirmed by the absence of p42/p44 MAPK inhibition in response to rapamycin or Ly294002, while PD98059 only inhibited p42/p44 MAPK activation (Fig. 2 B). These results clearly indicate that PI3K-p70 S6K is essential for growth factor mitogenicity in 1G11 endothelial cells. They also confirm that, as seen in other cell systems, P70 S6K is a downstream target of PI3K in vascular endothelial cells. 1G11 is a vascular endothelial cell line obtained from murine lung. To investigate whether the effects of rapamycin are general to vascular endothelial cells, we performed DNA synthesis assays with primary cultures of HUVEC, and a different vascular endothelial cell line, LIBE cells (a mouse brain capillary cell line). Preincubation with rapamycin completely abrogated FCS stimulation of thymidine incorporation in 1G11 and HUVEC cells and caused a 65% inhibition in LIBE cells (Fig.3). In contrast, preincubation of CCL39 fibroblasts in the presence of rapamycin only slightly inhibited thymidine incorporation by 18%. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on mitogenicity is a general phenomenon for vascular endothelial cells. It has been described that rapamycin abolishes cell proliferation in T cells, whereas it only delays entry of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts into S phase (31Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). To address the temporal effect of rapamycin in 1G11 endothelial cells, thymidine incorporation studies were performed for periods of time up to 48 h in the presence or in the absence of rapamycin. As is shown in Fig.4 A, rapamycin blocked mitogenicity at all the times assayed (96% of inhibition at 24 h, 87% at 36 h and 77% at 48 h). This indicates that, in vascular endothelial cells, rapamycin blocks cells in G1phase rather than delaying entry into the cell cycle. To confirm that rapamycin affects a critical step during the transition G0/G1 to S phase, a time course of rapamycin addition after serum stimulation was performed. As it has been described, rapamycin addition before FCS completely blocked thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4 B). However, when rapamycin was added after FCS stimulation, a gradual release of the inhibition was observed during the prereplicative phase, resulting in 50% inhibition at 6 h and only 22% when the cells enter S phase (Fig. 4 B). This result indicates that rapamycin affects an early step in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and that DNA replication is not sensitive to the inhibition by rapamycin. This block in G1was confirmed by the lack of hyperphosphorylation of pRb in cells pretreated with rapamycin and stimulated for 18 h with FCS (data not shown). The role of p70 S6K in the stimulation of the cellular proliferation is based in its capacity to phosphorylate the ribosomal protein S6 in response to mitogens (18Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation leads to an increase in the translation of a subset of messenger RNAs, which are essential for the demands of proliferating cells. Therefore, rapamycin could induce its effect on endothelial cell proliferation by inhibiting growth factor-mediated protein synthesis. To evaluate this possibility, we measured the variations in initial rates of protein synthesis. Serum stimulation of quiescent 1G11 cells resulted in a 40% increase in leucine incorporation (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the addition of rapamycin completely blocked serum-stimulated protein synthesis, without having any effect on the basal synthesis rate. We also assayed the effect of Ly294002 on protein synthesis. Ly294002 potently inhibited protein synthesis and even reduced the basal levels by 30% (Fig. 5). We next investigated whether the effect of rapamycin on thymidine incorporation correlated with protein synthesis inhibition. 1G11 cells were preincubated in the presence of different concentrations of rapamycin (from 0.01 to 10 nm) followed by measurement of p70 S6K activation and the rates of thymidine and leucine incorporation. As observed in Fig.6 A, rapamycin inhibited thymidine incorporation stimulated by FCS with the same dose-dependence than protein synthesis. In both cases, the IC50 for rapamycin is approximately 0.1 nm with a total inhibition at 1 nm. These effects correlated perfectly with the inhibition of p70 S6K activity as measured by the shift-up assay (Fig.6 B). This strict dependence between the rate of DNA synthesis and the rate of protein synthesis was confirmed with the use of a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. As is observed in Fig. 6 C, cycloheximide inhibited leucine and thymidine incorporation with a similar IC50 (0.015 μg/ml) for both processes. These results therefore suggest that the block of mitogenesis induced by rapamycin is due to the inhibition of serum-stimulated protein synthesis. In order to confirm the role of p70 S6K on the stimulation of protein synthesis by growth factors, we analyzed the effect of rapamycin on the synthesis of two proteins expressed in the G1 phase, cyclin D1 and p21. Treatment of quiescent cells with 20% FCS caused an induction of cyclin D1 for up to 16 h, with a maximum at 12 h (Fig. 7). This increase was completely abrogated by treatment with 10 nm rapamycin. The same result was obtained with the induction of p21, a growth factor-induced inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases (32Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). We also analyzed the effect of rapamycin on the growth factor-mediated degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. As is observed in Fig. 7, the decrease in p27 levels was not affected by treatment with rapamycin. Cyclin D1 and p21 are induced after long term stimulation, with the maximal expression attained around 12 h. In contrast, MAPK phosphatase 1 is induced by growth factors much earlier than cyclin D1 or p21, with a maximum at 1 h that is maintained until 4 h and thereafter returned to basal levels after 12 h (Fig.8 A). Interestingly, rapamycin had no effect on the induction of MAPK phosphatase 1, despite the fact that the drug immediately affected protein synthesis (Fig.8 B). Thus, the lack of effect of rapamycin on MAPK phosphatase 1 reflects the selective action of p70 S6K on the translation of different cell cycle-regulated proteins. The target of rapamycin is FRAP/mTOR, a kinase that regulates p70 S6K. Moreover, FRAP/mTOR also has a direct effect on the initiation of protein synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating eIF4E-BP1/PHAS-1, a repressor of mRNA translation (33Lawrence J.J. Abraham R.T.

To evaluate whether the effects of rapamycin are driven by p70 S6K inhibition, we isolated 1G11 cells stably expressing either wild type or a rapamycin-resistant mutant form of p70 S6K (p70S6K-E389D3E) (24Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Different clones overexpressing the wild type form or the p70S6K-E389D3E form (Fig.9 A) were analyzed for their capacity to reinitiate DNA synthesis in the presence of different concentrations of rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibited thymidine incorporation in clones overexpressing the wild type form with exactly the same dose response as in parental cells (Fig. 9 B). In contrast, cells overexpressing the rapamycin-resistant form of p70 S6K presented a clear resistance to the inhibition by the drug. The dose-response curves were shifted 1 log rightward for the clones expressing the rapamycin-resistant p70 S6K variant. This result indicated that the effect of rapamycin is p70 S6K-dependent and is not caused by a direct effect of FRAP/mTOR kinase on protein synthesis or other possible side effects of rapamycin. In this work we have shown that inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK and PI3K-p70 S6K cascades blocks fetal calf serum-induced DNA synthesis reinitiation in vascular endothelial cells. The arrest of proliferation by inhibition of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is not surprising, knowing the central role played by this cascade in the stimulation of cell proliferation (4Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, it has been described that PD98059 completely inhibits thymidine incorporation stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (36Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol.

Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5792-5799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, repression of p42/p44 MAPK activity in confluent endothelial cells is required for the maintenance of the quiescent state (21Viñals F. Pouysségur J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2763-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about the role of the PI3K-Akt-p70 S6K module in the control of endothelial cell growth. Our results have shown that two different inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and Ly294002, completely block serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in vascular endothelial cells. These inhibitors prevent p70 S6K activation, confirming that PI3K activity is required for activation of p70 S6K but not p42/p44 MAPK. Inhibition of PI3K results in a block of endothelial cell proliferation that correlates with the inhibition of p70 S6K (compare inhibition of thymidine incorporation in wortmannin-treated cells with that of Akt and p70 S6K). However, more interestingly, specific inhibition of p70 S6K activation by rapamycin was found to be sufficient to inhibit DNA synthesis reinitiation. Moreover, only p70 S6K activation and not Akt phosphorylation was found to be sensitive to rapamycin treatment. This result points out that, although Akt activation could have a key role in cell survival on its own, Akt stimulation is not sufficient to trigger DNA replication. This finding, which highlights the key role of p70 S6K in vascular endothelial cell proliferation, was already clearly established for lymphocytes, although the conclusions were more loose in other systems such as fibroblasts. Indeed, when p70 S6K is fully inhibited by rapamycin in CCL39 fibroblasts (Fig. 3 and data not shown), DNA synthesis reinitiation is only minimally affected without effects on protein synthesis. The cause for this difference between fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells is still unclear. Activation of the protein synthesis by growth factors is an essential step for cell cycle progression, and its inhibition causes fibroblast growth arrest in G0/G1 (40Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 41Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). PI3K-p70 S6K is one of the most important signaling pathways implicated in the stimulation of protein synthesis. Thus, p70 S6K is responsible for the phosphorylation of the ribosomal 40 S subunit S6 protein. When phosphorylated, polysomes will specifically translate a subset of mRNAs, all characterized by an oligopyrimidine tract at their 5′-untranslated region. These mRNAs are coding for members of the protein synthetic machinery (18Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 41Brown E.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since the IC50for rapamycin was identical for the inhibition of serum-induced DNA synthesis and protein synthesis, the inhibition of protein synthesis by rapamycin is likely to be responsible for the block of DNA synthesis in vascular endothelial cells. It is interesting to note that rapamycin only affects the increase in leucine incorporation induced by growth factors without affecting the basal rate of protein synthesis. Thus, it is possible that rapamycin would only affect the expression of growth factor-controlled gene products. Accordingly, we have found that rapamycin completely prevents the synthesis of one of the essential members of the Cdk-cyclin complexes of the G1 phase, cyclin D1, precluding the phosphorylation of Rb product and therefore the entry into S phase. Moreover, it is interesting to note that treatment with rapamycin discriminates between growth factor-regulated gene products, inhibiting cyclin D1 and p21 synthesis but not the expression of MAPK phosphatase 1, an early gene product. These results can be explained by the presence of an oligopyrimidine tract in the 5′-untranslated region of the cyclin D1 mRNA. However, other mRNA determinants could be involved, since about 30% of newly synthesized proteins are inhibited by rapamycin (19Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 44Pedersen S. Celis J.E. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Nielsen F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rapamycin's target is the immunophilin FK506-binding protein, which binds to the kinase FRAP/mTOR. FRAP/mTOR is a major upstream component of the p70/p85 S6K activation and plays a direct role in the stimulation of protein synthesis. Thus, by phosphorylation FRAP/mTOR inactivates the translation inhibitor eIF4E BP1/PHAS-1 (33Lawrence J.J. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.J. Abraham R.T.

Although we cannot discard the possibility of a direct effect of FRAP/mTOR on protein synthesis and proliferation of endothelial cells, we demonstrate in this study that overexpression of a rapamycin-resistant form of p70 S6K partially overcomes the effect of rapamycin. This result reinforces the notion that activation of p70 S6K by itself is an important step for endothelial cell cycle progression. Finally, we cannot exclude other effects of the stimulation of p70 S6K important for the mitogenic cascade in endothelial cells, but it seems that this is not due to the persistence of high levels of the Cdk-cyclin inhibitor p27 after growth factor stimulation. The role of p27 in the anti-proliferative effect of rapamycin is controversial (32Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M.

It is plausible that, due to the decrease in cyclin D1 levels, the residual amounts of p27 are sufficient to explain the cell cycle arrest in presence of rapamycin. In conclusion, at least two pharmacologically separate growth-signaling cascades are operating in vascular endothelial cells. These cascades lead to activation of critical protein kinases that cooperate at the level of gene induction (p42/p44 MAPK) and protein synthesis (p70 S6K). The extreme sensitivity of vascular endothelial cells to immunosuppressive drugs such as rapamycin as shown here could have great potential in therapeutic intervention. We thank G.

https://openalex.org/W2120581641,"To elucidate the role of the cytoskeleton regulating avidity or affinity changes in the leukocyte adhesion receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (alpha(L)beta(2)), we generated mutant cytoplasmic LFA-1 receptors and expressed these into the erythroleukemic cell line K562. We determined whether intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-mediated adhesion of LFA-1, lacking parts of its cytoplasmic tails, is regulated through receptor diffusion/clustering and/or by altered ligand binding affinity. All cytoplasmic deletion mutants that lack the complete beta(2) cytoplasmic tail and/or the conserved KVGFFKR sequence in the alpha(L) cytoplasmic tail were constitutively active and expressed high levels of the activation epitopes NKI-L16 and M24. Surprisingly, whereas these mutants showed a clustered cell surface distribution of LFA-1, the ligand-binding affinity as measured by titration of soluble ligand ICAM-1 remained unaltered. The notion that redistribution of LFA-1 does not alter ligand-binding affinity is further supported by the finding that disruption of the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D did not alter the binding affinity nor adhesion to ICAM-1 of these mutants. Most cytoplasmic deletion mutants that spontaneously bound ICAM-1 were not capable to spread on ICAM-1, demonstrating that on these mutants LFA-1 is not coupled to the actin cytoskeleton. From these data we conclude that LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion to ICAM-1 is predominantly regulated by receptor clustering and that affinity alterations do not necessarily coincide with strong ICAM-1 binding."

The amino terminus of CCTβ bears no resemblance to the amino terminus of CCTα and does not include a nuclear localization sequence as was identified in the CCTα protein (14Yamagishi M. Matsushima H.

CCTα has been localized predominantly in the nucleus but the physiological significance of the nuclear localization of CCTα remains unclear. CCTβ protein was localized outside the cell nucleus by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CCTβ consists of 330 amino acids, in contrast with the 367 residues of CCTα, and lacks most of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation domain that is found in the CCTα protein (9Cornell R.B.

Despite the differences at the amino and carboxyl termini of the proteins, both CCTα and CCTβ exhibit high activity when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

CCTβ2 encodes a 369-amino acid protein which is identical to the CCTβ1 isoform described previously from amino acids 1 to 320. However, CCTβ2 also has a carboxyl-terminal sequence that resembles the phosphorylation domain of CCTα. The existence of two distinct CCT genes and two CCTβ splice variants raises the possibility of regulation of CCT activity at the level of gene expression as well as subcellular localization and phosphorylation (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the expression of the CCT isoforms in human tissues, determine whether CCTβ2 has a phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain, and whether these structural differences alter the cellular localization of or the ability of CCT isoforms to complement defective CCT activity in vivo (28Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

All other supplies were reagent grade or better. Anti-CCTα rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (MDAQSSAKVNSRKRRKE) corresponding to the first 17 amino acids of CCTα. Anti-CCTβ antibody (B1 epitope) was a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide (MEEIEHTCPQPRL) corresponding to amino acids 27–39 of CCTβ1 and CCTβ2. The anti-CCTβ antibody (B2 epitope) was a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (TTDAESETGIPKSLSNEP) corresponding to amino acids 5–22 of CCTβ1 and CCTβ2. Anti-CCTβ2 antibody (B3 epitope) was a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (PPSSPKAASRSISSMSEGD) corresponding to amino acids 347–365 of CCTβ2. Resequencing of the CCTβ2 clone identified that the correct residue at position 10 of the B3 peptide is an alanine instead of an arginine. The B1 and B2 epitope antibodies recognized both CCTβ1 and CCTβ2 whereas the B3 epitope antibody recognized only CCTβ2. Peptides and peptide antigens were prepared by the Molecular Resource Center of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The B1 and B2 antigens were prepared by coupling each peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an additional cysteine at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide whereas the B3 antigen was coupled at the amino terminus. Immunization of rabbits and collection of antiserum was performed by Rockland, Inc., according to their standard schedule. Antisera were purified by affinity chromatography on Affi-Gel 10 cross-linked to the peptide as described previously (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The EST data base was searched using the published CCTβ sequence (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberAF052510). A clone from human brain was identified (GenBankTM accession number AA683266) and purchased from Genome Systems. The cDNA sequence was determined on both strands using primers that flanked the multiple cloning sites and internal primers that were synthesized to ensure a complete read on both strands. A second EST clone from human testis was identified (GenBankTM accession number AI041180) and purchased from Research Genetics. The cDNA sequence of the second clone was also determined. Clone AA683266 was subcloned into pcDNA3 using Bam HI and Xho I (pAL1). pcDNA3 has an Ssp I site approximately 1 kilobase from the 5′ end of the T7 promoter and pAL1 retains the Ssp I site of CCTβ. The cDNA encoding CCTβ1 in pcDNA3 (pPJ34) (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was also digested with Ssp I. The approximately 1.1-kilobase fragment derived from plasmid pPJ34 was ligated to the 5.5-kilobase fragment of pAL1 to generate pAL2. The M27A point mutation was constructed using overlap extension PCR with the CCTβ1 cDNA as template in pBlueScript SK− and using the primers: M13 reverse: 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′, M27A forward: 5′-CAGAAACCGCGGAGGAAATAGAGC-3′, M27A reverse: 5′-ATTTCCTCCGCGGTTTCTGAG-3′, and Sna B1 reverse: 5′-AGGGAGCATCTCTGATAACTTCGTC-3′. Primers M27A forward and M27A reverse replace the ATG codon for methionine 27 with GCG encoding alanine. In the first round of PCR the pairs of primers M13rev-M27Arev and M27Afor-Sna B1rev generated products of 280 and 381 bp, respectively. 10 ng of these products were gel purified and used as template for the second round of PCR with primers M13rev and Sna B1rev. The 642-bp product was cloned into pCR2.1 (plasmid pPJ76) and sequenced to verify that it had the desired mutation. The Bam HI-Sna BI fragment of pPJ76 was ligated into the CCTβ1 cDNA replacing the Bam HI-Sna BI fragment of AA382871. The mutated CCTβ1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 using Bam HI-Xho I. CCT activity was determined essentially as described previously (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The standard assay contained 150 mm bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 4 mm CTP, 64 μm lipid activator (PtdCho:oleic acid, 1:1), 1 mmphospho[14C]choline (specific activity 4.5 mCi/mmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5m Na3EDTA, and the tubes were vortexed and placed on ice. Next, 40 μl of each sample was spotted on preadsorbent Silica Gel G thin layer plates, which were developed in 2% ammonium hydroxide, 95% ethanol (1:1, v/v). CDP-[14C]choline was identified by comigration with a standard, scraped from the plate, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Protein was determined according to the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. CHO58 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes at 33 °C in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented as above. Transfections using LipofectAMINE reagent were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of plasmid and 60 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent were diluted separately into 0.8 ml of serum-free medium. The two solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Next, 6.4 ml of serum-free medium was added to each tube and the diluted solution was overlaid onto cells that had been previously rinsed with serum-free medium. The cells and reagents were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, and then 8 ml of growth medium containing twice the normal amount of serum was added. The medium was replaced 24 h after the start of the transfection procedure. COS-7 cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C and then harvested for analysis. CHO58 cells were transferred to 40 °C. After incubation for an additional 72 h at the restrictive temperature, CHO58 cells were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed by incubation for 5 min in CH3OH/H2O/CH3COOH (45:45:10, v/v). After removal of the solvent, cells were incubated for 5 min in 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 in CH3OH/H2O/CH3COOH (45:45:10 v/v) to stain colonies. Finally, dishes were washed twice with CH3OH/H2O/CH3COOH (45:45:10, v/v) and pictures were taken. COS-7 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 10 μg of vector expressing CCTβ1, CCTβ2, or a pcDNA3 control vector without a cDNA insert. Cells were washed with PBS 48 h after transfection and fresh medium was added containing 1.6 mCi/dish of [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were incubated for 60 min and then immunoprecipitated (see below). HeLa cell cultures were harvested and total RNA was isolated by a guanidine isothiocyanate lysis procedure followed by pelleting RNA by CsCl gradient centrifugation (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1977; 18: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). RNA pellets dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Sarcosyl, 0.5% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1, v/v) and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by passing the total RNA through an oligo(dT) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by standard protocols (31Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.5.1-4.5.3Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using human poly(A)+ RNA that was purchased from Invitrogen, Inc., or using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HeLa cells. The cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first strand of cDNA following manufacturer's recommended procedure. Poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) from each source was used in each 20 μl of reaction with random and oligo(dT) primers. The two tubes, where the reverse transcriptase reaction was performed, were combined and 5 μl of the first strand cDNA synthesis mixture was used for PCR amplification of CCT sequences. The forward primer for detection of CCTα expression was 5′-GAAGGTGGAGGAAAAAAG-3′ corresponding to 795–812 bp of the CCTα cDNA sequence, and the reverse primer was 5′-ACAGAAAGGGAGGACAG-3′ corresponding to 1123–1159 bp of the CCTα cDNA sequence. The forward primer for CCTβ was 5′-CAAGTGGACAAAATGAAGG-3′ corresponding to 733–751 bp of the CCTβ cDNA sequence and the reverse primer was 5′-CTAGAAGTCTCTGCACCTCG-3′ corresponding to 1299–1238 bp of the CCTβ2 sequence or 974–993 bp of the CCTβ1 sequence. The PCR was performed in 50-μl reaction volume with 35 thermocycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmid DNA was isolated, transcribed, translated, and labeled with [35S]methionine using the Promega T7-coupled transcription/translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed by incubation of the membranes with purified anti-CCTα (1:2000 dilution), purified anti-CCTβ1 (B2 epitope) (1:2000 dilution), or purified anti-CCTβ2 (B3 epitope) (1:2000 dilution) as primary antibody. The Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Western blotting reagents and protocol were used to identify the immunoreactive proteins. For immunoprecipitations, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in the culture dish with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2% aprotinin, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm Na3VO4) for 30 min in 4 °C with gentle agitation. Cell lysates and debris were scraped from the dish and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Lysate supernatants were incubated for 1 h with 8 μg of anti-CCTβ (B2 epitope) purified antibody at 4 °C and then with the protein A-Sepharose beads pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed thoroughly. Immune complexes were disrupted by addition of Laemmli buffer and heated in boiling water for 3 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. The antibodies were labeled according to the instructions provided with Molecular Probes' FluoReporterTM labeling kits. Briefly, 200 μl of the 1–2 mg/ml antibody in PBS was combined with 20 ml of 1m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. An appropriate amount of 5 mg/ml reactive dye solution in Me2SO was added to the mixture. The amount of dye was calculated according to the following formula: μl of dye stock solution = (mg/ml protein × 0.2 ml × MWreactive dye × 200 ×MR)/MWprotein. Where 200 is a unit conversion factor, and MR is the molar ratio of dye to protein in the reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred in the dark for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 5.5 μl of hydroxylamine provided with the kit and additional stirring for 15 min. Labeled antibodies were purified using spin columns provided with the kit. The degree of labeling was determined by measuring protein and dye concentrations (extinction coefficients provided by Molecular Probes) in a spectrophotometer and calculating protein/dye ratio. Typical labeling reaction resulted in 5–10 molecules of dye per one bivalent antibody molecule. BAC1.2F5 cells (32Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HeLa cells (33Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2169-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. Cells were grown in 4-chamber LabTekTM II Chamber Slides™. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized. Six different fixation and permeabilization procedures were investigated to evaluate the reproducibility of staining patterns with Oregon GreenTM-labeled anti-CCTα antibodies. The procedure of choice entailed fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C followed by washing with PBS and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 25 °C. The other five methods that were tested included: 1) fixation in 3.6% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C and permeabilization with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 5 min at 25 °C (15Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); 2) fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilization with cold acetone for 20 min at −20 °C (3Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); 3) fixation and permeabilization in cold methanol for 6 min at −20 °C; 4) fixation and permeabilization in methanol:acetone (1:1) for 20 min at 4 °C; 5) fixation and permeabilization with 70% ethanol in 50 mmglycine for 15 min at −20 °C. All of the procedures, except the last one, resulted in the distribution of anti-CCTα staining in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Using the last fixation/permeabilization procedure, anti-CCTα was found in the cytoplasmic compartment only. After fixation and permeabilization, the cells were subjected to 3 × 5-min washes with PBS containing 1% dry milk and nonspecific binding was blocked with PBS with 1% dry milk for 1 h. Cells were then washed 3 × 5 min with PBS and treated with 1:50 dilution in PBS of the appropriate antibody. For antibody specificity controls, CCT antibodies were incubated for 1 h in the cold room rotator with a 20-fold molar excess of peptide before application to the cells. The antibody treatment was followed by 5 × 10-min washes with PBS with continuous shaking at 25 °C. For the colocalization studies, cells were treated with 50 μg/ml concanavalin A conjugates, 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin conjugates, or a 1:100 dilution of fluorophore-labeled anti-protein disulfide isomerase for 1 h at 25 °C after the treatment with the anti-CCT antibody and washed an additional 5 × 5 min with PBS with shaking. Slides were mounted with ProlongTM antifade in the mounting medium and covered with coverslips. For the localization of the nucleus, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye. Fluorescent antibodies and conjugates were visualized using a Leica DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with the TCS-NT scanning laser. The pictures were taken using Leica TCS-NT computer software. For high-resolution pictures, the images were digitally zoomed to bring a single cell into the field of view. Oregon GreenTM 488 fluorophore was visualized using an argon-ion laser and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (488, 514 nm); Texas RedTM was visualized with the krypton-ion laser using a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set (568, 647 nm); colocalization studies were conducted with argon and krypton lasers and double fluorescein isothiocyanate/tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter sets. Hoechst 33258 dye was visualized with the UV laser and 352/461 nm filter set. Two human cDNA clones similar to CCTβ1 were identified (GenBankTM accession numbers AA683266 and AI041180) using a BLAST search of the public expressed sequence-tagged data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The DNA sequences were verified/corrected and completed, and analysis of the sequence information revealed the existence of a unique CCTβ mRNA, called CCTβ2, that was identical to CCTβ1 at the 5′ end of the open reading frame but was predicted to encode a protein with a very different carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). The cDNA sequence of clone AI041180 included both carboxyl termini representing the two variants of CCTβ with two in-frame stop codons to terminate translation, as well as the entire 5′ coding sequence. These data indicated that two transcripts were expressed from the same gene and also indicated that the exon encoding the β2 carboxyl terminus precedes the one encoding the β1 terminus in the genomic structure. The sequence analysis indicated that CCTβ2 is a splice variant of CCTβ1. The cDNA for CCTβ2 was assembled to exclude the possibility of expression of CCTβ1, and subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3. The predicted amino acid sequence of CCTβ2 was aligned with the sequences of CCTα and CCTβ1 (Fig. 2). The predicted CCTβ2 protein had 369 amino acids and was identical to CCTβ1 from amino acids 1 to 320. After residue 320 there were 39 additional amino acids, including two groups of 5 and 4 amino acids (SSPTR, residues 321–325, and RSPS, residues 328–331), respectively, which were identical to sequences in CCTα and missing from CCTβ1. The carboxyl terminus of CCTβ2 had 21 potential phosphorylation sites after position 310, including 19 serines and 2 threonine residues. As shown in Fig. 2 only 9 serines and 1 threonine of CCTβ2 align with the corresponding residues of CCTα. The existence of 21 potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in the predicted carboxyl-terminal domain of CCTβ2 suggested that this enzyme was phosphorylated similar to the modification of CCTα protein. This point was tested by transfecting COS-7 cells with CCTβ1, CCTβ2, or a vector control and followed labeling 48 h later with [32P]orthophosphate (160 μCi/ml) for 60 min. Both CCTβ isoforms were immunoprecipitated with the amino-terminal anti-CCTβ antibody (B2 epitope), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. CCTβ2 was highly phosphorylated (Fig. 3) confirming the prediction made from the analysis of the primary structure of its carboxyl terminus. CCTβ1 was also phosphorylated, although to a signficantly lesser extent as was predicted from the fact that CCTβ1 had only 3 potential phosphorylation sites after amino acid 310. These data are consistent with the idea that the carboxyl-terminal domains of CCTβ1 and CCTβ2 were the exclusive sites of phosphorylation, as was shown with CCTα (9Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J.

This was observed by following mitochondrial swelling in isotonic KCl solutions and was confirmed by a novel method in which the membrane potential decrease due to externally added K+ is measured fluorimetrically by using safranine. A detailed investigation of K+ uptake by durum wheat mitochondria shows hyperbolic dependence on the ion concentration and specificity. K+ uptake electrogenicity and the non-competitive inhibition due to either ATP or NADH are also shown. In the whole, the experimental findings reported in this paper demonstrate the existence of the mitochondrial K+ATPchannel in plants (PmitoKATP). Interestingly, Mg2+ and glyburide, which can inhibit mammalian K+ channel, have no effect on PmitoKATP. In the presence of the superoxide anion producing system (xanthine plus xanthine oxidase), PmitoKATP activation was found. Moreover, an inverse relationship was found between channel activity and mitochondrial superoxide anion formation, as measured via epinephrine photometric assay. These findings strongly suggest that mitochondrial K+ uptake could be involved in plant defense mechanism against oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species generation.

These findings strongly suggest that mitochondrial K+ uptake could be involved in plant defense mechanism against oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species generation. electrical membrane potential bovine serum albumin durum wheat mitochondria enzymatic units (μmol·min−1) carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone plant inner membrane anion channel mitochondrial K+ channel in plants mitochondrial K+ channel polyvinylpyrrolidone superoxide dismutase tetraethylammonium cation One of most outstanding problems in mitochondria bioenergetics concerns the mitochondrial permeability to metabolites, organic compounds, including vitamins, their derived cofactors, and metal ions. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains metabolite carriers (for review, see Refs. 1Atlante A. Passarella S. Minervini G.M. Quagliariello E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 2Atlante A. Passarella S. Pierro P. Quagliariello E. Arch. Biochem.

De Virgilio C. Barile M. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inner membrane also contains the cation carriers and channels that regulate cell and mitochondrial physiology. In particular, as regards K+ ion, in mammalian mitochondria, the transport properties are such that net potassium flux across the mitochondrial membrane determines mitochondrial volume (Refs. 5Bernardi P. Angrilli A. Ambrosin V. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18902-18906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 6Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar and references therein). It has been shown that K+ uptake is mediated by diffusion leak, driven by the high electric membrane potential maintained by redox-driven electrophoretic proton ejection, and that regulated K+ efflux is mediated by the inner membrane K+/H+ antiporter (see Ref. 7Paucek P.

There is also evidence for the existence of an inner membrane protein designed to catalyze electrophoretic K+ uptake into mammalian (5Bernardi P. Angrilli A. Ambrosin V. Azzone G.F. J. Biol.

As far as plant mitochondria are concerned, even though mitochondrial structure and function are expected to be strictly dependent on K+transport across the mitochondrial membrane, the knowledge of K+ permeability is not established at present. Indeed, the presence of a powerful K+/H+ antiporter, which partially collapses ΔpH, thereby increasing ΔΨ,1 has been shown (Refs. 15Diolez P. Moreau F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 56-63Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 16Diolez P. Moreau F. Moore A.L. Beechey R.B. Plant Mitochondria: Structural, Functional and Physiological Aspects. Plenum Press, New York1987: 17-25Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). On the other hand, among a variety of compounds (including reducing sugars, proline, and Cl−), K+ could play a significant role in the leaf osmotic adjustment in response to water stress (17Rascio A. Platani C. Scalfati G. Tonti A. Di Fonzo N. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 90: 715-721Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the purpose of this investigation was an attempt to determine whether and how K+ can enter per se plant mitochondria. They were isolated from a number of different plant species, and a detailed investigation was carried out using durum wheat mitochondria. The latter were chosen on the grounds of their high K+permeability. The existence of a K+ channel, which is probably involved in plant defense against oxidative stress, is shown. All reagents were purchased from Sigma. They were of purest available grade and they were used without further purification. Substrates were used as Tris salts at pH 7.20. Solution pH was adjusted with either Tris or HCl. Valinomycin, oligomycin, nigericin, and diazoxide were dissolved in ethanol. Certified seeds of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spelt (Triticum dicoccum Schübler), rye (Secale cereale L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were from the Italian Cereal Crop Institute. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber and spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) leaves were from the local market. Durum wheat seeds, cv. Ofanto (250 g) were sowed on a distilled water-saturated polyurethane foam sheet, and they were covered with a Whatman filter paper. They were then grown in the dark at 25 °C and 95% relative humidity for 72 h in an Heraeus HPS 1500 incubator. About 200 g of etiolated shoots (1–2 cm long) were removed from seedlings, and mitochondria were isolated essentially as in Ref. 18Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholarwith minor modifications; the grinding and washing buffers were 0.5m sucrose, 4 mm cysteine, 1 mmEDTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.50, 0.1% (w/v) defatted BSA, 0.6% (w/v) PVP; and 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.40, 0.1% (w/v) defatted BSA, respectively. Purification of washed mitochondria was performed by isopycnic centrifugation in a self-generating density gradient containing 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.20, and 28% (v/v) Percoll (colloidal PVP-coated silica, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in combination with a linear gradient of 0% (top) to 10% (bottom) (w/v) PVP-40 (19Moore A.L. Proudlove M.O. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 415-420Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial suspension was diluted with an appropriate volume of sucrose-free washing medium, in order to obtain a 0.3 m sucrose concentration. Mitochondrial protein content was determined by the method of Lowry modified as in Ref. 20Harris D.A. Bashford C.L. Harris D.A. Spectrophotometry and Spectrofluorimetry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 59-61Google Scholar, using BSA as a standard. The purified mitochondria showed 95% and 90% intactness of inner and outer membrane, respectively, determined as in Ref. 18Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar. They were tightly coupled: oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate occurs with a respiratory control ratio equal to 6.7 ± 1.4 (S.E., four experiments) and with an ADP/O ratio, i.e. the ratio between the phosphorylated ADP and reduced oxygen, equal to 3.6 ± 0.15 (S.E., four experiments). Oxygen uptake was measured at 25 °C by means of a Gilson Oxygraph model 5/6-servo channel, pH 5, equipped with a Clark-type electrode (5331; YSI, Yellow Spring, OH) in a medium consisting of 0.3 m mannitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) defatted BSA, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.20. Mitochondria from etiolated seedlings of bread wheat, spelt, rye, and barley were obtained as above reported for DWM isolation. Mitochondria from potato and spinach were obtained from 100 g of tubers and 200 g of leaves, respectively; homogenization was carried out by using a Waring Blendor homogenizer (speed setting 3 × 3 s × 3 times). Purification was performed as for DWM; in order to prevent chlorophyll contamination, washed spinach mitochondria were passed two consecutive times through the Percoll gradient. In any experiment, coupled mitochondria were used showing osmotic response, as monitored in swelling experiments, as well as the capability to generate membrane potential following succinate addition, as monitored via safranine response. Swelling experiments were performed at 25 °C by monitoring photometrically at 546 nm the absorbance of a suspension of mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein) in different isotonic media as a function of time. In the swelling experiments devoted to investigate the MgCl2 effect, this was not present or included in the medium at 0.1 and 5 mm concentrations. Mitochondrial ΔΨ changes were monitored at 25 °C essentially as in Ref. 21Moore A.L. Bonner Jr., W.D. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, by measuring safranine fluorescence changes (λex 520 nm, λem 570 nm) by means of the Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter. The reaction medium (2 ml) contained DWM (0.2 mg of protein), 0.3 m mannitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.20, 2.5 μm safranine. In the ΔΨ experiments aimed at investigating the MgCl2 effect, this was either omitted from the medium or used at 0.1 and 5 mm concentrations. Calibration of the safranine fluorescence decrease as a function of K+ diffusion potential was performed according to Ref. 22Zottini M. Mandolino G. Zannoni D. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholarby using rat liver mitochondria isolated as in Ref. 23Klingerberg M. Slenczka W. Biochem. Z. 1959; 331: 486-517PubMed Google Scholar; the K+ diffusion potential in rat liver mitochondria was induced by adding 0.05 μg/ml valinomycin (24Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Production of superoxide anion was determined essentially as in Ref. 25Boveris A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar by monitoring photometrically (480 nm, ε480 = 4.00 mm−1cm−1) the rate of epinephrine oxidation to adrenochrome. The assay was carried out in the presence of 5 mm succinate in 2 ml of a medium consisting of 100 mm KCl, 110 mm mannitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 EU of catalase, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.20; 10 μmcytochrome c was also present to account for the swelling-dependent endogenous cytochrome c release (26Matlib M.A. O'Brien P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.1 mg of protein) were incubated for 10 min during which any mitochondrial swelling was completed, then the reaction was started by adding 1 mm epinephrine. In certain experiments the osmoticum was 0.5 mm KCl plus 309 mm mannitol instead of 100 mm KCl plus 110 mm mannitol. In order to establish whether superoxide anion formation can affect PmitoKATP activity, superoxide anion was generated by using the properly developed superoxide anion-producing system consisting of 0.1 mm xanthine plus 0.038 EU of xanthine oxidase. This system was added to 2 ml of 0.18 m KCl, 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.00. 30 s later mitochondria were added, and the swelling was continuously monitored. In ΔΨ experiments, the superoxide anion producing system was added to 2 ml of the safranine medium containing mitochondria; after 30 s of incubation, 5 mm succinate was added, then the ΔΨ decrease was induced by KCl (25 mm) addition. Swelling and ΔΨ experiments were carried out as described in the respective sections. In order to gain a first insight into the K+ permeability of purified DWM, swelling experiments were carried out, using isolated mitochondria in the absence of externally added respiratory substrates. In control experiments, the absorbance of DWM, suspended in 0.36 m sucrose solution, was found to remain constant during the time, since sucrose cannot enter mitochondria (Fig. 1 A, trace a); conversely, DWM were found to swell in 0.14 m NH4Pi solution (Fig.1 A, trace b). The mitochondrial K+ permeability was checked by suspending DWM in potassium acetate and in KCl isotonic solutions. In the light of the existence of K+/H+ antiport, previously reported in plant mitochondria (Refs. 15Diolez P. Moreau F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 56-63Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 16Diolez P. Moreau F. Moore A.L. Beechey R.B. Plant Mitochondria: Structural, Functional and Physiological Aspects. Plenum Press, New York1987: 17-25Crossref Google Scholar and references therein), spontaneous swelling was found in potassium acetate with initial swelling rate equal to 0.08 ΔA/min·mg protein (Fig. 1 A, trace c). A further addition of nigericin, which allows K+/H+ exchange, has been proven to increase swelling rate up to 0.16 ΔA/min·mg protein. Surprisingly, DWM were found to swell rapidly in KCl (initial rate equal to 0.12 ΔA/min·mg protein) (Fig. 1 A, trace d); since Cl− can enter plant mitochondria (27Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such a swelling indicates that K+ can penetrate per se mitochondria in the absence of valinomycin. When valinomycin, which allows K+ permeability, was added at the end of the spontaneous swelling, little additional absorbance decrease was observed. No significant changes in both rate and extent of swelling was found in the presence of the respiratory substrate succinate or of the uncoupler FCCP or of the inhibitor pair cyanide plus salicylhydroxamic acid, which can inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and plant alternative oxidase, respectively (data not shown). When DWM were suspended in KCl in the presence of valinomycin, a very high rate swelling was found to occur (initial rate was 1.9 ΔA/min·mg protein) (Fig. 1 A, trace e), indicating that K+ rather than Cl− uptake via PIMAC (27Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) represents the rate-limiting step of DWM swelling in KCl. In the light of the already reported ATP inhibition of K+channel in mammalian mitochondria (6Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1997; 1321: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated whether externally added ATP can prevent DWM swelling in KCl (Fig.1 B). First, in a control experiment it was observed that ATP (1 mm) did not affect DWM absorbance in sucrose medium (Fig. 1 B, traces f and g); however, ATP inhibited both the initial rate (about 25%) and the extent of the KCl swelling (Fig. 1 B, traces k and l). Inhibition was insensitive to oligomycin and atractyloside, powerful inhibitors of ATP synthase and of ADP/ATP translocator, respectively (Fig. 1 B, trace j), which have no effect on the KCl swelling (data not shown). Valinomycin, added at the end of the swelling, induced an additional significant swelling (Fig.1 B, traces j and k). This finding indicates that K+ uptake rather than Cl− uptake was inhibited by ATP under these experimental conditions (1 mm ATP, absence of valinomycin). Swelling experiments in KCl plus valinomycin occurred at very fast rates, and these rates were inhibited by ATP (Fig. 1 B, traces m and n), raising the possibility of ATP inhibition of Cl− transport. In the same experiment, swelling in TEA+ medium was also carried out either in the absence or in the presence of ATP (see Ref. 10Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 997-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); ATP was found to cause no significant change in TEACl swelling, which occurs with a low rate (Fig. 1 B, traces h and i). These qualitative findings are consistent with the existence of a mitochondrial KATP channel; however, two findings render them insufficient to establish such a process with certainty. ATP inhibition of Cl− transport could explain the data; moreover, swelling in KCl plus succinate is unexpected if mitochondria maintain their membrane potential during respiration. The observed K+ uptake as well as the possible potassium cycle in Garlid's terms (6Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) are expected to cause membrane potential decrease, which could occur as a result of K+and/or H+ transport by DWM (see SchemeFS1). We monitored ΔΨ using a safranine probe, and observed that succinate addition (5 mm) to DWM in the absence of K+ caused a rapid increase of ΔΨ to about 185 mV (Fig. 2 A). Phosphate caused a slight increase of ΔΨ, as expected if it enters via proton-compensated symport (21Moore A.L. Bonner Jr., W.D. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), whereas ADP caused a decrease of ΔΨ, as expected from the increased proton current secondary to ATP synthesis. The ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin, partially restored ΔΨ, and the uncoupler, FCCP, abolished ΔΨ (Fig.2 A). Taken together, these findings indicate that DWM exhibit normal functionality with respect to ΔΨ in K+-free medium.Figure 2Changes in DWM ΔΨ. A, the mitochondria response to certain compounds; B, the K+-induced ΔΨ decrease and the effect of external ATP or NADH; C, the effect of K+ and Na+ on DWM ΔΨ;D, K+ prevention of the succinate-induced ΔΨ increase. Measurements were carried out as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” At the arrows the following additions were made: A, 5 mm succinate (Succ), 1 mm phosphate (Pi), 1 mm ADP, 2 μg of oligomycin (Oligo), 1 μm FCCP; B, 1 mm ATP or 1 mm NADH or nothing (Control trace), 5 mm succinate, 25 mm KCl; C, 5 mm succinate, 4 pulses of either KCl or NaCl (1 mm each), 0.1 μg of valinomycin (Val), and 1 μm FCCP; D, 5 mm succinate and 0.1 μg of valinomycin; the medium contained KCl at the reported concentrations; osmolarity was kept constant by acting on mannitol concentration. For further details, see “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Entirely different results were obtained when KCl was added to the medium (Fig. 2, B–D). When KCl was added after energization and hyperpolarization, ΔΨ was collapsed (Fig. 2 B) similarly to the effect of FCCP. This depolarization was prevented by both ATP and NADH. Sequential additions of 1 mm KCl caused progressive depolarization, whereas NaCl had no effect (Fig.2 C). Indeed, ΔΨ was generated at a rate and to an extent inversely relating to KCl concentration (Fig. 2 D). When valinomycin was added to DWM in the absence of added K+, a small depolarization was observed (Fig. 2, C and D). This is consistent with the contribution of the K+/H+ antiporter to extramitochondrial K+ in such media, resulting in K+ cycling and some uncoupling when valinomycin is added. The experiments in Fig. 2 appear to resolve uncertainties arising from the data in Fig. 1. Thus, high KCl concentrations are able to uncouple DWM completely, thus accounting for the observed swelling in the presence of succinate. Moreover, the failure of NaCl to mimic the uncoupling effects of KCl identifies K+ uniport as the uncoupling modality. The y intercepts of the Dixon plots in Fig.3 coincide with the experimental values measured in the absence of inhibitor. The x intercepts indicate K1/2 values for ATP and NADH under these conditions of 290 and 390 μm, respectively. In order to ascertain whether other plant mitochondria are permeable to externally added K+, swelling and safranine experiments were carried out by using mitochondria from monocotyledonous (cereals) and dicotyledonous (potato and spinach) species, including etiolated and green tissues (TableI). Interestingly, all the investigated mitochondria were found to show a K+-dependent membrane potential decrease and to swell in 0.18 m KCl in the absence of valinomycin. The K+ permeability was markedly evident in cereals; the highly permeable durum wheat species was used for further investigations. Potato mitochondria proved to be the least permeable to K+ among the investigated species. It should be noted that, in all cases, the swelling in KCl was enhanced by valinomycin, thus indicating that the K+ permeability rather than Cl− permeability was investigated (data not shown). We also studied swelling in 0.18 m potassium acetate in a medium containing 1% BSA in order to inhibit plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein activity (28Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P.

The swelling in Kac was performed in presence of 1% (w/v) BSA except for Triticum durum. In order to gain some insight into the mechanism by which K+ enters DWM, the dependence of the K+ uptake rate was investigated as a function of 0.005–25 mm KCl concentration (Fig.4). Hyperbolic dependence on the concentration was found, suggesting that K+ uptake takes place in a protein-dependent manner, probably via PmitoKATP. In three different experiments, Km and Vmax were 2.2 ± 0.78 mm (S.E.) and 12.5 ± 1.96 mV/s (S.E.), respectively. The rate of ΔΨ decrease due to FCCP addition was found to be greater than that observed with all KCl additions (Fig. 4, inset), confirming that this rate is not limited by the rate of safranine response. To gain an insight into the specificity of PmitoKATP, we compared the swelling response to various monovalent chloride salts (Fig. 5 A). The rate and amplitude of mitochondrial swelling varied in the order Cs+> K+ = Rb+ > Na+ = Li+. We also examined their ability to collapse ΔΨ in respiring mitochondria (Fig. 5 B). Na+ and Li+ had no significant effect, whereas K+, Cs+, and Rb+ caused ΔΨ decrease at a significant rate. In order to ascertain whether and how the K+ channel is ΔΨ-dependent, DWM, previously energized by succinate, were treated with FCCP in the nanomolar concentration range, designed to partially collapse membrane potential. Then the dependence of the rate of ΔΨ decrease on the actual mitochondrial ΔΨ was investigated, using 25 mm KCl (Fig.6). A fast decrease of K+-dependent depolarization, i.e. of the K+ channel activity, was found in ΔΨ range varying from about 175 to 140 mV. The rate was found to remain rather constant in the range 140–95 mV. We examined inhibitors and activators of mammalian mitoKATP to determine whether PmitoKATP shared any or all of the ligands previously reported for mitoKATP (10Beavis A.D. Lu Y. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Like mammalian mitoKATP, PmitoKATP is inhibited by ATP (Figs. 2 A and 3 A) and ADP, and ATP inhibition is prevented or reversed by GTP and diazoxide. PmitoKATP is also stimulated by the sulfydryl group reagents mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast to mammalian mitoKATP, PmitoKATP is activated, rather than inhibited, by palmitoyl-CoA, and it is not inhibited by glyburide. The glyburide effect was examined in both the absence or presence of Mg2+ (0.1 mm) plus ATP (1 mm) plus either diazoxide (10 μm) or GTP (1 mm), which proved to be essential for inhibition due to glyburide of mitochondrial K+ channel in mammalian (31Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Mutations in dally, a gene encoding a Drosophila glypican, and in GPC3, the gene for human glypican-3, implicate glypicans in the control of cell growth and division. So far, five members of the glypican family have been identified in vertebrates. By sequencing expressed sequence tag clones and products of rapid amplifications of cDNA ends, we identified a sixth member of the glypican family. The glypican-6 mRNA encodes a protein of 555 amino acids that is most homologous to glypican-4 (identity of 63%). Expression of this protein in Namalwa cells shows a core protein of ∼60 kDa that is substituted with heparan sulfate only. GPC6, the gene encoding human glypican-6, contains nine exons. Like GPC5, the gene encoding glypican-5, GPC6 maps to chromosome 13q32. Clustering of the GPC5/GPC6 genes on chromosome 13q32 is strongly reminiscent of the clustering of the GPC3/GPC4 genes on chromosome Xq26 and suggests GPCs arose from a series of gene and genome duplications. Based on similarities in sequence and gene organization, glypican-1, glypican-2, glypican-4, and glypican-6 appear to define a subfamily of glypicans, differing from the subfamily comprising so far glypican-3 and glypican-5.

Substantial evidence suggests that cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as “co-receptors” for FGFs1(2Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factors (3Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J.

Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), facilitating the interactions of these ligands with specific signal-transducing receptors and adding an important dimension of regulation to these signaling systems.Two major proteoglycan families account for most of the heparan sulfate that is integrally associated with cell surfaces, the syndecans (7Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and the glypicans (8Lander A.D. Stipp C.S. Ivins J.K. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar). While syndecans are transmembrane proteins, glypicans are linked to the cell surface through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Glypicans are also characterized by a unique pattern of 14 cysteine residues, conserved in all glypicans identified to date, including the glypican encoded by the dally gene in Drosophila (9Nakato H. Futch T.A. Selleck S.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3687-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core proteins of all glypicans are of roughly similar sizes (60 kDa) and contain Ser-Gly repeats in their C-terminal parts that compose sites for substitution with heparan sulfate. Since the structures of individual glypicans are extremely well conserved across species, these proteins might support additional specific functions, other than the display of heparan sulfate at the cell surface. Recently, it has been claimed that both insulin-like growth factor-2 and tissue factor pathway inhibitor are ligands for the core protein of glypican-3 (10Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A.

Schwartz A.L. Broze Jr., G.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).All glypicans are highly expressed during embryonic development. Glypican-1 is a major proteoglycan in the developing and adult brain, but it is also expressed in the kidneys, perichondrium, and several other tissues (12David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Glypican-2 expression, in contrast, is limited to the developing nervous system (14Stipp C.S. Litwack E.D. Lander A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Glypican-3 is highly expressed in the developing intestine and in mesoderm-derived tissues (15Filmus J. Church J.G. Buick N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas glypican-4 shows a predominant expression in blood vessels, kidney, brain, and adrenal cortex (17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Glypican-5 shows a developmentally regulated expression in kidney, limb, and brain (18Saunders S. Paine-Saunders S. Lander A.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,19Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Reekmans G. Steinfeld R. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1997; 40: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), with brain expressions that persist into the adult. Consistent with a proposed role in development, the expression patterns of these glypicans often coincide with those of growth factors, such as FGFs and BMPs, and their receptors.The first mutations described in glypican genes are associated with phenotypes that show a deregulation of cellular growth and morphogenesis, further implicating glypicans as controllers or effectors of developmental processes. Mutations of the dally locus in Drosophila affect cell division patterning and morphogenesis in the developing brain (9Nakato H. Futch T.A. Selleck S.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3687-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and genetic evidence suggests that dally affects the cellular response to Dpp, the transforming growth factor-β-related morphogen encoded by decapentaplegic (5Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions and translocations affecting glypican-3, and occasionally also glypican-4, are associated with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (10Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Babayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 20Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1998; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This X-linked syndrome is characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, visceral and skeletal anomalies, and an increased risk for the development of tumors (21Hughes-Benzie R.M. Hunter A.G.W. Allanson J.E. Mackenzie A.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 43: 428-435Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence that overexpression of glypican-3 induces cell line-specific apoptosis might provide some link to the genesis of these dysmorphisms, but the precise mechanisms at work remain unclear (22Gonzalez A.D. Kaya M. Shi W. Song H. Testa J.R. Penn L.Z. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).More insight in the regulatory roles or functions of the glypicans might be gained from the identification of additional members of this gene family. By extensive analysis of EST data bases and cDNA cloning, we were able to identify a sixth member of the glypican gene family. Glypican-6 appears to be a close homologue of glypican-4. Recombinant glypican-6 is substituted with heparan sulfate, and Northern blotting and in situ RNA analyses show that glypican-6 is differentially expressed in the tissues of the developing embryo and the adult.DISCUSSIONBio-informatics and RACEs have led to the identification of a sixth member of the human glypican gene family and of its mouse orthologue. As might have been expected from the characterization of the other members, the human and mouse forms of glypican-6 are highly similar in structure, with 96% identity.Ectopic expression of this protein in Namalwa cells shows that glypican-6 can be substituted with heparan sulfate. Whereas the syndecans frequently contain both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (28Rapraeger A.C. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the recombinant glypican-6 that is substituted with heparan sulfate in Namalwa cells apparently only carries this type of glycosaminoglycan. This is an observation that has also been reported for other glypicans (12David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Stipp C.S. Litwack E.D. Lander A.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Reekmans G. Steinfeld R. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1997; 40: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Filmus J. Shi W. Wong Z.M. Wong M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), implying that glypicans may be substrates that are particularly well suited for the priming of this glycosaminoglycan or that are exclusively routed to membrane compartments that are endowed with this specific biosynthetic machinery. Whether and how this might relate to the highly conserved “glypican” structural motif that is common to all these proteins is still an unresolved issue. It is clear, however, that glypican-6 extends the list of proteins that can ensure the expression of heparan sulfate at cell surfaces and of potential co-receptors for heparin-dependent growth factors and morphogens.Based upon sequence alignments only, the glypicans might already be divided in two subfamilies. The glypicans -1, -2, -4,and -6 form a separate group with high homology (40–60%) to each other but only 20% identity to the other group comprising glypican-3 and glypican-5 (also 40% identical to each other). The hypothesis of different subfamilies is further strengthened by an analysis of the genomic structures of the corresponding genes as follows: GPC1, GPC2, GPC4, and GPC6 consist of nine exons, whereas GPC3 and GPC5 contain only eight exons (20Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1998; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Huber R. Crisponi L. Mazzarella R. Chen R.N. Su Y. Shizuya H. Chen E.Y. Cao A. Pilia G. Genomics. 1997; 45: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).2 Interestingly, glypican-6 is most homologous to glypican-4 (both proteins are 63% identical). The GPC 6 gene maps close to the GPC 5 gene on human chromosome 13q32, whereas GPC 4 maps to chromosome Xq26, where it flanks GPC 3, the gene encoding the glypican which so far is most homologous to glypican-5. This suggests glypicans arose from a series of gene and genome duplications and may herald extension of the gene family by additional members and gene clusters. Whether members of the same subfamily share some common functions and members belonging to different subfamilies have different functions remains to be established. However, it is interesting to note that glypican-3 shows an overlapping expression with glypican-6 in the developing kidney (at least in mouse), whereas glypican-6 may not substitute for the loss of GPC3 function in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (since that syndrome is often associated with kidney malformation).GPC6, like GPC1 and GPC4 (13Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues, but GPC6 mRNA is not ubiquitous. In situ hybridization studies in mouse embryos suggest highly specific and regulated expressions of glypican-6 during development, partly overlapping with and partly different from those reported for other glypicans. High and highly distinctive expressions can be inferred in the dental mesenchyme, metanephric cap mesenchyme, intestinal mesenchyme, and blood vessels, suggesting a specific function for glypican-6 in the development of these organs. In the developing tooth the expression pattern of glypican-6 overlaps with that reported for BMP4, at least during the developmental stages examined here (30Vainio S. Karavanova I. Jowett A. Thesleff I. Cell. 1993; 75: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). BMP4 is the closest human homologue of the product of decapentaplegic. Since dally influences the signaling processes supported by decapentaplegic, it is tempting to speculate that glypican-6 might act as a co-receptor for BMP4 or modulator of the BMP4 signaling pathway during tooth development. Glypicans in general might have a role during tooth development since loss of GPC3 in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome patients is associated with dental malocclusion (31Weksberg R. Squire J.A. Templeton D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the kidney (at the mRNA level), the expression of glypican-6 overlaps with the expression pattern of BMP7 (6Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also with that of the heparan sulfate-modifying enzyme, heparan sulfate-2-O-sulfotransferase (32Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). All three are highly expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. The heparan sulfate present at these sites appears to be necessary for kidney development as mice deficient in heparan sulfate-2-O-sulfotransferase exhibit bilateral renal agenesis (32Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). By its nature, glypican-6 qualifies as a potential substrate for this enzyme. Mice deficient in BMP7 show a gradual cessation of nephrogenesis associated with apoptosis of the metanephric mesenchyme. Interestingly, BMP7 expression in the metanephric mesenchyme requires proteoglycans (6Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to glypican-6, at least glypican-3 and syndecan-2 are also expressed in the kidney mesenchyme and might equally qualify as regulators of the signaling of this growth factor (16Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The expression of glypican-6 indeed partially overlaps that of several other heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including glypican-4, the proteoglycan that structurally is most closely related to glypican-6. Based on prior reports by others (17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) overlapping GPC4 and GPC6 expressions occur in the prospective smooth muscle layers of the blood vessels and digestive system. Both genes also appear to be co-expressed in the nervous system, where they are mainly restricted to the ventricular zones. Yet, in most tissues the two members of this glypican subgroup appear to be differentially expressed. In the kidney, where GPC4 (along with GPC1) is highly expressed in pretubular aggregates, GPC6 expression is limited to the cortical mesenchyme, where it shows overlap with GPC3 expression (16Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In general, both glypican-1 and glypican-4 show epithelial expressions, whereas glypican-6, like glypican-3, shows a predominant expression in mesenchymal cells. Intriguingly, in the otic vesicle and cochlea, one of the rare examples of epithelial stainings for GPC6, glypican-6 appears to be expressed along with glypican-5 (18Saunders S. Paine-Saunders S. Lander A.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting coordinated expression of two members from the same gene cluster (assuming a similar gene organization in man and mouse) at this site. Future studies will undoubtedly provide additional details on these expressions and might also reveal possible relationships and hierarchies between genes belonging to similar or different subfamilies and gene clusters. At present, we are left wondering about the functional significance of this extensive proteoglycan diversity. In summary, glypican-6 is a novel heparan sulfate proteoglycan that shows a highly distinctive and regulated developmental expression, extending the repertoire of candidate morphogen cofactors or modulators. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present at the surfaces of most adherent cells and in the extracellular matrices that support or surround these cells. The heparin-like moieties of these molecules bind and modulate the activities of several matrix components, growth factors, proteinase inhibitors, cell-cell, and cell-matrix adhesion molecules (1Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence suggests that cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as “co-receptors” for FGFs1(2Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factors (3Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J.

Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 421-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and members of the transforming growth factor-βBMP superfamily (5Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A.

Two major proteoglycan families account for most of the heparan sulfate that is integrally associated with cell surfaces, the syndecans (7Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) and the glypicans (8Lander A.D. Stipp C.S. Ivins J.K. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar). While syndecans are transmembrane proteins, glypicans are linked to the cell surface through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.

Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions and translocations affecting glypican-3, and occasionally also glypican-4, are associated with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (10Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Babayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 20Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1998; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This X-linked syndrome is characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth, visceral and skeletal anomalies, and an increased risk for the development of tumors (21Hughes-Benzie R.M. Hunter A.G.W. Allanson J.E. Mackenzie A.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 43: 428-435Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence that overexpression of glypican-3 induces cell line-specific apoptosis might provide some link to the genesis of these dysmorphisms, but the precise mechanisms at work remain unclear (22Gonzalez A.D. Kaya M. Shi W. Song H. Testa J.R. Penn L.Z. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). More insight in the regulatory roles or functions of the glypicans might be gained from the identification of additional members of this gene family. By extensive analysis of EST data bases and cDNA cloning, we were able to identify a sixth member of the glypican gene family. Glypican-6 appears to be a close homologue of glypican-4. Recombinant glypican-6 is substituted with heparan sulfate, and Northern blotting and in situ RNA analyses show that glypican-6 is differentially expressed in the tissues of the developing embryo and the adult. DISCUSSIONBio-informatics and RACEs have led to the identification of a sixth member of the human glypican gene family and of its mouse orthologue. As might have been expected from the characterization of the other members, the human and mouse forms of glypican-6 are highly similar in structure, with 96% identity.Ectopic expression of this protein in Namalwa cells shows that glypican-6 can be substituted with heparan sulfate. Whereas the syndecans frequently contain both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (28Rapraeger A.C. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the recombinant glypican-6 that is substituted with heparan sulfate in Namalwa cells apparently only carries this type of glycosaminoglycan. This is an observation that has also been reported for other glypicans (12David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Stipp C.S. Litwack E.D. Lander A.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Reekmans G. Steinfeld R. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1997; 40: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Filmus J. Shi W. Wong Z.M. Wong M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), implying that glypicans may be substrates that are particularly well suited for the priming of this glycosaminoglycan or that are exclusively routed to membrane compartments that are endowed with this specific biosynthetic machinery. Whether and how this might relate to the highly conserved “glypican” structural motif that is common to all these proteins is still an unresolved issue. It is clear, however, that glypican-6 extends the list of proteins that can ensure the expression of heparan sulfate at cell surfaces and of potential co-receptors for heparin-dependent growth factors and morphogens.Based upon sequence alignments only, the glypicans might already be divided in two subfamilies. The glypicans -1, -2, -4,and -6 form a separate group with high homology (40–60%) to each other but only 20% identity to the other group comprising glypican-3 and glypican-5 (also 40% identical to each other). The hypothesis of different subfamilies is further strengthened by an analysis of the genomic structures of the corresponding genes as follows: GPC1, GPC2, GPC4, and GPC6 consist of nine exons, whereas GPC3 and GPC5 contain only eight exons (20Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1998; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Huber R. Crisponi L. Mazzarella R. Chen R.N. Su Y. Shizuya H. Chen E.Y. Cao A. Pilia G. Genomics. 1997; 45: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).2 Interestingly, glypican-6 is most homologous to glypican-4 (both proteins are 63% identical). The GPC 6 gene maps close to the GPC 5 gene on human chromosome 13q32, whereas GPC 4 maps to chromosome Xq26, where it flanks GPC 3, the gene encoding the glypican which so far is most homologous to glypican-5. This suggests glypicans arose from a series of gene and genome duplications and may herald extension of the gene family by additional members and gene clusters. Whether members of the same subfamily share some common functions and members belonging to different subfamilies have different functions remains to be established. However, it is interesting to note that glypican-3 shows an overlapping expression with glypican-6 in the developing kidney (at least in mouse), whereas glypican-6 may not substitute for the loss of GPC3 function in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (since that syndrome is often associated with kidney malformation).GPC6, like GPC1 and GPC4 (13Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues, but GPC6 mRNA is not ubiquitous. In situ hybridization studies in mouse embryos suggest highly specific and regulated expressions of glypican-6 during development, partly overlapping with and partly different from those reported for other glypicans. High and highly distinctive expressions can be inferred in the dental mesenchyme, metanephric cap mesenchyme, intestinal mesenchyme, and blood vessels, suggesting a specific function for glypican-6 in the development of these organs. In the developing tooth the expression pattern of glypican-6 overlaps with that reported for BMP4, at least during the developmental stages examined here (30Vainio S. Karavanova I. Jowett A. Thesleff I. Cell. 1993; 75: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). BMP4 is the closest human homologue of the product of decapentaplegic. Since dally influences the signaling processes supported by decapentaplegic, it is tempting to speculate that glypican-6 might act as a co-receptor for BMP4 or modulator of the BMP4 signaling pathway during tooth development. Glypicans in general might have a role during tooth development since loss of GPC3 in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome patients is associated with dental malocclusion (31Weksberg R. Squire J.A. Templeton D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the kidney (at the mRNA level), the expression of glypican-6 overlaps with the expression pattern of BMP7 (6Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also with that of the heparan sulfate-modifying enzyme, heparan sulfate-2-O-sulfotransferase (32Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). All three are highly expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. The heparan sulfate present at these sites appears to be necessary for kidney development as mice deficient in heparan sulfate-2-O-sulfotransferase exhibit bilateral renal agenesis (32Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). By its nature, glypican-6 qualifies as a potential substrate for this enzyme. Mice deficient in BMP7 show a gradual cessation of nephrogenesis associated with apoptosis of the metanephric mesenchyme. Interestingly, BMP7 expression in the metanephric mesenchyme requires proteoglycans (6Godin R.E. Takaesu N.T. Robertson E.J. Dudley A.T. Development. 1998; 125: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to glypican-6, at least glypican-3 and syndecan-2 are also expressed in the kidney mesenchyme and might equally qualify as regulators of the signaling of this growth factor (16Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The expression of glypican-6 indeed partially overlaps that of several other heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including glypican-4, the proteoglycan that structurally is most closely related to glypican-6. Based on prior reports by others (17Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) overlapping GPC4 and GPC6 expressions occur in the prospective smooth muscle layers of the blood vessels and digestive system. Both genes also appear to be co-expressed in the nervous system, where they are mainly restricted to the ventricular zones. Yet, in most tissues the two members of this glypican subgroup appear to be differentially expressed. In the kidney, where GPC4 (along with GPC1) is highly expressed in pretubular aggregates, GPC6 expression is limited to the cortical mesenchyme, where it shows overlap with GPC3 expression (16Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In general, both glypican-1 and glypican-4 show epithelial expressions, whereas glypican-6, like glypican-3, shows a predominant expression in mesenchymal cells. Intriguingly, in the otic vesicle and cochlea, one of the rare examples of epithelial stainings for GPC6, glypican-6 appears to be expressed along with glypican-5 (18Saunders S. Paine-Saunders S. Lander A.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting coordinated expression of two members from the same gene cluster (assuming a similar gene organization in man and mouse) at this site. Future studies will undoubtedly provide additional details on these expressions and might also reveal possible relationships and hierarchies between genes belonging to similar or different subfamilies and gene clusters. At present, we are left wondering about the functional significance of this extensive proteoglycan diversity. In summary, glypican-6 is a novel heparan sulfate proteoglycan that shows a highly distinctive and regulated developmental expression, extending the repertoire of candidate morphogen cofactors or modulators. Bio-informatics and RACEs have led to the identification of a sixth member of the human glypican gene family and of its mouse orthologue.

Retinoic acid (RA) does not induce growth arrest of the RARβ2−/− cells, whereas the F9 WT and RARβ2+/− heterozygote lines undergo RA-induced growth arrest. The RARβ2+/− lines also exhibit a faster cell cycle transit time in the absence of RA. The RARβ2−/− stem cells exhibit an altered morphology when compared with the F9 WT parent line, and after RA treatment, the RARβ2−/− cells do not exhibit a fully differentiated cell morphology. As compared with F9 WT cells, the RARβ−/− cells exhibited a markedly lower induction of several early RA-responsive genes and no induction of laminin B1, a late response gene. The induction of RA metabolism in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells following differentiation was not impaired. The research presented here, and prior research suggest that RARβ is required for RA-induced growth arrest in a variety of cell types and that RARβ also functions in mediating late responses to RA.

Each of these RAR and RXR receptors has three isotypes (α, β, and γ), which are encoded by separate genes.

RARβ exhibits a restricted pattern of expression during development as well as in the mature organism (4Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.M. Ruffenach F. Leroy P. Chambon P.

This pattern of expression is different from those of the other RARs and suggests that RARβ performs specific functions distinct from those of RARα and RARγ. F9 teratocarcinoma cells (15Damjanov I. Solter D. Sherman M. Solter D. Teratomas and Differentiation. Academic Press, New York1975: 209-220Google Scholar) express all known RA receptors, but RARβ mRNA is only present in high amounts after RA addition (10Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that RARβ2 is the predominant RARβ isoform expressed in F9 cells (4Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A.

F9 cells have recently been used in our laboratories to inactivate the RARα and RARγ genes by homologous recombination (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This gene knockout approach has allowed the identification of a series of genes that are direct or indirect targets of RARα or RARγ, such as the “homeobox” genes of the Hoxb and Hoxa clusters, and the genes encoding the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and collagen IV(α1) (16Boylan J.F.

In breast cancer cell lines, RA is not able to induce RARβ mRNA expression, even though these cells can transcriptionally activate an exogenous RARβ RARE (retinoic acid response element) (19Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sager R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 133-141PubMed Google Scholar). When the expression of the RARβ gene is restored in breast cancer cell lines via an exogenous RARβ cDNA expression vector, the cells acquire sensitivity to RA-mediated apoptosis and growth arrest (29Li X.-S.

Transfection of a human epidermoid lung cancer cell line with RARβ causes decreased tumorigenicity (32Houle B. Rochette-Egly C. Bradley W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of RARβ2in HeLa cells induces growth inhibition (33Si S.P. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Buchsbaum R. Tibaduiza E. Peacocke M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 223: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), while expression of RARβ antisense mRNA decreases RA sensitivity in responsive cell lines (31Liu Y.

Bradley W.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The loss of RARβ may be an essential step in neoplastic progression, since there is evidence of a progressive decrease in RARβ mRNA expression during breast carcinogenesis (35Xu X.C. Sneige N. Liu X. Nandagiri R. Lee J.J. Lukmanji F. Hortobagyi G. Lippman S.M. Dhingra K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4992-4996PubMed Google Scholar) and greatly reduced RARβ mRNA expression in morphologically normal tissue adjacent to breast carcinomas (36Widschwendter M. Berger J. Daxenbichler G. Muller-Holzner E. Widschwendter A. Mayr A. Marth C. Zeimet A.G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4158-4161PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, characterizing the role of RARβ in the control of RA-mediated differentiation and growth arrest may lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of cancer. We have generated RARβ2 knockout F9 cells by homologous recombination in order to study the role of RARβ2 in mediating the effects of retinoids on cell growth and differentiation. RA is incapable of inducing growth arrest in these RARβ2−/− cells, indicating that in F9 cells RARβ2 is required for the growth inhibitory actions of RA. This finding is significant in light of the reduced expression of RARβ transcripts in a number of carcinomas, and it suggests that RARβ could regulate RA-induced growth arrest in a variety of cell types. The RARβ2 disruption vector has been described in detail previously (37Mendelsohn C. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gaub M.P. Krust A. Lampron C. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). F9 WT cells were cultured under standard conditions, and electroporation was performed as described previously (16Boylan J.F.

Johnson Pharmaceutical Institute, Raritan, NJ), BMS 188,649 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Buffalo, NY) and 9-cis- RA (Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ). [3H]RA was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Southern and Northern analyses were performed as described (41Boylan J.F. Gudas L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 965-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For Northern analyses, 10 μg of total mRNA were loaded per lane and the signals were quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed under standard conditions as described (42Faria T.F. LaRosa G.J. Wilen E.B. Liao J. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell.

Immune complexes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse serum (1:2000), respectively, and the Super-Signal Ultra Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Extraction of retinoids and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were performed as described (39Achkar C.C. Derguini F. Blumberg B. Langston A. Levin A.A. Speck J. Evans R.M. Bolado Jr., J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2007-2013PubMed Google Scholar). The RARβ2 isoform was inactivated with a disruption vector described previously (37Mendelsohn C. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gaub M.P. Krust A. Lampron C. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The neomycin-resistance gene was inserted into the exon 4 of the RARβ gene, which encodes the 5′-untranslated and the A2 region sequences of the RARβ2 isoform. The insertion of the neomycin resistance gene in this region disrupts only the RARβ2 isoform of the RARβ gene. F9 WT cells were electroporated and selected in G418. Resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Southern analysis for the expected change in size of the 6.5-kb wild-type (WT) Kpn I genomic fragment (the mutated allele is 4.3 kb), using a probe derived from DNA sequence located 5′ of the sequence contained in the targeting construct. Two heterozygous lines were generated, F9 WT-β2–291 and F9 WT-β2–270, out of a total of 800 colonies screened (Fig.1 A). To target the second allele, the heterozygous lines were selected in high concentrations of G418 for 21 days (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One clone was isolated, out of 300 surviving colonies (F9 WT-β2–270-110), as a result of a second recombination event in which the second WT allele was disrupted (Fig.1 A). This clone was then subcloned, and eight subclone lines were generated that showed similar behavior (data not shown). In order to show that the RARβ2−/− line lacked detectable RARβ2 mRNA, RT-PCR analysis was performed (Fig. 1 B). Whereas bands of the appropriate size for RARβ2 were detected in the F9 WT and RARβ2+/− 270 lines, no bands of that size were detected in the RARβ2−/− line. Thus, the RARβ2−/− cells do not express the RARβ2transcripts which are expressed in the F9 WT cells. The expression of retinoid receptors was evaluated by Northern and Western analysis (Fig.1 C). As expected, there is no detectable induction of RARβ transcripts upon treatment of the F9 RARβ2−/− cells with 1 μm RA. In contrast, in the heterozygous lines and the F9 WT line, there was a large (≈20-fold) induction of the RARβ transcripts after RA treatment. The expression of RARα and RXRβ mRNA was similar in all the lines. The expression of RARγ mRNA increased slightly (approximately) 2-fold after RA treatment of the F9 RARβ2−/− cells, in contrast to the decrease in RARγ mRNA observed in RA-treated F9 WT and RARβ2+/− cells. The levels of RXRα protein (Fig.1 C) were lower in the RARβ2+/− and RARβ2−/− than in the wild type cells. In summary, the RARβ2−/− line has a lower level of RXRα protein and (after RA treatment) a higher amount of RARγ mRNA. The other retinoid receptors are present at levels similar to those seen in F9 WT cells (Fig. 1 C). The levels of the RARβ protein in the F9 WT, F9 RARβ2+/−, and F9 RARβ2−/− cell lines were evaluated by Western analysis (Fig. 1 D). After 48 h of RA treatment, the RARβ protein is induced in the F9 WT cells and is induced to a lesser extent in the F9 RARβ2+/− cells. No RARβ protein was detected in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells (Fig. 1 D). The responsiveness of the F9 RARβ2−/− line to RA-induced growth arrest was evaluated (Fig.2). Unlike the F9 WT line and the heterozygote lines, the F9 RARβ2−/− line did not growth arrest in response to RA. Other retinoids and retinoid agonists were tested, including a RXR pan-agonist (BMS 188,649), and these were also not able to induce growth arrest in the F9 RARβ2−/− cell line (Fig. 3), although they were effective to varying degrees in arresting the growth of the parent F9 WT cell line. This suggests that RARβ2 is required for all of these compounds to exert their growth inhibitory effects in F9 cells.Figure 3Effects of various retinoids on the growth rates of F9 WT and F9 RAR β2−/− cells. The cells were plated in triplicate wells at a density of 1000 cells/well in the presence of RA, ROL, 4-oxoROL, 4-oxoRA, BMS 188,649 (RXR pan-agonist), 9-cis-RA, or fenretinide (all drugs were 1 μm) and counted after 6 days in culture. The results are plotted as cell number versus treatment.Data points, means of triplicate samples; bars, S.E. This experiment was performed two times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, both of the independently generated F9 RARβ2+/− heterozygote lines grow faster that the WT F9 cells in the absence of RA (Fig. 2, note the different y axis scales). The mean doubling time for the parent WT cell line was 22 h, whereas the F9 RARβ2+/− 270 heterozygote line had a mean doubling time of 17 h, indicating that reduced levels of RARβ2 protein are associated with a decrease in the cell cycle transit time. The morphology of the RARβ2−/− cells is markedly different from that of the parent F9 WT cells (Fig.4). In the absence of RA, there are noticeable differences between the F9 WT cells and the F9 RARβ2−/− cells; the latter clump together in cell aggregates, which do not exhibit the irregular borders characteristic of F9 WT cells. Following RA treatment, F9 WT cells form long cellular processes that are absent in the RARβ2−/− cells, which look like undifferentiated cells (Fig. 4). F9 WT cells exhibit even more dramatic morphological alterations after the addition of cAMP and theophylline (47Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 2936-2940Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (593) Google Scholar), unlike the RARβ2−/− cells. It should be noted that it is possible to observe a few morphological changes occurring in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells after treatment with RA; the RA-treated F9 RARβ2−/− cells become more flattened and exhibit more vacuoles. The F9 RARβ2+/− cells exhibit a similar morphology to F9 WT cells in both the absence and presence of RA (data not shown), indicating that both alleles of RARβ2 must be inactivated in order to observe alterations in the morphological phenotype. The F9 WT, F9 RARβ2+/−, and F9 RARβ2−/− cell lines were cultured in the presence of 1 μmall-trans-RA for the indicated times, and the expression of several genes which are transcriptionally activated by RA was evaluated (Fig. 5, A and B). In the heterozygous F9 RARβ2+/− lines, the induction of laminin B1, CRABP II, and P450RAI (CYP26) by RA was similar to or slightly lower than that in the F9 WT cells. The expression of the REX-1 gene, which in F9 WT cells was reduced by ∼2-fold after 48 h of RA treatment, was reduced similarly in the RARβ2+/− cells (2.4-fold). The greatest difference between F9 WT and F9 RARβ2+/− cells was that the Hoxa-1 gene was always induced to a greater extent at earlier time points in the heterozygote lines than in the F9 WT cells. In the experiment shown, there was an 18-fold induction of Hoxa-1 mRNA in the heterozygote lines cultured in the presence of RA for 48 h versus a 4.7-fold induction in F9 WT cells cultured under the same conditions (Fig. 5, A and B). The increased expression of Hoxa-1 in the heterozygote lines was transient, and after 96 h of RA treatment, the levels of Hoxa-1 mRNA were comparable in the F9 WT and the RARβ2+/− lines (7.3- and 6.5-fold induction). In the F9 RARβ2−/− line, the expression of early response genes such as p450RAI and CRABP II was RA-responsive, although the magnitude of the induction of these mRNAs was much lower in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells than in the F9 WT cells. In contrast, the induction of the Hoxa-1 message after 48 h of RA treatment was only 2-fold lower in the RARβ2−/− cells than in the F9 WT cells. The reduction in the levels of REX-1 message after 24 h of RA treatment was comparable in the RARβ2−/− cells and the F9 WT cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, the reduced REX-1 mRNA levels were not maintained in the RARβ2−/− cells, and by 96 h REX-1 levels were the same as those in the untreated cells (see Fig. 5 B for normalized data). Laminin B1, a late response gene, was not induced in the RARβ2−/− cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In summary, the F9 RARβ2−/− cells exhibited a reduction in the magnitude of the induction of a number of RA-responsive genes following RA treatment. Since we observed that the induction of p450RAI message after RA exposure was lower in the RARβ2−/− cells than in the F9 WT cells (Fig. 5, A and B), we compared the amounts of RA metabolized by the F9 WT and F9 RARβ2−/− lines. The two cell lines were treated for 72 h with vehicle or with 1 μm RA and were then cultured in the presence of [3H]all-trans-RA for 1 h or for 3 h, after which both the intracellular and the extracellular levels of the polar metabolites of [3H]all-trans-RA were quantitated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 6). Like the F9 WT cells, the F9 RARβ2−/− cells were able to metabolize RA and the levels of RA metabolites produced were dramatically increased after RA-induced differentiation. Since the levels of metabolites produced from [3H]RA were similar in the F9 WT and the RARβ2−/− cell lines, the lower induction of the p450RAI transcripts after RA in the RARβ2−/− cells (Fig. 5) was not associated with an impairment of the ability to metabolize [3H]RA under the conditions of our assays. We have previously reported the generation of F9 teratocarcinoma cell lines carrying targeted disruptions of the RARα and RARγ genes (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now continue the characterization of the roles of the RARs in mediating RA-induced F9 cell differentiation by generating cell lines carrying one or two disrupted alleles of the RARβ2gene. The RARβ2 disruption completely abrogates the growth arrest that is one of the hallmarks of RA action in a variety of cell types. The F9 RARβ2−/− cells did not growth arrest in response to RA or a variety of other retinoids (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, the data presented in this report, together with prior data from various F9 RAR and RXR knockout lines, strongly argue for a critical role for RARβ2 in mediating growth arrest in response to RA in F9 cells (Figs. 2 and 3). Whereas in the absence of RARβ2 no growth arrest in response to RA is observed in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells (Fig. 2), the RARα−/− and RARγ−/− lines growth arrest like WT cells, and the RXRα−/− and RXRα−/− RARα−/− lines partially growth arrest after RA addition (16Boylan J.F.

Only the RXRα−/− RARγ−/− line shows no growth arrest in response to RA. Although in this line RARβ2 mRNA induction is decreased by 2–3-fold (49Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), this relatively small impairment of RARβ2 expression probably does not contribute to the observed lack of growth arrest of the RXRα−/− RARγ−/− cells (50Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since the RARβ2−/− line has a lower level of RXRα protein than F9 WT cells (Fig. 1 C), it is possible that in these RARβ2−/− cells the RXRα:RARβ heterodimer is involved in mediating the RA-induced growth arrest. The mechanism by which RA induces growth arrest is not known, although several reports have linked RARβ to growth regulation and apoptosis (see Introduction). Interestingly, the two independent F9 RARβ2+/− heterozygote lines, which arrested their growth normally in response to RA, showed a faster cell cycle transit time in the absence of RA (Fig. 2). At present we do not have an explanation for this observation. The finding that two independently derived RARβ+/− lines grow faster than the F9 WT cells in the absence of RA (Fig. 2) is particularly intriguing in light of the greatly reduced expression of RARβ in a variety of human cancers and preneoplastic cells (see Introduction). Our data support the hypothesis that reduced levels of RARβ confer a selective growth advantage to preneoplastic cells and, therefore, that the loss of one allele of RARβ may be a key step in neoplastic progression. The RARβ2 disruption alters the morphology of these cells as compared with the F9 WT parent line (Fig. 4). In the absence of RA, this difference in morphology may result from the presence of low levels of RARβ2 transcripts in the F9 WT cells and in the RARβ2+/− heterozygote cells, but not in the RARβ2−/− line. After RA treatment, the F9 RARβ2 −/− cells do not exhibit a typically differentiated morphology. A partial or complete lack of morphological differentiation following RA treatment has been previously observed in the F9 RARγ−/− lines (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the F9 RXRα−/− lines (48Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and in the double mutant lines F9 RXRα−/−RARγ−/− and F9 RXRα−/−RARα−/− (50Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There was a markedly lower induction of several RA-responsive genes in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells when compared with F9 WT cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, in the F9 RARα−/− and RARγ−/− lines, the inactivation of RARα and RARγ, respectively, caused a severely impaired induction of particular RA-responsive genes, whereas the induction of other RA-responsive genes was like that in F9 WT cells (16Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modulation of gene expression in response to RA in the RARβ2−/− cells was actually strongest at early time points when compared with the F9 WT cells. This RA induction of gene expression diminished at later times, and laminin B1, a late response gene, was not induced in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells. Our data suggests that in F9 WT cells the initial response to RA is mediated via the RARα and RARγ receptors, but that the large increase in RARβ2 receptors after RA treatment (which occurs after ≈16–24 h) is required for the maximal expression of RA-responsive genes at later times after RA addition. Alternatively, the lack of growth arrest in response to RA observed in the RARβ2 −/− cells may contribute to a reduction in the magnitude of the differentiation response in these cells. That the initial RA response with respect to transcriptional activation of RA-responsive genes such as Hoxa1 is present in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells is consistent with prior data indicating that RXRα and either RARα or RARγ are the essential receptor pairs for these early responses during the RA-induced conversion of F9 stem cells to primitive endoderm cells (49Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Collectively, the research presented here as well as prior research (48Clifford J.

The RA-inducible P450RAI has been implicated in the metabolism of RA in a variety of cell types (53White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.D. Dilworth F.J. Bonasoro J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol.

Previous data suggested that the RARγ·RXRα heterodimer is responsible for the induction of p450RAI in F9 cells (17Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Abu-Abed S.S. Beckett B.R. Chiba H. Chithalen J.V. Jones G. Metzger D. Chambon P. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2409-2415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although in RARβ2−/− cells the levels of p450RAI transcripts attained after RA treatment were much lower than in the F9 WT cells (Fig. 5), there was no corresponding impairment in the ability of the RARβ2−/− cells to metabolize [3H]RA (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is likely that the lower level of p450RAI mRNA present in RARβ2−/− cells is sufficient to metabolize 50 nm[3H]RA at the same rate as that seen in F9 WT cells. In summary, our data indicate that RARβ2 is not required for the induction of RA metabolism in F9 cells. Since most of the genes evaluated (with the exception of laminin B1) were induced in the F9 RARβ2−/− cells following RA treatment, albeit at reduced levels, it is possible that in F9 cells RARβ does not activate the transcription of the early response genes tested, but instead is required to achieve the maximum induction of these RA-responsive genes. This result, together with the high degree of functional redundancy among the different RARs in the context of mouse knockouts (55Kastner P. Mark M. Ghyselinck N. Krezel W. Dupe V. Grondona J.M. Chambon P. Development. 1997; 124: 313-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may explain why mice carrying two disrupted alleles of RARβ2 were phenotypically normal (37Mendelsohn C. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gaub M.P. Krust A. Lampron C. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and why mice in which all isoforms of RARβ were disrupted (56Luo J.

Chambon P. Mark M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 425-447PubMed Google Scholar) presented a relatively mild phenotype when compared with the phenotypes of other RAR knockouts (58Lufkin T. Lohnes D.

This may also account for the observations that RARβ−/− mice, as well as RARβ−/− mice knocked out for the p53 gene or carrying a MMTV-ras transgene, did not exhibit any increase in tumor formation over a period of at least 14 months. 2N.

Both the MSEu and MSEi, which share a 6-base pair GTGTGA consensus, are also recognized by a previously unidentified melanocyte-specific factor, MSF. Here we show using a combination of DNA binding assays, proteolytic clipping, and anti-Pax3 antibodies that MSF is indistinguishable from Pax3, a paired homeodomain transcription factor implicated genetically in melanocyte development and the regulation of the Mitf promoter. Consistent with Pax3 being able to bind the TRP-1 promoter, Pax3 is expressed in melanocytes and melanomas, and TRP-1 promoter activity is up-regulated by Pax3. The results identify a novel role for Pax3 in the expression of TRP-1, and the potential role of Pax3 in the melanocyte lineage is discussed.

Because melanocytes are not essential for viability and variations in pigmentation are obvious (1Silvers W.K. The Coat Colors of Mice. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar), over 70 independent genetic loci have been implicated in the development or function of these melanin-producing cells. Of the 20 or so that have been cloned to date, some, such as the genes encoding tyrosinase or tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1),1 have a clearly defined function in the genesis of pigment. On the other hand, genes such as the endothelin B (2Baynash A.G. Hosoda K. Giaid A. Richardson J.A. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Yanagisawa M.

Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) transcription factors have been implicated in the developmental pathway leading to the genesis of the mature pigment-producing melanocyte from a nonpigmented melanoblast precursor cell originating in the trunk neural crest. Particularly interesting are mutations affecting the Pax3-paired homeodomain transcription factor, exemplified by the splotch allele (11Epstein D. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), which expresses a truncated Pax3 protein. Although splotch homozygotes die in utero, heterozygous splotch mice exhibit pigmentation defects resulting from the loss of a proportion of the melanoblasts migrating away from the neural crest. The loss of melanocytes in splotch mice may be explained by the fact that Pax3 has recently been shown to activate expression from the promoter for the gene encoding the microphthalmia-associated basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor (Mitf) (12Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); mice devoid of functional Mitf lack all pigment cells, and a decrease in Mitf levels resulting from monoallelic loss of Pax3 would account for the pigmentation defect exhibited by splotch mice. The ability of Pax3 to regulate expression of Mitf is paralleled by the role of Pax3 in skeletal muscle formation where it is required for expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin (13Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 14Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which play essential roles in myogenesis. The role of Pax3 in regulating mitf expression, and consequently melanocyte development, appears to be relatively well defined, however, it is not known whether Pax3 might also play a role in differentiation of melanocytes as characterized by the expression of the genes involved in the manufacture of the pigment melanin, a process specific to this cell type. We have previously characterized the cis-acting requirements for expression of the human tyrosinase and mouse TRP-1 promoters (15Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Lowings P. Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both promoters are dependent on the activity of Mitf, which acts through an initiator E box in the tyrosinase promoter (15Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) as well as via the highly conserved M box element (17Lowings P. Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) present in the promoters for the tyrosinase, TRP-1 and TRP-2 genes. TRP-1 expression is also regulated by two additional elements with the sequence GTGTGA termed the MSEu and MSEi, which appear to act as strong negative regulatory sequences (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the MSEu and MSEi are recognized by an unidentified factor termed MSF. However, point mutational analysis revealed that binding by MSF did not correlate to repression of the TRP-1 promoter, but rather may be involved in positive regulation of TRP-1 expression (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Instead, repression appears to correspond to binding by Tbx2 (19Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the T-box transcription factor family (20Smith J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Papaioannou V.E. Silver L.M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) expressed in melanoblasts and melanocytes. If Tbx2 acts as the repressor of TRP-1, the question remained as to the nature of MSF. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of proteolytic clipping and DNA binding assays that MSF is in fact Pax3. Moreover we demonstrate that Pax3 can activate TRP-1 expression in transfection assays and that Pax3 is expressed in melanocytes and melanomas. Thus Pax3, which plays an essential role early in melanocyte development, also regulates a marker of melanocyte differentiation, TRP-1. The mouse melanoma cell line, B16, was grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using Fugene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated at 1 × 104/24 wells/plate 24 h before transfection. A total of 600 ng of DNA was mixed with 1 μl of Fugene in 60 μl of serum-free medium, left for 15 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed 2 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested using 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothrietol). Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system with 20 μl of cell extract according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was detected using a microplate luminometer apparatus (MicroLumat Plus, EG&G Berthold). All transfections were repeated using different amounts of DNA, and pCH110 containing the SV40 promoter driving expression of a LacZ reporter was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency (1 μg/transfection). The parental plasmid used for all luciferase assays was the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The TRP-1 promoter (−336/+114) and its mutated form LS-MSEu, described previously (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were subcloned as Xba I/Hin dIII fragments into the pGL3 vector (Nhe I/Hin dIII). The MSEi.M3 mutant was isolated in three steps by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis and was cloned as an Xba I/Hin dIII fragment in the pGL3 vector. Details of the precise cloning strategy used are available on request. The band shift assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, and 112 mm KCl. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed/translated (ITT) protein was made according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega TNT T7 Quick Coupled transcription). Nuclear extracts or ITT Pax3 were preincubated at 0 °C with 1 μg of poly(dIdC·dIdC) for 10 min before the addition of 10, 50, or 250 ng of cold competitor DNA. After a further incubation period of 10 min, approximately 0.5 ng of oligonucleotide probe, labeled at each end by filling in 5′ overhangs with Klenow polymerase and the appropriate [α-32P]dNTP, was added to the reaction for a further 20 min before loading onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel (44:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) and electrophoresis at 200 V for 1.5 h. The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes are as follows: MSEi, 5′-ctagaGAATTCACTGGTGTGAGAAGGGATTAGTt-3′; MSEu, 5′-ctagaAAAGCTAACAGAAAATACAAGTGTGACATTt-3′; Pax3, 5′-ctagaCACCGCACGATTAGCATCGTCACGCTTCAG-3′. Competitor sequences are described in the figures. Proteolytic clipping (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Eisen T. Easty D.J. Bennett D.C. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2157-2164PubMed Google Scholar) was achieved by adding 10, 100, or 1,000 ng of trypsin or chymotrypsin, or V8 protease to the standard band shift reaction after 10 min of incubation with the probe and were loaded to the gel after a further 10 min of incubation at room temperature. The specific anti-Pax3 antibody used in this study has been described previously (24Lam P.Y. Sublett J.E. Hollenbach A.D. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Dr. Martine Roussel (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). In addition to the M box, the TRP-1 promoter is regulated by the MSEu and MSEi elements, which share a GTGTGA motif (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This sequence is recognized both by the T-box factor Tbx2 (19Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by a factor found in all melanocyte and melanoma cell lines tested termed MSF (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was essential to establish the identity of MSF if the regulation of TRP-1 was to be understood. As a first step, we examined the precise requirements for sequence recognition by MSF by using a series of oligonucleotides (Fig.1 A) bearing specific substitutions in the MSEu and MSEi elements. These oligonucleotides were used as competitors in DNA binding band shift assays using either an MSEu or MSEi probe. Using an MSEu probe, and B16 melanoma cell nuclear extract, a specific complex corresponding to MSF was observed as described previously (Fig. 1 B). MSF binding was efficiently competed by the MSEu and also by the MSEi. A point mutation, pm1, affecting the first base of the GTGTGA motif severely reduced binding by MSF. Binding was essentially abolished by mutations at positions 3 and 4 of the MSEu (pm3 and pm4, respectively), and severely reduced (at least 25-fold) using pm2, pm5, and pm6, in which bases 2, 5, and 6 of the MSEu are mutated. Thus, mutation of any of the bases within the MSEu severely reduces binding by MSF. We next examined more precisely the requirements for binding the MSEu by using competitors in which specific residues were substituted by methylated bases or inosine (Fig. 1 C). In the MSEu.CI competitor, each T residue is substituted with a C residue, whereas the inosine substitutes for A. The result is a mutant MSEu in which specific changes have been introduced into the major groove, although leaving the minor groove unchanged. Given the severity of the changes to the major groove, we might have expected the MSEu.CI site not to bind MSF. However, MSF retained the ability to bind the MSEu.CI oligonucleotide but around 5-fold less efficiently than the wild type MSEu. In contrast binding to an MSEu in which each G residue was methylated (MSEu.mG) reduced MSF binding by more than 25-fold, indicating that the presence of methyl groups in the major groove of the top strand severely affected binding by MSF. Surprisingly, on the other hand, methylation of two C residues on the bottom strand (MSEu.mC), failed to affect binding by MSF. Taken together these data provide an indication that MSF binds asymmetrically in the major groove with the presence of methyl groups on the top strand preventing DNA binding, whereas methyl groups on the bottom strand have no effect. Using the MSEi as a probe (Fig. 1 D), we were also able to show that a similar substitution of T with C, and A with inosine within the MSEi (MSEi.CI), had only a minor effect on binding by MSF. As with the MSEu probe, binding by MSF to the MSEi was also efficiently competed by an oligonucleotide where two C residues on the bottom strand were methylated (MSEu.mC) and where a 3′-flanking C residue was methylated (MSEu.mC2). The results obtained for binding to the MSEi probe are therefore entirely consistent with those obtained using the MSEu probe. The data obtained for the MSEu suggested that MSF bound asymmetrically within the major groove and that each base within the MSEu was essential for MSF binding. We have previously described a mutation of the TRP-1 promoter in which 4 bases within the MSEi are altered (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This mutation, termed LSMSEi, results in up to an 80-fold increase in TRP-1 promoter activity in either melanoma or melanocyte cell lines (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with Tbx2 acting as a repressor of TRP-1 expression, Tbx2 is unable to bind the LSMSEi mutant (19Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, binding by MSF is relatively efficient, being only around 5-fold reduced compared with a wild type MSEi (Fig.2). The result was surprising, because although each base of the MSEu was important for MSF binding, mutation of 4 bases within the MSEi failed to affect binding by MSF more than 5-fold. One possible explanation was that binding to the MSEi required sequences outwith the core GTGTGA motif. In an attempt to identify any such auxiliary binding site, we introduced additional mutations into the core MSEi GTGTGA motif as well as the flanking sequences. The mutants used are shown in Fig.3 A, and the results of the DNA binding assays obtained using these mutant forms of the MSEi as competitors is shown in Fig. 3 B. As shown above, binding of MSF to the MSEi is competed by the LSMSEi mutant around 3–5-fold less efficiently than the wild type MSEi. Introduction of mutations into sequences 5′ to the GTGTGA motif (mutants M1 and M2) failed to affect binding by MSF. In contrast, mutation of an AT-rich sequence 3′ to the MSEi in mutant M3 resulted in greatly reduced MSF binding by around 25-fold, indicating that this region may represent the anticipated auxiliary MSF recognition element. Mutation of the first 2 bases of the MSEi in mutant M4 reduced binding by around 3-fold, whereas a mutation affecting the same bases together with the 3 bases immediately 3′ to the GTGTGA motif again inhibited binding by MSF by around 25-fold. However, the M6 mutant, which affects the 3′-flanking sequence alone, binds MSF with only around a 2-fold reduction in efficiency.Figure 3MSF binding to the MSEi.

This pattern of DNA recognition is extremely reminiscent of DNA binding by members of the paired homeodomain family, which play key regulatory roles during development (for review, see Ref. 25Dahl E. Koseki H. Balling R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). DNA recognition by the paired domain is complex, with different paired domains able to recognize different though related sequences. From the crystal structure of the Drosophila protein Prd (26Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), it is nevertheless evident that the effects of mutations introduced into the MSEu would be consistent with recognition of this motif by a paired domain, whereas the homeodomain (27Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which can cooperate in DNA binding with the paired domain (28Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), would be able to target the AT-rich motif 3′ to the MSEi GTGTGA element. If MSF were indeed a member of the paired homeodomain family of transcription factors, the most likely candidate would be Pax3, which has been implicated genetically in the regulation of melanocyte development, both in Splotch mice (11Epstein D. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and in human Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (29Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Harris R. Balling R. Gruss P. Strachan T. Nature. 1992; 355: 635-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar,30Baldwin C.T. Hoth C.F. Amos J.A. da-Silva E.O. Milunsky A. Nature. 1992; 355: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, the genetic defect associated with loss of Pax3 might reflect loss of melanoblast precursor cells, rather than a specific failure of Pax3 to regulate gene expression after commitment to the melanocyte lineage. Moreover, although ectopic expression of Pax3 can regulate the Mitf promoter and bind the promoter in vitro, surprisingly, it had not previously been determined whether Pax3 is in fact expressed in cells of the melanocyte lineage. Thus, before attempting to determine whether MSF was related to Pax3, it was essential to establish that Pax3 was indeed expressed in melanocytes. We therefore performed a Western blot using the mouse melanocyte cell line melan-a, as well as the mouse B16 and human 501 melanoma cell lines and probed with a specific anti-Pax3 antibody. ITT Pax3 was used as a control. The results (Fig. 4) indicate that Pax3 is expressed in both the melanocyte and melanoma cell lines, but not in the unrelated 3T3 cell line, a result confirmed both by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting (data not shown). 2Dot Bennett, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, personal communication.The absence of Pax3 in 3T3 cells is in agreement with our previous work where MSF DNA binding activity was not detected in 3T3 cells (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The additional faster migrating band observed using the B16 melanoma cell line may represent a degradation product of Pax3. The fact that Pax3 is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells added weight to the argument that MSF and Pax3 were related. Significantly, DNA binding site selection for high affinity Pax3 recognition sequences (31Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene. 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) identified a number of sequences with very strong homology to the MSEu or MSEi including for example AAGTGTGAC, identical to the MSEu over 9 base pairs, and an 8-base pair sequence identical to the MSEi, TGGTGTGA, which also was located a short distance upstream from an AT-rich element. Taken together with the fact that Pax3 is expressed in cells of the melanocyte lineage, the DNA binding data were consistent with MSF being Pax3. In addition, by using in vitro transcribed/translated Pax3 in a band shift assay (Fig. 5) together with the MSEu probe and competing with a selection of the oligonucleotides used to determine the DNA binding specificity of MSF shown in Fig. 1, it was evident that Pax3 and MSF recognized DNA in a very similar fashion. Thus for example, Pax3 could recognize both the MSEu and MSEi elements, was less affected by the pm2 mutation than the other point mutations in the MSEu, and bound the mC oligonucleotide but not the mG competitor, indicating that like MSF, DNA binding by Pax3 was differentially affected by methylation of the top or bottom strands of the MSEu binding site. We also used probes corresponding to either a consensus Pax3 binding site or the MSEu or MSEi elements to show that Pax3 could recognize the TRP-1 promoter sequences (Fig.6 A). No binding was observed using unprogrammed ITT reaction (not shown). We next chose to use an alternative approach to investigate more closely the identity of MSF. To this end, we made use of a proteolytic clipping assay that is used to identify highly related DNA-binding proteins (22Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and has been used by us previously to identify the Brn-2 transcription factor in melanoma cells (23Eisen T. Easty D.J. Bennett D.C. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2157-2164PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, nuclear extract or in vitro transcribed/translated protein is subjected to increasing concentrations of a proteolytic enzyme and specific cleavage products, which retain the ability to bind DNA are detected using a band shift assay and an appropriate radiolabeled probe. The pattern of DNA bound cleavage products obtained is highly specific for a given protein, being dependent not only on the precise position of specific protease cleavage sites in the primary amino acid sequence but also on their relative accessibility within the protein, which is dictated by the protein conformation. A specific pattern of DNA bound products is therefore diagnostic of a particular protein. To investigate the possibility that MSF and Pax3 were identical, we initially performed band shift assays using a consensus Pax3 binding site as probe and either ITT Pax3 or B16 cell nuclear extract to assess whether Pax3 DNA binding activity was present in B16 nuclear extract. After allowing the protein to bind the probe, the DNA binding reactions were treated with limited amounts of either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 protease. The results obtained are presented in Fig. 6 B and demonstrate clearly that B16 nuclear extracts contain Pax3: first, the relative migration of the intact complex obtained using ITT Pax3 and B16 extract is identical; and second, the pattern of DNA binding complexes obtained following proteolytic treatment using any of the three proteases is identical when comparing ITT Pax3 to B16 extract. Because the results from the proteolytic DNA binding assays indicate that Pax3 is present in the B16 melanoma cell nuclear extracts, we next compared the pattern of bands obtained using a consensus Pax probe to those obtained using an MSEu probe together with B16 cell nuclear extract and chymotrypsin cleavage (Fig. 6 C). Again, the relative migration and pattern of both the intact and proteolytically cleaved bands obtained with the Pax and MSEu probes is identical, and the same as that obtained using ITT Pax3 (compare with Fig.6 B), strongly suggesting that the MSEu is recognized by Pax3. The specificity of this assay is highlighted by the fact that the highly related paired homeodomain factor Pax6 can bind the MSEi probe, but the Pax6 MSEi complex migrates differently from those containing MSF or Pax3, and moreover the V8 cleavage pattern is different for Pax6 (Fig. 6 D) but identical when using Pax3 or MSF. Taken together, the results obtained from the DNA binding and proteolytic clipping assays are consistent with MSF and Pax3 being identical. To confirm that MSF and Pax3 were indeed the same, we made use of the specific anti-Pax3 antibody used for the Western blot shown in Fig. 4, in a bandshift assay using either an MSEi or MSEu probe and B16 cell nuclear extract. The results shown in Fig.7 demonstrate that DNA binding by MSF to either probe was strongly inhibited by the anti-Pax3 antibody, but was unaffected using an anti-Mitf antibody that we have used in similar assays to inhibit binding by Mitf to the M box (not shown). Thus, both the proteolytic clipping assays as well as the antibody supershifts are consistent with MSF and Pax3 being identical. If MSF and Pax3 are the same, then we might expect Pax3 to regulate transcription from the TRP-1 promoter. To address this question, we transfected B16 melanoma cells with a TRP-1 luciferase reporter extending between −336 and +114 (Fig. 8 A) either alone or together with a vector expressing Pax3. The results obtained demonstrated that increasing the amount of Pax3 expression plasmid used in the transfection resulted in increasing TRP-1 promoter activity (Fig. 8 B) with up to 12-fold activation being achieved at the highest amount of Pax3 expression vector used. Activation of TRP-1 was specific because no activation of a tyrosinase-luciferase reporter was observed (Fig. 8 C), consistent with the fact that the tyrosinase promoter lacks binding sites for Pax3(MSF). To ask whether the MSEu or MSEi were required for activation by Pax3, we also used reporters in which the MSEu or MSEi had been mutated. Specifically, the MSEi mutation used was that affecting the auxiliary Pax3 recognition site, MSEi.m3, because this mutation does not affect binding by Tbx2; the MSEu mutant, LSMSEu, fails to bind either Pax3 or Tbx2 and was used, because we have yet to identify point mutations that distinguish between binding by these two proteins at the MSEu. In contrast to the wild type TRP-1 promoter, which was activated by Pax3, neither the MSEi.M3 nor the LSMSEu mutant was affected even at the highest doses of Pax3 expression vector (Fig. 8, D and E). We conclude that Pax3 can activate the TRP-1 promoter but that efficient activation appears to require both the MSEu and MSEi. Because Pax3 and Sox10, an HMG box protein, have been reported to activate transcription synergistically in glial cells (32Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because Sox10, as well as Pax3, is implicated in melanocyte development (9Pingault V. Bondurand N. Kuhlbrodt K. Goerich D.E. Préhu M.-O. Puliti A. Herbarth B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Legius E. Matthijs G. Amiel J. Lyonnet S. Ceccherini I. Romeo G. Clayton-Smith J. Read A.P. Wegner M. Goossens M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar,10Southard-Smith E.M. Kos L. Pavan W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), we also asked whether Sox10 expression could affect the activation of TRP-1 by Pax3. The TRP-1 luciferase reporter was transfected into B16 melanoma cells together with different ratios of vectors expressing Pax3 and Sox10. In no experiment were we able to observe any cooperativity between Pax3 and Sox10 on the TRP-1 promoter (data not shown). We have previously established that the TRP-1 promoter is regulated by a combination of positive and negative elements (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Lowings P. Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One positive element, the M box, is targeted by Mitf (33Yavuzer U. Keenan E. Lowings P. Vachtenhein J. Currie G. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 123-134PubMed Google Scholar), whereas two additional elements, termed the MSEu and MSEi, are recognized by the T-box factor Tbx2 and a previously unidentified DNA-binding protein known as MSF (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). If the regulation of the TRP-1 promoter was to be fully understood, it was important to establish the identity of MSF. Here we show, using a combination of proteolytic clipping and DNA binding assays as well as by using a specific anti-Pax3 antibody, that MSF and Pax3 appear to be identical, and Pax3 can up-regulate TRP-1 promoter activity in co-transfection assays. We also demonstrate for the first time that Pax3 is expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Pax3 has already been identified genetically as playing an essential role in melanocyte development; mutations in Pax3 can give rise to the Splotch phenotype in mice (11Epstein D. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) or Waardenburg's syndrome type-1 in humans (29Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Harris R. Balling R. Gruss P. Strachan T. Nature. 1992; 355: 635-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 35Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Patton M. Gruss P. Harris R. Strachan T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Baldwin C.T. Lipsky N.R. Hoth C.F. Cohen T. Mamuya W. Milunsky A. Hum. Mutat. 1994; 3: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both Splotch and Waardenburg's syndrome type-1 are characterized by a partial loss of neural crest-derived melanocytes that may be accounted for, at least in part, by a requirement for Pax3 for the expression of the gene encoding Mitf (12Watanabe A. Takeda K. Ploplis B. Tachibana M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, the ability of Pax3 to bind and activate the TRP-1 promoter suggests an additional role for Pax3 in the regulation of melanocyte differentiation. Although the MSEu and MSEi can act as negative regulatory elements, the experiments presented here suggest that Pax3 may function as a positive regulator of TRP-1 expression. For example, the LSMSEi mutation can result in up to an 80-fold increase in TRP-1 promoter activity (16Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,34Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but this mutation failed to affect binding by Pax3 more than around 5-fold, whereas transfection of a Pax3 expression vector resulted in increased expression from a reporter gene driven by the TRP-1 promoter. Consistent with Pax3 not being responsible for repression of the TRP-1 promoter in melanocyte or melanoma cell lines, previous point mutational analysis of the MSEu and MSEi demonstrated that recognition of the MSEu and MSEi by Tbx2 correlated with transcriptional repression (34Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that at the MSEu and MSEi, Tbx2 may repress and Pax3 activate TRP-1 expression. In addition, although Tbx2 and Pax3 DNA binding specificity are distinct, for example Pax3 but not Tbx2 can bind the LSMSEi mutant, they clearly require overlapping sequences. As such it seems likely that binding by Pax3 and Tbx2 is mutually exclusive. What determines whether any given binding site is recognized by Pax3 or Tbx2 at any particular time will be determined by several factors including, the relative concentrations of each factor within the cell, and the nature of any regulation dictated by the activity of specific signal transduction pathways. At the moment, virtually nothing is known of the factors governing the activity or expression of either Tbx2 or Pax3. We have shown here that Pax3 is expressed in melanocytes as well as melanoma cell lines. Northern blot analysis2 has also established that Pax3 is expressed both in melanoblasts and in cells that have the characteristics of melanoblast precursors.TRP-1, and Mitf, on the other hand are expressed in both melanoblasts and melanocytes, but are not expressed before commitment to the melanocyte lineage. Thus during development, the expression of Pax3 alone is clearly insufficient to allow TRP-1 or Mitf to be expressed. Because Pax3 has also been demonstrated to up-regulate the Mitf promoter, some mechanism must operate to prevent Pax3 from inappropriately activating the Mitf and TRP-1 promoters in melanoblast precursor cells. One possibility is that in melanoblast precursor cells, Pax3 lacks an essential cofactor to enable it to activate transcription. Alternatively, because Pax3 has been shown to possess domains that mediate either transcription activation or transcription repression (37Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is also possible that Pax3 acts to repress transcription in pre-melanoblasts, but activates transcription after the transition to a melanoblast. Such a switch would require either that Pax3 is regulated by specific signal transduction pathways and/or that there is selective recruitment of co-factors to Pax3 to mediate its transcription activation/repression functions. Although it is not known how Pax3 is regulated, it has recently been shown that Pax3 can interact with HIRA, a factor implicated in chromatin modulation and a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional co-repressors (38Magnaghi P. Roberts C. Lorain S. Lipinski M. Scambler P.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This observation would suggest that one role of Pax3 is to organize the chromatin structure across Pax3 target promoters, though whether the interaction between Pax3 and HIRA results in a positive or negative regulation of transcription is unclear. It is also possible that it is the level of Pax3 expression per se that is the critical factor with the amount of Pax3 protein present in a cell needing to exceed a threshold before activation of the Mitf promoter can occur. This may be particularly relevant because melanoblasts express higher levels of Pax3 than melanoblast precursors.2 This situation appears to occur during muscle development where Pax3 is required for the expression of MyoD (13Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 14Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting is the observation that whereas cells derived from dissociated neural tube normally express Pax3, they are induced to undergo myogenesis by infection with a retrovirus expressing Pax3 (14Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the ability of Pax3 to induce myogenesis is normally suppressed by an inhibitor and that elevating Pax3 levels overcomes repression and leads to myogenesis. The nature of the repressor is unknown, but it may be that a similar mechanism operates to prevent Pax3 from inducing TRP-1 or Mitf expression in melanoblast precursor cells. Our future work will attempt to address this issue. We thank Dr. Michael Wegner for providing a Pax3 expression vector and Dr. Martine Roussel (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) for the anti-Pax3 antibody. We also appreciate the gifts of 501 mel cells from Dr. Ruth Halaban, and the Pax6-expressing baculovirus vector from Dr. Penny Rashbass."

However, the proximal mechanisms for flow-mediated signal transduction remain unknown. Previously we showed that flow activated ERK1/2 in an integrin-dependent manner (30Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, neither focal adhesion kinase nor paxillin were rapidly phosphorylated by flow, suggesting that other focal adhesion proteins were involved. p130 Crk-associated substrate (Cas) is a potential adapter protein for integrin-mediated cell adhesion that has an SH3 domain followed by multiple SH2 binding motifs in the substrate domain. This protein localizes to focal adhesions and associates not only with focal adhesion proteins such as focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and tensin (15Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cas was originally identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Crk- and v-Src-transformed cells. Cas is also tyrosine-phosphorylated during cell adhesion (21Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D.

Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that c-Src was activated within 2 min by shear stress in HUVEC (30Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that flow would stimulate c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas based on several findings. 1) Cas is a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by v-Src (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). 2) Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell adhesion in a Src-dependent manner (19Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 3) Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is decreased in Src−/− mouse fibroblasts and increased in Csk−/− cells in parallel with Src activity (17Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that shear stress stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and association of Cas with Crk in ECs. Further, our results show that calcium-dependent activation of c-Src is required for the shear stress-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. HUVEC were obtained as described previously (32Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). HUVEC at passages between 1 and 3 were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, heparin, and endothelial cell growth factor. Bovine aortic ECs (BAEC) were isolated from adult aortas, maintained in M199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (33Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and used at passages between 2 and 8. A23187 and α-thrombin were obtained from Sigma. 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and herbimycin A were purchased from Calbiochem. PP1 (CP-118, 556) was from Pfizer. Monoclonal anti-Crk antibody and polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody were from Transduction Laboratory. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and monoclonal anti-Src antibody (GD11) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal anti-v-Src antibody (OP-07) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products. Monoclonal antibody specific for the active form of c-Src (clone 28) was generated as described previously (34Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Polyclonal anti-Cas antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Protein A-agarose, cell culture media, and heparin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. cDNA for a chicken c-Src that is kinase-inactive (Lys-295 to Met) and acts as a dominant negative Src (KI-Src) was a kind gift of Dr. Sara A. Courtneidge (Sugen Inc., Redwood City, CA) (35Twamley S.-G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) HUVEC or BAEC grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 60- or 100-mm tissue culture dishes were serum-deprived for 3–6 h. Prior to the experiment, cells were rinsed free of culture media with HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS; 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 10 mm glucose and either maintained in static condition or exposed to fluid shear stress in a cone and plate viscometer at 37 °C as described previously (36Traub O. Yan C. Berk B.C. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Hardwood Academic Publishers, New York1998: 89-109Google Scholar). A polyacetal resin (Delrin) cone was milled with precise angle measurements and attached to a stainless steel shaft that was in turn attached to a BC215GD-AF model motor and 2GD10K gear head purchased from Oriental Motor Co. The motor was wired to an external controller (Model BLD15-AF) with adjustable potentiometer. A step down transformer (120 V to 100 V; Sanyo Model TSD-N0GU) was added, and the motor and gear head were placed on an adjustable platform so that the cone could be lowered onto the base containing the cell culture dish. Adjustable set screws were used to position the cone at a reproducible height related to the cell culture dish. The apparatus (not including external controller) was placed in an air incubator (Robbins Scientific hybridization chamber, Model 1000) set at 37 °C for experiments. After treatment, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and fresh 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and fresh 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Cell lysates were prepared by scraping and centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The lysates were immunoprecipitated and immune complexes were recovered by the addition of either 10 μl of protein A-agarose for Cas or 10 μl of protein A-agarose conjugated with anti-mouse IgG for Src and Crk, incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, and centrifugation. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (HybondTM-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (33Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a commercial blocking buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies, followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated). Cell lysates (1.5–1.7 mg of protein) were incubated with antibody (4 μg) against v-Src (OP-07) and immunoprecipitated as described above. Src activity was measured with a Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). Briefly, 20 μl of kinase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml of a specific substrate peptide KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP diluted to 1 μCi/μl with Mn/ATP mixture (75 mmMnCl2, 500 μm ATP) were added to 5 μl of the washed beads. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. The phosphorylated substrate was then separated from the residual [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper and quantified with a scintillation counter. cDNA for a kinase inactive form of chicken c-Src (KI-Src gene) was cloned into the expression vector pAd1.RSV according to the general protocol of Graham and Prevec (37Graham F.L. Prevec L. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, N. J.1991: 109-128Google Scholar). This vector, derived from the parent vector pXCJL.1, contains 16% of the adenoviral genome cloned into pBR322. The critical E1A region has been deleted and replaced by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat, a multiple cloning site, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. KI-Src-containing pAd1.RSV was cotransfected using Lipofectamine into 293 cells with pJM17, a second plasmid containing the majority of the adenoviral genome (38McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). After homologous recombination in vivo, plaques resulting from viral cytopathic infection were selected and expanded in 293 cells. 293 cells have been transformed with adenoviral E1A and therefore provide this viral transcription factor in trans. The KI-Src adenovirus (Ad.KI-Src) and a control adenovirus (Ad.LacZ) encoding nuclear-targeted β-galactosidase (39Stratford P.-L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) were propagated in 293 cells as described (37Graham F.L. Prevec L. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, N. J.1991: 109-128Google Scholar). The virus preparation was purified and concentrated from cell lysates by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl gradient followed by dialysis. Viral titer was determined by optical density at 260 nm and by plaque formation assay using 293 cells and was expressed as plaque-forming units. To optimize the protcol for HUVEC transfection, HUVEC were transfected with Ad.LacZ, and expression was measured by β-galactosidase (40Lozier J.N. Thompson A.R. Hu P.C. Read M. Brinkhous K.M. High K.A. Curiel D.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The frequency of transfection increased linearly with increasing virus concentrations of Ad.LacZ (Fig.1 B). There was ∼100% infection at >500 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i. is expressed in plaque-forming units/cell) of Ad.LacZ after transfection for 48 h. Expression of chicken KI-Src in HUVEC was determined by Western blotting with an anti-c-Src antibody that detects both mammalian and avian c-Src (Fig. 1 C). Transfection of HUVEC with Ad.KI-Src but not Ad.LacZ increased c-Src in a concentration-dependent manner. The ratio of expressed KI-Src to endogenous c-Src was 30:1 at 1000 m.o.i. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed at least three times. Significant differences were determined by Student's t test (p < 0.05). Analysis of densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.60. Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was normalized first to the amount of immunoprecipitated Cas protein based on Western blot density. Results were then normalized for comparison among different experiments by arbitrarily setting the densitometric value of control cells or uninfected cells to 1.0. To gain insight into the role of c-Src in shear stress-mediated signal events, we studied tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. HUVEC were exposed to flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2) for varying times and harvested for analysis of Cas phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas occurred within 1 min, peaked at 5 min (3.5 ± 0.7-fold increase), was sustained for 20 min (Fig. 2, A, upper and C), and returned to near baseline by 120 min after stimulation (not shown). There was no significant change in Cas protein levels during these experiments (Fig. 2 A, lower). Shear stress also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in BAEC (Fig. 2 B). We (41Geiger R.V. Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Nerem R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1407-C1411Crossref Google Scholar, 42Helmlinger G. Berk B.C. Nerem R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C367-C375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other groups (43Ando J. Komatsuda T. Kamiya A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 44Shen J. Luscinskas F.W. Connolly A. Dewey C.F.J. Gimbrone M.A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C384-C390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that shear stress stimulates a rapid increase in EC intracellular calcium that is dependent on the magnitude of shear stress. Therefore, we studied the dependence of flow-stimulated Cas phosphorylation on changes in intracellular calcium. Chelation of intracellular calcium with 50 μm BAPTA-AM in the presence of 10 μm EGTA abolished flow-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Increasing intracellular calcium by treating HUVEC with 10 μm A23187 for 10 min stimulated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation 3.7 ± 0.5-fold. Stimulation by A23187 was completely inhibited by calcium chelation. Finally, α-thrombin (3 units/ml), which also elevates EC intracellular calcium, increased Cas tyrosine phosphorylation 3.1 ± 0.5-fold, and α-thrombin stimulation was completely inhibited by calcium chelation. Previously, we showed that shear stress increased c-Src activity measured by phosphorylation of enolase in HUVEC (30Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined whether the shear stress-induced activation of c-Src was inhibited by calcium chelation. The activity of c-Src was analyzed by Western blot (Fig.4 A) and by Src kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). Western blot analysis with an antibody that selectively recognizes the active form of c-Src (34Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed a rapid increase in activity (within 0.5 min), which peaked at 2 min (1.8 ± 0.2-fold ) and was sustained for 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 4 A, left), consistent with previous results (30Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Shear stress-induced c-Src activation was completely abolished by chelation of intracellular calcium (Fig. 4, A, right and B). Treatment with a Src family-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP1 (50 μm), also inhibited shear stress-mediated c-Src activation (Fig.4 B). To characterize the tyrosine kinase responsible for Cas phosphorylation by shear stress, we utilized the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin A and PP1. PP1 (CP-118, 556), a pyrazolopyrimidine, is a Src kinase family inhibitor (45Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brisette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Treatment with PP1 inhibited shear stress-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (10 μm, 31.3 ± 14.6%; 50 μm, 83.6 ± 6.8%, Fig.5 A). PP1 did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation significantly (15.6 ± 11.9% inhibition, Fig.5 B). Herbimycin A, a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic, inhibits Src family kinases by covalent interactions with sulfhydryl groups (46Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) and by disrupting Src interactions with heat shock proteins (especially HSP90) (47Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Treatment with 1 μm herbimycin A significantly inhibited shear stress-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (88.0 ± 6.0%, Fig. 5 C). In contrast to PP1, treatment with herbimycin A significantly inhibited ERK1/2 activation by shear stress (80% ± 5.9%, Fig. 5 D). These results strongly suggested that Src family tyrosine kinases play an important role in shear stress-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. ERK1/2 activation is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation, but the requirement for Src kinases is unclear. To evaluate the role of c-Src activity in flow-induced Cas and ERK1/2 phosphorylation more specifically, KI-Src was overexpressed in HUVEC. Flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2 for 10 min) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by 3.1 ± 1.0-fold in uninfected cells (Fig. 6 A). Expression of β-galactosidase with Ad.LacZ had no significant effect on either basal levels of Cas phosphorylation or shear stress-increased Cas phosphorylation at 1000 m.o.i. (Fig. 6, A and B). Expression of KI-Src inhibited Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6). There was a significant decrease in the basal level of Cas phosphorylation to 17 ± 3% control, similar to treatment with 1 μm herbimycin A. There was also complete inhibition of shear stress-stimulated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation at concentrations of Ad.KI-Src ≥ 500 m.o.i. (Fig. 6). To determine whether c-Src activity is required for flow-induced ERK1/2 activation, we examined the effect of KI-Src overexpression on ERK1/2 phosphorylation by shear stress. Flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2 for 10 min) increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation by 7.0 ± 1.2-fold (Fig.7 A). Treatment with concentrations of Ad.KI-Src (300 or 1000 m.o.i.) that inhibited Cas phosphorylation had no significant effect on flow-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B). Overexpression of β-galactosidase also had no effect on flow-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. There was a small increase in basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation 48 h after infection with Ad.KI-Src and Ad.LacZ. To gain insight into the functional significance of Cas phosphorylation, we determined whether Cas associates with Crk in response to shear stress. BAEC were exposed to either 6 or 12 dynes/cm2 for various times (Fig.8). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Cas antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation of Crk after exposure of BAEC to shear stress showed a significant increase in co-immunoprecipitated Cas (Fig. 8, A and B) that was dependent on shear stress (Fig. 8 C, increased at 12 (lane 3) compared with 6 (lane 2) dynes/cm2) and was maximal at 10 min (Fig. 8, A and B). The magnitude of this effect was similar to that observed with 10 units/ml α-thrombin (not shown). The interaction of Crk and Cas was dependent on both Src kinases (inhibition by 25 and 50 μm PP1) and calcium (inhibition by BAPTA-AM+EGTA, Fig.8 C). We also determined whether Sos interacted with Cas as reported by other investigators (17Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect association of these proteins by immunoprecipitation of either Cas or Sos (not shown) suggesting that shear stress does not promote an interaction between Cas and Sos. The major findings of this study are that shear stress rapidly stimulates Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and association of Cas with Crk via a pathway dependent on intracellular calcium and c-Src activity. The conclusion that Cas tyrosine phosphorylation requires c-Src is supported by three experimental results. First, shear stress-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was completely inhibited by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of KI-Src. Second, shear stress-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was prevented by pretreatment with the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1 and herbimycin A. Third, the association between Cas and Crk stimulated by shear stress was inhibited by treatment with PP1. The two kinases best identified as Cas tyrosine kinases are c-Src (17Vuori K. Hirai H.

An important role for c-Src in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation is based on the findings that 1) Cas is significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transformed by v-Src (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar); 2) Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell adhesion in a Src-dependent manner (19Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar); 3) tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is decreased in Src−/− mouse fibroblasts and increased in Csk−/− cells in parallel with Src activity (17Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 4) focal adhesion kinase-induced Cas phosphorylation is dependent on the Src-binding site (Tyr-397) of focal adhesion kinase (17Vuori K.

In this study, we demonstrated that c-Src activity is required for shear stress-induced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. A cooperative interaction between PYK2 and c-Src has been shown to be required for Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in COS cells (48Astier A. Manie S.N. Avraham H. Hirai H. Law S.F. Zhang Y. Golemis E.A.

Therefore, PYK2 may be important in shear stress-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, we have found that PYK2 is present in BAEC and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to shear stress. 2M. Okuda, unpublished observations. It has also been shown that PYK2 is involved in ERK1/2 activation by G-protein-coupled receptors (50Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

In support of a functional role for the c-Src/Cas pathway in shear stress signaling, we demonstrated the association of Cas with Crk in ECs stimulated by shear stress. Crk is an adapter protein composed of SH2 and SH3 domains and has been shown to interact with several signaling molecules, including two GTP exchange factors (Sos and C3G) (52Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The interaction of Crk and C3G may regulate focal adhesion rearrangement and cell morphology in response to flow through the small G proteins. Recently, Altun-Gultekin et al. (53Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. de Graaf P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Hanafusa H. Wagner J.A. Birge R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that v-Crk activated the Rho signaling pathway and served as a scaffolding protein during the assembly of focal adhesions in PC12 cells. Other recent studies support an important role for Cas in the cardiovascular system. Honda et al. (29Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) reported that the Cas knockout mouse caused embryonic death because of marked systemic congestion and growth retardation. The heart was poorly developed, and blood vessels were prominently dilated in these mice. The findings of the present study and those of Honda et al. (29Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) suggest that Cas tyrosine phosphorylation may be important in endothelial responses to flow such as alignment and stress fiber formation (54Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2640-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The present study clearly demonstrates the merits of adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to study signal transduction. A variety of nonviral approaches have been used for transfer including liposomes, molecular conjugates, and electroporation. Compared with other vectors, transfection efficiency of adenovirus vector is much higher in both growing and quiescent cells. Whereas it has been difficult to transfect genes into ECs with high efficiency by nonviral approaches, transfection of HUVEC with Ad.LacZ showed 100% efficiency assessed by β-galactosidase assay. Most important, dominant negative gene transfection with adenovirus appears to be a more specific way to inhibit the function of targeted kinases than pharmacologic kinase inhibitors. Data that support a specific mechanism of inhibition for KI-Src include the concentration dependence, ability to use relatively low m.o.i. to achieve inhibition, and specificity as shown by inhibition of Cas phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 activation. The results for ERK1/2 with both KI-Src and PP1 differ from those reported by Jalali et al. (55Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) who found that flow-induced ERK activation required Src. This difference may be because of the greater specificity of adenoviral dominant negative Src or to cell culture differences. In summary, the present study is the first to demonstrate that shear stress stimulates Cas tyrosine phosphorylation through calcium-dependent activation of c-Src in ECs (Fig.9). This is a novel shear stress-mediated pathway different from ERK1/2 activation. Specifically, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for ERK1/2 activation by shear stress because KI-Src overexpression inhibited Cas tyrosine phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 activation. We suggest that the Src/Cas pathway described here is likely to be functionally important in shear stress-mediated EC functions such as regulation of cytoskeleton and cell movement.

Zen for performing the experiment showing transfection efficiency of recombinant adenovirus vector."

In this study, we have demonstrated that UV irradiation induced cleavage of FAK and two of its interacting proteins Src and p130Cas in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, concomitant with an increase in cell death. The cleavage of these proteins upon UV irradiation was completely inhibited by ZVAD-FMK, a broad range inhibitor of caspases, and apparently delayed by Bcl2 overexpression. To examine if FAK plays a role in suppressing UV-induced apoptosis, stable Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines overexpressing FAK were established. Our results showed that a marked (30–40%) increase in cell survival upon UV irradiation was achieved by this strategy. In our efforts to determine the mechanism by which FAK transduces survival signals to the downstream, we found that a FAK mutant deficient in binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase failed to promote cell survival. Moreover, the expression of the Src homology 3 domain of p130Cas, which competed with endogenous p130Cas for FAK binding, abrogated the FAK-promoted cell survival. Together, these results suggest that the integrity of FAK and its binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p130Cas are required for FAK to exert its antiapoptotic function.

The ability of FAK to transduce signals to the downstream is believed to be dependent on its ability to interact with several intracellular signaling molecules including Src family kinases (11Xing Z.

A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that two simultaneous bindings of PI3K and p130Cas are required for FAK to promote cell migration on extracellular matrix proteins (16Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 17Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol.

However, it is not clear if any of these molecules are responsible for the function of FAK in cell cycle or cell survival.Tyr-397 has been identified as the major site of FAK autophosphorylation (18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.X. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The proline-rich sequence region of FAK (residues 712–718) has been identified as the major binding site for the SH3 domain of p130Cas (15Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 21Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A substitution of Tyr-397 with Phe was found to abrogate the binding of FAK to both Src and PI3K (19Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To directly analyze the effect of the loss of PI3K binding on FAK's functions, a FAK mutant deficient only in PI3K binding has recently been introduced by a substitution of Asp-395 with Ala (17Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence have suggested that FAK may have a function in promoting cell survival. Inhibition of FAK in fibroblasts by microinjection with anti-FAK antibodies or with a peptide corresponding to a region of β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain thought to be required for FAK binding results in apoptosis (7Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Similarly, attenuation of FAK expression by antisense oligonucleotides induces apoptosis in tumor cells (8Xu L. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Ilic et al. (9Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) suggested that survival signals from extracellular matrix transduced by FAK may suppress p53-mediated apoptosis and showed that expression of a FAK C-terminal construct, the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain, induces apoptosis in primary fibroblasts. Finally, expression of the constitutively activated form of FAK (CD2-FAK) by anchoring it to the plasma membrane prevents epithelial cells from apoptosis upon cell detachment (10Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar).In this report, we have demonstrated that FAK is a target of caspases during UV-induced apoptosis and that overexpression of the wild-type (WT) FAK is capable of suppressing cell death upon UV irradiation. Moreover, we have found that inhibition of the association of FAK with PI3K or p130Cas abrogates the ability of FAK to promote cell survival. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that signals transmitted through the associations of FAK with PI3K and p130Cas are important for cell survival.RESULTSA proteolytic cleavage of FAK has been observed during apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (24Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the addition of Fas ligand/Apo-2L (25Wen L.-P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.-L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), overexpression of c-Myc (26Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar), and treatment of certain chemicals such as staurosporine (27Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.S. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined if FAK cleavage also occurs during UV-induced apoptosis. Similar to other apoptotic stimuli as described above, UV irradiation induced a sequential cleavage of FAK into two fragments in MDCK cells, which was concomitant with a decrease in cell survival (Fig.1). The first cleavage product of the 85-kDa fragment was detected as early as 6 h after UV irradiation, and the second cleavage product of 77-kDa fragment was detected 3 h later. Twenty-four hours after UV irradiation, dead cells accounted for more than 95% of the total cell population in which the intact FAK was not detected, and only the 77-kDa fragment remained. In addition to FAK, we also examined if other cellular proteins that are known to interact with FAK undergo cleavage during UV-induced apoptosis (Fig.1). Among these proteins, we found that the amount of p130Cas was gradually decreased 6 h after UV irradiation, presumably due to a proteolytic cleavage, and finally disappeared at 24 h. In addition, the cleavage of Src upon UV irradiation was found to generate an approximately 50-kDa fragment. Interestingly, a significant amount of Src remained intact 24 h after UV irradiation, indicating that Src was only partially cleaved during the apoptotic response. In contrast, the level of four other FAK-interacting proteins including the p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig.1), Grb2, paxillin, and talin had no detectable change during UV-induced apoptosis (data not shown).To examine if caspases are involved in the cleavage of FAK, p130Cas, and Src during UV-induced apoptosis, UV-exposed MDCK cells were incubated with tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors, ZVAD-FMK or DEVD-CHO (Fig.2 A). ZVAD-FMK, a general inhibitor of cysteine proteases, completely blocked cleavage of FAK, p130Cas, and Src, and significantly (∼30%) increased cell survival upon UV irradiation. DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, at a concentration of 40 μm was able to completely block Src cleavage but only partially inhibit the cleavage of FAK and p130Cas. These results suggest that the cleavage of FAK and p130Cas is likely to be mediated by more than one member of caspase family during UV irradiation-induced apoptosis.Figure 2Effect of caspase inhibitors or Bcl2 expression on cleavage of FAK, p130Cas, and Src during UV-induced apoptosis. A, MDCK cells were pretreated with (+) or without (−) ZVAD-FMK (40 μm) or DEVD-CHO (40 μm) for 1 h prior to UV irradiation. The cells were further incubated with or without ZVAD-FMK or DEVD-CHO for 12 h. Cell survival and the cleavage of FAK, p130Cas, Src, and p85 were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Survival of cells without UV irradiation and inhibitor treatment is defined as 100%. Values are the average of two independent experiments.B, an equal amount (50 μg) of lysates prepared from a control (Neo) clone or a MDCK cell clone overexpressing Bcl2 were exposed to UV radiation. After indicated times, the cleavage of FAK was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of Bcl2 has been shown to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspases (28Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. Orouke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bcl2 blocks FAK cleavage in response to UV irradiation, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing Bcl2 were established (22Tang M.-J. Hu J.-J. Lin H.-H. Chiu W.-T. Jiang S.-T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C921-C931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression level of ectopic Bcl2 in MDCK cells was at least 10-fold higher than endogenous Bcl2 (data not shown). The Bcl2-overexpressed (Bcl2) cells and control (Neo) cells were exposed to UV radiation and then analyzed for FAK cleavage after various time intervals. The results showed that overexpression of Bcl2 in MDCK cells apparently delayed FAK cleavage upon UV irradiation (Fig. 2 B). The first FAK cleavage product of the 85-kDa fragment appeared at 12 h after UV irradiation in Bcl2-overexpressed cells, which was an approximately 6-h delay compared with control cells. Consistent with the results from parental MDCK cells (Fig. 1), no intact FAK could be detected in Neo control cells 24 h after UV irradiation. Notably, at this time point, a significant amount of intact FAK still remained in Bcl2-overexpressed cells.To examine if FAK plays a role in preventing UV-induced cell death, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing HA-tagged FAK (WT) were established. The expression level of ectopic FAK in MDCK cells was approximately 2.5-fold of endogenous FAK (Fig.3 A). Cells from three WT clones and a control (Neo) clone were exposed to UV radiation, and their survival rates were determined after various time intervals. The results showed that, 9, 12, or 24 h after UV irradiation, the survival rate of WT cells was significantly (30–40%) higher than that of control cells (Fig. 3 B). To further confirm the antiapoptotic effect of FAK in this system, other apoptotic characteristics were analyzed. The Hoechst staining showed that, 4 h after UV irradiation, control cells contained a higher number of apoptotic nuclei, manifested by shrunken and fragmented nuclear morphology and condensed chromatin, than WT cells (Fig. 3 C). The DNA laddering assays indicated that control cells also exhibited a more severe DNA fragmentation than WT cells upon UV irradiation (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that overexpression of FAK is able to suppress UV-induced apoptosis. A simple explanation for WT cells being more resistant to UV irradiation is that more intact FAK proteins retained in WT cells than in Neo cells within a period of time after UV irradiation. To examine this, the cleavage of FAK in WT and Neo cells were analyzed 9 h after UV irradiation (Fig.3 D). The result clearly supports our assumption and suggests that the ability of FAK to exert its antiapoptotic function may first rely on its intact structure.Figure 3Suppression of UV irradiation-induced apoptosis by FAK overexpression. A, an equal amount (50 μg) of lysates prepared from a control (Neo) clone or three independent MDCK cell clones overexpressing HA-tagged WT FAK (designated WT-1, WT-2, and WT-3) was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-FAK. B, control and WT cells were exposed to UV radiation, and cell survivals were measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Data (means ± S.E.) are from five independent experiments. C, control and WT cells were exposed to UV and then visualized with Hoechst 33258 dye for nucleus 4 h after UV irradiation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Apoptotic nuclei comprising those with fragmented nuclei (arrows) and condensed chromatin (arrowheads) were counted. The apoptotic index is expressed as the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in total counted nuclei. Values are the average of two independent experiments. D, control and WT cells were exposed to UV radiation and then analyzed for FAK cleavage 9 h afterwards, as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the mechanisms by which FAK transmits survival signals downstream, stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing FAK mutants including D395A, Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F, deficient in binding to PI3K, Src, p130Cas, and Grb2, respectively, were established. The expression levels of these FAK mutants were comparable with WT FAK (Fig. 4 B, top) and all localized in focal contacts (data not shown). Interestingly, all of these FAK mutants failed to promote cell survival upon UV irradiation (Fig. 4 A). To examine if these ectopically expressed FAK proteins had a similar rate in their decay, presumably caused by caspase-mediated cleavage, these stable MDCK cell lines were exposed to UV radiation and lysed 4 or 6 h afterwards. Surprisingly, the decay rates of FAK Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F mutants were much faster than those in both WT FAK and D395A mutant, which were similar in their rates of decay (Fig. 4 B). Six hours after UV irradiation, HA-tagged FAK proteins were markedly lowered in Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F cells. Conversely, a substantial amount of HA-tagged FAK proteins still remained intact in WT FAK and D395A cells at this time point. Thus, it is possible that the failure of FAK Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F mutants in promoting cell survival is because of their fast decay rates rather than deficiency in particular protein binding. Nevertheless, the result showing FAK D395A failed to promote cell survival suggested that PI3K binding might be required for FAK to promote cell survival (see below).Figure 4Requirement of PI3K binding for FAK to promote cell survival. A, control (Neo) cells or MDCK cells overexpressing HA-tagged WT FAK, D395A, P712A/P715A, or Y925F were exposed to UV radiation, and their survival rates were determined 9 h afterwards. Data (means ± S.E.) are from at least nine independent experiments using three independent cell clones for each FAK construct. B, the cells as described in A were exposed UV radiation and lysed 4 or 6 h afterwards. An equal amount of lysates was then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA.C, an aliquot (700 μg) of lysates from Neo, WT, or D395A cells that were lysed 6 h after UV irradiation was incubated with anti-HA. The immunocomplexes were then subjected to an in vitro assay for PI3K activity, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The locations of the origin (Ori) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP) are indicated at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with our previous result (17Reiske H.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), FAK D395A mutant expressed in MDCK cells was able to bind Src and p130Cas and exhibited a level of tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro autophosphorylation similar to WT FAK (data not shown). These results indicated that the amino acid substitution in D395A mutant did not cause a change in its conformation. Moreover, because D395A mutant has been shown to be deficient in binding to PI3K in vitro and in Chinese hamster cells (17Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), our results here strongly suggest that the direct binding of PI3K to FAK may be required for FAK to promote cell survival. To confirm this, the association of endogenous PI3K with WT FAK and D395A mutant upon UV irradiation in MDCK cells was examined (Fig. 4 C). The level of PI3K activity associated with WT FAK was higher (∼7-fold) than that associated with D395A mutant in MDCK cells. Although some residual binding of PI3K to FAK D395A mutant was detected, it was apparently not sufficient for promoting cell survival in this system.It has previously been shown that associations of PI3K and p130Cas are required for FAK to promote cell migration (16Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar,17Reiske H.R. Kao S.-C. Cary L.A. Guan J.-L. Lai J.-F. Chen H.-C. J. Biol.

To examine if direct association of p130Cas with FAK is also critical for FAK to suppress cell death induced by UV irradiation, the HA-tagged SH3 domain of p130Cas (CasSH3) was stably expressed in MDCK cells that had already expressed HA-tagged FAK. CasSH3 was expected to function as a dominant-negative version of p130Cas by competing with endogenous p130Casfor FAK binding. The expression level of HA-tagged FAK in cells (WT/CasSH3) expressing both FAK and CasSH3 was similar to that in WT cells (Fig. 5 A). Next, we examined the effect of CasSH3 expression on FAK associations with p130Cas and PI3K. The results showed that the association of endogenous p130Cas with HA-tagged FAK was significantly reduced in WT/CasSH3 cells (Fig. 5 B). Conversely, the association of PI3K with HA-tagged FAK was not affected by CasSH3 expression (data not shown). Importantly, we found that WT/CasSH3 clones exhibited a lower cell survival rate than WT cells upon UV irradiation (Fig. 5 C), indicating that, in addition to PI3K, p130Cas binding may be also required for FAK to promote cell survival.Figure 5Effect of the expression of p130Cas SH3 domain on FAK : p130Cas association and FAK-promoted cell survival upon UV irradiation. A, an equal amount (50 μg) of lysates from a control (Neo) clone, a MDCK cell clone expressing WT FAK, or two independent clones expressing both WT FAK and CasSH3 (designated WT/CasSH3–1 and WT/CasSH3–2) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA. The molecular mass markers (kDa) are shown on the left. The positions of HA-tagged FAK and CasSH3 are indicated. B, an equal amount (500 μg) of lysates from the cells as described in A was incubated with anti-p130Cas. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-p130Cas. C, survival rates of the cells as described in A were determined 9 h after UV irradiation, as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this report, first we showed a sequential cleavage of FAK during UV-induced apoptosis. Because FAK cleavage is also triggered by other apoptotic stimuli in various cell types (24Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E. J. Exp.

The cleavage of FAK during UV-induced apoptosis was completely inhibited by a general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK and apparently delayed by Bcl2 expression, suggesting an involvement of caspases in this event. In fact, several members of the caspase family have been shown to directly cleave FAK in vitro (25Wen L.-P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.-L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.S. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol.

Notably, the patterns of FAK cleavage in various cell types undergoing apoptosis induced by UV irradiation (Fig. 1) or other stimuli (24Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Wen L.-P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.-L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol.

The cleavage of Src could be completely blocked by a caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO at 40 μm, which could only partially inhibit cleavage of FAK and p130Cas (Fig. 2). These results suggest that only caspase-3-like caspase(s) may be responsible for Src cleavage during UV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, our results showed that a substantial amount of Src remained intact 24 h (Fig. 1) or even 36 h (data not shown) after UV irradiation, indicating that Src cleavage occurred only in part of its fractions. Src is mainly a membrane protein, anchored via an N-terminal myristic acid and neighboring positively charged amino acids (30Rech M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (589) Google Scholar). To examine if membrane association protects Src from caspase-mediated cleavage, we carried out subcellular fractionation for UV-irradiated MDCK cells. Our preliminary results showed that Src cleavage was observed in cytosol fractions, but not in membrane fractions (data not shown). These results raise an intriguing possibility that, in addition to the presence of specific motifs in substrates for caspase recognition, subcellular localization and/or membrane anchorage of caspase substrates may have some impact on the execution of the proteolysis.In this study, we have established stable MDCK cell lines overexpressing FAK or its mutants deficient in binding to PI3K, Src, p130Cas, or Grb2. Surprisingly, these ectopically expressed FAK proteins exhibited different rates in their decay during UV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4), presumably due to a caspase-mediated cleavage. It appeared that Y397F, P712A/P715A, and Y925F mutants had a faster decay rate than both WT FAK and D395A mutant, which were similar in their rates of decay. Although the reason for this is unclear at present, it is possible that protein-protein interactions may lead to a mask of caspase recognition motifs on FAK or block the access of caspase to FAK, thereby tentatively protecting FAK from cleavage. Alternatively, the amino acid substitutions in FAK mutants Y397F, P712A/P715A, or Y925F may cause a change in protein conformation, leading to protein less stable regardless of UV irradiation. The latter possibility was excluded by our observation that all FAK mutants used in this study had a turnover rate similar to WT without UV irradiation (data not shown). It is noteworthy that, like WT, all FAK mutants described in this report targeted to focal adhesions (data not shown), rendering it unlikely that a faster decay rate for certain FAK mutants is due to an incorrect subcellular localization.Desp"

The involvement of the G12 family of G proteins and the role of specific Rho exchange factors in transducing signals from the thrombin receptor to Rho-dependent cytoskeletal responses was examined. Microinjection of cDNAs for activated Gα12or Gα13 induced cell rounding, and antibodies to Gα12 or Gα13 blocked the response to thrombin. In contrast, activation or inhibition of Gαqfunction had relatively little effect. The cytoskeletal response to Gα12 was inhibited by microinjection of C3 exoenzyme, indicating Rho dependence. Two Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), oncogenic lbc and p115, increased the percentage of rounded cells 4–5-fold, and this was inhibited by C3. Mutant GEFs lacking the Dbl homology (DH) domain required for exchange factor activity failed to induce cell rounding. However, the DH mutants of lbc and p115 were efficacious inhibitors of rounding induced by thrombin or Gα12. The effects of lbc were dependent on an intact pleckstrin homology domain, which may be required for appropriate targeting of the Rho-GEF.

Among its many functions, Rho is involved in controlling the actin cytoskeleton, thereby regulating cell shape and polarity, cytokinesis, cell motility, and contraction (1Narumiya S. J. Biochem.

Ligands for G protein-coupled receptors, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),1 bombesin, thrombin, and endothelin, have been shown to induce actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in a variety of cell types (3Ridley A.J.

In neuronal cell lines and PC-12 cells, LPA, thrombin, and prostaglandin E2 (all ligands for GPCRs) induce Rho-dependent retraction of cell processes and cell rounding (4Jalink K. van Corven E.J.

Our laboratory has also demonstrated a requirement for Rho in thrombin-stimulated rounding and retraction of processes in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (9Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M.

Similar cytoskeletal rearrangements are believed to be crucial in growth cone guidance and cell migration and may be involved in development and plasticity of neuronal and glial cells. Despite abundant evidence for the involvement of Rho family small G proteins in agonist-induced morphological responses, there is limited information regarding the molecular mechanisms linking agonist activation of GPCR to regulation of Rho-mediated events. The question of which heterotrimeric G proteins are responsible for coupling receptors to the downstream targets that transduce the effects of agonists on the actin cytoskeleton is of considerable interest. Notably, GPCR agonists that activate phospholipase C through Gq are not equally efficacious for inducing cytoskeletal changes. For example, thrombin but not carbachol causes cell rounding in astrocytoma cells (9Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanerolle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and LPA but not bradykinin causes process retraction in PC-12 cells (6Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that thrombin-induced cell rounding is independent of phospholipase C activation, Ca2+ mobilization, or pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein activation (9Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanerolle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, heterotrimeric G proteins other than those of the Gαq or Gαi/o family are likely to be responsible for linking activation of selected GPCRs to Rho-mediated actin rearrangements. The pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein Gα12 was first isolated as an oncogene (11Chan A.M.-L. Fleming T.P. McGovern E.S. Chedid M. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to induce cellular transformation in fibroblasts (12Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc.

However, the direct effectors of Gα12/13 that mediate the aforementioned responses still remain to be identified. Activation of Rho and other small GTPases requires the exchange of GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Several GEFs including lbc, lfc, lsc, and p115 show specificity for Rho (23Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Very recent studies provide evidence that the Rho-specific GEFs can transduce signals from the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins to Rho. The p115 GEF was demonstrated to contain an RGS-like domain and act as a GTPase-activating protein for Gα12 and Gα13 (25Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Most importantly, Gα13 was demonstrated to enhance the Rho exchange activity of p115 (25Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). A related observation is that Gα13can synergize with p115 to activate SRE-mediated gene transcription (17Mao J. Yuan H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Another Gα12 family binding protein, termed PDZ-RhoGEF or KIAA0380, also regulates G12/13 effects on SRE activation (27Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Involvement of Rho exchange factors in GPCR- or G12/13-mediated effects on the actin cytoskeleton has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that the thrombin receptor mediates cell rounding through coupling to Gα12 and subsequent activation of a Rho exchange factor. To test this possibility we microinjected inhibitory antibody to Gα12, as well as an expression plasmid for activated Gα12. Our findings indicate that Gα12 is necessary and sufficient for thrombin-induced cell rounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that thrombin- and Gα12-stimulated rounding are inhibited by mutants of the Rho-GEFs Lbc and p115. These data implicate GEFs as downstream mediators of G12/13-induced Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes. Human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were plated onto 100-mm plates at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/ml and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) for 4 days. The cells were then triturated and set on 12-mm round glass coverslips (prewashed with acid and ethanol) at a density of ∼1.0 × 104 cells/slip and allowed to grow in 5% fetal calf serum plus DMEM for 48 h before microinjection. cDNA for the glutathione S-transferase-C3 fusion protein (kindly provided by Dr. J. Meinkoth, University of Pennsylvania) was used to transform JM109 Escherichia coli to produce the glutathione S-transferase-C3 fusion protein for purification. After transformation, the cells were lysed, and clarified extracts were incubated with GSH-Sepharose. After extensive washing, the C3 toxin protein was cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase by overnight incubation with thrombin. Thrombin was removed by incubation with para- aminobenzamidine-Sepharose, and the supernatant was concentrated in a Centricon-10 to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml protein. In experiments involving microinjection of the C3 toxin, the protein was first diluted to a concentration of 40 μg/ml in microinjection buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mmNaPO4) before injection. 1321N1 cells were set on glass coverslips and grown as described above (see “Cell Culture”). Expression plasmids were prepared and purified by CsCl gradient and diluted to a concentration of 50 μg/ml in microinjection buffer. These diluted expression plasmids were microinjected into cell nuclei along with 100 μg/ml of a marker plasmid for nuclear green fluorescent protein (provided by the laboratory of Dr. Geoff Wahl (28Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar)) using an Eppendorf microinjector and Zeiss Axiovert Microscope. After microinjection of expression plasmids, cells were incubated in DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum for 3 h, followed by 20 min in serum-free DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without thrombin (0.5 units/ml), and then fixed and stained as described below. For microinjection of antibodies, the antibodies were concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Centricon and then diluted to 5 mg/ml with IgG. Following microinjection, cells were incubated for 30 min in 5% DMEM plus fetal calf serum, after which they were switched to serum-free medium plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 20 min. Cells were then fixed and stained for F-actin as described below. Microinjected cells were identified by staining for co-injected IgG or by directly staining for the injected antibody (from rabbit) using a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. To detect actin morphology of microinjected cells, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for 30 min with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Microinjected cells were identified by detection of green fluorescent nuclei (expressing co-injected nuclear green fluorescent protein), and F-actin staining was visualized using a Zeiss-Axiophot microscope and a × 40 Neofluor objective lens. Approximately 100–150 injected cells were detected per slip, and these were scored for rounding based on absence of “stellate” morphology (i.e. lack of processes and rounded morphology). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Postanalysis was performed using the Tukey test when p was <0.05. p values are given in the figure legends. To determine whether Gα12 mediates the cytoskeletal effects of thrombin we microinjected a Gα12C-terminal antibody into 1321N1 cells. The ability of thrombin to induce cell rounding was examined 30 min after antibody injection and compared with the response in cells microinjected with IgG. The Gα12 C-terminal antibody inhibited thrombin-induced rounding by nearly 80% (Fig. 1). Microinjection of a Gα13 antibody (CT100 from Dr. Melvin Simon) also dramatically decreased rounding. We also tested a commercially available C-terminal Gα13 antibody (Calbiochem) which gave a marked but less complete (∼55%) inhibition (data not shown). The same concentration of a C-terminal Gαq antibody caused only partial inhibition (∼30%) of thrombin-induced rounding. To determine the specificity of the Gα12 and Gα13 antibodies, Western blot analysis was performed on lysates from COS cells transfected with plasmids encoding Gα12 or Gα13, as described previously (14Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J. Feramisco J.R. Brown J.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20073-20077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Gα12 antibody recognized only Gα12; however, both Gα13 antibodies recognized Gα13 and, to a lesser extent, Gα12 (data not shown). Therefore, the ability of the Gα13 antibody to inhibit thrombin-stimulated rounding may be due in part to blockade of Gα12 function. To determine which Gα subunits could mimic the effects of thrombin, 1321N1 cells were microinjected with 50 μg/ml expression plasmids for the activated form of Gαq(GαqRC), Gα12 (Gα12QL), or Gα13 (Gα13QL). The cells were fixed 3 h after injection and stained, and the percentage of round cells was determined. Approximately 10% of cells injected with control plasmid (pCIS) were rounded (Fig. 2 A), while most showed a normal stellate, process-bearing shape like that seen in uninjected cells (Fig. 2 B). Microinjection of constitutively activated Gα12 or Gα13expression plasmids induced a loss of stellation and produced a round morphology in 40–50% of the injected cells. The morphology induced by microinjection of activated Gα12QL or Gα13QL was identical to that seen with thrombin stimulation of astrocytoma cells (9Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanerolle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Microinjection of the same concentration of constitutively activated Gαq cDNA resulted in a significantly lower level of cell rounding (∼20% of injected cells) than that seen with activated Gα12 or Gα13. Activated Gαq was less efficacious than Gα12 even when the concentration of microinjected Gαq was 50-fold above that of Gα12 (data not shown). A variety of cell-specific cytoskeletal responses have been shown to be induced by small G proteins. To directly examine the effect of Rho on astrocytoma cell morphology, we microinjected an expression plasmid for constitutively activated L63Rho into 1321N1 cell nuclei. The number of microinjected cells that rounded was increased 4-fold following injection of activated Rho (Fig. 3). Microinjection of another activated Rho mutant V12Rho was equally effective at inducing rounding (data not shown). The specificity of this response was assessed by comparison with responses to activated Rac (V12Rac) or Ras (V12Ras). Microinjection of cDNA for these small G proteins did not induce cell rounding (Fig.3), or other detectable morphological changes (e.g. membrane ruffling or stress fiber formation) in cells examined at times between 1 and 3 h after injection. These data indicate that Rho is a specific mediator of 1321N1 cell rounding and that this Rho-mediated response is independent of the activation of Ras or Rac. The C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylates and specifically inhibits Rho function. To demonstrate that Gα12 stimulates cell rounding through a Rho-dependent mechanism, we coinjected C3 exoenzyme protein along with activated Gα12QL plasmid. Co-injection of C3 exoenzyme blocked the ability of Gα12 to induce rounding. Microinjection of C3 exoenzyme also inhibited thrombin-induced rounding (Fig. 4), confirming the inhibitory effect of extracellularly applied C3 exoenzyme on the response to thrombin in these cells (9Majumdar M.

Cell rounding induced by activated Rho was also inhibited by C3 exoenzyme injection (Fig. 4), consistent with the concept that ADP-ribosylation of Rho blocks its ability to couple to downstream effectors. One likely effector of thrombin and Rho-mediated cell rounding is the Rho-dependent kinase, Rho kinase, which phosphorylates and inhibits myosin phosphatase, leading to an increase in phosphorylated myosin light chain (29Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar).

Majumdar, D. Goldstein, and J. Heller Brown, unpublished observations. To determine whether Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which serve as activators of Rho, could effect similar changes in 1321N1 cell shape, we microinjected expression plasmids for the Rho-specific GEF, lbc (see Fig.5 A). A truncated, activated form of lbc (onco-lbc), which lacks the region C-terminal to but includes the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain was found to be a highly efficacious activator of cell rounding (Fig.6 A). As evidence that this response was mediated through the ability of lbc to activate Rho, we demonstrated that onco-lbc-induced cell rounding was inhibited by C3 co-injection (Fig. 6 A). Microinjection of the full-length proto-lbc construct had a significant but lesser effect on cell morphology. Expression plasmids for another Rho-specific exchange factor, p115 (Fig. 5 B), were also microinjected. Both the full-length form (p115) and an N-terminal, truncated cDNA (ΔN-p115), which lacks the region that contains RGS sequence homology (26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D.

The response to p115 was shown to be Rho-dependent based on inhibition by C3 exoenzyme co-injection (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Microinjection of lbc and p115GEF induce C3-sensitive 1321N1 cell rounding.

To investigate a role for lbc and/or p115 in the signaling pathway utilized by thrombin and Gα12, we examined the possibility that DH domain mutants of the Rho-GEFs would act to inhibit downstream signaling. Mutants of lbc and p115 lacking their DH domains were first examined for their ability to induce cell rounding (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast to the marked stimulatory effects of onco-lbc or p115 shown in Fig. 6, A or B, the comparable mutants lacking DH domains (“lbc no DH” or “p115 no DH”; see Fig. 5) were ineffective (Fig. 7, A and B). Of greatest interest, expression of lbc no DH or p115 no DH inhibited cell rounding induced by thrombin by more than 80% (Fig. 7, A and B). Additionally, injection of the mutants lbc no DH or p115 no DH caused nearly complete inhibition of the induction of cell rounding by co-injected Gα12 (Fig. 7, A and B). As evidence that inhibition by the no DH mutant occurred upstream of Rho, lbc no DH failed to significantly inhibit cell rounding induced by activated (L63)Rho. To control for the specificity of the inhibition, we further determined that lbc no DH did not block cell rounding induced by colchicine (data not shown), which presumably elicits cytoskeletal responses through its direct effect on microtubules. An lbc mutant lacking the PH domain had no significant effect on cell morphology but, unlike the no DH mutant, did not act as an inhibitor of thrombin signaling (Table I).Table IEffects of lbc no PH on 1321N1 cell roundingConstruct or agonist1-aCells were microinjected with expression plasmids for SRαneo or lbc no PH at 50 μg/ml and treated or not treated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml) 3 h following injection as described (see “Experimental Procedures”).Mean ± S.E. of rounded cells1-bMicroinjected cells were identified, and percentage of rounded cells was determined.

Open table in a new tab The thrombin receptor has been suggested to couple to Gα12 and Gα13 based on its ability to increase GTP binding to these PTX-insensitive heterotrimeric G proteins in platelets and a reconstituted baculovirus system (32Offermanns S.

Our laboratory has also shown Gα12 to be required for thrombin-stimulated mitogenesis, Ras activation, and AP-1-mediated gene transcription (14Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, because these transcriptional and mitogenic responses result from convergence of multiple pathways and are measured at long times following thrombin stimulation, it has been difficult to identify the effectors immediately downstream of thrombin and Gα12 signaling in these pathways. The study described here presents evidence that thrombin-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is also mediated through receptor coupling to the heterotrimeric G protein G12. Analysis of this rapid and robust response has allowed further dissection of the molecular events by which Gα12 signaling occurs (Fig.8). Several observations support the involvement of Gα12 in thrombin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. First, microinjection of the constitutively activated subunit of Gα12 alone, in the absence of agonist, is sufficient to elicit a morphological response (i.e. cell rounding and retraction of processes) identical to that seen with thrombin treatment. This finding is consistent with a recent study, published while this manuscript was in preparation, which found retraction of neurites in PC-12 cells to be induced by activated Gα12 or Gα13 (35Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). More compelling evidence supporting the involvement of Gα12 in thrombin receptor-induced 1321N1 cell rounding is the observation that the response is fully inhibited by microinjection of C-terminal inhibitory antibodies to Gα12. The finding that thrombin-induced rounding could also be blocked by microinjection of an antibody to the C terminus of Gα13 suggested that the G12 and G13 pathways might both be required for thrombin-induced rounding. However, while the Gα12antibody was specific for Gα12, both Gα13antibodies tested reacted with Gα12 as well as Gα13. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the Gα13antibodies may result from blockade of Gα12 signaling. Gohla et al. (16Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) examined the ability of antibodies to the C-terminal of Gα12 and Gα13 to block LPA-induced stress fiber formation and reported inhibition only with antibodies to Gα13. More recent work from the same group has shown that antibodies to Gα12, but not Gα13, were capable of inhibiting thrombin-stimulated stress fiber formation (42Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the LPA receptor preferentially couples to Gα13, while the thrombin receptor couples to Gα12 to induce cytoskeletal responses. Our findings further implicate a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the thrombin receptor/Gα12/13-induced cytoskeletal response. Specifically, we demonstrate that two distinct Rho exchange factors, lbc and p115, both stimulate cell rounding and retraction of cell processes. The response to these Rho-GEFs, as well as the response to thrombin and Gα12, is C3-sensitive, demonstrating that Rho mediates the effects of all of these stimuli. Further experiments show that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity, which is localized to the DH domain, is required for this Rho-GEF induced cytoskeletal response, since neither the lbc nor p115 mutants which lack exchange activity stimulate rounding. Microinjection of a mutant lbc, which lacks the PH domain was also unable to induce cell rounding or process retraction, demonstrating a requirement for the PH domain in these morphological responses. Surprisingly, this same mutant was able to induce stress fibers in fibroblasts (31Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K. Toksoz D. Hall A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the PH domain has been shown to be required for transformation (24Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.-G. McCabe P.

Most critical to the conclusion that Rho-GEFs transduce signals from thrombin/Gα12 to Rho is the finding that microinjection of either lbc or p115 mutants lacking the DH exchange factor domain (lbc no DH or p115 no DH) can inhibit thrombin- and Gα12-stimulated rounding. Importantly, the lbc no DH mutant was unable to significantly inhibit L63Rho-induced rounding, indicating that the inhibition occurs upstream of Rho. In addition, the lbc no DH mutant was unable to block colchicine-induced 1321N1 cell rounding. These observations mitigate against nonspecific inhibitory effects of the mutant Rho-GEFs on the actin cytoskeleton. The finding that lbc lacking its PH domain, while inactive, did not inhibit thrombin-induced rounding in 1321N1 cells suggests that the lbc PH domain could be the region required to compete with the endogenous Rho exchange factor that is the direct target of thrombin and Gα12. Whether this exchange factor is lbc, p115, or another as yet undetermined Rho-GEF is currently unknown. It is of interest that the PH domains in p115 and lbc show a greater degree of homology to each other (∼27%) than to the comparable PH domain in the Rac specific exchange factor Dbl (24Hart M.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or to PH domains in other proteins. Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility that the PH domains in the Rho-GEFs compete for Gα12 binding to other proteins that do not have exchange factor activity. For example Gα12 has been shown to interact with the PH domain in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (43Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a member of the Tec/Bmx family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases recently suggested to mediate Rho-GEF activation by Gα12 family proteins (44Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Continued studies to determine which exchange factors bind to the Gα12 subunit and whether the PH domain competes for this binding are being carried out in our laboratory. The p115 GEF contains not only PH and DH domains but also an RGS domain. This domain binds to the α subunits of G12 and G13, for which p115 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (25Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Another Rho-specific GEF (termed PDZ-RhoGEF, cloned as KIAA0380) was also found to interact directly with Gα12 and Gα13 through an Lsc homology domain, with RGS domain homology (27Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Inhibition of thrombin- and Gα12-induced cell rounding by p115 no DH could therefore be due to an inhibitory interaction of either the PH or the RGS domain with Gα12. While lbc has not yet been shown to directly interact with Gα12/13 or to contain a well defined RGS domain, some RGS homology was detectable within the PH domain. 3D. Toksoz, unpublished results. Thus, direct interactions of lbc as well as p115 with G protein α subunits are possible. Several recent studies of heterotrimeric G protein signaling indicate that tyrosine kinases act upstream of Rho activation. Notably, these studies reported that a tyrphostin A25-sensitive tyrosine kinase was required for the effects of LPA and Gα13 on Rho-dependent cytoskeletal responses (16Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but that the response to Gα12 was not blocked by this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (16Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our preliminary data also suggest that the thrombin/Gα12-induced morphological response is not inhibited by tyrphostin A25 or PP2, which inhibits src-like tyrosine kinases. However, studies using more selective inhibitors of Src family or other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are required to rule out involvement of tyrosine kinases in the pathway by which thrombin and Gα12 activate Rho-GEFs and elicit cell rounding. The studies reported here are among the first to show that mutant GEFs can be used to inhibit signaling through Rho-dependent pathways and to demonstrate that a mutant Rho-GEF can block agonist or heterotrimeric G protein-stimulated cytoskeletal responses. Other recent studies demonstrate inhibition of agonist and Gα12/13 effects on SRE-mediated gene expression by no DH mutants of p115 and PDZ-RhoGEF (17Mao J. Yuan H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ATP hydrolysis and ligand translocation are dependent on a signaling mechanism originating from the binding protein and traveling through HisQ/HisM (16Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The HisP subunits interact with each other, as substantiated by several findings as follows: hydrolysis of ATP displays positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of n = 2 (8Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q.

HisP has been purified and characterized also in an active soluble form, away from HisQ and HisM (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Among its characteristics important for this study are the following: soluble HisP functions only as a dimer, it hydrolyzes ATP in the absence of liganded HisJ (i.e. in the absence of a signal), and it does not display cooperativity. Its three-dimensional structure has been resolved (22Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), and in agreement with the biochemical characteristics, it has a dimeric structure. Each subunit in the dimer has two arms in the shape of an “L.” Arm I contributes many of the ATP-binding pocket residues, and arm II appears to be embedded in the membrane by interaction with HisQM and is likely to be involved in the signaling mechanism. Important questions concerning the precise function and relationship to each other of the two nucleotide-binding sites within ABC transporters have not yet been resolved. In the case of MDR, inactivation of only one of the two ATP-binding sites, either mutationally (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 24Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9073-9082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or chemically (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), results in loss of activity by the other site. A similar finding was obtained for the bacterial transporter, the maltose permease (27Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the notion that the two sites interact with each other. In the case of the histidine permease, the two HisP subunits are identical and might be expected to function identically. However, this is not necessarily the case, because in the quaternary structure of the membrane-bound complex they interact with HisQ and HisM, which are closely related to each other (28Ames G.F.-L. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 23: 103-119Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but are different; as a consequence, the HisP subunits may also acquire different conformations within the complex. It is necessary to ask the following questions. Do both subunits hydrolyze ATP in each activity cycle, as opposed to only one hydrolyzing ATP while the other is involved only in an alternative function, such as activation? Do the two subunits perform the same function but separately and alternately? Do both subunits need to be intact for ATP hydrolysis? What kind of mutations are compatible with retention of activity? Here we have used both the soluble and membrane-bound HisP forms to show that, although dimer formation is a prerequisite for hydrolysis, when HisP is in the soluble form only one of the dimer subunits hydrolyzes ATP and that hydrolysis proceeds at the same rate if one of them is incompetent in hydrolysis. In contrast, in the case of the membrane-bound complex, both subunits hydrolyze ATP and, in a heterodimer in which one of the subunits is inactive, hydrolysis still occurs but at half the rate. Ligand translocation also proceeds at half the rate in such a heterodimer, suggesting that each ATP hydrolysis is separately coupled to translocation. These results are used to reinterpret and modify a working model for the mechanism of action of an ABC transporter. 3 g of cells from GA598, a strain containing plasmid pFA356 that harbors the wild type hisP gene (without the (his6) extension), were disrupted twice at 10,000 pounds/square inch in a French press cell, in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris/Cl buffer containing 20% glycerol, and 10 mm ATP. After two low speed centrifugations (10 min at 1300 × g), the supernatant fraction was ultra-centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 rpm in a TL100.4 Beckman rotor. Ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate was added in an equal volume with stirring for 30 min on ice; the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in the same buffer, and applied to a molecular sieve column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrogel-ACA54 for 5–70,000-kDa proteins). Fractions containing HisP were identified both by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels and by immunoblotting using anti-HisP antibody and concentrated using an Amicon Centricon concentrator. The ATPase activity was measured as described (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The final purity was about 70%. Production and purification of soluble HisP(his6) was performed as described (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Reassembly of complexes into urea-treated proteoliposomes was done as described previously (16Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membranes (15 mg of protein) from TA1889 containing plasmid pFA17, which carries the hisQ, hisM, and hisP genes cloned under the control of the λPL promoter (29Ames G.F.-L. Nikaido K. Hobson A. Malcolm B. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and induced for the production of the complex, were incubated for 2 h in the presence of soluble H211R(his6) (1.8 mg of protein) at 37 °C, in 100 mm MOPS/K, pH 7.5 buffer, containing 4 mm ATP, 8% glycerol, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 4 ml. HisQMP2 was then solubilized and purified as described (30Liu P.-Q. Molecular Mechanism of Action of the Periplasmic Histidine Permease Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1997Google Scholar).3 After solubilization as described (7Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but with the difference that EGTA was not present, the pH of the soluble fraction was adjusted to pH 8.0 with Tris base, and the soluble fraction was applied to a TALON column as described (20Liu C.E. Mechanism of Action of the Periplasmic Histidine Permease in Salmonella typhimurium Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar). After the unbound protein has exited, the column was washed twice with the same buffer as used for the solubilization, followed by 5 × 1-ml elutions with the same buffer containing 25 mm imidazole and then by 5 × 1-ml elutions with the same buffer containing 50 mmimidazole. The fractions eluted with 25 and 50 mm imidazole which contained protein were concentrated 3–4-fold using an Amicon PM10 Centricon concentrator, immediately reconstituted into proteoliposomes (7Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and stored in liquid nitrogen. SDS-PAGE was on 15% acrylamide (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), with the pH of the resolving gel adjusted to 8.5, and the dye front was allowed to escape for 10 min. Immunoblots were performed as described (16Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of soluble HisP was assayed as described (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Assay of transport and ATPase activities in proteoliposomes has been described (7Liu C.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A modified Lowry method (32Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar) was used for assaying protein concentration in proteoliposomes, whereas the Pierce BCA microassay was used for soluble HisP. Abundant evidence indicates that HisP must dimerize in order to hydrolyze ATP, suggesting that the subunits assume an “activated” conformation upon dimerization. Two possibilities were considered for the basis of the activity as expressed by the wild type HisP dimer, both in the soluble and membrane-bound forms as follows: (i) both subunits hydrolyze ATP in each turnover cycle; (ii) only one subunit hydrolyzes ATP with the other one functioning as an “activator.” In the first case the turnover number per molecule of dimer would be twice as high as in the second case. If a heterodimer were constructed in which one of the two subunits were able to bind ATP but not hydrolyze it, the wild type subunit might still be able to carry on hydrolysis in either of the above cases. If this were true, the specific activity of the heterodimer would be half as much as that of the wild type homodimer if both subunits normally hydrolyze ATP, but it would be the same as that of the wild type if only one subunit normally hydrolyzes ATP, 4Preferential positioning of each subunit within the complex would complicate the interpretation, as discussed later. suggesting that the “activation” can proceed in the absence of hydrolysis. Alternatively, the heterodimer might be altogether unable to hydrolyze ATP, as has been reported for the maltose permease (27Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which would suggest that activation of one subunit requires ATP hydrolysis and possibly binding by the other subunit. A comparison of the specific activities of the wild type homodimer and of heterodimers in which one of the subunits is unable to hydrolyze ATP would provide useful information for these questions. The characteristics of HisP mutants with respect to the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP have been described (6Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5P.-Q. Liu, unpublished data. On this basis we selected HisP mutants that bind but do not hydrolyze ATP to test whether they have retained the presumed activation function. Since HisP is now available both in the soluble and in the complex-bound form, the properties of homodimers and heterodimers of HisP can be studied under both conditions. We first analyzed the behavior of soluble HisP, which constitutes a simpler system because the formation of various heterodimers can be controlled by varying the amounts of the individual soluble species in appropriately calculated proportions. Wild type HisP carrying a 6-histidine residue carboxyl-terminal extension was purified in soluble form as described (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous findings (8Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the ATPase activity of soluble wild type HisP is concentration-dependent because activity requires dimerization: at 50 μg/ml protein the specific activity is very low, 160 nmol/min/mg, on average (Fig.1 A, open bars). As the concentration of HisP is increased, the concentration of the dimer increases and the specific activity increases correspondingly, reaching 515 nmol/min/mg when the protein concentration is 200 μg/ml. Several soluble mutant HisP proteins were similarly purified after introducing each mutant hisP gene of interest into a T7 promoter plasmid vector capable of overproducing the HisP protein containing a carboxyl-terminal extension of 6 histidine residues. Mutations in the hisP gene which eliminate substrate translocation have been characterized according to their ability to bind ATP (6Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A good candidate for testing the presumed activation ability is mutation hisP5551, in which residue His-211 has been replaced by arginine, coding for protein H211R, 6The first letter indicates the wild type residue (in the single letter amino acid code) and is followed by the residue number and the replacing residue. and which supports neither hydrolysis of ATP nor histidine translocation but retains the ability to bind ATP (as determined by interaction with 8-azido-ATP (6Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The ATPase activity of purified soluble H211R was tested at various protein concentrations. H211R does not have significant activity at concentrations comparable with those where the wild type has considerable activity (Fig. 1 A, solid bar). Purified H211R was then tested for its ability to impart activity by forming heterodimers in combination with wild type HisP. Increasing concentrations of H211R were added to a fixed low concentration (50 μg/ml) of wild type HisP, at which concentration the latter has little activity. The additions result in a progressively increasing activity (Fig. 1 B, dotted bars), indicating that an active heterodimer (wm) 7Dimers are referred to as ww, or mm, or wm, if they are composed of two wild type, or two mutant, or one wild type and one mutant subunit(s), respectively.must be formed between the inactive and the wild type subunits. To determine the specific activity of the heterodimer, the measured activity must first be corrected for the small amount of activity due to the wild type homodimer (ww). This is achieved by calculating the total concentration of dimers (21Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that of the individual dimeric forms, at each of the total protein concentrations; then corresponding fractions of the total activity are assigned to each of the dimer species that are active, i.e. the homodimer (ww) and the heterodimer (wm). TableI shows these calculations as performed on the data in Fig. 1. The H211R homodimer (mm) has an insignificant level of activity even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 1 A). The activity assigned to the wild type homodimer (ww) at each total protein concentration is calculated by multiplying the number of ww homodimers present by the known specific activity of the wild type, 0.26 nmol of Pi liberated per pmol of dimer/min and subtracting this value from the total measured activity; each remaining activity is divided by the number of heterodimers (wm) to obtain the specific activities at each combination. It can be seen that the specific activity of these heterodimers is approximately the same at all total protein concentrations and that, most importantly, it is about 0.26, i.e. similar to the known specific activity value established for the wild type. These data support the notion that when HisP is in the soluble form, although two subunits are required for activity, only one of them hydrolyzes ATP and that the “other subunit” need not be intact to “activate” ATP hydrolysis by the wild type subunit.Table IATPase activity of homodimers and heterodimers of soluble HisPH211RD185ESubunitDimer concentration1-aThe total number of pmol/ml dimers was determined as described (21). The number of each of the dimeric species containing two wild type (ww), one wild type and one mutant (wm), or two mutant (mm) HisP molecules, respectively, is as calculated from the relative proportions of wild type and mutant protein.

Open table in a new tab To support this conclusion, the activities of the wild type dimer and of the heterodimer were determined also under conditions where the ratio of H211R to wild type was maintained constant (1:1), whereas the total protein concentration was increased from 25 to 200 μg per ml. Fig. 2 (open circles) shows that, as expected, because of the dependence on dimerization, the activity obtained for the wild type alone increases faster than the increase in protein concentration; this relationship is linear when the activity is expressed relative to picomoles of dimer present (Fig. 2, inset). The activity of the mixture containing equal amounts of wild type and H211R similarly increases, although more slowly (solid diamonds), as would be expected from a fraction of the dimers being inactive (i.e. mm). If the activity of the mixture is corrected for that due to the formation of wild type homodimers and expressed relative to the number of picomoles of heterodimer, a linear relationship essentially identical to that for the wild type is obtained (Fig. 2, inset). Thus, these results support the conclusion that only one of the two subunits hydrolyzes ATP in both the wild type homodimer and the heterodimer. Another mutation analyzed is hisP6666, coding for protein D185E, which also binds but does not hydrolyze ATP. 8P.-Q. Liu, personal communication. The behavior of mutant D185E is somewhat different from that of H211R. Fig. 1 A (last bar) shows that it has an insignificant level of activity at a protein concentration of 200 μg/ml. Adding D185E to a fixed low concentration of wild type HisP results in an increase in activity (Fig. 1 B, bars with horizontal lines), indicating that it also is capable of forming activ"

Villin induces the growth of microvilli in transfected cells, an activity that requires a carboxyl-terminally located KKEK motif. By combining cell transfection and biochemical assays, we show that the capacity of villin to induce growth of microvilli in cells correlates with its ability to bundle F-actin in vitro but not with its nucleating activity. In agreement with its importance for microfilament bundling in cells, the KKEK motif of the carboxyl-terminal F-actin-binding site is crucial for bundling in vitro. In addition, substitutions of basic residues in a second site, located in the amino-terminal portion of villin, impaired its activity in cells and reduced its binding to F-actin in the absence of Ca2+ as well as its bundling and severing activities in vitro. Altogether, these findings suggest that villin participates in the organization and stabilization of the brush border core bundle but does not initiate its assembly by nucleation of actin filaments.

Villin is composed of six repeats, each containing approximately 150 residues that together constitute the core domain followed by the carboxyl-terminal headpiece domain of 87 residues (10Glenney Jr., J.R.

A. 1988; 85: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The core domain retains Ca2+-dependent capping, nucleating, and severing activity, whereas the carboxyl-terminal headpiece domain is required for actin filament bundling and binds to F-actin, independently of Ca2+ (10Glenney Jr., J.R. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2810-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Villin is structurally and functionally related to two classes of proteins. The first group comprises Quail, a bundling protein in Drosophila required for the formation of cytoplasmic F-actin bundles in ovary nurse cells (14Mahajan-Miklos S. Cooley L. Cell. 1994; 78: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as well as protovillin of Dictyostelium that has been proposed to be an ancestral form of villin (15Hofmann A. Noegel A.A. Bomblies L. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second group includes the severing proteins gelsolin, the crystal structure of which has been solved recently (16Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and scinderin found in higher eukaryotes (17Kwiatkowski D.J. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) as well as fragmin and severin of lower eukaryotes (18Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4149-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19André E. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M. Noegel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas proteins of the first group are organized into seven domains like villin, the members of the second group have an organization similar to the villin core domain. So far, villin is unique among these proteins because it is the only one that bundles and severs actin filaments in a Ca2+-regulated manner.A role for villin in the assembly of the microvillus core bundle was determined by reconstitution experiments in vitro (20Coluccio L. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Addition of villin and fimbrin, another actin-bundling protein associated with the microvillar core, to homogenous F-actin is sufficient for the formation of bundles with a basic structure similar to that of the brush border microvilli in vivo. Villin overproduction or villin mRNA ablation in cultured cells also suggested that villin supports assembly of the actin core bundle of microvilli (21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Franck Z. Footer M. Bretscher A. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fibroblast-like cells transfected with a cDNA encoding villin (21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or microinjected with villin protein (22Franck Z. Footer M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are covered by long microvilli containing bundled actin filaments to which villin is associated. Mutational analysis of villin showed that these morphological modifications require the first half of the core, also named villin 44T, and the headpiece domain (see Fig. 1 B and Refs. 21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 24Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The headpiece domain of human villin contains at its carboxyl terminus a cluster of predominantly basic residues (KKEK), which is essential for the morphogenic activity of villin in transfected cells (25Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from this region or recombinant headpiece bind to F-actin (25Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The second repeat of the core domain (V2) comprises a stretch of basic residues (27Pope B. Way M. Matsudaira P.T. Wedds A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that is important for the severing activity of the 44T villin subdomain (28de Arruda M. Bazari H. Wallek M. Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13079-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that this sequence also participates in bundling of actin filaments in vivo and in vitro. However, such a mechanism of action has, to our knowledge, never been tested experimentally.To address the action mechanism of villin, we determined how mutations affecting villin-induced growth of microvilli in transfected cells can also affect activity of villin in vitro. Because information obtained from previous studies (21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggests that microfilament bundling is an important activity for villin function, we focused on the two F-actin-binding sites located in the headpiece and core domain, respectively. We have also investigated for the first time how residue substitutions influencing F-actin binding properties of villin-derived peptides or domains affect the activities of the whole villin molecule in vitro.We show that F-actin bundling but not nucleation activity of villin is important for induction of F-actin spikes in transfected cells, suggesting that villin may stabilize and organize the F-actin bundle of microvilli but might not initiate the formation of these structures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsRhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Sigma.N-Pyrenyliodoacetamide was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).AntibodiesMonoclonal antibodies (ID2C3) recognizing an epitope in the carboxyl terminus of human villin, as well as their purification was described previously (29Dudouet B. Robine S. Huet C. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Blair L. Coudrier E. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fluorescein-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibodies were purchased from Cappel (Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium). Phosphatase coupled anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Construction of Recombinant DNAscDNA constructions were prepared by standard procedures as described by Sambrook and colleagues (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).DNA Constructions for Production of Wild Type Villin or Villin Variants in Eukaryotic CellsFor expression in eukaryotic cells, a cDNA encoding wild type villin (4Arpin M. Friederich E. Fleming T.P. Epithelial Organization and Development. Chapman and Hall, London1992: 245-271Crossref Google Scholar) was inserted into the pCB6 expression vector comprising a cytomegalovirus promoter sequence.To introduce the double amino acid substitution R137A,K144A, a sense-primer specific of bp1403–436 of the human villin coding sequence and an antisense primer located ∼500 bp downstream of this sequence were used in a polymerase chain reaction. Both primers contained add-on sequences for subcloning, corresponding to a Xba I and an Eco RI site, respectively. The sense-primer was a 41-mer oligonucleotide: 5′-CCCTCTAGACGTCCAGGCGCTGCTGCATGTCAAGGGCGCGA-3′ (the mutations are underlined). The sequence of the antisense primer was complementary to bp 888–903 of the villin coding sequence, located upstream of the unique Bgl II restriction site of the villin sequence. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were ligated through Xba I and Eco RI into the pSp64 vector. An ∼180-bp fragment corresponding to the mutagenized villin 5′-sequence was removed from this construct by AatII and Bgl II digestion and ligated to the AatII/Bgl II-cut pSp64-villin yielding pSp64-villin RK/AA. A DNA fragment of 2.7 kilobase pairs encoding the mutagenized complete villin sequence was ligated through the Xba I/Eco RI sites into the pCB6 expression vector, yielding pCB6-villin RK/AA that encodes villin variant RK/AA.A third amino acid substitution was introduced into the villin protein sequence by a similar cloning strategy using a 46-mer oligonucleotide 5′-CCCTCTAGACGTCCAGGCGCTGCTGCATGTCAAGGGCGCGGAGAAC-3′ as mutagenic primer (the mutations are underlined). The resulting construct was named pCB6-villin RKR/AAE and encodes the villin variant R137A,K144A,R145E.DNA Constructions for Production of Wild Type Villin or Villin Variants in Escherichia coliFor expression in E. coli, all cDNAs were introduced into the prokaryotic pGEX-2T expression vector (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). For in-frame ligation to the 3′-end of the glutathione S-transferase coding sequence, the 5′-end of the villin cDNA coding region was modified by the polymerase chain reaction. For expression of the cDNA encoding the triple substitution variant RKR/AAE in E. coli, the pCB6-villin RKR/AAE DNA was Sma I/Eco RI-digested. An ∼2.4-kilobase pairs DNA fragment corresponding to bp 51–2481 of the villin coding sequence was removed. To reconstitute the entire villin coding sequence, this fragment was ligated into the Sma I/Eco RI-cut pGEX-2T-villin 5′ DNA. Constructions of mutant cDNAs encoding villin V1–3+HP, villin Δ7, and villin KKEK/KEEE have been described previously (24Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For insertion of these cDNAs into the pGEX-2T expression vector, DNA fragments encoding these variants but lacking 50 bp of the 5′-end and the start of translation were ligated into the Sma I/Sal I digested pGEX2T-villin Sal I DNA to replace the wild type villin sequence and to reconstitute the villin 5′-end.Transient Expression of cDNAs in CellsThe human HeLa cell line derived from a carcinoma of the cervix and the fibroblast-like CV-1 cells, derived from green monkey kidney (32Jensen F.C. Girardi A.J. Gilden R.V. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under a 10% CO2atmosphere. HeLa and CV-1 cells were transfected using the Ca2+-phosphate DNA precipitation method as described by Matthias and colleagues (33Matthias P.D. Bernard H.U. Scott A. Brady G. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Schütz G. EMBO J. 1982; 2: 1487-1492Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells plated on 3.5-cm dishes were transfected by addition of 5 μg of DNA. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence or for analysis of proteins by immunoblotting 36 h after addition of DNA.ImmunoblottingTransfected HeLa cells plated on 3.5-cm dishes were processed for immunoblotting as described previously (21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One-twentieth of each cell lysate was used for analysis by immunoblotting. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane and antibody incubations were performed according to the method described by Burnette (35Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar). Purified monoclonal antibodies were used as first antibodies (5 μg/ml). Proteins were detected using phosphatase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Fluorescent Labeling of the CellsTransfected CV-1 cells plated on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, detergent permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100, and labeled as described (36Reggio H. Webster P. Louvard D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence staining of villin, cells were incubated with purified monoclonal anti-villin antibodies (5 μg/ml) and then with mouse IgG-specific antibodies conjugated to fluorescein. To visualize F-actin, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (0.3 μg/ml) was added at the same time as the secondary antibodies. In some experiments, cells were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 s prior to fixation and immunostained as described (25Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J.

The bead-bound fusion protein was digested with thrombin (purified from human plasma; Sigma). Thrombin was removed by incubating eluates in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine agarose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins were dialyzed against storage buffer (39Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For longer storage or concentration of proteins, eluates were dialyzed against storage buffer containing 50% glycerol and kept at −20 °C. We used this storage procedure because we noticed that storing villin in liquid nitrogen considerably lowered its bundling activity when compared with freshly prepared protein. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford procedure (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) or by densitometry of Coomassie Blue stained protein bands separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Electron Microscopic Analysis of Bundling and Severing ActivitiesTo test bundling activity, 15 μm G-actin in G buffer was polymerized by addition of 150 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 for 3 h at 20 °C. F-actin and villin proteins were dialyzed against buffer A (5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). F-actin (3 μm) was incubated overnight at 8 °C with wild type villin or villin variants at concentrations indicated under “Results.” To study severing, incubation of 2 μm F-actin and 0.7 μmprotein was performed for 1 min in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2 at 20 °C. Actin filaments were negatively stained by addition of 1% uranyl acetate in acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and observed with an electron microscope on carbon-coated grids.Sedimentation of Protein with F-actinF-actin (3 μm) in buffer A, diluted from a 15 μm stock solution was incubated with 0.7 μmwild type villin or villin variants in the same buffer for 10 min at 20 °C. F-actin was sedimented for 15 min at 30 psi in a Beckman Airfuge or for 15 min at 200,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge. The pellet and the acetone-precipitated proteins of the supernatant were resuspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were quantified by densitometry using VilberLourmat software. The value found for protein cosedimenting with F-actin was corrected for the amount of protein that sedimented in the absence of F-actin. Trapping of soluble proteins in the pellet, as estimated by sedimenting F-actin in the presence of bovine serum albumin (5 μg/50 μl) was negligible under the experimental conditions used.Actin Polymerization or Depolymerization Assays by Fluorescence SpectroscopyFluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature using an SFM25 Kontron Instrument or a Spex FluoroMax fluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was set at 365 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 388 nm with a sample volume of 700 μl.Severing of Actin FilamentsSevering activity of proteins was analyzed by the approach described by Janmey and Matsudaira (13Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin (2 μm, 100% pyrenyl-labeled) was polymerized in F buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol), overnight at 4 °C. F-actin was diluted below the critical concentration of the pointed end (300 nm) into F buffer containing 200 μmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA and incubated with villin or villin variants at concentrations indicated under “Results.” The depolymerization rate has been shown to be proportional to the number of pointed ends and thus to the number of cuts introduced by villin. To compare the severing activity of wild type villin to that of villin variants, we measured the decrease in fluorescence/min in the linear range of the curve as described previously (41Gettemans J. De Ville Y. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2644-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Nucleation of Actin PolymerizationTo test the nucleating activity of villin and villin variants, we measured their effect on the initial phase of actin polymerization. G-actin (2 μm, 50% pyrenyl-labeled) in G buffer containing 20 μmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, depending on the experiment, was preincubated in the presence of villin proteins for 10 min on ice. Polymerization was induced by addition of 150 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2. The increase of fluorescence was measured over time.Capping of Actin FilamentsThe capping activity of villin and villin variants was measured as described by Eichinger and colleagues (42Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preformed unlabeled actin filaments (800 nm) diluted into F buffer from a stock of 3 μm F-actin, were used as “nuclei” for the polymerization of G-actin (6 μm, 33% pyrenyl-labeled). Villin proteins were preincubated with F-actin nuclei in F buffer containing 20 μm CaCl2 or 2 mmEGTA for 10 min on ice. The F-actin-villin mixture was rapidly added to monomeric actin in G buffer containing 20 μmCaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, and polymerization was induced by addition of 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMgCl2. The increase of fluorescence was measured over time.DISCUSSIONVillin is a cell type-specific, multifunctional actin-binding protein that has been proposed to participate in the assembly of the actin core bundle of the intestinal brush border. We analyzed amino acid sequences important for villin-induced growth of microvilli in transfected cells and determined which of the villin in vitro activities are required for its morphogenic effect. We produced for the first time full-length, recombinant villin and villin variants comprising residue replacements. We found that the activity of recombinant human villin was similar to that previously reported for villin purified from tissue. The capacity of villin variants to organize actin filaments into tight bundles in vitro and to bind efficiently to F-actin is closely related to their ability to induce microvilli in cultured cells (TableI). In contrast, nucleation of actin polymerization in vitro is not correlated with induction of microvilli by villin (Table I). Hence, villin may participate in the organization and stabilization of the F-actin core bundle in vivo but most likely does not “nucleate” the microvillar cytoskeleton by stalilizing actin oligomers at the plasma membrane.Table ISummary of the activities of wild type villin and villin variants in transfected cells and in vitroView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of wild type villin, villin core, and variants V1–3+HP, Δ7, and KKEK/KEEE on the cytoskeleton of transfected or microinjected cells have been described previously (21Friederich E.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), because villin core produced from transfected cDNA was unstable (21Friederich E. Huet C. Arpin M. Louvard D. Cell. 1989; 59: 461-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).** Bundles contain loosely arranged actin filaments and electron dense material. Open table in a new tab The V1–3+HP variant comprising the minimal structural information necessary for elongation of microvilli in transfected cells (24Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) does not nucleate actin polymerization in vitro, as compared with wild type villin (Table I). Based on this finding and the observation that villin 44T does not nucleate at low 44T to actin ratios, it is likely that one of the actin monomer-binding sites required for nucleation is located in domains 4–6. In this regard, it is interesting to note that a natural variant of mouse adseverin lacking the fifth repeat of its gelsolin-like core by an alternative splicing event lost specifically its nucleating capacity (44Robbens J. Louahed J. De Pestel K. Van Colen I. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4589-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been shown for the closely related gelsolin polypeptide that not G1–3 but G2-G6 nucleates actin polymerization (45Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 46Sun H.-Q. Wooten D.C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2810-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that the V1+HP variant cosediments with F-actin to a similar extent as wild type villin and bundles actin filaments. This finding suggests that F-actin-binding sites comprised in the first half of the core domain and the headpiece are functional and participate both in bundling. However, because the bundles were less tightly packed than those observed with wild type villin, it is likely that the lack of the second half of the core domain affects the structural organization of the villin domains and may at least partially explain why the activity of this variant in cultured cells is reduced (Ref. 24Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and Table I).The seven carboxyl-terminal residues of the headpiece and particularly the included KKEK motif are essential for villin function in transfected cells (24Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2037342849,"We report the existence of eight different interleukin-15 receptor α-chain (IL-15Rα) transcripts resulting from exon-splicing mechanisms within the IL-15Rα gene. Two main classes of transcripts can be distinguished that do or do not (Δ2 isoforms) contain the exon 2-coding sequence. Both classes were expressed in numerous cell lines and tissues (including peripheral blood lymphocytes) at comparable levels and could be transcribed in COS-7 cells, and the proteins were expressed at the cell surface. Both receptor forms displayed numerous glycosylation states, reflecting differential usage of a single N-glycosylation site as well as extensive O-glycosylations. Whereas IL-15Rα bound IL-15 with high affinity, Δ2IL-15Rα was unable to bind IL-15, thus revealing the indispensable role of the exon 2-encoded domain in cytokine binding. A large proportion of IL-15Rα was expressed at the nuclear membrane with some intranuclear localization, supporting a potential direct action of the IL-15·IL-15Rα complex at the nuclear level. In sharp contrast, Δ2IL-15Rα was found only in the non-nuclear membrane compartments, indicating that the exon 2-encoded domain (which is shown to contain a potential nuclear localization signal) plays an important role in receptor post-translational routing. Together, our data indicate that exon 2 splicing of human IL-15Rα is a natural process that might play regulatory roles at different levels.

Grabstein K.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 483-490PubMed Google Scholar). This redundancy was shown to be due in part to the sharing, within their high affinity receptors, of common transducing subunits, the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) β- and γ-chains (9Giri J.G. Ahdieh M.

Unlike IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, these two α-chains are not members of the hematopoietin receptor family, but instead contain, in their extracellular parts, structural domains previously defined as protein-binding motifs (called the “sushi domain”; also known as the glycoprotein-I motif or short consensus repeat) present in some complement and adhesion molecules (14Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα contains two such domains, whereas IL-15Rα contains only one. In contrast to IL-2Rα, which alone binds IL-2 with low affinity (Kd = 10 nm) (15Greene W.C. Robb R.J. Svetlik P.B. Rusk C.M. Depper J.M. Leonard W.J. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), IL-15Rα on its own binds IL-15 with high affinity (Kd = 10 pm) (13Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. Dubose R. Cosman D. Park L. Anderson D.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ build up a functional receptor of intermediate affinity (Kd = 1 nm) competitively shared by both cytokines, and association of the α-chains leads to the formation of cytokine-specific functional high affinity ternary (αβγ) receptor complexes (Kd = 10 pm) (16Minami Y.

Like IL-15 mRNA, IL-15Rα messages are also expressed in various nonimmune cell types and tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and lung (12Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J.

Anderson D.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), suggesting that the IL-15 system may operate at multiple levels within and beyond the immune system. Accordingly, IL-15 has already been described as an anabolic agent on skeletal muscle (18Quinn L.S. Haugk K.L. Grabstein K.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3669-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and to stimulate intestinal cell proliferation (19Reinecker H.C. MacDermott R.P. Mirau S. Dignass A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1706-1713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). IL-15 also stimulates the proliferation of murine mast cell lines, but this effect is mediated through a novel, as yet unidentified, receptor not involving IL-15Rα or IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ (20Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of IL-15Rα mRNA have been described that result from alternative splicing of exon 3 and/or alternate usage of exon 7 or 7′ (12Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J. Tometsko M. Loomis A. Giri J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Valentine V. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29862-29869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These isoforms are equally capable of binding IL-15. In this paper, we show the existence of a novel type of IL-15Rα mRNA lacking exon 2. The IL-15-binding capacities, intracellular routing, and biochemical features of the IL-15Rα proteins encoded by these different transcripts in COS-7 cells are compared. Total RNA was extracted from various human cell lines and tissues using guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol as described (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from human liver, brain, and small intestine were purchased fromCLONTECH (Basingstoke, United Kingdom). Reverse transcription and PCR amplifications were performed as described previously (22Magrangeas F. Pitiot G. Dubois S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Chérel M. Jobert S. Lebeau B. Lethé B. Mallet J. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16005-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For PCR, the cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C; annealing for 1 min at 66 °C (E1/E7), 68 °C (E1/E7′), 52 °C (E4/p3BGH), 55 °C (β5′/β3′), or 60 °C (5E4.1/E7.2); and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C (30 cycles). The following primers were used: E1, 5′-AGTCCAGCGGTGTCCTGTGG; E7, 5′-TCATAGGTGGTGAGAGCAGT; E7′, 5′-TCAACAGACGCTTCCCACTG; E4, 5′-GAACTCACAGCATCCGCC; p3BGH, 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG; β5′ (sense), 5′-CGTGCTGCTGACCGAGGCC; β3′ (antisense), 5′-TTCGTGGATGCCACAGGAC; 5E4.1, 5′-GCAGCTTCATCTCCCAG; and E7.2, 5′-TAGGTGGTGAGAGC. The four products resulting from RT-PCR using primers E1 and E7 were ligated into the pNoTA/T7 plasmid, leading to pNo15R, pNo15RΔ3, pNo15RΔ2, and pNo15RΔ2Δ3. PCR amplification of pNo15R with primers 5E4.1 (located in exon 4) and E7.2 enabled the elimination of the receptor stop codon. The resulting PCR product was purified and inserted into pNoTA/T7, leading to pNo15R*. Sma I fragments from pNo15R, pNoΔ315R, pNoΔ215R, and pNoΔ2Δ315R were inserted into Sma I-digested and dephosphorylated pNo15R*. The Xba I fragments from each construct were then inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (pcDNA3mh; Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands), yielding pcDNA-15Rmh, pcDNA-Δ315Rmh, pcDNA-Δ215Rmh, and pcDNA-Δ2Δ315Rmh, respectively. The U937 human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, the SAOS-2 human osteogenic sarcoma cell line, and COS-7 monkey kidney epithelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (U937 and SAOS-2 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (COS-7 cells). The Kit 225 human T lymphoma cell line (obtained from Dr. Doreen Cantrell, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 6% fetal calf serum, 5 ng/ml IL-2, and 2 mm glutamine. COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/plate) were transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (23Aruffo A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3313-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of each pcDNA3.1/Myc-His construct. The same plasmids (30 μg) were used to transfect Kit 225 cells by electroporation (220 V, 960 microfarads), and transfectants were selected in culture medium containing 750 μg/ml Geneticin and 5 ng/ml IL-2. Rabbit polyclonal anti-histidine antibody and monoclonal antibody to the c-Myc epitope were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p300 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Biotin-conjugated affinipure goat anti-mouse antibody was from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Cy5-conjugated streptavidin was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity-purified anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments were from BioAtlantic (Nantes, France). Confluent COS-7 cells collected 48 h after transfection were fixed with 50% methanol and 50% acetone at 4 °C for 10 min and incubated with anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h, and with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-histidine antibody (1:200 dilution) and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 for 30 min and analyzed by scanning confocal microscopy (Leica, Rueil-Malmaison, France). COS-7 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). Samples (30 μg of protein) were treated either with 250 milliunits of endoglycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions or with 3 mm neuraminidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) plus 2 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) containing 9 mm CaCl2 and 150 mmNaCl. They were prepared as described previously (22Magrangeas F. Pitiot G. Dubois S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Chérel M. Jobert S. Lebeau B. Lethé B. Mallet J. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16005-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After depletion of nuclei, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) from the membrane fraction (pellet). Nuclei were purified according to a previously described procedure (24Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The nuclear pellet was lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.9) containing 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), the pellet containing nuclear membranes was resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. The protein content of each subcellular fraction was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). For immunoblot analysis, fraction samples (30 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with anti-histidine antibody (1:1000 dilution). Detection of the antibody-antigen complexes was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and exposure to X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.). COS-7 cells were iodinated with 100 μg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) and 0.4 mCi of [125I]iodine for 20 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were made in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, cleared by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-histidine antibody (10 μg) and protein A-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France). Protein A-bound material was eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Iodinated proteins were detected by autoradiography (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Human recombinant IL-15 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was iodinated as described (25Tejedor F. Ballesta J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 127: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with a specific radioactivity of ∼2000 cpm/fmol. Binding experiments were carried out for 75 min at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin as described previously (26Francois C. Sorel M. Cherel M. Brailly H. Minvielle S. Blanchard D. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using 106 cells/well and increasing concentrations of labeled IL-15 in a final volume of 50 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled cytokine. Regression analysis of the binding data was accomplished using a one-site equilibrium binding equation (Grafit, Erithacus Software, Staines, UK). IL-15Rα and Δ2IL-15Rα solubilized from transfected COS-7 cells as described above were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (QIAGEN Inc., Courtaboeuf, France) affinity chromatography (27Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6337-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IL-15Rα content of each preparation was analyzed by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (26Francois C. Sorel M. Cherel M. Brailly H. Minvielle S. Blanchard D. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), in which anti-Myc antibody (0.5 μg/well) was used as coating antibody and the combination of anti-histidine antibody (0.5 μg/well) plus peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution; BioAtlantic) was used as indicator. Purified receptors were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin with labeled IL-15 (2 nm) and 8 μg/ml anti-histidine antibody in a final volume of 25 μl. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added (25 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C. Centrifugation through a layer of dibutyl phthalate (87.5%) and paraffin oil (12.5%) allowed separation of protein A-bound immunocomplexes (pellet) from unbound reactants (supernatant), and the radioactivity associated which each fraction was determined. Transfected Kit 225 cells were washed twice to remove IL-2 or IL-15 and starved for 1 h in RPMI 1640 medium with 6% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were then plated (5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured for 48 h in culture medium containing 750 μg/ml Geneticin and supplemented with increasing concentrations of IL-2 or IL-15. They were pulsed for 6 h with 4 μCi of [3H]thymidine and harvested onto Whatman filters. Cell-associated [3H]thymidine was measured using a Microbeta counter (Wallack, Turku, Finland). Different IL-15Rα isoforms using alternate C-terminal exons (exons 7 and 7′) and containing or not exon 3 have already been described (Fig. 1) (12Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J. Tometsko M. Loomis A. Giri J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Valentine V. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29862-29869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the N-terminal end of exon 1 (primer E1) and the C-terminal end of exon 7 (primer E7) or 7′ (primer E7′), RT-PCR amplifications were carried out on mRNAs prepared from different cell lines and tissues (Fig.2). For each couple of primers (E1/E7 or E1/E7′), four amplification products were detected. The products from the E1/E7 amplification carried out on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cloned and sequenced. The two upper bands (834 and 735 bp) corresponded to full-length IL-15Rα and IL-15Rα lacking exon 3 (Δ3IL-15Rα), respectively. The two lower bands corresponded to two new mRNA species, one lacking exon 2 (641 bp; Δ2IL-15Rα) and one lacking both exons 2 and 3 (542 bp; Δ2Δ3IL-15Rα). Sequence analysis showed that exon 2 and/or exon 3 deletions did not change the reading frame (data not shown). The four products obtained from E1/E7′ amplification had sizes that were ∼100 bp lower than those obtained from the E1/E7 amplification, suggesting that they corresponded to similar IL-15Rα isoforms (full-length, Δ3, Δ2, and Δ2Δ3), but using the alternate exon 7′, which is 100 bp shorter than exon 7 (12Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J. Tometsko M. Loomis A. Giri J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Valentine V. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol.

The structures of the coding sequences of the eight mRNA isoforms are shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2Detection of eight distinct IL-15Rα transcripts. RT-PCR analysis of IL-15Rα was performed on different human tissues (A) and cell lines (B) as indicated using either primer pair E1/E7 (lanes 1) or primer pair E1/E7′ (lanes 2).Lane M shows the 100-bp DNA ladder.

FBM, fetal bone marrow; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These eight isoforms were detected in most of the cell lines and tissues examined (Fig. 2), except fetal bone marrow and the choriocarcinoma JAR cell line. The respective expression levels of the different isoforms varied from one cell/tissue type to another. Whereas, in most cases, the full-length and Δ3 isoforms appeared to predominate, the mRNAs corresponding to the Δ2 and Δ2Δ3 forms were as abundant as the others in a number of cell types (Kit 225 lymphoma cells and SAOS-2 osteocarcinoma cells) and even more in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The eight isoforms were also expressed by normal human T cell clones, either CD4+ or CD8+ (data not shown). The different IL-15Rα Myc/polyhistidine-tagged cDNA isoforms were transfected in COS-7 cells, and the expression products were analyzed by Western blotting on whole cell extracts (Fig.3 A). With the IL-15Rα cDNA (E7 isoform), two doublets of bands were revealed (best seen in panel c) at 59–62 and 39–41 kDa. Treatment with N-glycosidase induced a disappearance of the 62- and 41-kDa bands, leaving the 59- and 39-kDa bands unaffected, whereas treatment with O-glycosidase induced a disappearance of the 59- and 62-kDa bands, but not of the 39- and 41-kDa bands. Together, these results suggest that the 62- and 41-kDa bands are N-glycosylated forms of the 59- and 39-kDa bands, respectively, and that the 59–62-kDa bands are highly O-glycosylated forms of the 39–41-kDa bands. In the case of Δ2IL-15Rα, similar results were observed. The lower band at 32.5 kDa corresponds to an unglycosylated form of the receptor. Its size is ∼7 kDa lower than the corresponding 39-kDa band of IL-15Rα, in agreement with the deletion of the exon 2-encoded domain (12Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J. Tometsko M. Loomis A. Giri J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Valentine V. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29862-29869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The band at 35 kDa represents Δ2IL-15Rα with a carbohydrate linked to the single N-glycosylation site present in IL-15Rα and retained in Δ2IL-15Rα, whereas bands at 54–57 kDa correspond to O-glycosylated forms of the 32.5–35-kDa bands. Some material at ∼40 kDa was also observed with variable intensities and might represent intermediate states of glycosylation. The localization of the receptor was first analyzed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, IL-15Rα (in green) was mainly found associated with the nuclear membrane, giving a ring-like pattern. By comparison, localization of the nuclear protein p300 (in red) was purely intranuclear. There was also some co-localization of IL-15Rα and p300 (in yellow), suggesting that part of the receptor was localized at the inner side of the nuclear membrane and/or in the intranuclear space. Δ2IL-15Rα behaved very differently, with an expression pattern suggesting localization within the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and cytoplasmic vesicles, but not with the nuclear membrane or intranuclear space. Accordingly, it did not co-localize with p300. Other experiments (data not shown) indicated that exon 3 deletion had no influence on the localization of the receptor: Δ3IL-15Rα and Δ2Δ3IL-15Rα showed patterns similar to those of IL-15Rα and Δ2IL-15Rα, respectively. To support these observations, Western blot analyses were carried out on subcellular fractions prepared by biochemical means (Fig.3 B). In the membrane fraction prepared from isolated nuclei, IL-15Rα was expressed at a much higher level than the Δ2 isoform. Conversely, Δ2IL-15Rα was predominant in the membrane fraction prepared after depletion of nuclei (non-nuclear membrane fraction), and in comparison, IL-15Rα was expressed at a much lower level in that fraction. Both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the receptors were observed. Examination of the cytosolic extracts did not show detectable expression of either receptor form (data not shown). Confocal microscopy did not reveal detectable expression of IL-15Rα or Δ2IL-15Rα at the plasma membrane. However, this could be due to low cell-surface receptor density as often observed with cytokine receptors. To analyze this point further, cells were externally labeled with [125I]iodine before lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-histidine antibody (Fig. 3 C). Specific bands at 62 and 53 kDa were precipitated from IL-15Rα-transfected cells and a specific band at 48 kDa from Δ2IL-15Rα-transfected cells, indicating that both receptor isoforms are routed to the plasma membrane and exposed at the cell surface as glycosylated proteins. To evaluate the function of the sushi domain encoded by exon 2, we first analyzed the binding of radioiodinated IL-15 to transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 5 A). Mock-transfected COS-7 cells did not bind IL-15, whereas cells transfected with IL-15Rα expressed ∼1200 high affinity receptors (Kd = 60 pm). COS-7 cells transfected with the Δ2 isoform did not show any detectable specific IL-15 binding. As far as both receptors were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 3 C), these results suggested a loss of IL-15-binding capacity as a result of exon 2 deletion. To rule out the possibility that a low expression level of Δ2IL-15Rα as compared with that of IL-15Rα at the cell surface could account for the absence of detectable cytokine binding, IL-15Rα and Δ2IL-15Rα were solubilized from transfected COS-7 cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and their IL-15-binding capacities were assessed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-Myc antibody as coating antibody and anti-histidine antibody as tracer antibody showed similar receptor contents for the two preparations (Fig.5 B). Immunoprecipitation of the iodinated IL-15·receptor complex with anti-histidine antibody and protein A (Fig. 5 C) revealed dose-dependent binding of IL-15 to IL-15Rα, whereas no IL-15 binding was found when using Δ2IL-15Rα. IL-15·IL-15Rα complex formation was competed out with unlabeled IL-15 (Fig. 5 D). The half-maximal effect was obtained with an IL-15 concentration of ∼100 pm, indicating that solubilized IL-15Rα retained a high affinity similar to that measured on intact cells. To investigate potential regulatory effects, IL-15Rα and Δ2IL-15Rα (E7 forms) cDNAs were transfected in the human T lymphoma cell line Kit 225. RT-PCR using the E4/p3BGH primer pair showed that the c"

The family was defined as VTC (Vacuolar TransporterChaperon) and it contains four genes in the S. cerevisiae genome. Inactivation of one of them, VTC1, in the background of V-ATPase null mutations resulted in svf phenotype manifested by growth at pH 7.5. Deletion of the VTC1 gene (ΔVTC1) results in a reduced amount of V-ATPase in the vacuolar membrane. These mutant cells fail to accumulate quinacrine into their vacuoles, but they are able to grow at pH 7.5. The VTC1 null mutant also results in a reduced amount of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Pma1p) in membrane preparations and possibly mis-targeting.

Disruption of each of the single-copy genes yields a similar phenotype in which cells cannot grow at a pH higher than 7 and are sensitive to low and high calcium or metal ion concentrations in the medium (5Nelson H.

Mutant S. cerevisiae (yeast) cells can survive the lack of acidification that results from disruption of genes encoding V-ATPase subunits by taking up acidic external fluid via endocytosis (5Nelson H.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However the precise metabolic junction that prevents growth of V-ATPase null mutants at high pH is not known. Moreover the location of the vital acidic compartment in the vacuolar system is not apparent. Indirect evidence indicates that the vital acidic compartment is not the yeast vacuole (13Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We use suppressor mutants to pinpoint the cellular structures and metabolic pathways that are involved in the expression of the V-ATPase null mutation phenotype. Initial studies with null mutants showed very clearly that each of the V-ATPase subunits is required for the proper assembly of the holoenzyme (14Beltrán C. Kopecky J. Pan Y.-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 774-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, all the Vo subunits are required for assembly of the V1 sector onto the membrane. The proteolipid (Vma3p) plays a central role in V-ATPase assembly, and none of the remaining Vo subunits assemble in its absence (5Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,15Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

The only exception is subunit F (Vma7p), which is considered to be a V1 constituent, but a null mutation in its gene disrupts not only the assembly of V1 but also the assembly of Vo (17Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biogenesis of V-ATPase in S. cerevisiae cells involves several parallel steps starting in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytoplasm (11Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Phys. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A. Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) 272, 26787–26793Google Scholar). Partial complexes of V1 subunits can be formed in the cytoplasm in the absence of an assembled Vo domain (16Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J.

Using a native gel electrophoresis system that allows a fine resolution of cytosolic V-ATPase complexes, a major cytosolic V1 complex (complex II, 576 kDa) was detected in wild type as well as in ΔVMA3 and ΔVMA5 strains. Strains having mutations in genes encoding the Vmap, Vma2p, Vma4p, Vma7p, or Vma8p V1 subunits fail to assemble this complex, although large, intermediate-sized complexes were sometimes detected (20Ho M.N.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several newly discovered genes encode proteins that are not a part of the Vo complex but affect its assembly (18Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A. Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) 272, 26787–26793Google Scholar, 22Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ho M.N. Ohya Y. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 961-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hill K.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22329-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Vma21p is a particularly interesting integral membrane protein of 9.5 kDa (23Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is required for the assembly of the V0 sector. Moreover, the unassembled Vph1p is rapidly degraded in the mutant lacking Vma21p. The 21-kDa Vma22 protein is also an ER-localized protein required for V-ATPase assembly (18Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A. Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) 272, 26787–26793Google Scholar). As with Vma21p, the absence of Vma22p results in degradation of Vphlp and prevents the assembly of V1 onto the membrane. The association of Vma22p with the ER is itself dependent on another assembly factor Vmal2p (25 kDa). Again, mutants defective in Vmal2p have low levels of Vo subunits in the vacuole membrane and fail to assemble the peripheral sector (18Tomashek, J. J., Graham, L. A. Hutchins, M. U., Stevens, T. H., and Klionsky, D. J. (1997) 272, 26787–26793Google Scholar, 23Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Vo assembles in the ER and is subsequently moved to other locations within the cell. In the absence of correct assembly, the integral membrane domain may be degraded at the ER level. So far most of the assembly factors of V-ATPase were shown to be necessary for its assembly. It is likely that additional factors will function in the correct distribution of V-ATPase and other membrane proteins. Inactivation of such factors will not give the phenotype of the V-ATPase null mutations but should impair the physiological function of the membrane complexes governed by these assembly factors. In this paper, we report on a novel gene family that function in the distribution of membrane proteins. The genes were namedvacuolar transporter chaperons (VTC). The “wild-type” that was used is S. cerevisiae W303 (MATaα trp1 ade2 his3 leu2 ura3). The other strains used in this work are: ΔVTC1 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 VTC1::URA3); ΔVTC2 (MATα ade2 his3 trp1 ura3 VTC2::LEU2); ΔVTC2 (MATα ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 VTC2::HIS3); ΔVTC3 (MATα ade2 his3 trp1 ura3 VTC3::LEU2); ΔVTC4 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 VTC4::TRP1); ΔVTC2+3 (MATα ade2 trp1 ura3 VTC2::HIS3 VTC3::LEU2); ΔVMA1 (MATα ade2 his3 trp1 ura3 VMA1::LEU2); ΔVMA3 (MATα ade2 trp1 ura3 his3 VMA3::LEU2); ΔVMA3 (MATa ade2 trp1 ura3 his3 VMA3::LEU2); ΔVMA3 (MATα ade2 trp1 leu2 his3 VMA3::URA3); ΔVMA3 (MATa ade2 trp1 leu2 his3 VMA3::URA3); ΔVMA4 (MATα ade2 trp1 ura3 his3 VMA4::LEU2); ΔVMA5 (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 VMA5::LEU2); ΔVMA7 (MATα ade2 trp1 leu2 his3 VMA7::URA3); ΔVMA8 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 VMA8::URA3); ΔVMA10 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 VMA10::URA3); ΔVMA11 (MATa ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 VMA11::URA3); and ΔVMA16 (MATa ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 VMA16::URA3). The cells were grown in a YPD medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, and 2% dextrose. The medium was buffered by 50 mm Mes and 50 mm MOPS, and the pH was adjusted by NaOH (5Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 10Noumi T. Beltr‡n C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Agar plates were prepared by adding 2% agar to the YPD buffer medium at the given pH. Yeast transformation was performed as described previously (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformed cells were grown on minimal plates containing a 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, 2% agar, and the appropriate nutritional requirements. In most experiments, 0.1% casamino acids were added to the minimal plates. Mating of cells was performed with MATα and MATa strains that were grown overnight in YPD. 0.1 ml of each strain were incubated together overnight, spread on selective plates, and the grown colony cells were checked by mating type-specific PCR probes for their ploidy. The diploid cells were washed with water, and the cells were grown in 10 ml of SPM medium containing 3 g/liter potassium acetate and 0.2 g/liter raffinose. Tetrads were dissected in a dissection microscope as described previously (26Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). An S. cerevisiae mutant, bearing disruption or deletion mutation in genes encoding different V-ATPase subunits, were grown on 1.2 OD at 600 nm in buffered YPD medium (pH 5.5). The cells were harvested, suspended in water at a cell density of 2 OD at 600 nm, and treated at 30 °C with 10 μl/ml ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) for 60 min. The treated cells were washed with 5% sodium thiosulfate, followed by a washing in water, and resuspended in a minimal medium at a cell density of 2 OD at 600 nm. The treated cells were plated on buffered YPD medium (pH 7.5). The treatment resulted in 50–80% viability as judged by growing diluted samples before and after the treatment on YPD plates (pH 5.5). The number of svf colonies grown at pH 7.5 versus pH 5.5 was recorded as the mutation rate for V-ATPase-independent growth at the high pH. The minimal amount of complementation groups involved in the svf phenotype was estimated as follows: 10 svf mutants of VMA8::URA3 Mat α were crossed with 7 svf mutants of VMA8::LEU2 Mat a to give 70 diploid strains that grew on minimal plates without uracil and leucine. The diploid strains were analyzed for growth on YPD plates buffered at pH 7.5. Similarly, 9 svf mutants VMA10::URA3 Mat α and 9 svf mutants VMA10::LEU2 Mat a were crossed, and the resulting diploid strains were analyzed for growth at pH 7.5. The gene knockout of the new strains was performed as follows: Whole or part of the target gene was replaced by a selectable marker (URA3, TRP1, LEU2, or HIS4), leaving flanking DNA sequences of about 0.3 kilobase pairs. When PCR was used for the construct, the DNA fragments were cloned into the TA plasmid of pGEM-T Easy (Promega). For the disruption, we cut the plasmid with the appropriate restriction enzymes and transformed the yeast strains with the plasmid DNA as described previously (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strains were grown on minimal medium in the absence of the auxotrophic marker. Colonies that grew on the selective medium were selected, checked by PCR for homologous recombination, and analyzed for their phenotype. VTC1 containing 0.3-kilobase pair-flanking sequences was cloned by PCR into YPN2 plasmid (10Noumi T. Beltr‡n C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ΔVTC1 was obtained by the introduction of URA3 to replace most of the reading frame starting at amino acid 1 and ending at 129. Similarly VTC2, VTC3, and VTC4 were cloned by PCR and introduced to the respective YPN2 plasmid. Disruptant mutants were obtained as described for ΔVTC1 except that VTC2 was interrupted by LEU2 or HIS4, VTC3 by LEU2, and VTC4 by TRP1. Yeast transformation was performed either by the method of Ito et al. (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by a bench-top method according to Elble (27Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD medium (pH 5.5) to stationary phase. The cells were centrifuged for 10 s in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm. 10 μl of salmon sperm (10 mg/ml) were added to the pellet as a DNA carrier. Then about 1 μg of the plasmid or the DNA construct was added. Finally, the pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of PLATE medium containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 40% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m lithium acetate. The suspension was incubated overnight at room temperature and plated on the appropriate plates (10Noumi T. Beltr‡n C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in a selective medium or YPD to stationary phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 2 min at 2,500 rpm. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of STET solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 50 mm EDTA, 5% Triton X-100, and 8% sucrose. Glass beads (about 0.2 g) were added, and the suspension was vortexed for 20 min. Then, an additional 100 μl of STET were added, and the mixture was boiled for 3 min, cooled for 1 min on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. 100 μl were removed from the supernatant and 50 μl of 7.5 m ammonium acetate were added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h in −20 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. 100 μl of the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube, 200 μl of cold ethanol were added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris and 1 mmEDTA (pH 8). For preparation of vacuoles, cells were grown in YPD medium adjusted to pH 5.5 by HCl and harvested at cell density of about 0.8 OD units at 600 nm. Vacuolar membranes were prepared according to Uchida et al. (28Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the homogenization buffer contained no magnesium, and the vacuoles were washed only once with the EDTA buffer. ATP-dependent proton uptake activity was assayed by following the absorbency changes of acridine orange at 490–540 nm as described previously (29Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-ml reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7), 150 mm KCl, and 15 μm acridine orange. Isolated yeast vacuoles containing 10 to 30 μg were added to the reaction mixture followed by 10 μl of 0.1 m MgATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 1 mm carbonyl cyanide p- (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. A polyclonal antibody against Vtc4p antibodies was obtained by the injection into rabbits of a chimeric protein containing the maltose-binding protein and the hydrophilic sequence of amino acids 53–220 of Vtc4p. The DNA fragment coding to these amino acids was amplified by PCR with introduced Eco RI and Hin dIII restriction sites. The DNA was cloned in frame to the maltose-binding protein in the plasmid PMAL-C (New England Biolab). Following transformation and sequence verification, 500 ml of bacterial culture was grown to OD 0.5 at 600 nm, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g. The cells were broken by French press, and the protein was purified by using a column containing maltose-agarose. The fractions containing the chimeric protein were dissociated by SDS, loaded on preparative gel, and electrophoresed. The gel was briefly stained by Coomassie Blue, the identified protein band was cut out, and the fusion protein was electroeluted. About 0.25 mg of the fusion protein was injected into rabbits as described previously. Antibody to Pma1p was also raised in rabbits using the purified protein that was electroeluted from polyacrylamide gels (30Nelson N. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 5l0-523Google Scholar, 31Koland J.G. Hammes G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monospecificity of the antibody was verified by V-8 partial digestion of Pma1p followed by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (30Nelson N. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 5l0-523Google Scholar). This antibody was previously used in various laboratories (see Refs. 32Holcomb C.L. Hansen W.J. Echeverry T. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholarand 33Brada D. Schekman R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2775-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody detection system (ECL) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Western blots were performed according to the protocol of the ECL antibody detection system from Amersham. Samples were denatured by SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide mini gels (Bio-Rad) as described previously (34Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrotransfer at 0.5 Ampere for 15 min, the nitrocellulose filters were blocked for 1 h in a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature at a dilution of 1 to 1,000 in a similar solution containing dry milk at only 2%. Following five washes in the same solution, peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or protein A was added to the filters. After 30 min of incubation and five washes with the same solution, the nitrocellulose filters were subjected to the ECL amplification procedure. The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 5–30 s. Yeast cells were grown in 500 ml of YPD medium (pH 5.5) to OD 1 at 600 nm. The suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed with 200 ml of water, and again with 1 m sorbitol. The cell wall was digested by 2.5 units of zymolyase in a 10-ml solution containing 10 mm Hepes pH 7.5 and 1 m sorbitol. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the suspension was centrifuged in 15-ml Corex tubes at 3,000 × g for 5 min. 1 ml of glass beads were added to the pellet as well as 1 ml solution containing 30 mm MOPS pH 7, 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. The suspension was vortexed five times for 30 s with incubation on ice for 30 s in between. The solution was removed from the glass beads and placed in a new Corex tube. An additional 2 ml of the above solution was added to the tube with the glass beads and the tube was vortexed briefly. The suspension was added to the previous one and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to give a pellet containing the cell debris and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 0.3 to 0.5 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m sorbitol and stored as the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min and the pellet was suspended in 0.3–0.5 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol, and stored as the membrane fraction at −80 °C. The supernatant was stored as the fraction containing soluble proteins. Sucrose gradients were also used to estimate the relative density of various membrane fractions. The gradients was made as described in Lupashin et al. (35Lupashin V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. McNew J. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2659-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) except that gradients of 20% to 60% sucrose were used and the centrifugation was for 14 h. Yeast cells were grown in 5 ml of YPD to OD 0.8 at 600 nm. The cells where cooled on ice for 5 min, and 1 ml of the cells sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl YPD containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) and 200 μm freshly prepared quinacrine. The suspension was incubated 5–10 min at 30 °C and cooled on ice for 5 min. The cells were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml 100 mm of Hepes (7.6), 2% glucose. The cells were washed twice with the same cold buffer, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of the same solution. 4 μl of the cell suspension was mixed on the microscope slide with 4 μl of 0.5% low melting agarose that is kept at about 45 °C and covered with a glass coverslip. Accumulation of quinacrine into the vacuoles was followed by fluorescence microscopy with excitation at 423 nm and emission through a filter of 503 nm maximal transmission. Preliminary experiments showed a sporadic growth of V-ATPase null mutants on YPD plates buffered at pH 7.5 (36Perzov N. Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson H. Nelson N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 185-194Google Scholar). Following EMS treatment, many more colonies were able to grow under the same conditions. Because the V-ATPase null mutants are constructed by the deletion of most of the reading frames of their genes, it is unlikely that the EMS treatment revived the V-ATPase and proton pumping activity of the enzyme (36Perzov N. Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson H. Nelson N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 185-194Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments with quinacrine uptake by these mutants and ATP-dependent proton uptake into isolated vacuoles demonstrated that their V-ATPase is not active (36Perzov N. Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson H. Nelson N. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 185-194Google Scholar). The mutants were denoted as svf mutants (suppressor of V-ATPase function). The large number of colonies that grew at pH 7.5 after EMS treatment suggests a big complex with multiple subunits as the target for mutagenesis. Fig. 1 shows that svf are recessive mutations. A VMA3::URA3 (svf3) mutant that can grow at pH 7.5 was crossed with the original VMA3::URA3 null mutant that could not grow at pH 7.5. Diploid strains of V-ATPase null mutants that carried the wild-type and svf alleles were not able to grow on buffered plates at pH 7.5. It is likely, but not necessary, that the mutagenesis results in the inactivation of a protein that is part of a large complex. The minimal number of complementation groups was estimated by crossing the two mating types of svf mutants of ΔVMA8 as well as ΔVMA10. Six of 62 diploid strains of ΔVMA8 grew at pH 7.5, and 3 of 81 diploid strains of ΔVMA10 grew at pH 7.5. This experiment indicates that several complementation groups are involved in the generation of svf mutants, suggesting the involvement of several gene products in rendering the V-ATPase null mutants insensitive to high pH. Therefore, the mutation obtained by the EMS treatment inactivated a protein complex, which resulted in growth at pH 7.5 even when the V-ATPase was totally inactive. The presence of one intact copy of the same gene in diploid cells reversed the phenomenon and resulted in growth arrest on a medium buffered at pH 7.5. Because V-ATPase is composed of several subunits, we examined the frequency of svf in various V-ATPase null mutants in which different genes encoding subunits of the enzyme were interrupted. As depicted in Table I, EMS treatment of V-ATPase null mutants in which genes encoding subunits A, D, and E of the catalytic sector were interrupted gave raise to higher numbers of svf mutants. Similar treatment of V-ATPase null mutants in membrane sector subunits resulted in much lower frequency of svf. This also includes a V1 (catalytic sector) subunit (Vma7p) that was shown to be necessary for the assembly of the membrane sector Vo (8Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Dev.

We report that PTP-1B and its yeast analog, YPTP, are phosphorylated and activated by members of the CLK family of dual specificity kinases.

While serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins is a common post-translational modification, only a small proportion of proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Protein-tyrosine kinases, which include many growth factor receptors, are important regulators of cellular responses (1Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Denhardt D.T. Biochem J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Tyrosine phosphorylation may directly regulate enzyme activity, or it may direct the formation of large signaling complexes, which are essential for the transduction of signals throughout the cell. The levels of cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation are governed by the combined actions of the tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. While the regulation of cellular tyrosine kinases has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the regulation of tyrosine phosphatases. Interestingly, like tyrosine kinases, the activity of tyrosine phosphatases is subject to regulation by both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation (5Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza Jr., B.R.

Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While the regulation of PTP-1B activity in cells is poorly understood, it is known that phosphorylation of PTP-1B varies with the cell cycle and following treatment of cells with various stimuli, such as EGF,1 okadaic acid, and phorbol esters (5Flint A.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2957-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vivo the phosphorylation of PTP-1B occurs on serine and tyrosine residues. In response to EGF stimulation of A431 cells, PTP-1B is phosphorylated at Tyr66 by the EGF receptor, which leads to a 3-fold activation of PTP-1B (15Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence that PTP-1B phosphatase activity is regulated by serine phosphorylation is mounting. Treatment of cells with cAMP analogs or okadaic acid resulted in the serine phosphorylation of PTP-1B and a 4-fold stimulation of PTP-1B phosphatase activity (14Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified several serine phosphorylation sites within the C-terminal regulatory domain of PTP-1B (5Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza Jr., B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, phosphorylation at these sites does not lead to alterations in phosphatase activity. Therefore, it is likely that heretofore unrecognized phosphorylation sites within the catalytic domain of PTP-1B exist, and that these sites are important for the in vivo regulation of PTP-1B phosphatase activity. The CLK family kinases are an evolutionarily conserved group of dual specificity kinases, capable of phosphorylating protein substrates on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The prototypic CLK family kinase member, CLK1, was initially identified through its ability to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues (17Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Howell B.W. Afar D.E. Lew J. Douville E.M. Icely P.L. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The family includes members from diverse species, including yeast, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, tobacco, mouse, rat, and human. The biological functions of this family of proteins have remained elusive, but may play an important and evolutionarily conserved role in signal transduction within the cell. A critical role for the CLK family in development has been suggested by work on the Drosophila CLK homologue, DOA. Flies expressing low levels of the mutant DOA protein show marked neurologic abnormalities, and homozygosity for the DOA null allele is embryonically lethal (19Yun B. Farkas R. Lee K. Rabinow L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1160-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent work on the murine CLK1 protein has begun to shed light on other physiological roles of the CLK family of kinases. Regulation of mRNA splicing is now recognized as a dynamic process, and one in which the CLK family of kinases may have an important function. CLK1 has been reported to bind to and phosphorylate serine/arginine-rich mRNA splicing factors on physiologically relevant sites in vitro (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 21Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Caceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.D. J. Biol.

Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 22Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of CLK1 in COS cells leads to the subcellular redistribution of serine/arginine-rich proteins, and to alterations in mRNA splicing in vivo. Collectively, these data strongly suggest a role for the CLK family kinases in the regulation of mRNA splicing in vivo. The CLK family kinases may also participate in intracellular signal transduction cascades. Myers et al. (23Myers M.P. Murphy M.B. Landreth G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6954-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of CLK1 in the pheochromocytoma PC-12 cell line led to differentiation of these cells. Moreover, specific signal transduction intermediates were activated in these cells, including ERK1/2 and pp90Rsk. Furthermore, immunocytochemical staining of 3T3 cells expressing human CLK3 demonstrated that the majority of immunoreactivity was present within the cytoplasm, and was less abundant in the nucleus. 2H. Menegay, F. Moeslein, and G. Landreth, submitted for publication.Similarly, staining of endogenous CLK1 in PC12 cells found it to be mostly cytoplasmic as well. In agreement with a putative signaling role for the CLK kinases is the finding that ethylene stimulation of tobacco leaves stimulates the activity of the tobacco CLK family member, PK12 (24Sessa G. Raz V. Savaldi S. Fluhr R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2223-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These finding strongly suggest the existence of cytoplasmic targets for the CLK family kinases and their participation in intracellular signaling pathways. We report here that PTP-1B and a yeast analog, YPTP1, are in vitro substrates for both CLK1 and CLK2. Moreover, phosphorylation of these two phosphatases by CLK1/CLK2 leads to their enzymatic activation in vitro. We have mapped the activation site within the catalytic domain of PTP-1B and show that it is important both for basal activity as well as enzymatic activation of PTP-1B. Furthermore, we show that co-expression of CLK1/CLK2 with PTP-1B leads to activation of PTP-1B in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis of hPTP-1B or YPTP1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction using 4-primer mutagenesis (25Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli strain was used as the host strain during mutagenesis. Two of the primers were anchored in the pGEX-KG sequence flanking the multi-cloning site: right primer, 5′-TCCGGTTCCCAACGATCAAGGCGAG; left primer, 5′-CCCAATGTGCCTGGATGCGTTCCC. Primers overlapping the sites of mutagenesis were designed as follows, locations of the mutations are underlined: S50A Sense, 5′ -CCTAAGAACAAAAACCGAAATAGGTACAGAGACGGCGCCCCC; S50A Antisense, 5′-CCGACTATGGTCAAAGGGGGCGCCGTCTCTGTACC; S50T Sense, 5′-CCTAAGAACAAAAACCGAAATAGGTACAGAGACGTGACACCC; S50T Antisense, 5′-CCGACTATGGTCAAAGGGTGTCACGTCTCTGTACC; S242A Sense, 5′-GCTGATGGACAAGAGGAAAGACCCTGCAGCGGTTG; S242A Antisense, 5′-CTAACAGCACTTTCTTGATATCAACCGCTGCAGGGTC; S242T Sense, 5′-GCTGATGGACAAGAGGAAAGACCCTACTACGGTTG; S242T Antisense, 5′-CTAACAGCACTTTCTTGATATCAACCGTAGTAGGGTC; S83A Sense, 5′-GATTACATTAACGCGGCGTATGTCAAAGTG; S83A Antisense, 5′-CACTTTGACATACGCCGCGTTAATGTAATC; C252S Sense, 5′-CATTATCGTACACTCTTCCGCAGGCGTGGG; C252S Antisense, 5′-CCCACGCCTGCGGAAGAGTGTACGATAATG. Following polymerase chain reaction, the full-length proteins were digested with Bam HI and Sal I and sub-cloned into pGEXKG or in pEBG. Proteins were expressed in the BL21 E. coli strain as GST fusion proteins. The cDNAs for the catalytic domains of mCLK1 and hCLK2, and full-length S50A-PTP1B, S50T-PTP1B, WT-PTP1B, S242A-PTP1B, S242T-PTP1B, and S50A/S242A-PTP1B were subcloned into the pGEXKG vector at the Bam HI/Sal I sites. Cultures were grown at 25 °C for 16 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) was added, and the cultures were further incubated at 25 °C for 8 h. Following lysis in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton), the GST fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads. The GST-tagged proteins were then eluted from the beads in Elution Buffer (30% ethylene glycol, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm glutathione), and stored at −20 °C. HEK 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression constructs were introduced into HEK293 cells (3 × 106 cells) by electroporation using an Invitrogen Electroporator II apparatus. The cells were harvested 48–60 h later in cold Lysis Buffer, and sonicated using a Kontes model ASI sonicator. After centrifugation, the GST fusion proteins were recovered from the supernatants either using glutathione-Sepharose beads or by immunoprecipitation using anti-PTP1B antibodies. Proteins were suspended in Laemmli Sample Buffer (10% glycerol, 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.15 m Tris, pH 6.8) resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBS-Tween (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The membranes were first probed with anti-PTP-1B antibodies (FG6–1G, Calbiochem) in 2% BSA/TBS-Tween and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 2% dried milk/TBS-Tween. The bound proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce Super Signal chemiluminescent reagents). Bacterially expressed recombinant CLK protein was incubated with substrates in Kinase Reaction Buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μmATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2). For assays requiring 32P incorporation, the Kinase Reaction Buffer was supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min and were stopped by the addition of 3× Laemmli Sample Buffer, or diluted in Phosphatase Reaction Buffer and phosphatase activity monitored. The activity of YPTP1 and PTP-1B were assayed by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol phosphate (PNPP). The phosphatases were incubated in Phosphatase Reaction Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PNPP) for 2–20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 0.2 n NaOH, and the absorbance at 410 nm was measured. The reactions were run in triplicate. The activity of PTP-1B was also assayed using radiolabeled tyrosine-phosphorylated MBP as a substrate. The MBP was radiolabeled by incubation with the tyrosine kinase GST-FER in Kinase Reaction Buffer. The phosphatases were incubated in Assay Buffer (25 mmHepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) plus the indicated concentrations of the tyrosine-phosphorylated MBP for 2–5 min. The assays were stopped in Charcoal Stop Mix (30% charcoal, 6% diatomaceous earth, 0.9 m HCl, 90 mm NaPPO4, 2 mm NaPO4). Liberated phosphate in the supernatants was determined by Cerenkov counting using a Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. Radiolabeled phosphatases were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. The protein bands were excised from the membrane and subjected to acid hydrolysis as described by Kamps (26Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled proteins were proteolytically digested as described by Luo et al. (27Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M.

The 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were resolved in one-dimension using Tricine-SDS-electrophoresis essentially as described by Schagger and von Jagow (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The protocol was modified by use of 24% acrylamide separation gels. The gels were run at 100 mV for 18 h at 4 °C. The gels were immediately dried and the phosphopeptides visualized by autoradiography. The32P-labeled phosphopeptides were resolved in the first dimension by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 on TLC plates as described (29Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The plates were dried, and then subjected to ascending chromatography in the second dimension using a buffer composed of isobutanol, pyridine, acetic acid, and water (75:15:50:60). The plates were dried, and the phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. In experiments initially designed to test the phosphorylation dependence of CLK1 activity in vitro, we observed that when PTP-1B was incubated with CLK1, PTP-1B became highly phosphorylated. We subsequently found that recombinant, constitutively active CLK1 or CLK2 phosphorylated PTP-1B (Fig.1 A) in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylated PTP-1B exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 1 B). In order to determine whether CLK phosphorylation altered PTP-1B activity, the phosphatase was preincubated in the presence or absence of either CLK1 or CLK2 for 20 min in vitro. Subsequent in vitro phosphatase assays demonstrated an approximate 5-fold activation of phosphatase activity of CLK1 or CLK2-treated PTP-1B (Fig.2 A). Incubation of PTP-1B with increasing amounts of CLK protein led to a corresponding increase in activation of PTP-1B (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that phosphorylation of PTP-1B by CLK1 and CLK2 activates the phosphatase.Figure 2CLK1 and CLK2 activate PTP-1B in vitro. A, Recombinant PTP-1B (0.1 μg) was preincubated in the absence or presence of (2 μg) constitutively active CLK1 or CLK2 in vitro for 20 min in kinase reaction buffer. The PTP-1B or CLK1 or CLK2 was diluted in phosphatase reaction buffer and incubated another 2 min. Phosphatase activity was assayed by liberation of the PNPP cleavage product quantitated at OD410 by spectrophotometry. B, a constant amount of recombinant PTP-1B (0.1 μg) was preincubated in vitro with increasing amounts of constitutively active CLK1 or CLK2, or BSA for 20 min. In vitro phosphatase reactions were then performed using PNPP as a substrate for PTP-1B. The results shown are the average (± S.D.) of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of PTP-1B was utilized to investigate which serine residues CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylated in vitro. The phosphopeptide maps demonstrate that CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylated PTP-1B at similar sites, as evidenced by the detection of identical phosphopeptides (Fig.3). Examination of the primary sequence of PTP-1B revealed multiple sites conforming to the CLK family consensus phosphorylation sequence (R/K-X-R/K-X-R/K-X-S-X-X-R). 3F. M. Moeslein, M. P. Myers, and G. E. Landreth, unpublished data.These data and the size of the phosphopeptides allowed identification of Ser50 as a likely site of CLK phosphorylation. Substitution of an alanine at the Ser50 site (S50A) by site-directed mutagenesis diminished CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylation of PTP-1B by approximately 90%, indicating that this was the principal site of phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). To further establish that this residue was phosphorylated, we generated a threonine substitution at Ser50 (S50T). Following incubation of the S50T PTP-1B mutant with CLK1 or CLK2, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed the presence of phosphothreonine residues on the S50T mutant (Fig.4 B). Substitution of threonine for serine slightly decreases the affinity of the CLKs for this site compared with the native enzyme, as evidenced by the presence of equal amounts of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine on the S50T mutants. Moreover, proteolytic maps of the S50T mutant show increased phosphorylation on other phosphopeptides (see below), as well as on the phosphopeptide containing Thr50 (data not shown). We conclude that both CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylate PTP-1B principally at Ser50.Figure 4CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylate Ser50and Ser242/Ser243 on PTP-1B. Equal amounts of bacterially expressed wild-type, S50T, and S50A PTP-1B proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by either bacterially expressed CLK1 or CLK2. A, the 32P-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (top panel) or Coomassie staining (lower panel). The open arrowheads indicate the position of the CLK autophosphorylation band. The solid arrowheads indicate the position of the PTP-1B protein.B, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on CLK1- or CLK2-phosphorylated S50T PTP-1B or CLK1-phosphorylated S242T/S243T PTP-1B. The phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis on TLC plates and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of phosphoserine (pSer), phosphothreonine (pThr), and phosphotyrosine (pTyr) were determined by ninhydrin staining of phosphoamino acid standards. The positions of partially hydrolyzed phosphopeptides are indicated (pPEP).C, equal amounts of bacterially expressed wild-type or S50A/S242A/S243A (AAA) PTP-1B proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by either bacterially expressed CLK1 or CLK2. The32P-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The open arrowhead indicates the position of the CLK autophosphorylation band, and the solid arrowhead indicates the position of PTP-1B (as identified by Coomassie staining of the gels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The S50A mutant was phosphorylated by CLK1 and CLK2, albeit at lower levels than the wild-type enzyme, suggesting the existence of additional CLK phosphorylation sites on PTP-1B. Phosphopeptide maps of S50A mutants phosphorylated by CLK1 and CLK2 were consistent with Ser242 or Ser243 as the second site of CLK phosphorylation on PTP-1B. Substitution of alanine at positions 242/243 only modestly diminishes CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylation of PTP-1B (data not shown). Moreover, CLK2 poorly phosphorylates, and CLK1 does not phosphorylate the triple mutant, S50A/S242A/S243A PTP-1B (Fig.4 C). Following incubation with CLK1 or CLK2, phosphoamino acid analysis on the S242T/S243T PTP-1B mutant revealed phosphothreonine residues (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). These data show that, although CLK1 and CLK2 directly phosphorylate PTP-1B on both Ser50 and Ser242/Ser243, the preferred CLK phosphorylation site is Ser50, as it is preferentially phosphorylated at an approximate ratio of 9:1 over the Ser242/Ser243 site. We tested whether the mutation of Ser50 affected the phosphatase activity of PTP-1B. The basal activities of the wild-type, S50T, and S50A PTP-1B proteins were analyzed using in vitro phosphatase assays. The S50A mutants have significantly diminished basal phosphatase activity toward the PNPP substrate, compared with the wild-type enzyme, while the S50T mutants have wild-type level phosphatase activity (Fig. 5). CLK1 and CLK2 activated the phosphatase activity of S50T and wild-type PTP-1B in vitro (Fig. 6). However, the S50A mutant was resistant to activation by either CLK1 or CLK2 (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that Ser50 is the phosphorylation site on PTP-1B responsible for CLK-induced stimulation of phosphatase activity.Figure 6Ser50 is important for CLK1 and CLK2 activation of PTP-1B. Equal amounts of S50A, S50T, S242A/S243A, S242T/S243T, and wild-type PTP-1B proteins (0.1 μg) were preincubated in the presence of 4 μg of CLK1, CLK2, or BSA (control) for 20 min at room temperature. The PTP-1B proteins were then diluted in phosphatase assay buffer and incubated another 2 min. The PNPP cleavage product was quantitated spectrophotometrically. The results shown are the average (± S.D.) of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine whether the CLKs could activate PTP-1B toward a protein substrate, wild-type PTP-1B, the S50A mutant, and activated PTP-1B were assayed using tyrosine-phosphorylated MBP as a substrate. CLK2 phosphorylated PTP-1B exhibited a 3-fold increase in activity relative to the wild-type PTP-1B (Fig.7). Furthermore, the S50A mutant possessed approximately 20% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. Phosphorylation of PTP-1B by CLK2 led to a decrease in the Km by 3-fold (TableI). Interestingly, substitution of alanine for Ser50 led to 5-fold increase in the Km over wild-type; however, the Vmax for the S50A mutant was roughly half that of the wild-type enzyme. The change in the Km of the PTP-1B for substrate following phosphorylation by the CLKs is consistent with the observed increase in activity of PTP-1B for protein and synthetic substrates. The changes observed in the S50A mutant are concordant with the view that Ser50 is an important determinant of the substrate binding pocket conformation. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of PTP-1B at Ser50enhances substrate binding to the enzyme.Table IKinetic analysis of PTP-1B proteinsProteinKmVmaxμmnm/min/ngWild-type PTP-1B110.18 ± 0.01Wild-type + CLK22.90.19 ± 0.02S50A mutant530.08 ± 0.01Recombinant wild-type or mutant (S50A) PTP-1B(5 ng) were incubated with32P-radiolabeled MBP (10–500 pmol).

Vmax and Km were determined by Lineweaver-Burke analysis. The effect of CLK1 and CLK2 on PTP-1B in vivo was investigated by overexpressing these proteins in HEK293 cells. GST-tagged full-length CLK1 or CLK2 were co-transfected with GST-tagged PTP-1B into HEK293 cells. Glutathione-Sepharose was used to precipitate the tagged proteins from the transfected cells. In vitro phosphatase assays were performed on the precipitated proteins. Co-expression of CLK1 with PTP-1B activated PTP-1B 2-fold in vivo (Fig.8). Similar results have been obtained by co-expression of CLK2 with PTP-1B (data not shown). In a series of similar experiments, we co-expressed CLK1 or CLK2 with untagged-PTP-1B in NIH 3T3 cells and observed a 2–3-fold increase in phosphatase activity in immunoprecipitates of PTP-1B (data not shown). The 2-fold activation of PTP-1B in vivo by CLK1 is significantly lower than that observed in vitro. However, this is likely a consequence of the lower enzymatic activity of the full-length CLK1, relative to the constitutively active, truncated CLK1 employed in the in vitro studies. These data demonstrate that PTP-1B is regulated by the CLK family kinases in vivo as well as in vitro. We investigated whether the CLKs could also activate other phosphatases related to PTP-1B. Yeast protein-tyrosine phosphatase, YPTP1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae PTP-1B analog (30Guan K.L. Deschenes R.J. Qiu H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12964-12970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was phosphorylated and enzymatically activated in vitro by CLK1 and CLK2 (Figs. 9 A and10). We therefore investigated which residues on YPTP1 the CLKs phosphorylated. We used the CLK consensus phosphorylation sequence to search the aligned sequences of YPTP1 and PTP-1B for potential phosphorylation sites. In YPTP1, Ser83was found to closely conform to the consensus phosphorylation site of CLK1. This serine residue was mutated to alanine (S83A YPTP1) to test whether this serine was phosphorylated by the CLKs. We also substituted a serine for the invariant catalytic cysteine, Cys252, creating a catalytically inactive YPTP1 mutant (C252S YPTP1). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was performed on CLK1 phosphorylated wild-type, S83A, and C252S YPTP1. The tryptic maps of YPTP1 and C252S YPTP1 produced several major phosphopeptides and a number of minor phosphopeptides (Fig. 9 B). Importantly, the tryptic map of S83A YPTP1 showed the specific loss of a single phosphopeptide (Fig. 9 B). A peptide map was produced from a mixture of all three phosphorylated forms of YPTP1 (wild-type, S83A, and C252S YPTP1), indicating that identical sites were phosphorylated in all thee forms of YPTP1 (Fig. 9 B). The loss of a single phosphopeptide in the S83A mutant demonstrates that Ser83was phosphorylated by CLK1. The identities of the other major phosphorylation sites on YPTP1 are currently unknown.Figure 10YPTP1 mutated at Ser83 is resistant to CLK1-mediated activation. The phosphatase activity of wild-type (WT), S83A, and C252A YPTP1 after incubation in the absence or presence of CLK1 was tested. Wild-type YPTP1, S83A YPTP1, or a catalytically inactive form of YPTP1, C252S YPTP1, were incubated in the presence or absence of CLK1 for 20 min and then assayed for phosphatase activity using PNPP as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested whether substitution of an alanine at Ser83 would effect the phosphatase activity of YPTP1.In vitro phosphatase assays were performed on YPTP1 proteins that had been incubated in the absence or presence of CLK1. Mutation of Ser83 to alanine resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in the basal activity of YPTP1 (Fig. 10). Moreover, S83A YPTP1 proteins are resistant to activation by CLK1 in vitro (Fig. 10). We conclude from these data that CLK phosphorylation of YPTP1 at Ser83 activates the phosphatase activity of YPTP1. The CLK family kinases were initially identified on the basis of their ability to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues. Subsequent analysis of the CLK kinases showed them to be members of the growing class of kinases termed dual-specificity kinases, capable of phosphorylating substrates on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Work from several laboratories has suggested an important role for the CLK kinases in regulation of mRNA splicing in vivo (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Arabidopsis CLK family member AFC1 is capable of regulating transcription in vivo (32Bender J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12105-12109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated that the majority of cellular CLK protein is located in the cytoplasm,2 suggesting the existence of non-nuclear targets for the CLK kinases. Moreover, a role for the CLK family kinases in signaling cascades has been suggested by several findings. Overexpression of CLK1 in PC12 cells caused the differentiation of these cells into a neuronal phenotype (23Myers M.P. Murphy M.B. Landreth G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6954-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Analysis of these cells showed that CLK1 expression activated elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, including ERK1/ERK2 and pp90Rsk. Although CLK1 caused the activation of the ERKs and pp90Rsk, the mechanism through which CLK stimulated these activities is unclear, as we have ruled out direct phosphorylation of these molecules by CLK1 (data not shown). We report here the identification of a direct non-nuclear target of the CLKs, the tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-1B. Serendipitously, in the course of studying CLK1 activation in vitro, it was noted that CLK1 was capable of phosphorylating PTP-1B in vitro. We have subsequently demonstrated that both CLK1 and CLK2 are capable of activating PTP-1B in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, a yeast PTP-1B family member, YPTP1, was also phosphorylated and activated by CLK1 and CLK2 in vitro. PTP-1B has been shown to be one of the major tyrosine phosphatase activities within cells (14Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Its activity and phosphorylation varies with the cell cycle and following stimulation with various cellular stimuli. However, the exact role of PTP-1B in the cell is not understood. Identified cellular targets for PTP-1B include the activated EGF receptor, the insulin receptor, and several integrins, suggesting that PTP-1B acts within cells to antagonize receptor driven signaling pathways (33Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Biochem. 1998; 182: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). PTP-1B activity is at least partially controlled by regulation of intracellular compartmentalization, as it is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by its C-terminal regulatory domain (37Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Moreover, prolonged treatment of HeLa cells with insulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate leads to the alternative splicing of the PTP-1B mRNA, giving rise to a C-terminally truncated protein (38Shifrin V.I. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25376-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This C-terminal truncation may be important in altering the subcellular localization of the enzyme. However, it is now apparent that phosphorylation of PTP-1B can directly control levels of activity of this phosphatase. PTP-1B activity is stimulated following EGF stimulation of A431 cells and phorbol ester treatment of HeLa cells (14Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PTP-1B appears to be regulated by multiple signaling pathways, as evidenced by discrete phosphorylation events following a variety of cellular stimuli. Treatment of cells with cAMP analogs leads to elevation in PTP-1B activity by 4-fold, while EGF stimulation of A431 cells leads to a 3-fold stimulation of phosphatase activity. However, these mechanisms drive this elevation in PTP-1B differentially, as cAMP promotes serine phosphorylation of PTP-1B while EGF stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP-1B, suggesting the existence of multiple activating phosphorylation sites within the catalytic domain of PTP-1B. The first identified activating phosphorylation site on PTP-1B was Tyr66, which is directly phosphorylated by the EGF receptor (15Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, many cellular stimuli which activate PTP-1B lead only to serine phosphorylation of the enzyme, suggesting that an important regulatory serine phosphorylation site exists (5Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza Jr., B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The previously identified sites of serine phosphorylation have been localized to the C-terminal regulatory domain of PTP-1B. Significantly, phosphorylation at these C-terminal sites has not been demonstrated to be responsible for enzyme activation, suggesting that the activating phosphorylation sites may lie within the catalytic domain (5Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza Jr., B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We observed that the phosphorylation of PTP-1B by CLK1 or CLK2 led to an approximately 5-fold stimulation of phosphatase activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that these enzymes phosphorylated PTP-1B on serine residues only. We determined that CLK1 and CLK2 phosphorylate PTP-1B on two sites within the catalytic domain, Ser50 and Ser242/Ser243. Mutagenesis of Ser242/Ser243 did not alter phosphatase activity nor did it affect the ability of CLK1 or CLK2 to activate PTP-1B, indicating this is not a regulatory phosphorylation site. However, substitution of an alanine at Ser50significantly reduced the basal level of phosphatase activity of PTP-1B and the mutant phosphatase no longer activable by CLK1 or CLK2. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser50 is responsible for the observed activation of PTP-1B by CLK1 and CLK2. Analysis of crystallographic data has shown that Ser50 lies near the substrate-binding pocket of PTP-1B (39Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sarmiento et al. (40Sarmiento M. Zhao Y. Gordon S.J. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26368-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the three residues most responsible for determining the substrate specificity of PTP-1B are Tyr46, Arg47, and Asp48. The authors showed that mutation of these residues altered the Km of these mutant enzymes. The dramatically reduced catalytic activity of the Ala50 mutant is consistent with the premise that the Ser50 residue is important for appropriate conformation of the substrate-binding pocket. Phosphorylation of this site may alter the characteristics of the binding pocket, and thereby lead to the activation of the phosphatase by shifting the binding pocket into a more open (active) state. Consistent with this hypothesis is the localization of Tyr66 in this same area of the protein. Moreover, alignment of YPTP1 with PTP-1B shows that the activating phosphorylation at Ser83 is also in this same region of the phosphatase molecule. Thus, there may be a general effect of phosphorylation near the substrate-binding pocket that serves to activate the PTP-1B family of phosphatases. Importantly, co-expression of CLK1 or CLK2 with PTP-1B in HEK293 cells stimulated the phosphatase activity 2–3-fold over basal levels. This study demonstrates that the CLK family kinases regulate cellular phosphatases. We thank Drs. Steven Hanks for his gift of the hCLK2 clone, John Bell for supplying the mCLK1 clone, and Nick Tonks for the GST-FER construct.

Members of the Giα subfamily of these proteins, particularly Goα and Giα1, constitute roughly 1% of brain membrane protein, yet the only known effectors for Goα, the three Giα proteins, and Gzα are certain isoforms of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (1Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We have thus attempted to detect novel effectors that lie downstream of selected G protein α subunits, initially by utilizing 32P-labeled α subunits activated (essentially irreversibly) with GTPγS to probe cDNA expression libraries. We have taken advantage of the fact that Gzα can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C at a site near its amino terminus that does not interfere with interaction between Gzα and adenylyl cyclase (3Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have also appended a site for phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to the carboxyl terminus of Goα; this region of G protein α subunits is also not involved in interactions with known effectors. This strategy led to isolation of a novel cDNA, initially designated Z-16, and detection of a homolog, KIAA0514. The protein products of these cDNAs interact selectively with GTPγS- or GDP-AlF4−-bound forms of Giα subfamily members in vitro, and they cause extension of neurites in Neuro2a cells when coexpressed with activated forms of Goα. We thus tentatively refer to these two proteins as (GRIN1) (Z-16) and GRIN2 (KIAA0514) (G protein-regulated inducer ofneurite outgrowth). Gzα and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) were purified using a recombinant baculovirus-Sf9 cell expression system as described previously (2Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Activated Gzα was then phosphorylated with PKCα (4 μg) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 0.125 mmCaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 μm[γ-32P]ATP (40,000 cpm/pmol), and 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine-diolein (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Tagged Goα (600 μg) was similarly activated with GTPγS and phosphorylated with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (3 μg) at 30 °C for 30 min as described by Baude et al. (4Baude E.J. Dignam S.S. Olsen S.R. Reimann E.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2316-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After phosphorylation, free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration (PD-10 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer A (20 mm NaHepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% C12E10 (polyoxyethlene 10-lauryl ether), 1 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the proteins were used as probes for screening cDNA expression libraries. Candidate effector proteins were sought in a λEXlox library from 16-day mouse embryo cDNA (Novagen) with BL21/DE3 as the host E. coli strain. Approximately 1 × 106 clones were screened using phosphorylated Gzα as a probe. Phage were plated at a density of 3–5 × 104 per 150-mm plate and incubated at 37 °C for 7 h. The plates were overlaid with Hybond-C filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been saturated with 10 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. They were further incubated at 37 °C for 3.5 h to induce expression of proteins encoded by cDNAs. The filters were then rinsed with Buffer A at room temperature and blocked with Buffer A containing 5% dry milk at 4 °C overnight. The filters were probed with 50 nm phosphorylated GTPγS-bound Gzα in Buffer A with 5% dry milk for 4 h at 4 °C. The filters were washed three times with Buffer A for 5 min at 4 °C, air dried, and exposed to film at −70 °C for 2 days. Secondary and tertiary screens were carried out under identical conditions. Two clones, Z-13 and Z-16, were isolated and cDNA inserts were sequenced. Z-13 had a 0.8-kb insert encoding mouse nucleobindin (7Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Z-16 had a 1.8-kb insert encoding 273 amino acid residues of previously undescribed sequence. To obtain a full-length Z-16 cDNA, a mouse brain λgt11 library (generously provided by Dr. Melvin Simon, California Institute of Technology) was screened by plaque hybridization using a fragment from the 5′ end of the initial Z-16 clone as a probe. An additional 0.8 kb of coding sequence was isolated; the reading frame was open throughout. Two rounds of 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions were then performed with a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH), using oligonucleotides based on sequences at the 5′ end of the Z-16 cDNA. The final Z-16 cDNA contains an ATG codon that agrees well with Kozak's translation initiation criteria and an in-frame, upstream stop codon. A related cDNA clone, designated KIAA0514 (8Nagese T. ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was identified in public data bases and was generously supplied by Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). Northern blots of RNA from various tissues or brain regions (CLONTECH) were probed with GRIN1 (Z-16) or GRIN2 (KIAA0514) cDNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dATP (random primer labeling; Stratagene, Prime-it II). Blots were hybridized with probe (5 × 106 cpm/ml) in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 2 h. The blots were then washed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 45 min at room temperature, followed by a high stringency wash with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C. Then, the blots were finally subjected to phosphorimaging analysis (TR2040S imaging plates and BAS1500 scanner, Fuji Medical System). Two peptides were synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of GRIN1: P1 (550SSAQPQRDTRSIGSLPER567) and P2 (747EVEVLGMAIQKHLERQIE764); these peptides also included an additional cysteine residue at their amino termini and a tyrosine residue at their carboxyl termini. The cysteine residue was utilized to facilitate cross-linking of peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Antisera were produced in New Zealand White rabbits. Antisera T116 and T114 were generated against peptides P1 and P2, respectively. The specificities of the antisera were confirmed by immunoblotting. An antiserum specific for Goα (U1901) was generated in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of Goα (94EYGDKERKADSKMVC108) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Other rabbit polyclonal antisera against various Gα subunits have been described previously (2Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GRIN1 and GRIN2 were subcloned into the pFastBacHTb vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant baculoviruses encoding His6-GRIN1 or His6-GRIN2 were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding His6-GRIN1 or His6-GRIN2 were prepared and extracted with 1% C12E10. His6-GRIN1 and His6-GRIN2 were then purified from these extracts using Ni-NTA chromatography. The proteins were further purified by Mono Q and Superdex 200 column chromatography in 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% C12E10. Hexa-histidine-tagged GRIN1 or GRIN2 purified from SF9 cells (1.5 μg) was mixed with 2 μg (500 nm) of recombinant Goα or Gzα bound with GDP, GTPγS, or GDP-AlF4−, as indicated, in 100 μl of Buffer B (50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% C12E10) and incubated on ice for 30 min. NaF (10 mm) and AlCl3 (30 μm) were included in the buffer to prepare Gα-GDP-AlF4−. Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) was equilibrated with Buffer B, and 25 μl was added to the mixture of proteins, followed by further incubation on ice for 5 min. The resin was collected by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved as the flow-through fraction. The resin was washed twice with 150 μl of Buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. NaF and AlCl3 were included in the wash buffer when they were present initially. The resin was finally eluted twice with 50 μl of Buffer B containing 200 mmimidazole. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE. An expression vector for GRIN1 was constructed by adding a FLAG tag at the amino terminus of GRIN1 by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning the resultant GRIN1 cDNA (Kpn I-Hin dIII fragment, 3.6 kb) into the pCMV5 vector. For GRIN2, a FLAG tag or a hexahistidine tag was added at the amino terminus, and the resultant cDNA (Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment, 1.4 kb) was subcloned into pCMV5. Simian kidney COS-M6 cells, simian renal epithelium MA104 cells, and murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with appropriate expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lysates were fractionated into particulate and soluble fractions as described (13Mumby S.M. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Muntz K.H. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Circulation. 1992; 86: I-764Google Scholar). A crude membrane fraction of COS cells expressing FLAG-tagged GRIN1 was extracted with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% C12E10supplemented with fresh protease inhibitors). The extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with 200 nm G protein α subunits either in the presence or absence of 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 for 10 min on ice, mixed (50 μg of protein) with 5 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (3 mg/ml; Eastman Kodak Co.) in a total volume of 50 μl, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Fixed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (5 μl of a 10% suspension; Pansorbin, Calbiochem) were added and incubated on ice for an additional 1 h. The extracts were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, and the precipitates were suspended in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The suspensions were layered over 0.9 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20% sucrose (w/v) and centrifuged for 6 min. The pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Subcellular fractionation of adult mouse brain was performed based on the procedure described in Ref. 15Suman T. Cervato-Franco G. Poli S. Basic Appl. Histochem. 1980; 24: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar. Mouse brain was homogenized in Buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 11% sucrose with protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 11,700 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in Buffer C and loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10–40%) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 2 h. Fractions at the interfaces of the gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting. Plasma membrane is concentrated at the 25–30% sucrose interface. Subcellular fractions of embryonic mouse brain were obtained as described (16Pfenninger K.H. Johnson E.L. Friedman L.B. Somio S.L. Cell. 1983; 35: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Simkowitz P. Elis L. Pfenninger K.H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1004-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect endogenous GRIN1, Neuro2a cells were plated on laminin-coated coverslips at 50% confluency and grown for 2 days to generate neurites. For transient transfection, Neuro2a cells were plated on nontreated coverslips at 60–70% confluency and allowed to grow for 1 day. Cells were then transfected with expression plasmids and incubated for 48 h. Transfected MA104 or Neuro2a cells were rinsed and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 6 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 20 min, and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glycine on ice for 5 min. Cells were permealized in buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) or cold 100% methanol for 10 min. Cells were then incubated in 5% goat serum in buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 for 1 h, followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight with Goα monoclonal antibody (mAb2A, 1:50 dilution), anti-GRIN1 antibody (T116, 1:300 dilution), or GAP43 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:100 dilution). After washing, coverslips were incubated with fluorescent, conjugated secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml; Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed twice with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and twice with water, and then air-dried for 30 min before mounting with Fluoromount G. Phosphorylated GTPγS-Gzα was utilized to screen a mouse embryo λEXlox expression library. Two clones, designated Z-13 and Z-16, were eventually isolated based on clearly positive signals in several successive screens. The product of the Z-13 cDNA bound GDP-Gzα and GTPγS-Gzα equally well, whereas the product of the Z-16 cDNA bound GTPγS-Gzα selectively (Fig.1). Sequencing and data base searches revealed that Z-13 encoded the protein nucleobindin. Interactions of Giα2 with nucleobindin have been detected previously (18Mochizuki N. Hibi M. Kanai Y. Insel P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nucleobindin is described as a secreted protein that interacts with DNA (7Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We did not pursue nucleobindin further because of these characteristics and its failure to recognize GTPγS-bound Gzα selectively. The protein product of the Z-16 cDNA also bound to phosphorylated protein kinase A-tagged, GTPγS-bound Goα. Sequencing of the 1800-base pair insert designated Z-16 revealed that it had an open reading frame encoding 273 amino acid residues fused to the T7 gene 10 product, as anticipated. The sequence was incomplete at the 5′-end. An apparently full-length cDNA was obtained by screening a mouse brain cDNA library and by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, using a 5′-stretch of randomly primed brain cDNA library (Fig. 2 A). The deduced amino acid sequence specifies a protein containing 827 residues, with Mr = 84,700. Nearly 45% of the residues have small side chains: Ala (11%), Gly (9.8%), Pro (10.5%), and Ser (13.4%). Data base searches revealed that KIAA0514, a cDNA clone isolated from a human brain cDNA library, and Z-16 encode homologous ∼100–150 amino acid residue domains near their carboxyl termini (Fig. 2 B). No other matches or homologies were detected, except for a few previously unidentified Z-16 expressed sequence tags (AI427420, W54141, and AI413422). In addition, related genes were not detected by Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA (data not shown). Because of the functional properties of the proteins encoded by the Z-16 and KIAA0514 cDNAs (described below), we refer to these two proteins as GRIN1 and GRIN2, respectively. Northern blot analysis of GRIN1 was performed using several regions of the cDNA as probes. Messenger RNA for GRIN1 (about 4 kb) was detected in brain but not in heart, liver, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, or testis (Fig.3 A). GRIN1 mRNA is widely distributed in the central nervous system; the highest concentration was detected in the spinal cord (Fig. 3 B). Messenger RNA for GRIN2, which is about 8 kb, is also specifically expressed in brain. In contrast to GRIN1, expression of GRIN2 was only detected in cerebellum (Fig. 3 B). Two antibodies specific for GRIN1 (designated T114 and T116) were prepared using GRIN1 peptides as immunogens. In lysates of COS cells transfected with GRIN1 cDNA, both antibodies detected an immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000. Consistent with the results of Northern analysis, this 110-kDa band was also detected in mouse brain homogenates but not in homogenates of other tissues (Fig. 3 C). The appearance of GRIN1 as a doublet band in brain lysate may reflect proteolysis during sample preparation, or it may indicate the existence of splice variants of the protein. This immunoreactive band was not detected if antisera were first incubated with peptides used as immunogens or with expressed GRIN1 protein (data not shown). We thus conclude that this band represents GRIN1 protein and that the protein migrates anomalously during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Among several cell lines tested, endogenous GRIN1 was detected in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (see Fig. 5 B) and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells as a doublet similar to its appearance in brain lysate (data not shown). The peptide used to generate antibody T114 shares 13 amino acid residues (of 18) with GRIN2. This antibody, but not T116, recognized the GRIN2 product expressed in COS or Sf9 cells (data not shown). GRIN2 (461 amino acid residues) has a calculated molecular weight of 47,600 but migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 during SDS-PAGE. Baculoviruses encoding full-length GRIN1 or GRIN2 (with hexahistidine tags at the amino terminus) were generated, and recombinant GRIN1 or GRIN2 protein was purified from Sf9 cells using Ni-NTA, Mono-Q, and Superdex 200 column chromatography. Purified GRIN1 or GRIN2 was mixed with 500 nm Goα or Gzα bound with either GDP, GDP-AlF4−, or GTPγS, and interactions were analyzed by co-elution from Ni-NTA columns (Fig.4 A). Both GRIN1 and GRIN2 interacted with the GTPγS- or GDP-AlF4−-bound form of Goα and Gzα; interactions with the GDP-bound forms of these two proteins were not detected. Interactions between GRIN1 and various Gα proteins were also examined using full-length Flag-tagged GRIN1 expressed in COS cells. Detergent extracts containing GRIN1 were then mixed with G protein α subunits, and complexes were precipitated with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B). Specific interactions were detected between GRIN1 and members of the Gi subfamily of Gα subunits, including Goα, Gzα, and Giα1. A weak interaction was detected with G12α, but none was observed with Gqα or Gsα. Again, GRIN1 interacted preferentially with the GTPγS or the GDP-AlF4−-bound forms of the Gα proteins compared with the GDP-bound proteins. The subcellular distribution of GRIN1 was first examined in transfected COS cells. Exogenously expressed GRIN1 and Goα were largely confined to the particulate fractions, and only small amounts appeared in the cytosol (Fig.5 A). Similarly, endogenous GRIN1 and Goα in Neuro2a cells and brain are predominantly membrane-bound (Fig. 5, B and C). The amino acid sequence of GRIN1 contains no obvious hydrophobic domain sufficient to explain membrane localization. There are also no consensus sequences for covalent modification by myristoylation or prenylation. Co-localization of GRIN1 and Goα in Neuro2a cells was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence. Neuro2a cells were induced to extend neurites by culture on laminin-coated dishes. Permeabilized cells were then incubated with both rabbit polyclonal anti-GRIN1 antibodies (T116) and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Goα (mAb2A). Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies to detect GRIN1 and Goα, respectively. The specificity of observed fluorescence was confirmed by competition with the immunogenic peptide or GRIN1 protein (data not shown). The pattern of immunofluorescence for GRIN1 and Goα in differentiated Neuro2a cells is similar, and the two proteins are predominantly found at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, D–F). Goα and GAP43 are enriched in growth cone membranes (19Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Growth cone membrane fractions were prepared as described by Pfenninger et al. (16Pfenninger K.H. Johnson E.L. Friedman L.B. Somio S.L. Cell. 1983; 35: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and Simkowitz et al. (17Simkowitz P. Elis L. Pfenninger K.H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1004-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting using GRIN1 antisera. Fig.6 A shows that GRIN1 is highly enriched in the growth cone membrane fraction (lane 4), as are GAP43 and Goα. By contrast, Gzα and the low-affinity NGF receptor are found in all membrane fractions. Furthermore, immunofluorescence of differentiated Neuro2a cells shows that GRIN1 and GAP43 are concentrated in putative growth cone membranes (Fig. 6, B–D, arrows). GRIN1 or GRIN2 was cotransfected into MA104 (simian renal epithelium) cells with either wild type Goα or a constitutively active (GTPase-deficient) mutant of the protein (Goα Q205L), and the transfected cells were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.7 A, MA104 cells transfected with only wild type Goα, GoαQ205L, or GRIN1 had a relatively unperturbed morphology. However, cells spread irregularly on coverslips and generated many fine, neurite-like processes if they were cotransfected with GRIN1 and GoαQ205L. This effect was much less apparent if wild type Goα was expressed with GRIN1. Expression of GRIN2 alone caused extension of processes in some cells, and co-transfection of Goα or GoαQ205L increased both the frequency and extent of these changes. Similar experiments were performed with Neuro2a cells (Fig. 7, B and C). Again, co-transfection of GRIN1 or GRIN2 with GoαQ205L caused long neurites to appear. In addition, these neurites displayed many hair-like processes. Co-transfection of GRIN1 or GRIN2 with wild type Goα caused less extensive changes. In contrast to MA104 cells, expression of GoαQ205L alone induced formation of neurites, albeit with lower efficiency. This effect is perhaps explained by the endogenous content of GRIN1 in Neuro2a cells. These results indicate that Goα and GRIN1 interact (directly or indirectly) in vivo and that this causes formation and extension of neurite-like processes. Similar effects of GoαQ205L have been described in PC12 cells (20Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. Zhu X.-P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We screened a mouse embryo cDNA expression library to search for proteins capable of interacting with phosphorylated GTPγS-Gzα. Two clones were isolated, designated Z-13 and Z-16. Z-13 encoded nucleobindin, the interactions of which with Giα2 were detected previously using a yeast two-hybrid screen (18Mochizuki N. Hibi M. Kanai Y. Insel P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We did not pursue this lead further because of the apparently similar affinity of GDP-Gzα and GTPγS-Gzα for nucleobindin and the presence of a signal sequence in the protein. By contrast, the protein now designated GRIN1 interacts preferentially with activated forms of G protein subunits in the Giα subfamily (Giα, Goα, Gzα). Furthermore, GRIN1 is specifically expressed in brain and shares with Goα substantial enrichment in membranes from neuronal growth cones. We thus hypothesize that GRIN1 may function as a downstream effector for Goα. A homolog of GRIN1-GRIN2 (KIAA0514), was isolated and sequenced previously as a newly identified brain cDNA by Nagase et al. (8Nagese T. ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The regions of GRIN1 and GRIN2 that are similar are at the carboxyl termini of both proteins, and we had shown independently that this is the Goα-binding domain of GRIN1 (data not shown). Significantly, GRIN2 also interacts preferentially with activated members of the Gi subfamily of G protein α subunits. Although GRIN1 is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, GRIN2 is apparently restricted to the cerebellum. Goα is the most abundant G protein α subunit in mammals. It is expressed predominantly in brain and is enriched in neural growth cones (19Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Despite these interesting properties, physiological roles for Goα have not been identified, other than its interactions with G protein βγ subunits and appropriate receptors. The heterotrimeric Go protein is responsible for receptor-mediated inhibition of voltage-sensitive N-type or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in presynaptic nerve terminals, but this effect appears to be mediated by the G protein βγ subunit complex (21Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Goα is a weak inhibitor of some isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (1Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of this is difficult to evaluate. Goα has also been hypothesized to regulate neurite extension. Binding of GTPγS to Goα is stimulated by GAP43 (neuromodulin), an abundant growth cone protein that is important for neural pathfinding (19Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The expression of both GAP43 and Goα starts in brain regions when differentiated neurons begin to extend neurites (22Schmidt C.J. Zubiaur M. Valenzuela D. Neer E.J. Drager U.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of constitutively activated mutant forms of Goα stimulates neurite outgrowth in neuronal cell lines (20Strittmatter S.M. Fishman M.C. Zhu X.-P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2327-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for this phenomenon has not been defined. We have shown herein that either GRIN1 or GRIN2 induces extensive outgrowth of neurites from Neuro2a cells when coexpressed with activated forms of Goα. This result implies interaction between proteins in vivo, although not necessarily a direct one. However, the fact that Goα does interact directly with both GRIN1 and GRIN2 in vitro suggests that these latter proteins may function physiologically as downstream targets for Goα and/or other members of the Giα subfamily to regulate neurite outgrowth. The amino acid sequences of GRIN1 and GRIN2 show no significant homology with known kinases, enzymes that generate second messengers, or other identified effectors for G protein action. Although GRIN1 has a proline-rich domain (residues 590–710), we detected no other provocative signatures. Recent evidence suggests that Rho family GTPases are important components of signaling pathways that control axonal growth and guidance (23Luo L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Rho itself is involved in collapse of growth cones and retraction of neurites. By contrast, Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate the formation and advance of growth cones through formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (24Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that Cdc42 or Rac1 are downstream components of signaling pathways that include Goα and GRIN1 or GRIN2.

Ethanol also induces translocation of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA to the nucleus; RI and Cβ are not translocated. Nuclear PKA activity in ethanol-treated cells is no longer regulated by cAMP. Gel filtration and immunoprecipitation analysis confirm that ethanol blocks the reassociation of Cα with RII but does not induce dissociation of these subunits. Ethanol also reduces inhibition of Cα by the PKA inhibitor PKI. Pre-incubation of Cα with ethanol decreases phosphorylation of Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and casein but has no effect on the phosphorylation of highly charged molecules such as histone H1 or protamine. cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation by Cα is also increased in ethanol-treated cells. This increase in CREB phosphorylation is inhibited by the PKA antagonist (Rp)-cAMPS and by an adenosine receptor antagonist. These results suggest that ethanol affects a cascade of events allowing for sustained nuclear localization of Cα and prolonged CREB phosphorylation.

Receptor-stimulated increases in intracellular cAMP levels cause dissociation of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 from regulatory subunits; the free catalytic subunit (Cα) then phosphorylates intracellular substrates. The duration of the stimulus determines whether these substrates are cytoplasmic or nuclear (2Bailey C.H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13445-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, PKA Cα phosphorylates a specific transcription factor, CREB, at serine 133, initiating changes in expression of genes containing cAMP response elements (3Bailey C.H. Alberini C.

Increases in Gihave also been reported after chronic exposure to ethanol (26Charness M.E. Querimit L.A. Henteleff M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that one of the catalytic subunits of PKA, Cα, translocates to the nucleus of NG108–15 cells during prolonged exposure to ethanol; Cα remains in the nucleus as long as ethanol is present (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the rapid exit of Cα from the nucleus when adenylyl cyclase and PKA are activated by receptors or forskolin (6Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because prolonged intranuclear localization of Cα during exposure to ethanol could be responsible for ethanol-induced changes in gene expression (see Ref. 1Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar for review), we undertook a study to determine the mechanism and functional significance of ethanol-induced Cα translocation. We show here that ethanol-induced nuclear Cα is functionally active, resulting in the phosphorylation of CREB. This persistent activation appears to be because of, in part, ethanol inhibition of Cα reassociation with regulatory subunits of PKA and ethanol-dependent inactivation of PKI. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where indicated. NG108–15 neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cells obtained from the cell culture facility at the University of California (San Francisco, CA) were grown in 10% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, as described previously (17Gordon A.S. Collier K. Diamond I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells in T175 flasks for nuclear extract preparations and into 6-well plates at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well for whole cell lysate preparations. For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were plated on single chamber slides at a density of 4–6 × 104 cells/slide. All cells were maintained for 3 days in complete defined medium (10Sapru M.K. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). On day 3, media were changed, and the cells were maintained in the absence or presence of 200 mm ethanol for 24 h; media were replaced daily. Treatment with 10 μm forskolin was carried out for 30 min. 40 μm(Rp)-cAMPS (Biolog Life Science Institute, La Jolla, CA) and 10 μm BWA1434U (a gift from Glaxo Wellcome) were added 3 h or 30 min, respectively, prior to ethanol or forskolin exposure. Cells were fixed, blocked, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as described elsewhere (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Antibody against CREB phosphorylated at Ser-133 was purchased from NEN BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and diluted 1:200. Secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit) was purchased from Cappel (Costa Mesa, CA) and diluted 1:250. Nuclei were isolated from NG108–15 cells in hypertonic sucrose by the procedure of Laks et al. (27Laks M.S. Harrison J.J. Schwoch G. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8775-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate)) and shaken at 4 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation for 20 min at 67,000 × g, protein content and PKA activity were determined in the supernatant, and a fraction was used for Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts (0.6 mg/ml protein) were incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer in the presence and absence of 5 μm cAMP. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 μm ATP, 200 μm Kemptide, and 12.5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was stopped after incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, and the amount of γ-32P incorporated into Kemptide was determined as described by Rabin et al. (11Rabin R.A. Edelman A.M. Wagner J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar). The PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma) was reconstituted in 40 mm dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml and was used within 3 days. For each experiment, enzyme was diluted 50-fold in assay buffer with or without various concentrations of ethanol. The final concentration of enzyme was 0.51 units/0.13 mm histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.2 mm Kemptide, casein, or protamine sulfate. A Sephadex G-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (15 × 250 mm) was preequilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 4 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 75 mm NaCl) (28Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used to separate PKA holoenzyme from dissociated Cα and RII subunits. The void volume was determined to be 14 ml. At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, holoenzyme elutes in the void volume (RII at 36 ml and Cα at 40 ml). Kinase activity was measured in these fractions as described above, using 10 mg/ml protamine sulfate as substrate, because ethanol has no effect on phosphorylation of this substrate (see Fig. 4 B). Phosphorylation in the void volume containing holoenzyme is cAMP-dependent, whereas kinase activity in the 40-ml fraction containing Cα is cAMP-independent. Nuclear extract (0.5 mg of protein) was prepared as described above (except that NaCl was omitted from extraction buffer) and was precleared for 30 min with protein A-conjugated agarose. Supernatant from a 10 min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm was incubated overnight with 2 μg of polyclonal Cα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and further incubated with protein A-conjugated agarose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. All incubations were at 4 °C. After a final wash, the immunoprecipitate was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and probed with RIIβ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and Cα antibodies on Western blots. Whole cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collecting them in SDS buffer (100 μl/well from 4 wells) followed by sonication for 3 s. Cells from 2 remaining wells were used for protein measurements. Nuclear extracts and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed using standard procedures (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and antibodies against Cα (a generous gift from Susan Taylor, University of California, San Diego, CA) (diluted 1:10,000), RI, RIIα, and RIIβ (Transduction Laboratories) (1:1000), Cβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) (1:1000), or total CREB and phosphorylated CREB (NEN BioLabs) (1:1000). Secondary antibodies (NEN BioLabs) were horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit (1:5000) for Cα, Cβ, CREB, and phospho-CREB and rabbit anti-mouse (1:1000) for RI and RII. Proteins were detected using LumiGLO chemiluminescence substrate (NEN BioLabs) and exposed to Kodak Biomax film. Scanning densitometry was used to quantitate Western blots using the NIH Image program. Using immunocytochemistry, we have shown that chronic ethanol exposure causes translocation of PKA Cα from the Golgi area into the nucleus in NG108–15 cells (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To quantitate the extent of Cα translocation and to determine whether ethanol causes translocation to the nucleus of other PKA subunits in NG108–15 cells, we carried out Western blots on cell lysates and nuclei from these cells. Fig. 1 shows that NG108–15 cells express Cα, Cβ, RI, and RIIβ. Only traces of RIIα could be detected in the presence or absence of ethanol (data not shown). After incubation with ethanol for 24 h, there is a 54 ± 2% (mean ± S.E.) increase in the amount of Cα in the nuclei of ethanol-treated cells and a 40 ± 5% decrease in the amount of RI in whole cell homogenates. These results are in agreement with our previous findings (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that ethanol causes translocation of Cα into the nucleus and decreases the amount of RI subunit in whole cells. Fig.1 also shows that, after exposure to ethanol, nuclear RIIβ increases by 52 ± 4%. However, there is no RI or Cβ in the nuclei of either control or ethanol-treated cells. Our data suggest that the amount of Cα and RIIβ in the nucleus of NG108–15 cells increases by 50% after chronic exposure to ethanol. To determine whether nuclear Cα is active or bound to RIIβ and thus inactive, we measured PKA activity in the presence and absence of cAMP in nuclear extracts. Nuclei were recovered after cell disruption and centrifugation in hypertonic sucrose buffer, and soluble proteins were extracted with 0.5m NaCl buffer (27Laks M.S. Harrison J.J. Schwoch G. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8775-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA activity in the extract was assayed with Kemptide as substrate (11Rabin R.A. Edelman A.M. Wagner J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 257-262PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows that PKA activity remaining in control nuclei after subcellular fractionation is cAMP-dependent, suggesting that Cα and RIIβ are associated as a holoenzyme. In contrast, kinase activity in the nuclei of cells treated with 200 mm ethanol for 24 h is cAMP-independent, suggesting that some of the Cα is no longer associated with RIIβ. Because total PKA activity did not change in ethanol-treated cells, it is also likely that a significant fraction of nuclear PKA is inactive after ethanol exposure. The results in Fig. 2suggest that active Cα is not regulated by RII in the presence of ethanol. To test this possibility, we examined RII inhibition of purified Cα activity in the presence or absence of ethanol. Fig.3 A shows that RII inhibits Cα catalytic activity by 72 ± 2% in the absence of ethanol. However, preincubation of RII with ethanol strikingly decreases RII inhibition of Cα. When RII was preincubated with 50 mmethanol for 2 h, inhibition of Cα activity by RII was reduced to 25 ± 1%. These results suggest that ethanol inhibits the binding of RII to Cα, thereby preventing RII inhibition of Cα activity. To determine directly whether ethanol inhibits binding of RII to Cα, association of the two subunits was assessed by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography. The holoenzyme elutes in fraction 14 (void volume) and Cα in fraction 40. Fig. 3 B shows that when equimolar amounts of Cα and RII are co-incubated for 30 min without cAMP, all kinase activity is cAMP-dependent and is recovered in the void volume (fraction 14). This indicates that RII and Cα associate to form the holoenzyme. When cAMP is present during both incubation and elution, all PKA activity is recovered in fraction 40 and is cAMP-independent. This indicates that cAMP prevents the association of Cα and RII. When RII is preincubated with 50 mm ethanol for 60 min before incubation with Cα and the column eluted with buffer containing 50 mm ethanol, only 46 ± 2% of PKA activity is in the void volume and 44 ± 4% elutes in fraction 40, suggesting that ethanol inhibits the association of RII and Cα by 54%. This is in agreement with the results in Fig.3 A showing a 45 ± 6% decrease in RII inhibition of Cα activity after RII was preincubated with 50 mm ethanol for 90 min. Although ethanol inhibits the reassociation of PKA subunits, it has no effect on the dissociation of the holoenzyme. Incubation of holoenzyme with as much as 200 mm ethanol for 30 min did not cause dissociation into subunits, in contrast to dissociation produced by cAMP (Fig. 3 C). Our findings suggest that ethanol interferes with the reassociation of RII and Cα subunits of PKA in vitro. To determine if ethanol produces the same effect in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in nuclear extracts from NG108–15 cells maintained in the presence and absence of 200 mm ethanol for 24 h. The Cα·RIIβ complex was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal Cα antibody and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against RIIβ and Cα. Fig. 3 D shows that the amount of RIIβ co-immunoprecipitated with Cα is 45 ± 2% less in the nuclei of ethanol-treated cells. This is in agreement with the results in Fig. 3, A and B, and suggests that Cα and RIIβ are partially dissociated in the nuclei of these cells. We have shown that Cα remains in the nuclei of ethanol-treated NG108–15 cells as long as ethanol is present and returns to the Golgi 12 h after ethanol is removed (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cα ordinarily exits the nucleus by binding to the heat-stable PKA inhibitor, PKI, which contains a nuclear export signal required for transporting proteins out of the nucleus (7Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W. Fantozzi D. Taylor S.S. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Fantozzi D.A. Harootunian A.T. Wen W. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Tsien R.Y. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PKI binds to the same hydrophobic site on Cα as RIIβ (31Kemp B.E. Faux M.C. Means A.R. House C. Tiganis T. Hu S.-H. Mitchelhill K.I. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1994: 30-67Google Scholar), it is possible that ethanol also inhibits the binding of PKI to Cα. This would be expected to attenuate inhibition of Cα by PKI and limit the export of Cα from the nucleus. We used an in vitro kinase assay to test this hypothesis. Under control conditions PKI inhibits purified Cα-catalyzed phosphorylation by 84 ± 6% (Fig. 4 A). Preincubation of PKI with 50 or 100 mm ethanol for 30 min at room temperature decreases PKI inhibition of kinase activity to 31 ± 5% and 14 ± 6%, respectively. Thus, ethanol limits inhibition of PKA by PKI, suggesting that ethanol, similar to its effect on RII, probably inhibits the binding of PKI to Cα. This would also prevent the exit of Cα from the nucleus. Because PKI and RII share common binding sites on Cα with substrates (31Kemp B.E. Faux M.C. Means A.R. House C. Tiganis T. Hu S.-H. Mitchelhill K.I. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1994: 30-67Google Scholar), we determined the effect of ethanol on Cα-mediated phosphorylation of different substrates in vitro. Fig. 4 B shows that Cα preincubation with 100 mm ethanol for 30 min inhibits Cα-dependent phosphorylation of Kemptide or casein by 36%. However, 100 mm ethanol did not inhibit phosphorylation of the highly charged molecules histone H1 or protamine sulfate. Similar results were obtained with 50 mm ethanol. Moreover, preincubation of all substrates with 100 mmethanol did not affect subsequent phosphorylation, except for casein where inhibition of phosphorylation was reduced from 36 to 25% (data not shown). These results suggest that ethanol inhibits phosphorylation of hydrophobic substrates by interacting primarily with hydrophobic sites on Cα. Cα localized to the nucleus after exposure to ethanol is active (Fig. 2), suggesting that endogenous nuclear substrates should also be phosphorylated. The transcription factor CREB is a physiological substrate for PKA in the nucleus (3Bailey C.H. Alberini C. Ghirardi M. Kandel E.R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1994; 29: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we used Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry with polyclonal antibodies that recognize CREB phosphorylated at serine 133 (phospho-CREB) to determine whether ethanol increases CREB phosphorylation. Fig. 5, A and B, shows that ethanol induces phosphorylation of CREB (p-CREB) reaching a maximum at 3 h of exposure. Most importantly phospho-CREB remains higher than control levels from 1–24 h of ethanol treatment; there was no change in the amount of CREB (Fig.5 A).

Fig.6 shows an immunocytochemical image of phospho-CREB in NG108–15 cells before and after treatment with either forskolin or ethanol. The amount of phospho-CREB in the nucleus after a 3-h exposure to ethanol is similar to that obtained by treating the cells with forskolin for 30 min (Fig. 6). Forskolin- and ethanol-induced phosphorylation of CREB was greatly reduced by preincubating cells with (Rp)-cAMPS, suggesting that PKA is responsible for CREB phosphorylation induced by ethanol.Figure 6Ethanol-induced CREB phosphorylation in NG108–15 cells is blocked by adenosine receptor and PKA antagonists.

Diamond I. Collier K. Lopez L. Ullman B. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 744-748PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sapru M.K. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). If adenosine receptor-dependent increases in cAMP levels are responsible for ethanol-induced activation and translocation of Cα to the nucleus, an adenosine receptor antagonist should also block phosphorylation of CREB. BWA1434U, an adenosine receptor antagonist, blocked ethanol-induced CREB phosphorylation but, as expected, had no effect on forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation, which bypasses receptor stimulation (Fig. 6). Immunocytochemical studies in our laboratory have shown that chronic exposure of NG108–15 cells to ethanol caused a dramatic and specific translocation of Cα from the Golgi area to the nucleus (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This translocation is confirmed by Western blot analysis of homogenates and nuclei of control and ethanol-treated cells (Fig. 1). We demonstrate here that the RIIβ regulatory subunit is also translocated to the nucleus following chronic ethanol exposure, but ethanol does not alter localization of the Cβ catalytic subunit. Nuclei of control NG108–15 cells contain both Cα and RIIβ, probably associated as holoenzyme, because cAMP is required for PKA activation (Fig. 2). After chronic ethanol exposure, however, there is a substantial increase in the amounts of both Cα and RIIβ in the nucleus (Fig. 1). Once in the nuclei of ethanol-treated cells, some Cα and RIIβ appear to be dissociated because PKA activity is cAMP-independent (Fig. 2). This is likely because of the inhibition of the association of Cα and RII by ethanol (Fig. 3 B) thereby blocking RII regulation of Cα activity (Fig. 3 A). Thus, a 90-min incubation with 50 mm ethanol prevents the association of RII and Cα by 50% (Fig. 3 B) and decreases RII inhibition of Cα activity by 45% (Fig. 3 A). This concentration of ethanol is clinically relevant, particularly in chronic alcoholics (38Diamond I. Messing R.O. West. J. Med. 1994; 161: 279-287PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ethanol inhibition of Cα·RIIβ holoenzyme formation in vitro is reproduced in vivo because 45% of nuclear RIIβ fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Cα after 24 h of ethanol treatment (Fig.3 D). Our data also suggest a mechanism for the prolonged sequestration of functionally active Cα in the nucleus in the presence of ethanol. Neurotransmitter- and hormone-dependent signal transduction via cAMP cause a transient translocation of PKA Cα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with brief activation of transcription; Cα returns rapidly to the cytoplasm after binding to PKI (6Nigg E.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2676-2686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During prolonged exposure to ethanol, however, Cα remains in the nucleus and returns to the Golgi only 6–12 h after ethanol is removed (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This unusual time course for Cα translocation could be because of the interaction of ethanol with hydrophobic binding sites on PKI that prevents PKI from binding to Cα, thereby inhibiting PKI-mediated export of Cα out of the nucleus. Indeed, the data presented here show that PKI inhibition of Cα activity is greatly reduced after preincubation with ethanol (Fig. 4 A). Presumably this is because ethanol prevents the binding of PKI to Cα, similar to ethanol interfering with the association of RIIβ with Cα (Fig. 3, B and D). Ethanol also appears to limit access of specific substrates to Cα; phosphorylation of Kemptide and casein by Cα is reduced after preincubation of Cα with ethanol, whereas phosphorylation of histone and protamine are unaffected by ethanol (Fig. 4 B). The binding of substrates and RII and PKI to the catalytic subunit of PKA involves two hydrophobic interactions and three electrostatic contacts (31Kemp B.E. Faux M.C. Means A.R. House C. Tiganis T. Hu S.-H. Mitchelhill K.I. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1994: 30-67Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that ethanol can bind directly to hydrophobic pockets in proteins (39Slater S.J. Cox K.J. Lombardi J.V. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. Nature. 1993; 364: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 40Li C. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we propose that ethanol-induced sustained translocation of Cα to the nucleus is related to ethanol inhibition of the reassociation of Cα with RII and/or the binding of Cα to PKI. This may be because of ethanol-induced conformational changes at hydrophobic sites near the binding domains. This explanation is also consistent with our observation that ethanol does not inhibit phosphorylation of substrates that are highly charged, such as histone H1 and protamine sulfate (Fig. 4 B), where hydrophilic binding to Cα probably predominates. Preincubation of substrates with ethanol does not produce the same decrease in Kemptide and casein phosphorylation as preincubation of Cα. We presume this occurs because Kemptide and casein have a random coil secondary structure (42Rosevear P.R. Fry D.C. Mildvan A.S. Doughty M. O'Brian C. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3161-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43de Jongh H.H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13603-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that is less affected by ethanol. Two apparent methodological discrepancies in our studies are informative. First, in our previous paper (23Dohrman D.P. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10217-10221Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), ethanol caused the translocation to the nucleus of almost all Cα observable by confocal microscopy. In this report, Western blot analysis indicates that only approximately 50% of Cα is translocated to the nucleus. This discrepancy can be explained by methodological differences; we used confocal microscopy in our earlier report and Western blot analysis in this study. Confocal microscopy results in visualization of densely localized Cα, as seen in the Golgi and nuclei. Diffusely distributed Cα, on the other hand, is more difficult to observe by microscopy but is readily detected by Western blot analysis. The second discrepancy is that Western blot analysis shows a 50% increase in Cα in the nucleus after exposure to ethanol; this is not accompanied by an increase in PKA enzymatic activity, suggesting that some nuclear Cα may be rendered inactive and no longer regulated by cAMP after chronic exposure to ethanol. This raises the very interesting possibility that some Cα may be retained in the nucleus after chronic exposure to ethanol by binding to a putative inactivating protein distinct from PKI and RII. The existence of such a hypothetical Cα-binding protein in the nucleus is suggested by our observation that sustained nuclear localization of Cα in the presence of ethanol requires protein synthesis. 2D. Dohrman, H.-m., Chen, I. Diamond, and A. Gordon, manuscript in preparation. Studies are underway to identify this putative binding protein. Ethanol-induced translocation of Cα to the nucleus should enhance cAMP-dependent gene expression and reduce phosphorylation of membrane or cytoplasmic proteins. Because Cα is active for long periods of time, there may even be inappropriate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes. This is suggested by our finding that ethanol causes a striking increase in CREB phosphorylation with a peak at 3 h, followed by a sustained increase in phospho-CREB even after 24 h of ethanol exposure (Fig. 5). The peak of CREB phosphorylation at 3 h appears to be because of unrestrained Cα activity, apparently because ethanol inhibits RII and PKI binding to Cα (Figs. 3 and 4 A). After 3 h, phospho-CREB remains higher than in control cells but decreases despite the continued presence of Cα in the nucleus (see Ref. 18Diamond I. Wrubel B. Estrin W. Gordon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). This may be related to the observation that CREB phosphorylation following activation of the cAMP pathway is also regulated by protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 2B in neurons of the striatum (44Liu F.C. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatase 1 in PC12 cells (45Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decrease in CREB phosphorylation after 3 h may be because of an ethanol-induced increase in nuclear protein phosphatase activity. Several reports have shown that other kinases can phosphorylate CREB in vitro and in vivo on Ser-133, e.g. calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (32Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 33Greenberg M.E. Thompson M.A. Sheng M. J. Physiol.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar). In NG108–15 cells, the increase in CREB phosphorylation during ethanol exposure appears to be due primarily to Cα, because the PKA-specific inhibitor (Rp)-cAMPS, which acts directly on the holoenzyme to prevent its dissociation, significantly but not completely inhibits phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 6). This suggests the possibility that an early activation of PKA by ethanol-induced increases in cAMP may also up-regulate other kinases that phosphorylate CREB. However, an ethanol-induced increase in cAMP production must be required for CREB phosphorylation in the nucleus because BWA1434U, an adenosine receptor antagonist that blocks acute ethanol-induced increases in cAMP levels (9Nagy L.E. Diamond I. Collier K. Lopez L. Ullman B. Gordon A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 744-748PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sapru M.K. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar), completely abolishes ethanol-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 6). This is consistent with recent data in our laboratory showing that both (Rp)-cAMPS and BWA1434U prevent acute ethanol-induced translocation of Cα into the nucleus.2 Moreover, a requirement for cAMP is also supported by data in Fig. 3 C showing that ethanol alone does not dissociate the PKA holoenzyme. In summary, the major finding in this paper is that ethanol-induced translocation of PKA Cα to the nucleus in NG108–15 cells causes a sustained increase in CREB phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation has long been implicated in the regulation of many cellular functions and in short and long term learning and memory (46Martin K.C. Casadio A. Zhu H., E.Y. Rose J.C. Chen M.

LpxA is a trimer of identical subunits, and it represents the first example of a protein with a left-handed, parallel β-helix as the predominating feature of its secondary structure (25Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase from Mycobacterium bovis BCG (28Beaman T.W. Binder D.A. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and a xenobiotic acetyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29Beaman T.W. Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Like LpxA, these enzymes are trimers. There are no structural clues to the location or mechanism of the LpxA active site, because the LpxA crystal structure was solved in the absence of substrates or inhibitors (25Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, the sequences of more than 15 LpxAs are now available. The amino acid residues conserved across all LpxAs cluster around a deep cleft located between adjacent subunits (Fig. 2), which contains multiple histidines and other basic residues. Because of its symmetry, LpxA has three such clefts (not all visible in Fig. 2). The ACP substrate of LpxA consists of 77 amino acid residues and is very acidic (30Vagelos P.R. Majerus P.W. Alberts A.W. Larrabee A.R. Ailhaud G.P. Fed. Proc. 1966; 25: 1485-1494PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is plausible that the substrates R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP and UDP-GlcNAc might bind to this basic cleft. Further evidence for the importance of the cleft comes from recent studies of the acyl chain length specificity of E. coli LpxA (32Wyckoff T.J.O. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Dotson G.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32369-32372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Substitution of glycine 173 (red residue in the shaded area of Fig. 2) with methionine switches the acyl chain length selectivity of E. coli LpxA from 14 carbons to 10 (32Wyckoff T.J.O. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Dotson G.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32369-32372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We now present chemical modification studies to demonstrate that histidine, lysine, and arginine residues are important in LpxA catalysis, whereas serine and cysteine residues are not. We also use site-directed mutagenesis to examine the effects of changing conserved histidine, lysine, and arginine residues. The combined findings support the view that His125 of E. coli LpxA is directly involved in catalysis, whereas other conserved basic residues may participate in substrate binding. We also show that high levels of homogeneous LpxA do not catalyze UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc hydrolysis or UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc exchange. The results argue against a ping-pong mechanism with an acyl-enzyme intermediate but are consistent with the direct transfer of the acyl chain from R-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP to the glucosamine 3-OH of UDP-GlcNAc.

The standard reaction mixture (10–20 μl) contains 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 μm R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP, and 10 μm[α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (2 × 106 cpm/nmol). Substrates were synthesized as described previously (33Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Steeghs L. van der Ley P. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture is incubated at 30 °C for 1–10 min. For measuring initial rates, the enzyme concentrations (monomer) are typically 1–10 nm. The reactions are terminated by spotting 2–2.5-μl portions onto a silica thin layer chromatography plate. After the spots air dry, the plates are developed in the solvent chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v). The plates are dried and then exposed to imaging screens overnight at room temperature. The plates are visualized, and the extent of the reaction is quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, operated with ImageQuant software. For assays of E. coli crude extracts, 0.2 mg/ml L-573,655 (17Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H.

This is unnecessary for assays of purified LpxA or of Corynebacterium glutamicum extracts expressing recombinant E. coli LpxA. The assay of LpxA in the reverse direction monitors the conversion of [α-32P]UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc to [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (8Anderson M.S. Bull H.G. Galloway S.M. Kelly T.M. Mohan S.

Jackman, Duke University). ACP, coenzyme A (Sigma), pantetheine (Sigma), N-acetylcysteamine (Aldrich), glutathione (Sigma), and UDP-GlcNAc were tested as acyl acceptors in the reverse direction. All the acyl acceptors are reduced with a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) for 20 min at room temperature prior to the assay. The reaction is started by addition of purified LpxA and incubated at 30 °C. Reactions are terminated by spotting 2 μl onto a silica thin layer chromatography plate. Plates are developed and quantified as described above. For assays of cell free extracts, 50-ml cultures of BL21(DE3)/pLysE strains carrying plasmids containing wild type and mutant lpxA genes were grown at 37 °C in LB (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter NaCl) (36Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (225 rpm). At A600 = 0.6, they were induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown for 3 more hours. Cells were washed once with 5 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 20% glycerol, resuspended in 2 ml of the same, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris. Membrane-free supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min.

Cells were washed once with 40 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 0.2m NaCl and 20% glycerol, resuspended in 2 ml of the same, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were broken by three passages through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min to remove cell debris. Wild type E. coli LpxA was purified from BL21(DE3)/pLysE/pTO1 (33Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Steeghs L. van der Ley P. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Mutant LpxAs were purified from BL21(DE3)/pLysE strains carrying pET23c based plasmids containing mutant lpxA genes (see below). BL21(DE3)/pLysE cultures (500 ml) were grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C (225 rpm), induced with 1 mm IPTG at A600 = 0.6, and grown for 3 more hours (final A600, ∼2). Cells were washed once with 50 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 0.2m NaCl and 20% glycerol, resuspended in 20 ml of the same, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min to remove cell debris. Membrane-free supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 90 min (final volume, 17 ml). A 40-ml Gel Matrex Green A (Amicon) column (8Anderson M.S. Bull H.G. Galloway S.M.

The membrane-free supernatant was diluted to 10 mg/ml (final volume, 25 ml) and applied to this column at 1.5 ml/min. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer until no more protein emerged as judged by A280. The protein was eluted with a 400-ml 0.2–2.5 m NaCl gradient (in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 20% glycerol). LpxA elutes at approximately 0.6 m NaCl (8Anderson M.S. Bull H.G. Galloway S.M. Kelly T.M. Mohan S. Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19858-19865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing LpxA were pooled and dialyzed against 2 × 2l portions of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol. This pool was applied at 1 ml/min to an 8 ml Source 15Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed in the equilibration buffer until no more protein eluted. The protein was then eluted with a 160 ml of 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient (in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 20% glycerol). LpxA elutes at approximately 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions containing LpxA were pooled, divided into aliquots, and then stored at −80 °C. In the following experiments, LpxA concentrations are expressed as the amount of monomer/unit volume. For inhibition studies, 20 μmpurified LpxA was incubated at room temperature in 40 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7, with various concentrations of DEPC (Sigma) for 10 min. DEPC solutions (in ethanol) were made each day just prior to an experiment. Exact DEPC concentrations were determined by reacting with an excess of imidazole (Sigma) and measuring the A240 (ε = 3200m−1) (38Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). DEPC reactions with LpxA at room temperature were quenched by a 1:50 dilution into 70 μmimidazole (on ice) (at least a 10-fold molar excess over the DEPC). DEPC, ethanol, and imidazole at the concentrations used have no effect on the substrates of the LpxA reaction, and ethanol and imidazole have no effect on LpxA activity at the levels at which they are carried over into the assay mixture (not shown). The LpxA/DEPC/imidazole mixtures were further diluted with 1 mg/ml BSA and assayed by the standard method using 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, instead of 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, but this modification has little effect on LpxA activity. For substrate protection studies, 20 μm purified LpxA was incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, and 200 μm DEPC in the presence of 20 mm UDP-GlcNAc, or 40 μm R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP. These concentrations correspond to about 20 times the Km (8Anderson M.S. Bull H.G. Galloway S.M. Kelly T.M. Mohan S. Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19858-19865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for each substrate. The reactions were quenched by a 1:50 dilution into 40 μmimidazole (a 10-fold molar excess). The mixtures were then further diluted as appropriate into 1 mg/ml BSA and assayed by the standard method with 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, taking into account the residual substrate concentrations carried over from the preincubation. For NH2OH reactivation studies, 20 μmpurified LpxA was incubated with and without 100 μm DEPC for 5 min at room temperature in 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. The reactions were quenched by a 1:50 dilution into 20 μm imidazole. These mixtures were then diluted 1:2 into 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, and 1 mg/ml BSA or into the same containing a final concentration of 10 mmNH2OH (Sigma). A 100 mm stock of NH2OH in water was made fresh each day. At various times, portions were diluted further into 1 mg/ml BSA as appropriate and assayed by the standard method with 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. For spectrophotometric quantification of the extent of chemical modification, 20 μm purified LpxA was incubated with 20–90 μm DEPC for 15 min at room temperature. During the reaction, the A240 was followed to determine the concentration of modified histidines, and the A280 was also measured to exclude major structural changes in protein folding. At various times throughout the reaction, 3-μl portions were withdrawn and quenched with a 10-fold excess of imidazole in 1 mg/ml BSA. These sample were kept on ice until the end of the study, at which time all of the samples were assayed for LpxA activity by the standard method with 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. In all experiments, 20 μm purified LpxA (monomer) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with various concentrations of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, phenylglyoxal, or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate reactions were quenched by a 1:2 dilution into 10 mm sodium borohydride (corresponding to at least a 10-fold molar excess over pyridoxal 5′-phosphate). All reactions were then diluted appropriately and assayed for LpxA activity. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (Sigma) was prepared in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8, whereas phenylglyoxal and sodium borohydride were dissolved in water, and the phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride stock solution was prepared in isopropanol. None of these reagents has any effect on the substrates of the LpxA reaction, and isopropanol and sodium borohydride have no effect on LpxA activity at the levels carried over into the assay system. The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and phenylglyoxal studies were done in 40 mmHEPES, pH 8 (39Matsuyama T. Soda K. Fukui T. Tanizawa K. J. Biochem.

In all experiments, 10 μm purified LpxA (monomer) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with various concentrations of methyl methane thiosulfonate or N-ethyl maleimide. Both reagents were from Sigma, and stock solutions were prepared in water. After 30 min, samples were diluted with 1 mg/ml BSA and assayed by the standard method with 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. Recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Spin Miniprep kit or the Bigger Prep Plasmid DNA Preparation Kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Restriction endonucleases, Klenow, T4 DNA ligase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were used according to the manufacturers' specifications. DNA was extracted from gels using the GeneClean kit (Bio 101, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. LpxA mutants were made by the method of Kunkel et al. (43Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K.

Plasmid pTO1 contains wild type E. coli lpxA in a pET23c (Novagen) vector. Resulting plasmids are named for the mutated gene they carry, prefaced by pTO, e.g. pTO-H122A. Each mutated gene was sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutation was present. Plasmids were transformed into CaCl2 competent BL21(DE3)/pLysE (Novagen) cells. pET23c-based plasmids containing wild type and mutant lpxA genes were digested with Nde I and Bam HI to excise the lpxA gene. This fragment was treated with Klenow fragment and then ligated into a Bam HI-digested and Klenow fragment-treated pGK1 Corynebacterium/E. coli shuttle vector (37Brabetz W. Liebl W. Schleifer K.H.

https://openalex.org/W1996381409,"Transcriptional synergism between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 (Oct-1 and Oct-2) in the induction of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) transcription has been proposed to be mediated through directed recruitment of the octamer factors to their binding sites in the viral long terminal repeat. This recruitment correlates with direct binding between the GR DNA binding domain and the POU domain of the octamer factors. In present study, in vitro experiments identified several nuclear hormone receptors to have the potential to bind to the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 through their DNA binding domains, suggesting that POU domain binding may be a property shared by many nuclear hormone receptors. However, physiologically relevant binding to the POU domain appeared to be a property restricted to only a few nuclear receptors as only GR, progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR), were found to interact physically and functionally with Oct-1 and Oct-2 in transfected cells. Thus GR, PR, and AR efficiently promoted the recruitment of Oct-2 to adjacent octamer motifs in the cell, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), estrogen receptor α, and retinoid X receptor failed to facilitate octamer factor DNA binding. For MMTV, although GR and MR both induced transcription efficiently, mutation of the promoter proximal octamer motifs strongly decreased GR-induced transcription without affecting the total level of reporter gene activity in response to MR. These results suggest that the configuration of the hormone response element within the MMTV long terminal repeat may promote a dependence for the glucocorticoid response upon the recruitment of octamer transcription factors to their response elements within the viral promoter.

DNA binding by nuclear receptors is almost exclusively dependent upon the orientation and spacing of just two core DNA recognition sequences (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

Four steroid hormone receptors (glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, androgen, and progesterone) bind as homodimers to a palindrome of the sequence AGAACA with a 3-base pair spacing, whereas the estrogen receptors bind as dimers to a similar arrangement of the second core sequence; AGGTCA, and most other nuclear receptors recognize alternative arrangements of the same sequence (2Beato M.

For example, whereas the hormone response element of the mouse sex-limited protein gene is bound by GR and PR in addition to AR, sex-limited protein gene expression is specifically induced by androgens and is refractory to progestins and glucocorticoids (7Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This specificity in responsiveness is determined by the specific interaction of AR with factors binding to auxiliary elements within the sex-limited protein gene enhancer (8Adler A.J. Scheller A.

Steroid-induced MMTV transcription is dependent upon a complex hormone response element (HRE) responsive to GR, AR, PR, and MR, as well as binding sites for nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and octamer transcription factors (5Archer T.K.

The role of NF1 in steroid induction appears to be mediated indirectly, with NF1 occupancy of the viral promoter being primarily dependent upon the induction of changes in chromatin structure by the steroid receptor (14Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). By contrast, there is evidence that the octamer transcription factors participate in the steroid hormone response through a protein-protein interaction with GR and PR (15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, we have suggested that a protein-protein interaction between the GR DBD and the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 potentiates the glucocorticoid hormone responsiveness of MMTV by a recruitment mechanism that may facilitate or promote the binding of the octamer factors to their recognition sequences in the MMTV promoter (16Préfontaine G.G.

This suggestion is consistent with the cooperativity in DNA binding observed for GR and Oct-1 and Oct-2 that has been observed both in vitro and in vivo (14Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M.

Binding between GR and Oct-1 and Oct-2 was found to be direct 2Wang, J. M., Préfontaine, G. G., Lemieux, M. E., Pope, L., Akimenko, M.-A., and Haché, R. J. G., (1999)Mol. Cell.

Biol., in press. and is likely to occur in vivo for the full-length proteins as well as for the isolated domains.Analysis of the GR-Oct-1/2 interaction has demonstrated that the GR DBD is sufficient for Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding and that point mutations at Cys-500 and Leu-501 of the GR DBD abrogate the interaction between the full-length proteins (16Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Haché R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Localization of POU domain binding with the region of GR that is most highly conserved among nuclear hormone receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar) suggested that interaction with the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 may be a broadly conserved property of nuclear hormone receptors.In the present study, we have evaluated the potential for other nuclear hormone receptors to interact with Oct-1 and Oct-2. Our results indicate that whereas similarities within the nuclear receptor DBD allowed several nuclear receptors to bind specifically to the octamer factor POU domains in vitro, interactions in transfected cells were limited to AR, PR, and GR. On the MMTV promoter AR, PR, and GR, but not MR, promoted the binding of Oct-2 to its recognition sequences. The inability of MR to promote octamer factor binding to the MMTV promoter correlated with a lack of transcriptional synergism between the MMTV HRE and octamer motifs in response to the activation of viral transcription by MR. Surprisingly, however, MR activated transcription from the wild-type MMTV promoter in CHO cells with efficiency similar to that of GR, whereas induction by GR alone was severely compromised from a promoter in which the octamer motifs were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. By contrast, GR and MR activated transcription similarly from a synthetic steroid response element. These results indicate that the requirement of the octamer motifs for GR-mediated induction may reflect a specific limitation in the configuration of the MMTV HRE that translates to a decrease in the transcriptional activation potential of GR in fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONThe steroid receptors for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progestins, and androgens recognize the same DNA sequence elements in the cell (3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar), yet specific gene transcription is known in at least some cases to be selectively responsive to particular hormones (27Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Moreover, GR and MR differentially transmit transcriptional responses to corticosteroids in different tissues (36Funder J.W. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), despite both receptors displaying high affinities for glucocorticoids and aldosterone (4Cato A.C. Weinmann J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The differential responsiveness of GR and MR is mediated at several levels. First, the two receptors are differentially expressed, particularly in the brain (36Funder J.W. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Second, 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which selectively metabolizes cortisol, but not aldosterone, also is differentially expressed (37Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Third, differences in the GR and MR ligand binding domains and their completely divergent N termini are proposed to confer distinct transcriptional regulatory properties that are also expected to influence and even determine the specificity of transcriptional responses (27Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 38Laudet V. Hanni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stehelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate that the apparent inability of MR to bind to the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2, and to promote the binding of Oct-2 to octamer motifs in the MMTV promoter proximal regulatory region, correlates directly with an absence of synergism between MR and octamer factors in transfection experiments. Interestingly, at the same time, our results also reveal a compensatory mechanism that appears to be encoded within the MMTV HRE that results in similar total hormonal responsiveness to GR and MR, at least in CHO cells. Thus in the context of the MMTV HRE, GR was only a weak activator of transcription in the absence of octamer motifs. By contrast GR and MR activated transcription similarly from synthetic perfectly palindromic response elements.The structure and sequence of nuclear receptor DBDs have been highly conserved, and a number of nuclear hormone receptors have been demonstrated to interact synergistically with POU transcription factors (15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Wieland S. Döbbeling U. Rusconi S.

Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the DBDs of several nuclear receptors in addition to GR were able to bind to the POU domains of Oct-1/2 in GST pull-down assays. However, under the more stringent binding conditions of mammalian one-hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments, only three receptor DBDs, those of GR, PR, and AR, interacted with the POU domain in a manner that was readily detectable in the cell. For at least one receptor, ERα, our results are consistent with a previous report on the nature of its transcriptional synergism with the POU factor Pit-1 (42Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, whereas a weak interaction was noted between the ERα DBD and the Pit-1 POU domain, transcriptional synergism was entirely dependent upon a functional interaction between the N terminus of Pit-1 and the estrogen receptor LBD. Our results also highlight the importance of confirming in vitro binding results with bacterially expressed and in vitro translated proteins with more stringent assays that more directly reflect the potential for binding in vivo.On the MMTV LTR, the promoter proximal octamer motifs are required for over 90% of the transcriptional responsiveness to glucocorticoids and progestins (15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This correlates directly with the promotion of the binding of Oct-2 to DNA that we observed on transiently transfected DNA templates. Furthermore, this effect appears to be directly dependent, at least in part, upon the binding of the GR or PR DBDs to the POU domain of the octamer factors. Our results also are consistent with in vitro studies that demonstrated that the addition of GR or PR to a binding assay decreased the concentration of Oct-1 required to saturate the MMTV octamer motifs (15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). By comparison, the inability of MR to interact with Oct-2 and to promote its binding to octamer motifs adjacent to MR-binding sites on both the MMTV promoter and synthetic templates was exactly consistent with the inability of MR to interact synergistically with octamer factors to activate transcription from the MMTV promoter proximal regulatory region.Interestingly, however, the inability of MR binding to the octamer factors had little effect on the induction of MMTV transcription in response to stimulation of MR. Indeed, a mild reduction in the fold activation of transcription by MR was observed in the presence of the octamer motifs. By contrast, mutation of the octamer motifs, which eliminated the contribution of the octamer factors toward MMTV transcription (15Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Haché R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), almost completely eliminated the induction of transcription by GR. Thus on the MMTV HRE, GR activated transcription 30 times less efficiently than MR in the absence of octamer motifs. This low transcriptional activation potential of GR was specific for the MMTV HRE, as both receptors induced transcription similarly from a promoter containing two copies of a perfect HRE palindrome. Our results with the synthetic HRE are also consistent with those of other groups that have reported a similar transcriptional regulatory potential for GR and MR (4Cato A.C. Weinmann J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 43Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results highlight that although GR and MR have similar transcriptional activation properties in many instances, the precise transcriptional activation potential of receptors may be allosterically regulated by the nature of the HRE (44Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 45Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24216-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).One alternative possibility in our experiments was that on the MMTV promoter proximal regulatory region, MR interacted more productively with NF1 than GR. It has been observed in vitro on chromatin-free DNA templates that GR and NF1 activate MMTV transcription independently and actually can compete for binding to the MMTV promoter in a way that is not observed on organized chromatin templates in vivo (14Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Haché R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 46Brüggemeier U. Rogge L. Winnacker E.L. Beato M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whether MR interacts differently with NF1 is not known. However, our footprinting of the promoter of the transiently transfected MMTV LTR construct indicates that occupancy of the MMTV NF1-binding site was not noticeably affected by steroid-induced MR or GR. Thus a preferential interaction between MR and NF1 would most likely occur subsequent to the binding of the two factors to the MMTV LTR.In addition to GR-Oct-1/2 binding (16Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Giffin W. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Haché R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Kutoh E. Stromstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), there are several additional examples of the GR DBD entering into functional complexes with other transcription factors. Two of these interactions, with AP-1 and NFκB, are conserved properties of several nuclear receptors (48Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Klieweer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 49Zhang X.K. Wills K.N. Husmann M. Hermann T. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell.

All three appear to be mediated mainly through the second zinc finger of the receptor DBD. Although a direct comparison remains to be made, and AP-1 is known not to interact with MR (54Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), it appears that each interaction is mediated through determinants in the GR DBD that are differentially conserved in other receptors. For example, whereas receptor-Oct-1/2 binding was found to be restricted to GR, AR, and PR, NFκB can also interact with ERα (55Ray P. Ghosh S.K. Zhang D.H. Ray A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and AP-1 can interact with RAR and TR (49Zhang X.K. Wills K.N. Husmann M. Hermann T. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6016-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 50Salbert G. Fanjul A. Piedrafita F.J. Lu X.P. Kim S.J. Tran P. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, whereas rat GR truncated from the C terminus to amino acid 509 can still interact fully with AP-1 (56Kerppola T.K. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3782-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the same truncation of GR reduces Oct-1/2 binding in a GST pull-down assay by over 80%.3Alignment of the rat GR and MR DBDs shows that there are just two non-conservative differences between the two receptors to the end of the second zinc finger, at Arg-496 and Tyr-497 of GR. Interestingly, substitution of these two amino acids interferes with GR binding to AP-1 (54Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), whereas mutations C500Y and L501P interfere with the binding of GR to Oct-1 and Oct-2. It will be interesting to compare directly the effect of the R496L and Y497Q for GR binding to Oct-1 and Oct-2. However, because truncation of GR from 525 to 509 also affects Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding in vitro, it will be important also to consider the several amino acid differences in this region that occur between GR and MR. Indeed, preliminary results suggest that determinants within these hinge regions of GR and MR may be crucial for distinguishing the binding of GR and MR to Oct-1 and Oct-2. Identification of a localized MR/GR substitution that eliminates the direct binding of GR to Oct-1 and Oct-2 may be expected to allow a detailed examination of the contribution of GR-Oct-1 and Oct-2 binding to transcriptional synergism between GR and Oct-1/2 in vivo. The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily is distinguished by a striking conservation of the receptor DNA binding domains and highly redundant DNA sequence recognition. DNA binding by nuclear receptors is almost exclusively dependent upon the orientation and spacing of just two core DNA recognition sequences (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar). Four steroid hormone receptors (glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, androgen, and progesterone) bind as homodimers to a palindrome of the sequence AGAACA with a 3-base pair spacing, whereas the estrogen receptors bind as dimers to a similar arrangement of the second core sequence; AGGTCA, and most other nuclear receptors recognize alternative arrangements of the same sequence (2Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Despite recognizing the same DNA sequence elements, glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR) differentially regulate the transcription of target genes in response to steroid (3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar, 4Cato A.C. Weinmann J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Archer T.K.

For example, whereas the hormone response element of the mouse sex-limited protein gene is bound by GR and PR in addition to AR, sex-limited protein gene expression is specifically induced by androgens and is refractory to progestins and glucocorticoids (7Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This specificity in responsiveness is determined by the specific interaction of AR with factors binding to auxiliary elements within the sex-limited protein gene enhancer (8Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The major sites of expression for mouse mammary tumor virus are the lactating mammary gland and the testis. Steroid-induced MMTV transcription is dependent upon a complex hormone response element (HRE) responsive to GR, AR, PR, and MR, as well as binding sites for nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and octamer transcription factors (5Archer T.K.

Acta Physiol. Scand. 1941; 2 (Suppl. 8): 1-62Google Scholar, 2Newton N. Morell D.B. Clarke L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 96: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Sibbett S.S.

Those differences have been attributed to the special nature or structure of the heme group in MPO. Because this heme is covalently bound to the protein, characterization of this chromophore has been difficult. Based on different spectroscopic techniques, a formyl-containing heme a, a chlorin, and a heme b prosthetic group have been proposed in the past (3Sibbett S.S. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Eglinton D.G. Barber D. Thomson A.J. Greenwood C. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7173-7179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the enzyme differs in spectroscopic and catalytic properties, the homology between MPO and the other mammalian peroxidases is high. MPO shares respectively 70, 61, and 47% identical residues with eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (10Sakamaki K. Tomonaga M. Tsukui K. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16828-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ueda T. Sakamaki K. Kuroki T. Yano I. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Kimura S. Ikeda-Saito M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 3: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and an even higher homology can be found among the residues in the active site. MPO is the only mammalian peroxidase for which a crystal structure is known, at 2.3 Å resolution (13Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The structural data for human MPO suggested that three heme substituents form covalent bonds with amino acid side chains in the protein. Two ester bonds were claimed to be present, between modified methyl groups on pyrrole rings A and C and the amino acids Glu242 and Asp94. In a recent study, we have provided the first direct evidence by FTIR difference spectroscopy that ester bonds link the heme groups in all mammalian peroxidases via the conserved aspartate and glutamate residues (14Kooter I.M. Pierik A.J. Merkx M. Averill B.A. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11542-11543Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The third linkage involves the nonconserved Met243 residue, for which there is considerable evidence. Based on the unique autocleavage Met243--Pro244 site of MPO, resembling the cyanogen bromide dependent-cleavage of Met-X bonds, and the fact that Met243 is in close proximity to the prosthetic group of MPO, Taylor et al. (15Taylor K.L. Pohl J. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25282-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that Met243 was involved in a sulfonium ion linkage to the heme group. Later studies showed that this sulfonium ion linkage involved the vinyl group of pyrrole ring A (13Fenna R. Zeng J. Davey C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Taylor K.L. Strobel F. Yue K.T. Ram P. Pohl J. Woods A.S. Kinkade J.J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Met243 is replaced by a threonine in human EPO (10Sakamaki K. Tomonaga M. Tsukui K. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16828-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in bovine LPO a glutamine is found at this position (17Cals M.-M. Mailliart P. Brignon G. Anglade P. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and, as recently shown by Ueda et al. (11Ueda T. Sakamaki K. Kuroki T. Yano I. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in human LPO a histidine is present. It should be mentioned that the genetic codes of Gln and His only differ by one base for both residues. Human TPO has been shown to contain a valine at this position (18Kimura S. Kotani T. McBride P.W. Umeki K. Hirai K. Nakayma T. Ohtaki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5555-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In a recent study (19Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Wever R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 191-197Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we have mutated the Met243 of MPO into a glutamine to create an LPO-like protein. This mutant MPO is spectroscopically very similar to LPO, and we concluded that Met243 is responsible for the spectral characteristics of MPO. In this study we further investigated the role of the Met243 residue by mutating it to the corresponding residues of the other mammalian peroxidases, i.e. a threonine for EPO and a valine for TPO. We also mutated the Met243 residue into a cysteine to investigate whether this residue would still be able to make a linkage to the heme group via its sulfur atom, in analogy with heme c. These mutations of the Met243residue in MPO resulted in loss of the typical MPO enzymatic and spectroscopic characteristics. The binding of chloride to the Met243 mutants is also affected; the affinity for Cl− has decreased approximately 100-fold. We also show for the first time that it is possible, by vibrational spectroscopy, to detect a single methionine residue in a protein by isotopically labeling of the recombinant wild type and mutant MPO. Transfection of recombinant plasmids into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, selection and culture procedures for transfected cells, protein purification protocols, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and electrophoretic analysis of recombinant myeloperoxidase were described in detail previously (20Moguilevsky N. Garcia-Quintana L. Jacquet A. Tournay C. Fabry L. Pierard L. Bollen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The M243C, M243T, M243Q, and M243V mutant proteins were produced by replacing, in the myeloperoxidase-coding cassette carried by plasmid pNIV2703, a 178-base pair Apa I-Avr II DNA fragment by the mutated counterpart. The final plasmids were called pNIV2721, 2719, 2718, and 2717, respectively. The mutation was generated within this fragment by a combination of polymerase chain reactions and overlap extensions, using an oligonucleotide primer carrying the modified codon. The amplified fragment was sequenced using Sequenase version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The final recombinant plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, and G418-resistant colonies were selected and expanded. Cell factory supernatant (10 liters) was collected, and the mutant was purified (20Moguilevsky N. Garcia-Quintana L. Jacquet A. Tournay C. Fabry L. Pierard L. Bollen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 13CD3-labeled methionine recombinant and M243T mutant were produced similarly to the ordinary recombinant and M243T mutant, but the CHO cells were grown in the presence of 1 gram of 13CD3-labeled methionine (Isotec Inc.). It was found that the recombinant MPO had a lower Rz value (A428 nm/A280 nm) than native MPO, and the mutants also showed different Rz values. This made it difficult to assess the protein concentration. We therefore determined the concentration of recombinant MPO from the optical absorbance of the Soret band at 428 nm and that of the mutants at their Soret maximum, using in both cases the extinction coefficient of 89 mm−1·cm−1 of native MPO. Recombinant MPO has a lower Rz value (0.6) than natural MPO (0.8) because the 84-kDa recMPO is produced as a single chain monomer and is secreted as the glycosylated proprotein that contains a propeptide of 177 residues. The Rz of the recMPO is lower compared with that of the natural enzyme because of a higher content of phenylalanine and tyrosine residues in the unprocessed recMPO. However, the recMPO is very similar if not identical in specific activity and spectral properties as detailed in Ref. 20Moguilevsky N. Garcia-Quintana L. Jacquet A. Tournay C. Fabry L. Pierard L. Bollen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar. All optical spectra for the recombinant and mutants were recorded on a Cary 50 Biospec spectrophotometer. An appropriate amount of dithionite solution was used for reduction. The pyridine hemochrome spectra were prepared in 2.1 m pyridine and 75 mm NaOH, and a concentrated dithionite solution was added for reduction. EPR measurements at X-band were obtained with a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer at a field modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Cooling of the sample was performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 cryostat with an ITC4 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG magnetic field meter. The microwave frequency was measured with an HP 5350 B frequency meter. The resonance Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman microspectrophotometer that was adapted for the experiment using 413.1 nm excitation, as reported before (19Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Wever R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 191-197Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IR spectra were recorded on a Bio-Rad FTS-60A FTIR spectrometer equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and a MCT detector. All measurements were carried out with a home-made “sandwich” IR-cell composed of two CaF2 plates separated by a 56-μm polyethylene spacer.13CD3-methionine and methylated-13CD3-methionine solutions were in H2O. Methylated-13CD3-methionine was prepared according to Toennies and Kolb (21Toennies G. Kolb J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945; 67: 849-851Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Solid state samples were air-dried on a single CaF2 plate. Difference spectra were obtained by first recording a single beam spectrum of the oxidized form of the sample containing 2.5 mm deazaflavin and 25 mm EDTA. Then the sample was photo-reduced (22Tollin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Lübben M. Gerwert K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by exposure to visible light from a 150 W Oriel Xenon lamp via an optical fiber, and a reduced minus oxidized spectrum was recorded. The spectra were corrected for water vapor and recorded at room temperature. The oxidation state of the sample in the FTIR cell was monitored by visible spectroscopy using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 A diode array spectrophotometer. The chlorinating activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of monochlorodimedone (1,1-dimethyl-4-chloro-3,5-cyclohexanedione) at 290 nm (ε = 20.2 mm−1·cm−1(24Hewson W.D. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3175-3181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) into dichlorodimedone (ε = 0.2 mm−1·cm−1 at 290 nm). The chlorinating activity was also measured by monitoring the formation of taurine monochloramine at 252 nm (ε = 429m−1·cm−1 (25Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar)). The guaiacol assay was performed by monitoring the formation of tetraguaiacol at 470 nm (ε = 26.6 mm−1·cm−1(26Chance B. Maehly A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 764-781Crossref Scopus (3565) Google Scholar)). The 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay was performed by monitoring the formation of the oxidation product at 414 nm (ε = 36.0 mm−1·cm−1 (27Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar)). The assays were performed with 2.5 mm ABTS, 8 mm guaiacol, 50 μm MCD, or 15 mm taurine, respectively. All assays were performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) or sodium acetate (pH 5) and 200 mmNa2SO4 and with 5–50 nm MPO and 100 μm H2O2. The chlorinating activity assays were performed in the presence of 100 mmNaCl, and the reactions were started by addition of enzyme. The ABTS and guaiacol activity assays were started by the addition of H2O2. We decided not to explore the kinetic parameter (Vmax and Km) values in detail considering the complex kinetic behavior of MPO (28Bakkenist A.R.J. Boer D.J.E.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For the chloride binding studies the optical absorbance spectrum was recorded before and after the addition of chloride. After correction for volume changes the dissociation constants were calculated from saturation curves of the chloride-induced spectral changes (28Bakkenist A.R.J. Boer D.J.E.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Binding studies were performed on an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer and a Cary 50 Biospec spectrophotometer. Here we present a spectroscopic and enzymatic characterization of all Met243 mutants available; for comparison, LPO data are also shown. Fig.1 shows the optical absorbance spectra of both the oxidized and reduced forms of the M243C, M243T, M243Q, and M243V mutants, LPO, and recombinant MPO. The Soret band in the oxidized enzyme state was found at 410 nm for M243C, 414 nm for M243T, 410 nm for M243Q, 414 nm for M243V mutant, 412 nm for LPO, and 428 nm for recombinant MPO. At pH 7 it was not possible to completely reduce the Met243 mutants by addition of dithionite under anaerobic conditions. Reduction was facilitated by addition of 0.5 μm methylviologen. The Soret band was found at 432 nm for M243C, 447 nm for M243T, first at 445 nm and finally at 430 nm for M243Q, and first at 447 nm and finally at 433 nm for M243V at the same time scale (not shown). At pH 9.3 and after addition of 0.5 μm methylviologen reduction of the Met243 mutants is complete and the Soret band was found at 432 nm, with a shoulder at 447 nm, for M243C, at 447 nm for M243T, at 445 nm for M243Q, and at 447 nm for M243V (Fig. 1). The Soret band of the reduced state of LPO and recombinant MPO at pH7 were found at 444 and 474 nm, respectively. To investigate the type of heme present we prepared alkaline pyridine samples. Fig. 2 shows that the Soret band of the different Met243 mutants is found at similar positions, but they all are blue-shifted compared with that of recombinant MPO. Mutation of the Met243 residue clearly affects the chemical nature of the heme group, and the spectrum is now similar to that of protoheme IX (29Fuhrhop J.-H. Smith K.M. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1975: 804-806Google Scholar). Incubation of native or recombinant MPO in the pyridine solution at high pH for a period more than 5 h resulted in a spectrum with bands at 425, 526, and 565 nm, similar to that of Met243 mutants (not shown). EPR spectra of the Met243 mutants show multiple high spin signals, indicating the presence of multiple species in the mutants (Fig. 3). Lowering the pH increased the intensity of the more rhombic species, whereas addition of chloride or addition of glycerol increased the intensity of the more axial species. Changing the buffer to Hepes (pH 7) did not affect the spectrum. Addition of cyanide to the oxidized enzyme resulted in the low spin ferric enzyme state (Fig. 4). Whereas addition of 10 mm KCN was sufficient to convert the recombinant MPO into the low spin state (Kd = 0.43 μm (30Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)), up to 200 mm was needed to obtain the low spin state of the Met243 mutants. Clearly the affinity for cyanide of the Met243 mutants is lowered. The low spin spectrum of recombinant MPO (g1, g2, g3 = 2.87, 2.25, 1.63) is identical to that of the native MPO (g1, g2, g3 = 2.87, 2.25, 1.63) (not shown) and more axial than that of the low spin spectrum of LPO (g1, g2, g3 = 2.91, 2.25, 1.57). The low spin species of M243V (g1, g2, g3 = 3.03, 2.21, 1.47) and that of M243Q mutant (g1, g2, g3 = 3.02, 2.22, 1.48) have a more rhombic signal. The M243T mutant differs from these in that it shows two low spin signals (g1, g2, g3 = 3.04, 2.24, 1.47 and g1, g2, g3 = 2.90, 2.24, 1.59), and the latter one is similar to that observed for the M243C mutant (gx1, g2, g3 = 2.90, 2.26, 1.58). As Fig. 4 shows, all Met243 mutants exhibit more g strain, as indicated by the broader signals in their low spin EPR spectra.Figure 4EPR spectra of the low spin forms of M243C, M243T, M243Q, and M243V mutant MPO, LPO, and recombinant MPO. Low spin states were obtained by addition of 70 μl of potassium cyanide solution (final concentration, 0.5 m) in 100 mmsodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) to 200 μl of Met243mutants of Fig. 3 and of 5 μl of potassium cyanide solution (final concentration, 10 mm) in 100 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) to 200 μl of LPO and recombinant MPO. Conditions during the recording of the spectra were as in described in the legend to Fig. 3. (The spectra are normalized to give similar signal heights.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5 shows the resonance Raman spectra of M243C, M243T, M243Q, and M243V mutants, LPO, and recombinant MPO. All Met243 mutants show identical spectra. Most remarkable is the effect of the Met243 mutation in the oxidation state marker region, as reported before (19Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Sijtsema N.M. Otto C. Wever R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 191-197Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is clear that the mutation results in a highly symmetric ν4 line at approximately 1370 cm−1 similar in shape and position to that observed for LPO. The overall spectrum of the Met243 mutants is less complicated than that of recombinant MPO and is essentially identical to the spectrum of LPO, indicative of a heme with a higher symmetry. Within the mammalian peroxidases family, MPO is the only peroxidase that is able to peroxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid, a bactericidal agent, at a substantial rate. Recombinant and native MPO are found to have similar kinetics parameters, as judged from the chlorination of MCD (31Jacquet A. Deby C. Mathy M. Moguilevsky N. Deby-Dupont G. Thirion A.

Renirie R. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3907-3912Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also measured the chlorination activity by means of the taurine assay, because some mutants were found to directly oxidize MCD in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, as is native MPO in the absence of a halide substrate (33Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Taurine is known to be unreactive toward MPO compounds I and II (35Marquez L.A. Dunford B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7950-7956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems, Part C. 223. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1994: 502-512Google Scholar), and in this respect taurine oxidation makes a better chlorination assay. Two classical peroxidase substrates, namely ABTS and guaiacol, were also investigated. Table I shows the activity of the mutants in different assays measured at pH 5 and 7 under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The native MPO was shown to have its pH optimum at 7 for the guaiacol assay, whereas that for the ABTS assay was around pH 5. For the classical peroxidase substrates, a residual activity of 1% was found for the M243V and M243Q mutant, an activity of 5% was present for M243T mutant, and 2% activity was present for the M243C mutant. Thus, these mutations had a profound effect on the function of the enzyme as a classical peroxidase. In the chlorination assay with taurine (pH 5), activities of less than 1.5% were found for the M243V and M243Q mutant, 15% activity was found for the M243T mutant, and 1.5% activity was present for the M243C mutant. In the assay using MCD at this pH, 3, 6, 16 and even 56% residual activity was found for the M243V, M243Q, M243T, and M243C mutant, respectively. However, the higher values for the chlorination activity found using this assay are probably due to direct oxidation of MCD by the mutants.Table IActivity of MPO and mutants under conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”GuaiacolABTSMCDTaurinepH 7pH 5pH 7pH 5pH 7pH 5pH 7pH 5wtMPO99262.91280.67.16.75.9recMPO120340.51290.774.66.6M243C2.30.342.47.30.13.9<0.10.1M243T6.51.02.46.70.11.10.31.0M243Q0.90.170.281.2ND0.1<0.1<0.1M243V1.30.100.101.3ND0.2<0.1<0.1Activity is expressed in s−1 and was calculated from the absorbance changes and corresponding extinction coefficients.

Boer D.J.E.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Ikeda-Saito M. Argade P.V. Rousseau D.L. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and chloride shifts the Soret band in the optical absorbance spectrum from 428 to 434 nm (28Bakkenist A.R.J. Boer D.J.E.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At each chloride concentration, the degree of saturation can be determined from the absorbance difference between MPO and the MPO-chloride complex in the Soret region (trough at 427 nm and peak at 448 nm), and from the resulting saturation curve the dissociation constant (Kd) of the MPO-chloride complexes can be obtained. In line with the results of Bakkenist et al. (28Bakkenist A.R.J. Boer D.J.E.G. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Bolscher and Wever (30Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the Kd is found to be strongly pH-dependent and is in the order of 8 mm at pH 5.5. Because mutation of the Met243results in the loss of the positively charged sulfonium ion linkage, we wondered whether this would affect the chloride binding to the enzyme. Fig. 6 shows the pH dependence of the dissociation constants (Kd values) of several mutant MPO-chloride complexes. It is evident that the dissociation constant for the Met243 mutants has increased almost 100-fold compared with the recombinant and native enzyme. For comparison, the pH dependence of the Kd for chloride of the D94N and E242Q mutants were also measured. As seen in Fig. 6, the Kd for chloride of the E242Q mutant is of the same order of magnitude as those of the recombinant and native MPO system. For the D94N mutant a difference spectrum is observed with two difference features. Calculation of the Kd from the chloride-induced peak at 415 nm and the trough at 400 nm results in a Kd of 10 mm (×, Fig. 6), whereas the calculation from the peak at 444 nm and the trough at 426 nm results in a Kd of 1.5 mm (•, Fig. 6) at pH 4. It is known 2Kooter, I. M., Moguilevsky, N., Bollen, A., Sijtsema, N. M., Otto, C., Dekker, H. L., and Wever, R. (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 263, 1–8. that D94N mutant consist of two species. The first one lacks the ester bond formed by Asp94 and is spectroscopically similar to native MPO, whereas the second also lacks the sulfonium ion linkage and is spectroscopically similar to a Met243 mutant. The values of 1.5 and 10 mm correspond well to the first and second species. There is still debate on the nature of the sulfonium ion linkage, and we tried to specifically investigate this by isotopically labeling of Met243 and by studying the Met243-labeled recombinant MPO by FTIR. For this, recombinant MPO was expressed by the CHO cell line that was grown in the presence of13CD3-labeled methionine. As a control the M243T mutant was also grown in the presence of13CD3-labeled methionine. Of the nine fundamental vibrations of a methyl group, two are in the high frequency region (3000 cm−1). An asymmetrical stretching mode, ν4, is found at 2962 cm−1 and a symmetrical stretching mode, ν1 at 2872 cm−1 (38Bellamy L.J. The Infra-red Spectra of Complex Molecules. Methuen & Co. LTD, London1956Google Scholar). In case of -13CD3 (in- stead of -CH3) we should expect these bands to appear in the 2200 cm−1 region. Indeed for13CD3-methionine in solution two bands are observed in the 2300–2000 cm−1 wavelength region (Fig.7 A). The band at 2230 cm−1 is assigned as the asymmetric stretch (ν4), and the band at 2129 cm−1 as the symmetric stretch group frequency (ν1) of -13CD3 (39Meloan C.E. Elementary Infrared Spectroscopy. The Macmillan Company, New York1963: 121-122Google Scholar). In the solid state form of13CD3-methionine, the ν4 mode downshifts 13 cm−1 to 2217 cm−1, whereas the ν1 mode downshifts 11 cm−1 to 2128 cm−1, compared with the solution state (Fig.7 B). Methylation of the13CD3-methionine results in a sulfonium ion structure (21Toennies G. Kolb J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945"

These proinflammatory mediators are released from sensitized mast cells upon activation through the antigen-mediated cross-linking of their high affinity cell surface IgE receptors/FcεRI (1Galli S.J.

Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both β and γ subunits of the IgE receptor/FcεRI contain ITAMs (immunoreceptortyrosine-based activation motifs), which allow interaction with protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) and PTK substrates via their Src homology 2 domains (4Hamawy M.J. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P.

The engagement of IgE receptors by antigen triggers a cascade of biochemical signal transduction events, including activation of multiple PTK (6Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H.

The activation of PTK and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of their downstream substrates have been implicated in the pathophysiology of type I hypersensitivity reactions (6Scharenberg A.M. Lin S.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2595-2605PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of the PTK-dependent signal transduction events that lead to FcεRI-mediated mast cell degranulation and mediator release may provide the basis for the rational design of potent mast cell inhibitors for prevention and treatment of allergic reactions. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) are pleiotropic transcription factors that mediate cytokine-stimulated gene expression in multiple cell populations (8Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar, 9Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All STAT proteins contain a DNA-binding domain, a Src homology 2 domain, and a transactivation domain necessary for transcriptional activation of target gene expression. Janus kinases (JAK), including JAK1, JAK2, Tyk, and JAK3, are cytoplasmic PTK that play pivotal roles in initiation of cytokine-triggered signaling events by activating the cytoplasmic latent forms of STAT proteins via tyrosine phosphorylation on a specific tyrosine residue near the Src homology 2 domain (10Ihle J.N. Kerr I.R. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize through specific reciprocal Src homology 2-phosphotyrosine interactions and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they stimulate the transcription of specific target genes by binding to response elements in their promoters (11Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Among the four members of the JAK family, JAK3 is abundantly expressed in lymphoid cells and plays an important role in normal lymphocyte development and function, as evidenced by qualitative and quantitative deficiencies in the B-cell as well as T-cell compartments of the immune system of JAK3-deficient mice (12Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M.

Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), including monocytes, megakaryocytes, endothelial cells, cancer cells, and, as we now report, mast cells also express JAK3, but no information is currently available regarding the physiologic function of JAK3 in these nonlymphoid cell populations. In a recent study, we found that the IgE/antigen-induced degranulation and mediator release are substantially reduced with Jak3 −/− mast cells from JAK3-null mice that were generated by targeted disruption of Jak3 gene in embryonic stem cells (17Malaviya R. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that JAK3 plays a pivotal role in IgE receptor/FcεRI-mediated mast cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that selective inhibition of JAK3 in mast cells with 4-(4′-hydroxylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline) (WHI-P131), a rationally designed potent and specific inhibitor of JAK3 that does not affect the enzymatic activity of other protein-tyrosine kinases including Src family tyrosine kinase LYN, ZAP/SYK family tyrosine kinase SYK, TEC family tyrosine kinase BTK, receptor family tyrosine kinase IRK, or Janus kinases JAKI and JAK2 (18Goodman P.A.

Treatment of IgE-sensitized rodent as well as human mast cells with WHI-P131 effectively inhibited the activation-associated morphological changes, degranulation, and proinflammatory mediator release after specific antigen challenge, without affecting the functional integrity of the distal secretory machinery. In vivo administration of this JAK3 inhibitor prevented mast cell degranulation and development of cutaneous as well as systemic fatal anaphylaxis in mice. Thus, targeting JAK3 with a specific inhibitor, such as WHI-P131, may provide the basis for new and effective treatment as well as prevention programs for mast cell-mediated allergic reactions. Male BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).

The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in PIPES-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fetal liver-derived human mast cells were resuspended in tyrode buffer containing calcium and magnesium and challenged with anti-FcεRI antibody 22E7 for 15 min. In some experiments fetal liver-derived human mast cells were resuspended in culture medium at a cell density of 5 × 106/ml and sensitized with IgE (150 μg/ml) for 3 h at 4 °C. After sensitization the cells were washed with tyrode buffer containing calcium and magnesium and challenged with mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE (40 μ/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C.

Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of WHI-P131 on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice, dorsal sides of the ears of BALB/c mice were injected intradermally with 20 ng of DNP-IgE (left ears) or PBS (right ears) in 20 μl of volume using a 30-gauge needle as described previously (39Miyajima I. Dombrowicz D. Martin T.R. Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Galli S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). After 20 h, mice were treated with WHI-P131 (10 or 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) twice at 1-h intervals prior to the antigen challenge. Control mice were treated with an equal volume of vehicle. 30 min after the last dose of WHI-P131 or vehicle, mice were challenged with 100 μg of antigen (DNP-BSA) in 200 μl of 2% Evan's blue dye intravenously. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 30 min after the antigen challenge. For quantitation of the Evan's blue dye extravasation as a measure of anaphylaxis-associated vascular hyperpermeability, 8-mm skin specimens were removed from the ears of mice, minced in 2 ml of formamide and incubated at 80 °C for 2 h in water bath to extract the dye. The absorbance was read at 620 nm. The data were expressed as plasma exudation indices (i.e. fold increase in optical density over PBS-treated ears at 620 nm). To induce passive systemic anaphylaxis, BALB/c mice were sensitized with 50 μg of DNP-IgE intravenously. At 24 h DNP-BSA (2 mg) was administered intravenously with 0.5% Evan's blue (200 μl). For assessment of vascular leak, animals were sacrificed 30 min after the antigen challenge, and their foot pads were examined for blue coloration. Histamine levels in plasma were measured 5 min after the antigen challenge. To this end, blood samples were obtained from the ocular venous plexus by retroorbital venupuncture, and histamine levels were determined by ELISA using a commercial kit (Immunotech, West Brook, ME) (29Malaviya R.

Dermatol. 1996; 106: 785-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For histopathologic evaluation of tissue mast cell degranulation, ears of mice were removed 1 h after the DNP-BSA injection and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Processed thin sections (3–5 μm) were stained with avidin-FITC (6.25 μg/ml) for 2 h, washed with PBS to remove unbound dye, and then mounted in buffered glycerol, 30 mm triethylenediamine, pH 8.6 (40Malaviya R. Ross E.A. Jakschik B.A. Abraham S.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the murine model for antigen-induced active anaphylaxis, mice were sensitized with 2 mg of BSA in 200 μl of aluminum hydroxide gel (Reheis Inc., Berkeley, NJ). 10 days later, anaphylactic shock was induced by the intravenous challenge of the mice with 200 μg of BSA. As shown in Fig.1 A, JAK3 is abundantly expressed in RBL-2H3 mast cells. This finding prompted us to examine the potential involvement of JAK3 in IgE receptor/FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation. The base-line tyrosine phosphorylation level of unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells varied from experiment to experiment. Cross-linking of the IgE receptors on RBL-2H3 mast cells that were previously sensitized by a monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE antibody with the specific antigen DNP-BSA resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 regardless of its base-line phosphorylation state (Figs.1 B and 2 A).Figure 2WHI-P131 prevents JAK3 but not SYK activation in mast cells after IgE receptor cross-linking. To show that WHI-P131 prevents JAK3 activation in mast cells after IgE receptor cross-linking, RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with monoclonal anti- DNP IgE, treated with either vehicle (A) or 30 μmWHI-P131 (B) and then challenged with DNP-BSA. Cells were lysed, and JAK3 immune complexes were subjected to kinase assays in the presence of cold ATP followed by APT immunoblotting (upper panels in A and B) as well as to JAK3 Western blot (WB) analysis (lower panels in A and B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To show the activation of SYK in mast cells following IgE receptor cross-linking, RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with monoclonal anti- DNP IgE, left untreated (C), or treated with either vehicle or 30 μm WHI-P131 (D) and then challenged with DNP-BSA. Cells were lysed at the indicated time points, and SYK immune complexes were subjected to kinase assays in the presence of cold ATP followed by APT immunoblotting (upper panels in C and D) as well as to SYK Western blot analysis (lower panels in C and D). Lanes C, base-line control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next set out to determine the effects of WHI-P131, a rationally designed JAK3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on JAK3 activation as well as other biochemical signal transduction events in mast cells. WHI-P131 inhibits JAK3 with an IC50 value of 9 μm, but it does not exhibit any detectable inhibitory activity against other protein-tyrosine kinases, including the structurally similar Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2, SRC family tyrosine kinase LYN, ZAP/SYK family tyrosine kinase SYK, TEC family tyrosine kinase BTK, and receptor family tyrosine kinase IRK even at concentrations as high as 350 μm (18Goodman P.A.

Uckun F.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1569-1582PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the rat mucosal mast cell line RBL-2H3 with WHI-P131 abrogated JAK3 activation after IgE receptor cross-linking (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, WHI-P131 did not prevent the robust SYK activation signal in RBL-2H3 mast cells after IgE receptor/FcεRI cross-linking (Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, any biological consequences of JAK3 inhibition in WHI-P131-treated mast cells cannot be attributed to impaired SYK activation. These results also demonstrate that JAK3 in mast cells does not act upstream of SYK in the signal transduction cascade initiated by the engagement of the high affinity IgE receptor/FcεRI, and its activation is not mandatory for activation of SYK. We also noted a slight difference in kinetics of activ"

We show that FIM has nuclear and nucleolar localization, whereas FIM-FGFR1 is mainly cytoplasmic. Within the nucleolus, FIM colocalizes with the upstream binding factor in interphasic cells, indicating that FIM may be involved in the regulation of rRNA transcription. We demonstrate that the targetting of FIM to the nucleus depends upon its C-terminal region, which is absent in the cytoplasmic FIM-FGFR1 protein. Secondly, we demonstrate that FIM-FGFR1 has constitutive dimerization capability mediated by the FIM N-terminal sequences. Finally, we show that FIM-FGFR1 promotes survival of pro-B Ba/F3 cells after interleukin-3 withdrawal, whereas ligand-activated FGFR1 induced not only cell survival but also interleukin-3 independence. Taken together, these results indicate that FIM-FGFR1 is activated by dimerization as a cytoplasmic kinase and suggest that FIM-FGFR1 partially signals through the FGFR1 pathways.

The FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein contains the N-terminal two-thirds of FIM, retaining the 10 putative zinc finger motifs and the FGFR1 intracellular region minus the major part of the juxtamembrane domain. We previously showed that it has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity (5Popovici C. Adélaïde J. Ollendorff V. Chaffanet M. Guasch G. Jacrot M. Leroux D. Birnbaum D. Pébusque M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5712-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of a tyrosine kinase receptor by permanent, ligand-independent stimulation can lead to aberrant stimulation of signal transducing pathways, resulting in cellular transformation and neoplasia (11Sawyers C.L. Denny C.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 171-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The FGFR1 tyrosine kinase receptor is broadly expressed and may play a role in many different processes, including hematopoiesis (12Popovici C. Ollendorff V. Coulier F. Pébusque M.-J. Birnbaum D. Hématologie. 1998; 4: 361-369Google Scholar). Because of constitutive activation, the fusion protein is likely to cause aberrant signaling rather than simple ectopic activation of a normal FGFR1 pathway. Because tyrosine kinase receptors are known to be activated following dimerization or higher order oligomerization (13Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and because each of the FGFR1 fusion partners, i.e. FIM, FOP, or CEP110, shows potential dimerization motifs in its N-terminal region, we suspected that FIM-FGFR1 constitutive kinase activity (5Popovici C. Adélaïde J. Ollendorff V. Chaffanet M. Guasch G. Jacrot M. Leroux D. Birnbaum D. Pébusque M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Indeed, the latter are binding motifs that very frequently mediate protein-protein (in addition to DNA-protein) interactions and can create homodimerization (14Mackay J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Here we gather clues about the mechanism of action of the FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein that may sustain its oncogenic potential in hematopoietic cells. In particular, we demonstrate that FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein is localized in the cytoplasm and that its dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal FIM sequences. We also present data supporting the idea that FIM-FGFR1 could act on cell survival. Cos-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% new born calf serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.

All constructs were derived from the wild type FIM (pFIM) and fusion FIM-FGFR1 (pCHIM) cDNAs inserted in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) as described in a previous work (5Popovici C. Adélaïde J. Ollendorff V. Chaffanet M. Guasch G. Jacrot M. Leroux D. Birnbaum D. Pébusque M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The respective positions of nucleotides and amino acids for all the constructs mentioned below (either wild type or chimeric) correspond to the FIM sequence from ATG minus the 261-base pair alternatively spliced. A sequence encoding the Myc epitope tag, MEQKLISEEDL, (17Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 18Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), preceded by a Kozak sequence was added at the 5′ of pFIM and pCHIM constructs and renamed mycFIM and mycCHIM, respectively. All constructs were made using standard techniques. Each construct was sequenced to verify the correct frame as well as the proper sequence of any linker introduced during the cloning procedure. The two-hybrid plasmids (pBTM116 and pVP16) were a generous gift from S. Hollenberg and J. A. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). To facilitate the cloning procedure, the polylinker region of both pBTM116 and pVP16 vectors has been remodeled to make three different versions of pBTM116 and pVP16 (i.e. A, B, and C), differing in-frame at the Bam HI site and containing an additional Not I site as described in Ollendorff and Donoghue (19Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32011-32018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FIM or CHIM (corresponding to FIM-FGFR1) cDNAs were cloned in-frame with either LexA (in pBTM116) or VP16 (in pVP16). Six different FIM constructs were generated: L-FIM (24–1292), corresponding to a 3.8-kb Nco I/Not I fragment derived from mycFIM and inserted in pBTM-C cut by Bam HI and filled in with the Klenow polymerase; V-FIM (24–1292), corresponding to a Not I/Sal I fragment derived from L-FIM (24–1292) and ligated in the Not I/Sal I sites of pVP16-C; L-FIM (314–1292), corresponding to a 3-kb Eco RI fragment derived from pFIM (FIM full-length cloned in pBluescript SK) and ligated in the Eco RI site of pBTM-A; V-FIM (314–1292), corresponding to a 3-kb Bam HI/Sal I fragment from L-FIM (314–1292) inserted in the Bam HI/Sal I sites of pVP16-A; L-FIM (24–425), corresponding to a 1.2-kb Hin dIII filled in/Not I fragment, which contains the sequences encoding the N-terminal sequence of FIM, derived from L-FIM (24–1292), and ligated into the Eco RI filled in/Not I sites of pBTM-C; and V-FIM (24–425), corresponding to a 1.2-kb Not I/Sal I fragment derived from L-FIM (24–425), and introduced in pVP16-C. Seven FIM-FGFR1 plasmids were constructed as follows: L-CHIM (24–1218), a 4.2-kb Nco I/Not I fragment containing the full-length coding sequence of FIM-FGFR1 was derived from mycCHIM filled in with Klenow and ligated in Bam HI filled in site of pBTM-C; V-CHIM (24–1218), the 4.2-kb Not I/Sal I fragment from L-CHM (24–1218) was prepared and ligated into pVP16-C; L-CHIMKD (24–1218) (kinase dead), because the FIM-FGFR1 fused to LexA (construct L-CHIM (24–1218) constitutively transactivated the reporter genes of the L40 yeast strain, a kinase-defective mutant FIM-FGFR1 fused to LexA was made by site-directed mutagenesis using Quickchange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations changing lysine 910 (lysine 514 in the FGFR1 sequence) to alanine (20Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in the L-CHIM (24–1218); L-CHIM (314–1218), a 3-kb Eco RI fragment was derived from L-CHIM (24–1218) and inserted in the Eco RI site of pBTM-A; V-CHIM (314–1218), a 3-kb Not I/Sal I fragment derived from L-CHIM (314–1218) was inserted in pVP16-A; L-CHIM (425–1218), a 2.7-kb blunt end Hin dIII/Not I fragment was derived from mycCHIM and inserted into pBTM-A; and V-CHIM (425–1218), the 2.7-kb Not I/Eco RI fragment was inserted in Bam HI filled in site of pVP16-A. These LexA and VP16 CHIM (425–1218) fusion constructs are deleted of the N-terminal FIM region and retain only 6 of the 10 zinc fingers motifs present in FIM. For CHIMKD (425–1218), as with the previously described construct L-CHIM (24–1218), L-CHIM (425–1218) activated constitutively the reporter genes in yeast. To prevent this we made a L-CHIMKD (425–1218) by swapping a 1.65-kb Nhe I/Eco RI fragment from L-CHIM (425–1218) by the corresponding region in L-CHIMKD (24–1218) encompassing the Lys910 → Ala mutation. As a result, the construct L-CHIMKD (425–1218) did not show any constitutive reporter transactivation. FIM N-terminal constructs consisting of the deletion of sequences encoding either one or two putative C-terminal FIM NLSs, DC1 and DC2, respectively, were made as follows. DC1 was deleted of FIM sequences coding for the C-terminal putative bipartite NLS (amino acids 1, 163–1, and 197). Briefly, mycFIM was cut with Xh oI (unique site in FIM, nucleotide position 3329) and Apa I (polylinker). Synthethic oligonucleotides with cohesive Xho I/Apa I and an in-frame stop codon were inserted by ligation. DC2 was deleted of the FIM sequences encoding the two putative NLSs [the previously described bipartite NLS and the one located between amino acid #954 and #964 (PRSKKKGAKRK)]. Briefly, mycFIM was cut with unique Eco RV FIM site (nt position 2, 760) and Not I (polylinker) and oligonucleotides with cohesive Eco RV/Not I sites and containing an in-frame stop codon were ligated in. FIM C-terminal plasmids that contain the sequences coding for either one or two of the putative C-terminal NLSs of FIM, DN1 and DN2, respectively, were constructed in the RK5-myc vector (a kind gift from J. P. Borg et al. (21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar)) as follows. For DN1, a 850-base pair FIM restriction fragment containing the sequences coding for C-terminal FIM region with the putative bipartite NLS from unique Pvu II FIM site (nucleotide position 3091) and Xba I (mycFIM polylinker) was filled in (with Klenow) and inserted in the RK5-myc cut by Xb aI filled in. For DN2, similarly, a Myc-tagged construct retaining C-terminal sequences including both NLSs was made by inserting a 1200-base pair FIM restriction fragment from Eco RV (nucleotide position 3021) and Xba I (polylinker) in the plasmid RK5-myc cut by Eco RI and filled in with Klenow. HA-tagged FIM-FGFR1 expression vectors were cloned in pcDNA3 in-frame with three repeats of the HA epitope (pcDNA3HA) (Invitrogen) as follows. For HACHIM, a near full-length coding sequence of 4.1-kb fragment (fragment Nco I filled in Not I (polylinker) derived from the mycCHIM was cloned into pcDNA3HA vector cut by Xba I and blunt ended. For HAΔR1CHIM, a 3-kb Eco RI (nucleotide position 1200)/Xho I (polylinker) fragment from mycFIM-FGFR1 and retaining the sequences coding for 8 of the 10 zinc fingers was subcloned in pcDNA3HA vector. For HAΔHd3CHIM, similarly, a 2.7-kb Hin dIII/Not I (polylinker) filled in fragment from mycFIM-FGFR1 containing FIM sequences coding for 6 of the 10 zinc finger motifs was inserted in the pcDNA3HA vector cut with Eco RV. For pFGFR1A, the full-length FGFR1 cDNA was excised from pFlg16 (22Dionne C. Crumley G. Bellot F. Kaplow J. Searfoss G. Ruta M. Burgess W. Jaye M. Schlessinger J.

Cos-1 cells were transiently transfected using 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Ba/F3 cells were electroporated as follows. 1 × 107 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 20 μg of plasmid DNA at 350 mV/960 microfarad in a Bio-Rad apparatus. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cells were seeded in plates. After electroporation, Ba/F3 cells were plated in 10 ml of IL-3 medium for 24 h and then selected in IL-3 medium plus 1 mg of G418/ml. Neomycin-resistant cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. FGFR1 positive cells were selected in G418 medium containing 10 ng/ml of FGF1 plus 10 μg/ml of heparin (22Dionne C. Crumley G. Bellot F. Kaplow J. Searfoss G. Ruta M. Burgess W. Jaye M.

The DSKITPSSKELASQK peptide, corresponding to amino acids 96–111 of FIM sequence, was chosen for chemical synthesis (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) owing to its predicted antigenicity. This peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as hapten, suspended in PBS, and used to immunize rabbits by intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. The antibody generated against this peptide was designated anti-N-FIM. The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) (17Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by D. Hernandez-Verdun (Paris, France). UBF labeling was revealed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Cos-1 cells were grown as monolayer on coverslips 1 day before transfection (1 to 2 × 105 cells/60-mm plate). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once in PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After extensive PBS washes, cells were permeabilized and blocked in 5% fetal calf serum/PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed several times in 1× PBS, and then incubated with 2 μg/ml of the Alexa-conjugated anti-Mouse secondary antibody. To detect the endogenous FIM protein, transfected Cos-1 cells were incubated with the antipeptide serum anti-N-FIM (dilution, 1:1000 or 1:5000) for at least 1 h. This antibody was revealed either by an Alexa-conjugated anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes). Controls were made by preincubating the FIM antiserum with the immunogen peptide (50 μm) or by incubating the cells with a preimmune serum rather than the anti-N-FIM serum. In these cases, the immunofluorescence staining was abolished, confirming the specificity of anti-N-FIM antiserum signal. To detect UBF, cells were incubated with anti-UBF serum used at the final dilution of 1:100 or 1:200 as described in Roussel et al. (24Roussel P. André C. Comai L. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The antibody was then revealed by a goat fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-human antibody (Immunotech). For FIM and UBF double labeling immunofluorescence, cells were first incubated with the two respective primary antibodies and then washed in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with a Goat anti-human fluorescein isothiocyanate to detect UBF, washed several times, and incubated with a goat Texas Red anti-rabbit antibody to detect FIM. The staining pattern observed for endogenous FIM after single labeling was identical to the double stained cells experiment, ruling out any cross-reactions between secondary antibodies. Except for the double labeling of UBF and FIM, after the secondary antibody incubation, coverslips were washed several times in PBS and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 1 μg/ml of ethidium-acridine heterodimer (Molecular Probes) used to visualize DNA (25Gaugain B. Barbet J. Oberlin R. Roques B.P. Le Pecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5071-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Gaugain B. Barbet J. Capelle N. Roques B.P. Le Pecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5078-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After several washes with PBS, coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol. Cellular localization of proteins was analyzed by confocal laser system microscopy using a TCS NT Leica apparatus (Heidelberg, Germany). The two-hybrid interaction assays were done according to previously published protocols using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain (27Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 28Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding a fusion between the DNA binding domain LexA and the construct of interest was cotransformed in the L40 strain with a plasmid encoding a fusion between the activation domain VP16 and a second protein of interest. After growth of the double transformants on selective media (−Trp, −Leu plates), several individual transformants were tested for their ability to activate the two integrated reporter genes HIS3 and LACZ. An interaction was scored positive based on whether or not yeast colonies were able to grow after 3–5 days at 30 °C on −His, −Trp, −Leu plates containing 10 mm of 3-amino-triazol (Sigma). The β-galactosidase activity was also checked qualitatively by a filter assay as described (28Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We first noticed that a LexA fusion with the chimeric FIM-FGFR1 protein was able to activate the reporter genes constitutively rending impossible the two hybrid analysis (data not shown). However, we observed that making a LexA fusion of CHIM with a point mutant that eliminates any tyrosine kinase activity of the FGFR1 kinase abolished this constitutive gene reporter transactivation. Therefore, we used as chimeric LexA fusions only kinase inactive (kinase dead or KD) derivatives for the two-hybrid analysis (L-CHIMKD (24–1218) and L-CHIMKD (425–1248)). Cell lysates from 2 × 106 Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild type or fusion proteins and immunoprecipitation using the antibody anti-C-FGFR1 were done as described (29Wang J.K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For dimerization studies, 1 × 106 Cos-1 cells were split in 100-mm plates, and transfected 24 h later using FuGENE-6 (as a ratio of 2 μl of FuGENE-6/1 μg of plasmid DNA). One day after transfection, cells were washed on ice with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described (21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and spun for 10 mn at 4 °C to remove debris. Immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 °C on 600 μl of total cell lysate with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10). Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h, washed three times in the same lysis buffer, and resuspended in 60 μl of sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and half of each immunoprecipitate was loaded on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoblotted following blocking in bovine serum albumin 5% with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Myc or anti-HA (3F10, Roche) or anti-C-FGFR1 (C15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Blots were visualized using chemiluminiscence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For growth curves, 1 × 104 nontransfected Ba/F3 cells or neomycin-resistant cells expressing either FIM-FGFR1 or FGFR1 or transfected with empty vector were plated on day 0, and viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after culture with or without IL-3. Ba/F3 cells expressing FGFR1 were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/ml of FGF1 plus 10 μg/ml of heparin. Cell proliferation was monitored by [3H]thymidine uptake. Cultures of 1 × 104 cells from the same clones (FIM-FGFR1, FGFR1, or without any insert) were grown in 96-well plates with the same conditions as described above. After 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, 0.74 MBq of [3H]thymidine was added to each well for 6 h. Incorporated radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. In parallel with trypan blue staining, cell loss was determined by a flow cytometry assay as described in Nicoletti et al. (30Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell culture of the selected clones as described above, 100% ethanol fixation, RNase treatment, and propidium iodide staining, the DNA content of cell nuclei was determined using a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACScan). Subdiploid cells were considered apoptotic cells. The fusion between two proteins resulting from a chromosomal translocation event often creates an aberrantly located protein. This abnormal subcellular localization can be, at least in part, the source of its oncogenic effect. Based on sequence analyses, we predicted the cytoplasmic localization of FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein because it lacks the FGFR1 transmembrane domain and the two putative NLSs present in the C terminus of the wild type FIM (5Popovici C. Adélaïde J. Ollendorff V. Chaffanet M. Guasch G. Jacrot M. Leroux D. Birnbaum D. Pébusque M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5712-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we compared the localization of both fusion FIM-FGFR1 and wild type FIM proteins by immunofluorescence in Cos-1 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding Myc-tagged constructs. As suspected, the FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein was mostly located in the cytoplasm (Fig.1 A, panels a and c). In contrast, the FIM protein was found exclusively located within the cell nucleus, in the nucleoplasm, and in discrete nucleolar areas (Fig. 1 B, panels a, c, d, and f). One nuclear pattern recurrently observed is shown in detail (Fig. 1 B, panels d–f). Therefore the FIM-FGFR1 fusion protein resulting from the t (8;13) translocation is mainly translocated to a subcellular compartment different from both FIM and FGFR1 wild type proteins, which are nuclear and plasma membrane bound, respectively. FIM C-terminal sequence displays two putative nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1, dark and light blue boxes), the more C-terminal one being bipartite (5Popovici C. Adélaïde J. Ollendorff V. Chaffanet M. Guasch G. Jacrot M. Leroux D. Birnbaum D. Pébusque M.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5712-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that these nuclear localization sequences are actually important, we studied the localization of different FIM proteins (Fig.2). Two short C-terminal deletion constructs, named DC1 and DC2, were first studied. The respective truncated proteins lack one and two putative nuclear localization signals, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Eliminating the FIM C-terminal region containing the putative bipartite NLS greatly affected the localization of the protein, which showed a cytoplasmic pattern in most cells (Fig. 2 A, panels a–c). However, in some cells the localization of this truncated protein was partially nuclear, suggesting that another signal localization could still be functional (Fig. 2 A, panels d–f). Indeed, the localization of the DC2 protein, which lacks the two putative NLSs, was exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig.2 B), either remaining diffuse (Fig. 2B, panels d–f) or concentrated in aggregates (Fig.2B, panels a–c). These results sugg"

We utilized point mutagenesis to investigate if a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp-409), which engages in π-stacking with the heme and hydrogen bonds to its axial cysteine ligand, helps control catalysis and regulation by NO. Surprisingly, mutants W409F and W409Y were hyperactive compared with the wild type regarding NO synthesis without affecting cytochrome c reduction, reductase-independent N-hydroxyarginine oxidation, or Arg and tetrahydrobiopterin binding. In the absence of Arg, NADPH oxidation measurements showed that electron flux through the heme was actually slower in the Trp-409 mutants than in wild-type nNOS. However, little or no NO complex accumulated during NO synthesis by the mutants, as opposed to the wild type. This difference was potentially related to mutants forming unstable 6-coordinate ferrous-NO complexes under anaerobic conditions even in the presence of Arg and tetrahydrobiopterin. Thus, Trp-409 mutations minimize NO feedback inhibition by preventing buildup of an inactive ferrous-NO complex during the steady state. This overcomes the negative effect of the mutation on electron flux and results in hyperactivity.

NO is synthesized by a family of enzymes termed NO synthases (NOSs). All NOSs catalyze a two-step, NADPH-and O2-dependent oxidation ofl-arginine (Arg) to NO and citrulline forming N ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) as an intermediate (4Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 5Marletta M.A. Hurshman A.R. Rusche K.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Three different isoforms exist: inducible NOS (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS). Both eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed, whereas iNOS is expressed in response to cytokines or bacterial products. Each NOS is comprised of an N-terminal oxygenase domain that binds iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), 6 R-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), andl-arginine (Arg) and a C-terminal reductase domain that binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH (6Hemmens B. Mayer B. Titheradge M.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 100. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 1-32Google Scholar). To be active, two NOS oxygenase domains interact to form a homodimer. NOS oxygenase and reductase domains are linked together on the polypeptide by a calmodulin (CaM) binding sequence (7Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H.

CaM binding activates NO synthesis by triggering electron transfer from the flavins to the heme (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Sequential transfer of electrons enables the heme to bind and activate O2 in both steps of NO synthesis (10Abu-Soud H.M.

This enables a similar chemistry for oxygen activation and mixed function oxidation of substrate (4Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the heme environments in NOS and the cytochrome P450s differ in a number of important ways. Crystal structures show that H4B binds at the heme edge in NOS perpendicular to its plane (12Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. DaNiu X. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Paul R. Lundell D.J.

Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Two conserved aromatic residues (Phe-584 and Trp-409 in rat nNOS) engage in aromatic stacking with the heme on its distal and proximal sides, respectively (Fig. 1). This aromatic stacking is absent in cytochrome P450s but is present in peroxidases and influences their electronic and catalytic properties (15Goodin D.B. Davidson M.G. Roe J.A. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NOS crystal structures predict that the indole nitrogen of Trp-409 hydrogen bonds with the cysteine thiolate heme ligand in nNOS. In cytochrome P450s, hydrogen bonding to the coordinating thiolate is minimal, but it does occur in the thiolate-ligated hemeprotein chloroperoxidase (16Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Aromatic and hydrogen bond interactions of Trp-409 in nNOS could conceivably influence heme iron electronegativity (17Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J.

Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but its actual role has not been tested. The nNOS heme also binds self-generated NO during NO synthesis (19Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The resulting ferrous heme-NO complex is inactive but resumes normal catalysis upon O2-dependent decay of the NO complex. This distinguishes nNOS from cytochrome P450s, which usually are irreversibly inactivated if NO binds to their ferrous heme (20Tsubaki M. Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Fujimoto Y. Ikekawa N. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4856-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because decay of the ferrous-NO complex is relatively slow, a majority of nNOS enzyme molecules (70–90%) exist as an NO complex during steady-state NO synthesis (19Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that heme-NO binding is an important regulator of NOS catalysis, it is currently unclear what, if any, structural features that are unique to NOS allow it to function in this capacity. To address this issue, we used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate what role Trp-409 has in regulating nNOS activity. Surprisingly, substitution with Phe or Tyr generated mutants that had greater NO synthesis than wild-type nNOS. Mutant hyperactivity appeared to result from combined changes in electron flux and heme-NO complex formation during the steady state. Our results emphasize the importance of NO complex formation in regulating nNOS activity and reveal that Trp-409 plays a key role in the process. All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources previously reported (18Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem.

Restriction digestions, cloning, and bacterial growth were performed using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

DNA fragments were isolated using the AgarACE enzyme protocol from Promega. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Quick Change polymerase chain reaction in vitro mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Incorporated mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Cleveland Clinic core facility. DNAs containing the desired mutations were transformed into E. coli for protein expression. Oligonucleotides used to construct site-directed mutants in nNOS were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. or by Integrated DNA Technologies. Silent mutations coding for restriction sites were incorporated into the oligonucleotides to aid in screening. Mutations (bold), silent restriction sites (underlined), and their corresponding oligonucleotides were as follows: W409F-Nhe I-sense: GCATGCC TTC CGGAACGCTAGCCGATGTGTGGGCAG; W409F-antisense: CTGCCCACACATCGGCTAGCGTTCCGGAAGGCATGC; W409Y-Nhe I-sense: GCATGCC TAC CGGAACGCTAGCCGATGTGTGGGCAG; and W409Y-antisense: CTGCCCACACATCGGCTAGCGTTCCGGTAGGCATGC.

UV-visible spectra was recorded on a Hitachi U3110 Spectrophotometer in the absence or presence of 20 μm H4B and 1 mm Arg. The ferrous-CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate the heme protein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1 cm−1 (A444-A500). The initial rate of NO synthesis, NADPH oxidation, or cytochrome c reduction by wild type and mutants was quantitated at 25 °C as described earlier (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). 0.6 μm nNOS was diluted in an air-saturated 40 mmEPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.9 mm EDTA, 3 μm CaM, 200 μm DTT, 20 μmH4B, 80 μm NADPH, and 1 mm Arg; final volume 1 ml. Reactions were started by adding 1.2 mmCa2+ and monitored by wavelength scanning at 15 °C. Concentrated small amounts of nNOS or mutants were placed into an anaerobic cuvette with 4 μmH4B, 1 mm Arg, and 200 μm DTT and made anaerobic by repeated cycles of evacuation and equilibration with deoxygenated argon gas. A 40 mm EPPS buffer containing 4 μm H4B, 1 mm Arg, and 200 μm DTT was separately made anaerobic, and 1 ml of this solution was transferred to the cuvette. NO gas was added to the head space and dissolved by mixing. Dithionite solution was then added in some cases. H2O2-dependent nNOS oxidation of NOHA to nitrite was assayed in 96-well microplates at 30 °C as described previously (23Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with modification. The assay volume was 100 μl and contained 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 250 nm nNOS or mutants, 1 mm NOHA, 1 mmDTT, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 μm H4B. Reactions were initiated by adding 30 mm H2O2 and stopped after 10 min by adding 1300 units of catalase. Nitrite was detected at 550 nm using the Griess reagent (100 μl) and quantitated based on nitrite standards. Arg binding affinity was studied at 30 °C by perturbation difference spectroscopy according to methods described previously (24McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The buffer contained 40 mm EPPS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm H4B, and 1 or 2 μm enzyme. 10 mm imidazole was added to the cuvette prior to titration with l-Arg (0–200 μm). The Kd of Arg was calculated by double reciprocal analysis of the absorbance difference versus substrate concentration. The optical spectrum of the W409F and W409Y mutants closely resembled that of wild-type nNOS at pH 7.6 in the absence of H4B and Arg (data not shown). Addition of 20 μm H4B and 1 mm arginine to either mutant caused a spectral shift from low spin to high spin, indicating that these molecules bound. Dithionite reduction in the presence of Arg, H4B, and CO produced a 444-nm absorbance peak for the ferrous-CO complex in both cases, indicating that their heme iron ligation is the same as in wild-type nNOS. Arg binding affinities were determined by spectral perturbation in the presence of 10 mm imidazole and 20 μm H4B (data not shown). Arg completely displaced bound imidazole during the titrations, and the Arg Ks values for W409F and W409Y were 60 and 68 μm, respectively, compared with 55 μm for wild-type nNOS. Thus, Arg and H4B binding were not significantly perturbed by the mutation of Trp-409 to Tyr or Phe. Table I compares the catalytic turnover numbers of wild-type nNOS and the Trp-409 mutants with regard to NO synthesis from Arg or NOHA, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM. Substitution of Trp-409 with Phe or Tyr altered rates of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation but did not alter cytochrome c reduction in any case, suggesting the mutations only affect the oxygenase domain of nNOS. Surprisingly, the W409F and W409Y mutants had 3- and 1.8-fold faster rates of NO synthesis from Arg compared with the wild type, respectively. Corresponding rates of NADPH oxidation were increased, indicating a proportional increase in electron flux through the enzyme. The calculated NADPH stoichiometries were 1.7, 1.6, and 1.5 mol of NADPH oxidized/mol of NO generated from Arg for wild-type nNOS, W409F, and W409Y, respectively. These values are close to the theoretical minimum of 1.5 (4Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 6Hemmens B. Mayer B. Titheradge M.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 100. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 1-32Google Scholar) and therefore indicate tight coupling between NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis by the mutants. When NOHA replaced Arg as the substrate, an even greater hyperactivity was observed for both mutants (Table I).Table IComparative analysis of catalytic activities of wild type nNOS and mutantsActivitynNOSW409FW409Y+CaM−CaM+CaM−CaM+CaM−CaMNO synthesis from Arg96 ± 50286 ± 180155 ± 150NO synthesis from NOHA115 ± 50453 ± 110180 ± 120NADPH oxidation170 ± 1011.2445 ± 205.6237 ± 511.2Cytochrome c reduction7000 ± 220505 ± 505000 ± 200230 ± 205546 ± 300280 ± 20The turn over number (kcat) is expressed as mol of product formed/mol of protein/min.

NO synthesis from Arg and NOHA, NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c reduction rates were determined at 25 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the mean and standard error for three measurements each. To understand how the mutations increased rates of NO synthesis by nNOS, we first examined mutant activities in the H2O2-supported NOHA oxidation assay. This measures nitrite formation and is useful because the reaction does not require electrons from the reductase domain and does not result in formation of a heme-NO complex (23Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, initial rates of nitrite formation by the mutant proteins were equivalent to wild-type nNOS. This suggests that the mutations increase NO synthesis in the NADPH-supported reaction by changing the rate of electron flux and/or the dynamics of heme-NO complex formation. To examine how the mutations effect electron flux through nNOS, we compared their NADPH oxidation rates under a number of different conditions (Table II). CaM-bound, wild-type nNOS had a relatively high rate of NADPH oxidation in the absence of H4B and Arg, and this rate was increased approximately two times when H4B bound, consistent with previous reports (18Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidation rates for the CaM-bound Trp-409 mutants were slower in the absence of Arg and H4B but increased proportionally as for the wild type in response to H4B (∼2×). Addition of the heme reduction inhibitor nitro-l-Arg methyl ester (18Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to the H4B-bound proteins decreased their NADPH oxidation rates to a level seen for the nNOS reductase domain alone, indicating that any additional NADPH oxidation above this value was associated with heme reduction. Together, these data indicate that electron flux through the heme is actually slower in the two mutants than in wild-type nNOS in the absence of NO synthesis. The addition of Arg to the CaM-bound, H4B-saturated enzymes initiated NO synthesis in all cases and lowered the rate of NADPH oxidation in wild-type nNOS, as reported previously (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 18Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Arg addition increased NADPH oxidation rates in both H4B-bound mutants. To test if NO was involved in modulating the Arg effects, we utilized agmatine, a substrate analog that binds to nNOS without supporting NO synthesis. 2N. Sennequier and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished observation. Agmatine decreased NADPH oxidation by wild-type nNOS compared with H4B alone but to a lesser extent than seen with Arg. For the mutants agmatine either did not effect the NADPH oxidation rate (W409F) or only increased it slightly (W409Y). These data show that electron flux through the heme is actually slower in the mutants under all conditions except when NO synthesis is taking place. This suggests that mutant hyperactivity and associated increase in electron flux must arise from a difference in NO interaction with the enzyme.Table IIEffect of H4B, Arg, and Arg analogs on NADPH oxidation by CaM-bound nNOS and mutant proteinsSystemnNOSW409FW409Ymin−1min−1min−1−H4B, −Arg290 ± 25105 ± 1074 ± 8+H4B, −Arg500 ± 25189 ± 15124 ± 4+H4B, NAME22 ± 416 ± 325 ± 4+H4B, Arg160 ± 12480 ± 20250 ± 20+H4B, agmatine250 ± 20180 ± 10170 ± 10The turn over number (kcat) is expressed in mol of NADPH oxidized/mol of protein/min.

NAME, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. NO down-regulates the rate of NO synthesis and associated electron flux by binding to the nNOS heme (19Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated if NO binding to the heme was altered by the Trp-409 mutations during aerobic steady-state catalysis. Fig. 3 shows wavelength scans of nNOS and mutants before and after activating NO synthesis at 15 °C. For wild-type nNOS, a significant percentage accumulated as the 6-coordinate ferrous-NO complex during the steady-state, as judged by the buildup of characteristic absorbance peaks at 436 and 560 nm (A and D), as reported earlier (19Abu-Soud H.M.

Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, the Trp-409 mutants had either a small (W409F) or no (W409Y) detectable absorbance buildup at 436 nm (B, C, and D), indicating their 6-coordinate NO complexes did not accumulate during steady-state NO synthesis. Given the above, we investigated if either mutant could form stable ferric or ferrous NO complexes with authentic NO under an anaerobic atmosphere in the presence of Arg and H4B, as occurs for wild-type nNOS (19Abu-Soud H.M.

Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, A–C, shows that wild-type nNOS and both mutants all formed stable 6-coordinate ferric NO complexes that display a Soret peak at 440 nm and visible peaks at 549 and 580 nm (25Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A small amount of dithionite was then added to reduce each enzyme. This formed a stable 6-coordinate ferrous-NO complex in wild-type nNOS (A) but generated unstable ferrous-NO complexes in both mutants (B and C). We conclude that the W409 mutations destabilize the ferrous-NO complex that normally accumulates during NO synthesis by nNOS. Mutating conserved residues near the active site of an enzyme usually diminish activity. This makes the hyperactivity of the Trp-409 nNOS mutants unusual but not unique among hemeproteins. In fact, mutation of Trp-51 to Phe in yeast cytochrome c peroxidase results in hyperactivity with regard to cytochrome c oxidation (15Goodin D.B. Davidson M.G. Roe J.A. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like Trp-409 in nNOS, Trp-51 engages in π-stacking with the peroxidase heme (26Goodin D.B. Roe J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20037-20045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but on its distal rather than proximal side as in nNOS. Peroxidase hyperactivity appears to result from a faster reduction of a compound I-like heme intermediate by the substrate cytochrome c. However, the hyperactivity observed for our nNOS mutants occurs through a distinct mechanism. After initiating NO synthesis, nNOS molecules quickly partition between a catalytically active form and an inactive ferrous-NO complex (19Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This creates two cycles that each have their own rate-limiting step and together determine the observed rate of NO synthesis during the steady-state (Fig. 5). A given nNOS molecule circulates in the active or inactive cycles depending on whether it binds O2 or NO to the heme. The rate-limiting step in the active cycle, which leads to NO synthesis, could be substrate binding, electron transfer, oxygen binding, a bond-making or -breaking step involved in oxygen activation or product formation, or product release. It is still unclear which of these is rate-limiting for wild-type nNOS, but related work clearly shows that heme reduction becomes rate-limiting if it is slowed relative to wild type (27Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If an nNOS molecule binds NO, it is placed in the inactive cycle and the rate-limiting step becomes the O2-dependent decay of the NO complex (29Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Once decay occurs, the enzyme can bind O2 and rejoin the active cycle. Mutation of Trp-409 to Phe or Tyr appears to effect the rate-limiting step in both cycles of nNOS. In the active cycle, our NADPH oxidation measurements suggest the mutants have a slower electron flow to the heme relative to wild type. Because mutant cytochrome c reduction rates were normal, it is the flavin-to-heme reduction step that is likely slowed. Indeed, the equilibrium reached between ferric and ferrous heme during anaerobic NADPH-dependent reduction is greatly shifted toward ferric in both Trp-409 mutants compared with wild type. 3S. Adak and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished observation. This is consistent with structural and resonance Raman data that predicts the indole nitrogen of Trp-409 and forms a hydrogen bond with the cysteine thiolate heme ligand in nNOS (see Fig. 1), and loss of this hydrogen bond by mutation to Phe or Tyr should increase the negative charge density on the cysteine thiolate and thus lower the reduction potential of the heme iron (17Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A slower rate of heme reduction would slow NO synthesis by any Trp-409 mutant nNOS molecules present in the active cycle relative to the wild type (27Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, we saw that mutant rates of NO synthesis were actually greater than the wild type. This could occur if the mutations minimized partitioning of enzyme molecules into the inactive cycle (i.e. heme-NO complex) during the steady-state. This appears to be the case, because we observed little or no NO complex accumulation for either Trp-409 mutant in the steady-state. Thus, it appears that the Trp-409 mutations offset their negative effect on heme reduction by allowing a greater proportion of the enzyme to circulate in the active cycle during the steady-state. Why does this occur? There are several possibilities. (a) An increase in cysteine thiolate electronegativity resulting from the loss of the Trp-409 hydrogen bond should weaken the heme-NO bond (31Yoshimura T. OhyaNishiguchi H. Packer L. Bioradicals Detected by ESR Spectroscopy. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1995: 217-235Crossref Google Scholar). (b) Slower heme reduction in the mutants might favor formation of the ferric-NO species during the steady-state from which NO more rapidly dissociates (32Scheele J.S. Bruner E. Kharitonov V.G. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Sharma V.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13105-13110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). (c) Reactivity of the heme-NO complex toward O2 may increase, speeding the return of enzyme molecules to the active cycle. (d) Conversion from a 6- to 5-coordinate ferrous-NO complex may occur (33Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although NO generally dissociates slower from 5-coordinate than from 6-coordinate ferrous hemes (34Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We are presently working to distinguish between these and other potential mechanisms. Given the hyperactivity of the Trp-409 mutants, it is astonishing that a Trp appears at this position in all 29 NOSs sequenced to date. This implies that in nature the most “appropriate” form of NOS may not be a more catalytically active form. Why is this so? Although a definitive answer is still forthcoming, we suspect that this Trp is conserved either to ensure an appropriate rate of heme reduction or to maintain NO complex formation and its resultant effect on enzyme O2 response (29Abu-Soud H.M.

Activation of the epidermal PAF-R leads to the production of PAF, prostaglandins, IL-6, IL-8, and the inducible form of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) (30Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A.

It is not presently known whether the PAF system participates in UVB-induced cytokine production. However, ultraviolet radiation has been reported to be a stimulus for PAF biosynthesis in corneal epithelial cells (11Sheng Y. Birkle D.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, cytokines and the oxidative stress generated in response to UVB irradiation in epidermal cells can cause PAF production in other cell types (31Camussi G. Bussolino F. Salvidio G.

The objective of these studies was to assess whether PAF-R activation can modulate UVB-induced TNF-α production. Using a model system our laboratory has developed by retroviral-mediated gene transduction to express the human PAF-R in the PAF-R-negative human epidermoid cell line KB (24Travers J.B. Murphy R.C.

Routine chemicals, PAF, 1-hexadexyl-2-N-acetyl-3-glycerophosphocholine (CPAF), α-tocopherol (vitamin E), and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Growth media and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was from Intergen (Purchase, NY).

KB cell clones transduced with PAF-R (KBP) or with control MSCV2.1 retrovirus (KBM) were characterized by Southern and Northern blot analysis and by binding and calcium mobilization studies to demonstrate that the KB PAF-R was functional (24Travers J.B. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Pei Y. Morin S.M. Clay K.L. Barber L.A. Hood A.F. Morelli J.G. Williams D.A. Prostaglandins. 1998; 56: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Pei Y. Barber L.A.

All experiments were replicated with at least two different KBP or KBM clones. Epidermal cells were irradiated as described previously (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C.

For studies examining PAF-R agonistic activity, 10-cm dishes containing KBM cells (>90% confluent) were washed three times with HBSS, and 1 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) HBSS with 0.25% bovine serum albumin was added and then UVB-irradiated (FS20 Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, PA). Immediately after irradiation, the reaction was quenched with ice-cold methanol, and lipids were extracted (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (41840) Google Scholar). The chloroform-containing fraction was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and brought up in absolute ethanol for calcium mobilization studies or select ion monitoring gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described previously (12Barber L.A.

Total RNA from KB cells was extracted, and 10 μg of RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis exactly as described previously (30Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C.

Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and TNF-α cDNA probes were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); human COX-1 and COX-2 clones were kind gifts from Dr. Jana Stankova (University of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, CA). TNF-α protein release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously with minor modifications (30Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 200,000/ml on 24-well plates for 24 h, then exposed to media with/without drugs and/or subjected to UVB irradiation. In experiments in which CPAF was used, cells were treated with CPAF or ethanol vehicle (0.1%). For experiments involving PAF antagonists or antioxidants, cells were preincubated with drug, ethanol, or DMSO vehicle (0.5%) for 30 min, and media was replaced with prewarmed media before (400 J/m2) UVB treatment. The medium was collected at various times, and TNF-α was assayed using Quantikine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Similarly treated cells were trypsinized and counted (Coulter). Intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in KB cells plated on glass coverslips were assessed using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously reported (24Travers J.B. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Pei Y. Morin S.M. Clay K.L. Barber L.A. Hood A.F. Morelli J.G. Williams D.A. Prostaglandins. 1998; 56: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Data is presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance is assessed by the Student's t test, and significance is set at p < 0.05. Since PAF may have both receptor-dependent and -independent effects (secondary to the formation of biologically active metabolites), a model system was developed to study the role of the PAF-R in epidermal cell function. This system utilizes the human epidermal cell line KB, which, unlike normal human keratinocytes, does not express functional PAF-Rs (28Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Gelfand E.W.

J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A PAF-R-positive KB cell line was created by transducing KB cells with the replication-defective MSCV2.1 retrovirus containing the entire human PAF-R cDNA (24Travers J.B. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Pei Y. Morin S.M. Clay K.L. Barber L.A. Hood A.F. Morelli J.G. Williams D.A. Prostaglandins. 1998; 56: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the effects of stimuli on both PAF-R-positive (KBP) and -negative (transduced with empty MSCV 2.1 retrovirus; KBM) KB cells, the role of the PAF-R on cytokine production could be readily assessed. Our first studies assessed the ability of PAF-R activation to stimulate TNF-α production using the KBPAF-R model system. KBM and KBP cells were treated with 100 nm metabolically stable PAF-R agonist CPAF for various times, and TNF-α mRNA or released protein was measured. As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of KBP, but not KBM, cells with CPAF resulted in an increased accumulation of TNF-α mRNA. Increased cytokine mRNA was first seen by 30 min, was maximal at 1–2 h, and returned to base line by 6 h. Consistent with the Northern blotting data, CPAF treatment of KBP cells resulted in an increase in immunoreactive TNF-α protein secretion as shown in Fig. 2. CPAF treatment of KBM cells did not result in a significant TNF-α protein secretion. However, treatment of KBM cells with 10 nm PMA did result in increased TNF-α release (data not shown), indicating that the PAF-R is not necessary for the production/release of this cytokine in these cells.Figure 2Measurement of TNF-α protein after treatment of KB cells with CPAF. KBP or KBM cells were incubated with 100 nm CPAF. The supernantants were removed at various times and assayed for immunoreactive TNF-α protein using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of duplicate samples of a representative experiment (of three) and are typical of at least two separate KBM or KBP cells. The asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05); higher levels of TNF-α measured in CPAF-treated KBP versus KBM cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ultraviolet radiation has been shown to stimulate PAF biosynthesis in epidermal cells (11Sheng Y. Birkle D.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our previous studies used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to demonstrate that UVB treatment of KB cells resulted in the biosynthesis of PAF and 1-acyl PAF in KBP but not KBM cells (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as preincubation with PAF-R antagonists and antioxidants inhibited UVB-induced KBP PAF biosynthesis, we hypothesized that this pro-oxidative stressor triggered the production of oxidatively modified phospholipids, which then acted upon the PAF-R-positive KBP (but not KBM cells) to stimulate PAF biosynthesis. To test this hypothesis, lipids were extracted from KBM cells after UVB irradiation and tested for PAF-R agonistic activity by bioassay. Lipid extracts from UVB-irradiated KBM, but not untreated KBM cells, induced transient intracellular calcium mobilization responses in KBP cells (Fig. 3). The peak changes in [Ca2+]i from the lipid extracts were compared with a standard curve derived from authentic C-16 PAF (1-hexadecyl-2-N-acetyl glycerophosphocholine) treatment of KBP cells. In 6 separate experiments, lipid extracts from KBM cells irradiated with 1000 J/m2 contained 782 ± 105 fmol/106 cells (mean ± S.D.) C-16 PAF equivalent biological activity. The Ca2+ flux generated by lipid extracts derived from irradiated KBM cells was inhibited by pretreatment of indo-1-loaded KBP cells with the structurally dissimilar PAF-R antagonists CV-6209 (10 nm) and WEB 2086 (1 μm) (data not shown). In addition, treatment of indo-1-loaded KBM cells with lipid extracts from UVB-treated KBM cells did not result in an increase in [Ca2+]i. Three of the six UVB-irradiated KBM extracts were subjected to select ion gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with deuterated PAF and 1-acyl PAF internal standards (29Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In these specimens, less than 100 fmol/106 cells of either PAF or 1-palmitoyl acyl PAF species were found, consistent with our previous report that UVB does not stimulate the production of PAF or 1-acyl PAF species in PAF-R-negative KB cells (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings indicate that UVB can stimulate the formation of a PAF-R agonistic activity, which our previous mass spectrometry studies indicate is structurally not PAF nor acyl-PAF. Keratinocytes have been shown to synthesize TNF-α in response to UVB (4Kock A. Schwarz T. Kimbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 6Leverkus M. Yaar M. Eller M.S. Tang E.H. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest.

Given the findings that PAF-R activation is a potent stimulus for TNF-α production in epidermal cells and UVB can induce a PAF-R agonistic activity, the next experiments sought to define whether the presence of the PAF-R can modulate UVB-induced TNF-α biosynthesis. KBM and KBP cells were treated with 400 J/m2 UVB, and TNF-α mRNA or released protein was measured at various times after UVB irradiation. As shown in Fig.4, UVB irradiation of KBP cells resulted in a significant increase in the accumulation of TNF-α mRNA in comparison with similarly treated KBM cells. The time course of TNF-α mRNA accumulation in UVB-treated KBP cells appeared to be somewhat similar although of slightly longer duration than that seen in CPAF-treated KBP cells. Unlike UVB-induced accumulation of TNF-α mRNA, COX-2 mRNA levels appeared essentially equal in KBP versus KBM cells (Fig. 4). Both KBM and KBP cells contained similar amounts of COX-1 mRNA levels, which were not affected by CPAF (30Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar) or UVB (not shown) treatment. Consistent with the Northern blotting data, UVB treatment of KBP cells resulted in increased TNF-α protein secretion in KBP over KBM cells (Fig.5). As has been previously reported for wild-type KB (4Kock A. Schwarz T. Kimbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), UVB treatment of KBM cells did result in increased levels of TNF-α protein release, albeit at much lower amounts than in KBP cells.Figure 5Measurement of TNF-α protein after treatment of KB cells with UVB. KBP or KBM cells were irradiated with 400 J/m2 UVB, and the supernatants were removed at various times and assayed for immunoreactive TNF-α. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of duplicate samples of a representative experiment (of three) and are typical of at least two separate KBM or KBP clones. The asterisk denotes statistical significance (p< 0.05); higher levels of TNF-α were measured in UVB-treated KBP versus KBM cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of pretreatment with a PAF-R antagonist or antioxidant to inhibit UVB-stimulated TNF-α release in KBP cells was next assessed. As shown in Fig. 6 A, pretreatment of KBP cells with the antioxidant vitamin E inhibited subsequent TNF-α production in response to UVB stimulation. Similarly, other antioxidants 1,1,3,3-tetramethylthiourea (1 mm) and N-acetyl cysteine (10 mm) inhibited UVB-induced TNF-α production in KBP cells (data not shown). However, vitamin E (or other antioxidants) did not affect TNF-α release in response to CPAF (Fig. 6 B). In addition, preincubation of KBP cells with 10 μm PAF-R antagonists WEB 2086 or A-85783 inhibited both UVB- and CPAF-induced TNF-α production (Fig. 6, A and B). However, vitamin E or these PAF-R antagonists did not affect TNF-α production in response to UVB in KBM cells (Fig. 6 C). Incubation of KB cells with antioxidants or PAF-R antagonists did not affect base-line TNF-α release (data not shown). Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis that UVB can stimulate the formation of a soluble PAF-R agonistic activity, which then can act upon a PAF-R-expressing cell to augment TNF-α production. These studies provide evidence that the epidermal PAF-R may be involved in UVB-induced cytokine production. The study of PAF/PAF-R is limited by the rapid metabolism of PAF and the fact that PAF metabolites can exert biological activity independent of the PAF-R (16Wilcox R.W. Wykle R.L. Bass D.A. Lipids. 1987; 22: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,17Travers J.B. Sprecher H. Fertel R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The model system used in these studies was developed to overcome some of the current limitations in the study of PAF/PAF-R and to account for the diverse ligands recognized by the PAF-R (19Smiley P.L.

Prostaglandins. 1998; 56: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In particular, this model system can account for non-PAF PAF-R agonists such as sn-2 short chain phosphocholines, which have been shown to be produced in response to lipid peroxidation (reviewed in Refs. 35Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 11618-16615Google Scholar and 36Murphy R.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 416: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the KB PAF-R resulted in an increased accumulation of TNF-α mRNA and protein. Similarly, PAF treatment of monocytes and endothelial cells also has been reported to increase TNF-α biosynthesis (37Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 38Ruis N.M. Rose J.K. Valone F.H. Lipids. 1991; 26: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as TNF-α is a known stimulus for PAF biosynthesis in these same cell types (31Camussi G. Bussolino F. Salvidio G. Bagglioni C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), this lipid mediator and cytokine could be involved in pathophysiological effects ascribed to each other through positive feedback mechanisms. Characterization of this complex relationship between PAF and TNF-α could have therapeutic implications given the availability of PAF-R antagonists. Our previous studies have demonstrated that expression of the PAF-R leads to enhanced apoptosis in response to UVB treatment (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This augmentation of UVB-induced apoptosis seen in KBP over KBM cells was inhibited by pretreatment with antioxidants and PAF-R antagonists. The present experiments show that UVB treatment can generate a biologically active PAF-like activity in KB cells. However, mass spectrometry studies indicate these lipid extracts do not contain PAF or 1-acyl PAF species (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the pro-oxidative stressor UVB can generate oxidized phospholipids with PAF-like activity. Recent evidence from several laboratories indicate that free radical-induced oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position of glycerophosphocholines results in non-PAF PAF-R agonists (39Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 40Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witzum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke E. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This activity has been demonstrated in association with oxidized low density lipoprotein and after exposure of rodents to the known oxidant cigarette smoke (41Lehr H.A. Weyrich A.S. Saetzler R.K. Jurek A. Arfors K.E. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2358-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The production of this potent biological activity would be expected to be dependent upon the amount of free radical-induced damage and the redox state of the cell, unlike the tightly regulated enzymatic biosynthesis of native PAF. Although this non-PAF PAF-R activity generated in response to oxidative stress has been reproduced in several laboratories in various model systems, the exact structures of the active metabolites are not known at this time. Consistent with the ability of UVB to generate PAF-R agonistic activity, UVB irradiation resulted in increased TNF-α mRNA accumulation and protein release in KBP over KBM cells. That UVB appeared to increase COX-2 mRNA levels independent of PAF-R expression suggests different mechanisms for the induction of these two UVB-induced proteins. The significance of COX-2 in epidermal function is not clear. However, high amounts of COX-2 protein have been reported in carcinomas (42DuBois R.N. Radhika A. Reddy B.S. Entingh A.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1259-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The ability of the known tumor initiator and promoter UVB to up-regulate this protein in epidermal cells in vitro as well as in vivo has suggested possible involvement of COX-2 in epidermal carcinogenesis (43Buckman S.Y. Gresham A. Hale F. Hruza G. Anast J. Masferrer J. Pentland A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In addition to the ability of UVB to generate PAF-R agonistic activity, several other possible mechanisms exist that could explain in part the ability of the PAF-R to augment UVB-induced TNF-α production. One possibility is that UVB could have inhibitory effects on PAF-acetylhydrolase enzymes. Indeed, oxidative stress has been reported to inactivate these enzymes that serve to degrade PAF and short-chained sn-2 glycerophosphocholines (44Ambrosio G. Oriente A. Napoli C. Palumbo G. Chiarello P. Marone G. Condorelli M. Chiarello M. Triggiani M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that UVB is activating the PAF-R directly. Although UV radiation has been reported to activate growth factor or TNF type 1 receptors directly (i.e. independent of ligand) (45Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 46Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it is not known whether UV can activate a G protein membrane receptor. The ability of preincubation of KBP cells with antioxidants or the PAF-R antagonists WEB 2086 and A-82587 to inhibit this UVB-induced augmentation of TNF-α production in KBP cells would not be expected to differentiate PAF-R activation due to the production of a soluble PAF-R activity versus direct activation. However, the finding of a soluble PAF-R activity in UVB-irradiated KB cells suggests that this activity is responsible for a component of UVB-induced PAF-R activation. We hypothesize oxidized lipids with PAF-R activity as the source of this PAF-R agonistic activity in KB cells. Future studies will attempt to structurally characterize this PAF-like activity as well as to define whether UVB can activate G protein receptors directly. Although human keratinocytes synthesize PAF (27Michel L. Denizot Y. Thomas Y. Jean-Louis F. Heslan M. Benveniste J. Dubertret L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 576-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Travers J.B. Harrison K.A. Johnson C.A. Clay K.L. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest.

J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the role of the PAF-R in epidermal cell function is not clear. These studies suggest that one of the functions of the epidermal PAF-R could be to augment production of the known proinflammatory and cytotoxic cytokine TNF-α in response to UVB radiation. Although UVB can stimulate more TNF-α production in KBP over KBM cells, ongoing studies indicate that the augmentation of UVB-induced apoptosis seen in KBP over KBM cells (12Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is not affected by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) or RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (0.1 mg/ml). The lack of effects by these inhibitors at dosages that inhibit KB protein/RNA synthesis suggests that endogenous TNF-α production does not play an important role in PAF-R augmentation of UVB-induced apoptosis in these cells. However, increased TNF-α production by epidermal cells could certainly modulate cutaneous inflammation given the potent pro-inflammatory effects of this cytokine (7Bazzoni F. Beutler B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). The ability of the PAF-R to recognize oxidatively modified glycerophosphocholines produced in response to noxious stimuli and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α fits with the notion that the epidermal PAF-R may act as an endogenous “damage sensor.” Inasmuch as certain populations are potentially more susceptible to PAF effects due to inherited or acquired PAF-acetylhydrolase deficiencies (reviewed in Ref. 47Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), these findings may have clinical implications. A better understanding of the functions of the PAF system in keratinocyte biology and cutaneous inflammation may lead to therapeutic interventions designed around this lipid mediator.

GAIP, Gα-interacting protein maltese-binding protein The accumulation of neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes is a major characteristic of inflammatory processes. Many of the responses of monocytes to infection are regulated by chemoattractant or proinflammatory factors. N-Formyl-methionyl peptides (e.g. N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)),1 complement component C5a, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) are some of the most potent chemoattractant stimuli (1Johnston Jr., R.B.

These small peptide or lipid factors bind to high affinity cell surface receptors and trigger chemotactic migration and activation of the inflammatory response (6Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B.

G-proteins, or heterotrimeric GTP-binding regulatory proteins, have been implicated in regulation of the response to chemoattractant ligands through biochemical studies of the effects of GTP analogues on chemoattractant factor binding and activation of phospholipases in permeabilized cells and membranes (3Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, pertussis toxin, which blocks the activation of certain G-proteins, inhibits the chemoattractant response (4Schepers T.M. McLeish K.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G-proteins are essential elements of many transmembrane signaling pathways involved in coupling receptors for extracellular mediators to a variety of second messenger-generated effector enzymes or ion channels (9Wilk Blaszczak M.A. Singer W.D. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Belardetti F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G-proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits (8Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 177-198PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The inactive G-protein is a GDP-bound heterotrimer. Ligand-bound activated receptors catalyze the exchange of GDP by GTP, leading to dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ dimer and signal transduction by the separated G-protein subunits (Gα and Gβγ). Recent experiments provided evidence that chemotaxis is mediated by Gβγ dimers released by activation of Gα-coupled receptors (12Arai H. Tsou C.-L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14484-14494Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit deactivates G-proteins by allowing heterotrimers to reform (14Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Many G-protein-mediated signaling pathways become desensitized after stimulation. One such mechanism involves phosphorylation of the G-protein-coupled receptor by protein kinases thereby uncoupling the receptor from interaction with the transducing G-protein (15Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recently discovered mechanism of desensitization results from interaction of the Gα protein with members of a family of proteins termed RGS proteins (regulators of G-protein signaling). At least 18 members of this protein family have been described in mammals (17Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Members of the mammalian RGS family have been shown to induce desensitization in yeast (21Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of RGS-induced desensitization was revealed by the demonstration that RGS proteins in vitro interact specifically with the activated form of Gα subunits and accelerate hydrolysis of GTP (19Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar,23Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Studies of the phototransduction cascade have demonstrated that different modes of desensitization complement each other. Phosphorylation of the receptor (rhodopsin) leads to rapid deactivation controlling the amplitude of the response, whereas G-protein (transducin) deactivation by hydrolysis of GTP is rate-limiting for shut off of the phototransduction cascade and controls recovery (27Sagoo M.S. Lagnado L. Nature. 1997; 389: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Patterns of specificity between individual RGS proteins and subfamilies of Gα proteins are only beginning to emerge (28Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). RGS proteins investigated so far can serve as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for the Gi and Gq but not the Gssubfamily of α subunits. In the experiments purified, GTP-loaded Gα subunits were used as substrates under conditions in which one round of hydrolysis could be initiated by the prebound nucleotide (19Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 23Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Although these experiments have established the GAP activity of RGS proteins, it has not been possible to define the specific receptor to which a particular RGS protein couples. Besides acting as a GAP, there is evidence that RGS proteins may also interfere directly with activated Gα subunits, e.g. by occlusion of the binding site of Gα for phospholipase Cβ (28Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 29Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Little information is available on the distribution and the subcellular localization of RGS proteins, with the exception of GAIP, which was demonstrated to be membrane-anchored (20De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate the distribution and subcellular localization of RGS1. By showing that RGS1 enhances chemoattractant-induced GTPase activity in plasma membranes from Bt2cAMP-treated human monocytic U937 and THP1 cells, we provide evidence that the receptors for the chemoattractants fMLP, C5a, and LTB4 are desensitized by RGS1 and that a mixture of ligand-stimulated plasma membranes and recombinant RGS proteins can be used to investigate G-protein and RGS protein interaction. The use of ligand-stimulated plasma membranes allowed us to rule out a possible activity of RGS1 as promoter of GDP-GTP exchange. The following reagents were obtained as indicated: [α-32P]CTP, [α-32P]GTP, [γ-32P]GTP, [γ-35S]GTPγS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), C5a, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma); leukotriene B4 (LTB4), pertussis toxin (Calbiochem); IFNγ (Imukin®-Thomae); mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) reactive with the HA tag, anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); mouse monoclonal antibody (T56/14) reactive with the transferrin receptor/CD71 (Oncogene Science); goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate, goat anti-mouse peroxidase, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch); AlexaTM 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Polyclonal antisera against RGS1 and WRS/tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase were made in rabbits by standard immunization protocols using a GST-RGS1 fusion protein and a MBP-WRS fusion protein, respectively. Polyclonal RGS1 antiserum was affinity purified using N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose High Performance HiTrap® columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) covalently coupled with (i) purified GST protein, (ii) purified MBP protein, and (iii) purified MBP-RGS1 fusion protein, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody activity of the fractions was tested by Western blot analysis. Pooled poly(A)+ RNA isolated from untreated U937 and THP1 cells was used for construction of a directional cDNA library in Eco RI-Xba I-digested λ GEM®2 vector arms according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega); subsequently biotinylated cRNA was generated utilizing the “MEGAscriptTM T7 in Vitro Transcription kit” (Ambion) modified by exchanging UTP for Biotin-21-UTP (CLONTECH). Poly(A)+ RNA from TPA/IFNγ- and IFNγ-treated U937 and THP1 cells was pooled (induced poly(A)+ RNA pool), and cDNA was generated using the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene). After alkaline hydrolysis to remove RNA templates, the induced cDNA was subtracted twice with uninduced cRNA. Biotinylated sequences and hybrids were removed by adding 20 μg of streptavidin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and extraction with phenol. Second strand synthesis was performed after rehybridization of the subtracted single strand cDNA to the induced poly(A)+ RNA. cDNA was unidirectionally ligated into λ ZAP® II vector digested with Eco RI-Xho I (Stratagene) and in vitro packaged using ZAP-cDNA® Gigapack® III (Stratagene). The subtracted library was screened for TPA/IFNγ-induced genes using a highly labeled [32P]-cDNA probe, which was prepared from the induced poly(A)+ RNA pool and subtracted twice with cRNA from uninduced cells using the above described procedure. By screening 75,000 colonies from the subtracted library with the subtracted cDNA probe 2789 single clones were isolated. Five of the cDNAs analyzed were coding for RGS1 (30Hong J.X. Wilson G.L. Fox C.H. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3895-3904PubMed Google Scholar). Excision of the pBluescript phagemid from the λ ZAP® II vector was performed using the ExAssistTM helper phage resulting in RGS1/pBluescript vector SK(−). The RGS1 cDNA coding for 196 aa was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAATTCCCAGGAATGTTCTTCTCTG-3′ (aa position +2) and oligonucleotide 5′-GCTCTAGACTGGCACATTCCTTCGTG-3′ (63 nucleotides 3′ of the stop codon). The PCR product was cloned into pT7-vector (Novagen), digested with Bgl II and Sal I, and ligated in frame into the Bam HI/Sal I sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) resulting in plasmid pGEX4T1 RGS1. The DNA sequence was determined by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems and Perkin-Elmer) to confirm its proper insertion into the vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and induced at an A600 of 0.5 by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm final concentration) to express the GST-RGS1 fusion protein. After a 2-h induction at 37 °C, cells were harvested, and GST-RGS1 fusion protein was prepared and purified in a batch procedure using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RGS1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATCCCCAGGAATGTTCTTCTCTG-3′ to introduce a Bam HI at the 5′-end of RGS1 (aa position +2), and oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGATCCCTTTAGGCTATTAGCCTGC-3′ to introduce a Bam HI site at the 3′-end of RGS1 (aa position 195). The 601-base pair PCR product was digested with Bam HI and subcloned into the Bam HI site of the mammalian expression vector pEVRFO (31Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), resulting in expression of carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged RGS1, termed RGS1 HA tag. The same Bam HI-digested 601-base pair PCR product was subcloned into the Bam HI site of His tag vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and expression of the fusion protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 2-h induction at 37 °C, cells were harvested, and the His-tagged RGS1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat, Raji, THP1, HL-60, and U937 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.); HaCat and HeLa S3 cells were grown as adherent cells using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/HAM's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For treatment with 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cells were seeded at densities of 5 × 105/ml. TPA was added for 48 h at a final concentration of 20 nm for THP1 cells, and at a final concentration of 10 nm for U937, Jurkat, Raji, HaCat, and HeLa S3 cells. Recombinant human IFNγ was used in a final concentration of 1000 units/ml for 24 h. For induction with Bt2cAMP the medium was supplemented with 1 mmBt2cAMP for 72 h. For immunofluorescence studies CHO cells (5 × 104/well) were plated on 24-well tissue culture plates covered with clear glass coverslips (12 mm diameter, Assistent, Sondheim/Rhön, Germany). Cells were cultured overnight and transfected with LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For preparing cell extracts CHO cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105/6-cm dish, cultured overnight, and transfected with LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation. B- and T-cells were isolated from the mononuclear fraction using MACS Beads (Miltenyi) (anti-CD19 for B-cells and anti CD3 for T-cells). Monocytes were prepared by adherence. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed greater than 95% purity of monocytes, T-cells, and B-cells. Total RNA was prepared using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride gradient procedure (32Birnboim H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Glisin V. Crkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA/slot were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred by capillary blotting with 20× SSC onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA was covalently UV cross-linked to the membrane (Stratagene UV cross-linker). A digoxigenin-labeled RGS1 riboprobe was generated in a standard transcription assay with T3 RNA polymerase using the digoxigenin-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after linearization of the RGS1/pBluescript vector SK(−) (Stratagene) with Xho I. Following hybridization the membranes were developed by DIG detection according to the manufacturer's luminescent detection protocol (CSPD, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Aliquots of 1 × 106 cell pellets were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-disc gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. After blocking the membranes with blocking buffer (PBS containing 1.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at RT, membranes were washed one time with WP (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) followed by incubation for 2 h at RT with anti-RGS1 rabbit antiserum and mAb 12CA5, respectively. Membranes were washed four times with WP and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse, respectively, for 1 h at RT. After washing four times with WP, relevant proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet of 2 × 107 cells was stored at −70 °C prior to membrane production. The frozen cell pellet was thawed by resuspending in 5 volumes of ice-cold TEmp buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 28 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). Subsequently, cells were homogenized by 25 firm strokes using a Dounce homogenizer (5 ml) with a tight fitting pestle and passed through a 27-gauge syringe needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. Membranes were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction. The membrane containing pellet was washed in TEmp buffer and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in TEmp buffer at a final protein concentration between 1 and 3 mg/ml, aliquoted, and stored until use at −70 °C. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was determined in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 3 μg of membrane protein, 1 mm App(NH)P, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ouabain, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 2.5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 μm GTP, and [γ-32P]GTP (0.5 μCi/reaction mixture). Agonists were added as indicated in the figures and reactions started by addition of membranes to the incubation mixture and incubation at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 900 μl of a 5% (w/v) ice-cold activated charcoal slurry in 20 mm phosphoric acid, pH 2.3, resulting in a total volume of 1000 μl. To pellet the charcoal along with unhydrolyzed [γ-32P]GTP, tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 500 μl of the supernatant fluid containing the free [32Pi] were removed and used for determination of Cerenkov radiation. Low affinity hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was assessed by incubating in the presence of 100 μm GTP. Blank values were determined by replacement of membrane protein with TE (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0); the maximal GTP hydrolysis was determined by counting 500 μl of a 1:10 diluted mixture directly. Low affinity hydrolysis and blank values were less than 1% of the total [γ-32P]GTP present in the assay. After subtracting the blank values, the rate of hydrolysis of GTP was calculated as followed: C/S.A. × 2 × 1000/P × 1/t; where C indicates the counts determined in the 500-μl sample; S.A. indicates the specific activity of the GTP (each assay tube contained 50 pmol of cold GTP; the specific activity per pmol is the maximal activity/50);P indicates the amount of protein present in μg; and t indicates the time of the assay. This calculation gives the rate of hydrolysis of GTP in pmol/min/mg of membrane protein. Binding assays were performed at 30 °C in an incubation mixture (100 μl) containing 5 μg of membrane protein, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm GDP, and 112.5 fmol of [35S]GTPγS. Agonists were added as noted in the figures, and reactions were started by the addition of membranes to the prewarmed (30 °C) reaction mixture. The reaction was terminated at various time points by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters under vacuum and three washes with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (dried GF/C filters were placed in a scintillation vial along with 20 ml of scintillation fluid (LSC safety mixture, Baker/Holland), mixed, and left in the dark for 12 h). Nonspecific binding is defined by the binding that was not competed for by 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS; nonspecific binding was less than 1% of the total [35S]GTPγS present in the assay. Blank values were determined by replacing membrane protein with TE. CHO cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in PBS, 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.05% Nonidet P-40. TPA-treated THP1 cells were trypsinated with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed with PBS, placed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass microscope slides for 15 min, fixed in 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.1% Saponin. Following permeabilization cells were rinsed three times with PBS, incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0, 1% Tween 20 and 10% fetal calf serum) for 30 min at RT, followed by incubation with the first antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at RT. After four washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. Cells were washed four times with PBS and mounted with coverslips in PermaFluor (Immunotech) to stabilize fluorescence. Laser scanning microscopy was performed by M. Rohde (GBF, Braunschweig, Germany) using a Zeiss inverted microscope and a scanning confocal imaging system (MRC1024-UV, Bio-Rad) equipped with a 5-milliwatt krypton/argon laser (488, 568, and 647 nm) and a T1/E2 filter set for detection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies. Images were collected with a PlanNeofluar 63× oil NA 1.25 objective and were processed using Bio-Rad LaserSharp 3.1T software. Optical sections were obtained at 0.2-μm intervals (CHO cells) and 1.0-μm intervals, respectively (THP1 cells). Human monocyte THP1 and U937 cells were differentiated by treatment with TPA and IFNγ. Genes expressed during differentiation were isolated by subtractive cloning procedures. One cDNA obtained was identified as RGS1. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that expression of RGS1 in THP1 and U937 cells was restricted to treatment with TPA (Fig.1 A). In line with the original characterization of RGS1 as a protein inducible by mitogenic stimuli in B-cells (30Hong J.X. Wilson G.L. Fox C.H. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3895-3904PubMed Google Scholar, 34Newton J.S. Deed R.W. Mitchell E.L. Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), significant levels of RGS1 mRNA expression were observed in TPA-treated Raji B-cells (Fig. 1 B); no expression was found in Jurkat T-cells, epithelial HeLa cells, and HaCat keratinocytes with or without prior TPA treatment (data not shown). Analysis of purified populations of monocytes, B-cells, and T-cells from peripheral blood demonstrated that expression of RGS1 mRNA is confined to monocytes (Fig. 1 B). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant RGS1 protein. Specificity of the antibody was controlled by analysis of CHO cells transfected with an HA-tagged RGS1 expression construct (Fig.2 A) and demonstrated a major protein of 25 kDa. Due to the insertion of the HA tag, the recombinant protein is slightly larger than the native RGS1 protein; the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 directed against the HA epitope recognized a protein of identical molecular weight in protein extracts from transfected CHO cells (lower part of Fig.2 A). In Western blots of total proteins from TPA-treated THP1 cells, the RGS1 antiserum recognized a protein of 22 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of RGS1. To eliminate cross-reactivity, the antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography (compare Fig. 2 B, lane 2 with lane 1). Specificity of the antibody was further demonstrated by preincubation with excess RGS1 antigen eliminating the recognition of the 22-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Western blots of total cellular proteins confirmed the results of the mRNA analysis. RGS1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was restricted to monocytes (Fig. 2 C). RGS1 expression in Raji B-cells and in cells of the monocyte lineage (U937 and THP1) was observed only after treatment with TPA (Fig. 2 D). For unknown reasons RGS1 frequently appears as a double band in Western blot analysis. The distribution of RGS1 was assessed in crude membrane (100,000 × g pellet) and cytosolic (100,000 × g supernatant) fractions prepared from CHO cells transiently expressing HA-tagged RGS1. RGS1 was associated with the membrane fraction (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). When this fraction was treated with 0.1m Na2CO3 (pH 11.3) to strip peripheral membrane proteins (35Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), RGS1 to a large extent remained associated with the membrane fraction (see Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that RGS1 in part behaves as an integral membrane protein.

The process is well conserved among eukaryotes and requires the participation of several initiation factors as well as specific features at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the message (reviewed in Refs. 1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar and 2Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The first step is the recognition of the m7G cap structure, present at the 5′-end of all cellular mRNAs, by eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 4E (the cap-binding protein), which, together with eIF4G, forms the core of the eIF4F complex. In mammalian cells, eIF4F contains a third subunit, initiation factor eIF4A. The poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of most cellular mRNAs acts, like the cap structure, as a translational enhancer. The complex formed by the poly(A) tail and the associated poly(A) tail-binding protein stimulates 40 S subunit recruitment to the mRNA and, in combination with the cap complex, synergistically activates translation initiation (3Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Sachs A.B. Davis R.W.

Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). RNA secondary structures in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA that might impede ribosome binding are then melted by the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A in conjunction with eIF4B, an RNA-binding protein that stimulates eIF4A activity (7Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Methot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The eIF4F complex exhibits higher helicase activity than eIF4A alone (9Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and eIF4A has been proposed to cycle in and out of the eIF4F complex during translation initiation (10Pause A. Methot N. Svitkin Y. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Once the mRNA is unfolded, the 43 S preinitiation complex binds probably through interaction of eIF4G and eIF4B with ribosome-bound eIF3 (11Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar,12Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the preinitiation complex scans the 5′-untranslated region for the translation initiation codon. A key player in translation initiation that coordinates all these steps by acting as a molecular adapter is initiation factor eIF4G (13Hentze M. Science. 1997; 275: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two related eIF4G proteins (eIF4G1 and eIF4G2) encoded by two different genes exist in plants (reviewed in Ref. 14Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), mammals (15Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). eIF4G helps to recruit 43 S preinitiation complexes by acting as a bridge between eIF4E bound to the cap, poly(A) tail-binding protein bound to the poly(A) tail, and eIF3 bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Additionally, mammalian eIF4G contains two binding sites for eIF4A, one in the middle (amino acids 478–883) and one in the C-terminal part (amino acids 1045–1404) of the protein (17Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), that recruit the helicase to the eIF4F complex. Whereas the amino acid sequence of the middle part is conserved among human, yeast, and plant eIF4G, the C-terminal part seems to be unique to the mammalian factor. Yeast eIF4G possess no corresponding region, and plant eIF(iso)4G possess part of the domain with low homology (12%). It is not clear yet whether the two binding sites on mammalian eIF4G bind a single eIF4A molecule or whether they independently interact with two molecules of eIF4A. Depending on the isolation procedure, plant eIF4A, like its mammalian counterpart, can be recovered in a complex with eIF4G. However, yeast eIF4A could thus far not be detected in eIF4F complexes purified by m7GDP affinity chromatography (18Lanker S. Müller P.P. Altmann M. Goyer C. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21167-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, eIF4A is an essential protein encoded by two genes, TIF1 and TIF2 (19Linder P. Slonimski P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2286-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is required for translation of most, if not, all mRNAs (20Altmann M. Blum S. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Wilson T.M. Trachsel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Altmann M. Blum S. Wilson T.M. Trachsel H.

A. 1992; 89: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but its role in translation initiation is not entirely clear. Even mRNAs with AUG start codons positioned close to the cap and with little RNA secondary structure in their 5′-untranslated regions are still dependent on eIF4A for translation (22Blum S. Schmid S.R. Pause A. Buser P. Linder P. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7664-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The requirement of eIF4A for translation initiation and our inability to recover it as part of the eIF4F complex in yeast prompted us to directly address the question of whether yeast eIF4A and eIF4G interact and whether this interaction is physiologically relevant for translation initiation. Using purified recombinant proteins, we demonstrate direct binding of eIF4A to eIF4G1 and map the interaction domain to a portion of the eIF4G1 protein between amino acids 542 and 883. We show that this fragment of eIF4G1 functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of translation in an eIF4A-dependent in vitro system and of cell growth in vivo, most probably because it competes with eIF4G for eIF4A binding. Both translation and cell growth can be rescued by increasing the eIF4A concentration, indicating that, in yeast, the eIF4G-eIF4A interaction is essential for translation and cell growth. eIF4G1 constructs were derived from pUC8.4. This plasmid carries the complete TIF4631 open reading frame introduced into pUC8 as an Eco RI fragment from plasmid pCG8.4 (16Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Six histidine residues were introduced at the C terminus by polymerase chain reaction. For bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, vectors pGEX-1λT, pGEX-2T, pGEX-3X, and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. To obtain eIF4G1-(1–952), the Eco RI fragment of pUC8.4 was subcloned into pGEX-2T. eIF4G1-(542–883) and eIF4G1-(492–539) were subcloned as Bgl II fragments into the Bam HI site of pGEX-1λT, and eIF4G1-(441–952) was subcloned as an Eco RV-Eco RI fragment into the Sma I-Eco RI sites of pGEX-3X. The Bgl II fragment of pUC8.4 encoding eIF4G1-(542–883) was also subcloned into the Bam HI site of pGEX-6P-1. eIF4G1-(441–539), eIF4G1-(592–953), and eIF4G1-(592–862) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pUC8.4 as template. The construction of eIF4G1-(160–492) and eIF4G1-(883–952) has been described previously (23Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Plasmid pYEX-GST-eIF4G1-(542–883) was made by introducing the 1023-base pair Bgl II fragment of pUC8.4 into the Bam HI site of pYEX-4T (AMRAD Biotech). Plasmid pGEX-TIF1 was made by polymerase chain reaction on plasmid pGAL-TIF1 (24Blum S. Mueller M. Schmid S.R. Linder P. Trachsel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6043-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the fragment was then introduced into pGEX-6P-1. The same fragment was subcloned into vector pEGKG (25Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pEGKG.eIF4A. p301-HIS3-eIF4A was made by introducing the Bam HI-Sac I fragment of pGAL-TIF1 into the yeast centromeric vector p301-HIS3 (26Niederberger N. Trachsel H. Altmann M. RNA. 1998; 4: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast cells was done by the lithium acetate method (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A.

Precultures were grown overnight and diluted 1:50 in 1 liter of LB medium. After 2 h of growth, synthesis of the fusion proteins was induced with a 1 mm final concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (MBI Fermentas). Cells were collected after 4 h, resuspended in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in a French press at 1000 p.s.i. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. For the experiments in Figs. 1 and2, batch purification of GST-eIF4G1 and GST-eIF4G1 fragments was performed by incubating the extracts with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with 1 ml of buffer A (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mmdithiothreitol).Figure 2Interaction between yeast recombinant eIF4A and GST-eIF4G1.

RNase A (25 μg/ml) was included in the reaction where indicated. Following four washing steps with 1 ml of buffer A each (tubes were changed before the last wash), bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. All SPR assays were performed in an IAsys (Affinity Sensors, Thermobio Inc., Cambridge, United Kingdom). Purified eIF4A (60 ng) was immobilized on a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated carboxylate cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions. eIF4G1-(542–883), eIF4G1-(592–862), and eIF4G1-(592–953) were then injected over the chip. Each cycle consisted of a 200-μl injection of the indicated amount of purified proteins in buffer A. The chip was regenerated after each cycle by washing three times with 200 μl of 100 mm HCl (pH 1.5) and five times with 200 μl of buffer A. The response of the eIF4A-coated chip with 200 μl of buffer A was fixed as a base line. Data were analyzed using IAsys FAST-fit software. To calculate the Kd of eIF4G1-(542–883) binding to eIF4A, three concentrations of eIF4G1-(542–883) were used (50, 125, and 250 nm). Strains CWO4 and DDY6 were grown overnight in 2 liters of YPGal at 32 °C. Exponentially growing cells (A600 nm ∼ 0.5–1) were pelleted, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed with glass beads by vortexing eight times for 30 s each. Following clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 30 min, 40 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation was continued for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After three washes with a total of 12 ml of buffer A (tubes were changed before the last wash), the GST-eIF4A fusion protein and the associated proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Strains DDY9 and DDY10 were grown on minimal medium with glucose as carbon source. Cells from a 50-ml culture (A600 nm ∼ 0.7) were collected and lysed in 500 μl of buffer A. The clarified lysates were incubated with 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads for 2.5 h at 4 °C and washed as described above. GST and GST-eIF4G1-(542–883) together with the associated proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described (30Berset C. Trachsel H. Altmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4264-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Primary polyclonal antibodies (used in a 1:1000 dilution) were rat anti-eIF4A (24Blum S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3820-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and rat anti-p20 (23Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Preparation of the eIF4A-dependent translation system and translation reactions were as described (24Blum S. Mueller M. Schmid S.R. Linder P. Trachsel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6043-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recombinant eIF4A and eIF4G1-(542–883) proteins were preincubated at room temperature for 5 min in Tris-buffered saline. To study the putative interaction between yeast eIF4G and eIF4A, the gene encoding eIF4G1 (TIF4631) was inserted into the pGEX-2T vector and expressed in bacteria as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. eIF4G1 immobilized on GSH-Sepharose resin was incubated with an RSW fraction enriched in initiation factors. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of eIF4A was determined by immunoblotting (Fig.1). The eIF4A polypeptide from RSW was specifically retained when eIF4G1 was bound to the beads (Fig.1 C, lane 2), but not with control GST (lane 9), indicating that the two proteins do interact directly or indirectly. To map more precisely the region within eIF4G1 responsible for the interaction, several deletion mutants were created and expressed in E. coli as N-terminal GST fusions (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar amounts of protein were purified by GSH-Sepharose affinity column and assayed for eIF4A binding. Most of the GST fusion proteins contained smaller peptides, which are probably C-terminal degradation products, as has been previously observed for both mammalian (33De Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA. 1998; 4: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and yeast (34Tarun S.J. Wells S.E. Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35Tarun S.J. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) eIF4G preparations. The concentration of the full-length products was then estimated from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel, and approximately equal amounts of fusion proteins were used for the binding experiments. The fragment eIF4G1-(160–492) migrated abnormally slowly on SDS gels (Figs.1 B and 2 A, lanes 2). This domain is probably responsible for the abnormal migration of eIF4G in SDS-PAGE (16Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) since the other eIF4G1 fragments displayed normal electrophoretic mobilities. The region of the eIF4G1 polypeptide from amino acids 542 to 883 (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) and a larger fragment containing this part (eIF4G1-(441–952); lane 3) were able to retain eIF4A in the resin (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and 5), but not other parts of the protein. To test the specificity of the binding experiment, eIF4E binding to the eIF4G1 fragments was used as a control. The binding site for eIF4E on eIF4G1 is known to reside between amino acids 441 and 490 (23Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As expected, eIF4E specifically bound to full-length eIF4G1 (Fig.1 C, lane 2) and to those fragments that still harbored the eIF4E-binding site (lanes 3, 4, and 6); very low levels of eIF4E were also recovered after incubation with eIF4G1-(542–883) (lane 5), but they were close to the background levels detected with GST alone (lane 9). The slower migrating band in lane 7 corresponds to a degradation product of eIF4G1-(492–539) (see lane 6 of Fig. 1 B), which probably nonspecifically bound the anti-eIF4E antibodies because of the large amount of protein present. Binding of eIF4A to eIF4G1-(542–883) seems to be specific since Prt1, a subunit of eIF3 (29Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not bind to it. On the other hand, Prt1 interacted with full-length eIF4G1 and some of the other eIF4G1 fragments (data not shown). In the experiments shown in Fig.1 C, the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of 25 μg/ml RNase A to exclude interactions mediated by RNA. We conclude from these data that yeast eIF4G1 is capable of interacting with eIF4A either directly or through other factor(s) present in the RSW fraction. To exclude the possibility that binding of eIF4A to eIF4G1 is mediated by other factor(s) present in RSW, a GST-eIF4A fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, and the GST moiety was removed with PreScission protease. Binding of purified eIF4A to the eIF4G1 fragments and to GST was then assayed (Fig. 2). Recombinant eIF4A was capable of binding to full-length eIF4G1 (Fig.2 B, lane 2) and to fragments eIF4G1-(441–952) (lane 4) and eIF4G1-(542–883) (lane 5), but not to GST alone (lane 9). In this particular experiment, the amount of eIF4G1-(441–952) immobilized on the resin was at least five times lower than that of other proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), explaining the lower recovery of eIF4A. In addition, eIF4G1-(441–539) (Fig. 2 B, lane 6), encompassing the eIF4E-binding site and an arginine/serine-rich region, did interact weakly with eIF4A. This interaction was not apparent when RSW was used as the source for eIF4A (Figs. 1 C and2 B, compare lanes 6). The significance of this interaction was not further evaluated. Although more eIF4A bound to eIF4G1-(542–883) than to the full-length protein, estimation of the relative affinities is complicated by the presence of the numerous eIF4G1 degradation products, some of which might still interact with eIF4A. The same results were obtained when the binding reaction was performed in the presence of 25 μg/ml RNase A (data not shown). Together, these results show that eIF4A binds directly to a domain of eIF4G1 comprising amino acids 542–883. To verify that eIF4G1-(542–883) harbors an eIF4A-binding site, the interaction between the two proteins was analyzed by other techniques. Incubation of equimolar amounts of eIF4A and eIF4G1-(542–883) showed that they form a stable complex that can be purified by gel filtration chromatography. The size of the complex is consistent with a 1:1 ratio between the two proteins (data not shown). The interaction of eIF4A with some eIF4G1 fragments was then also measured by SPR analysis (Fig. 3). eIF4G1-(542–883) interacted strongly with eIF4A. No binding of eIF4G1-(592–862) was detected, whereas eIF4G1-(592–953) exhibited a greatly reduced binding to eIF4A. Both eIF4G1-(592–862) and eIF4G1-(592–953) showed no binding to eIF4A in in vitro binding assays described in Fig. 2 (data not shown). In a separate experiment, three different concentrations of eIF4G1-(542–883) were used. The on- and off-rates were measured, and the Kd was estimated to be ∼3 × 10−8m (data not shown). These data demonstrate that eIF4G1-(542–883) binds to eIF4A with high affinity to form a stable complex. In addition, they indicate that the region between amino acids 542 and 592 of eIF4G1 contains an important determinant for eIF4A binding. The absence of eIF4A in eIF4F complexes isolated from yeast cells (18Lanker S. Müller P.P. Altmann M. Goyer C. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21167-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be used to argue that the interaction observed in vitro is an artifact. To determine if the eIF4G1-eIF4A interaction occurs in vivo, the yeast strain DDY6 was used (Table I). This strain is deleted for TIF1 and TIF2 (both genes encoding eIF4A) and expresses an eIF4A-thermosensitive protein constitutively from a plasmid (eIF4Ats (37Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3463-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) and a GST-eIF4A fusion protein upon galactose induction from another plasmid. The fusion protein is active as shown by in vivo complementation of the thermosensitive phenotype of strain SS13-3A/pSSC120 (Table I) and by its stimulation of translation in an eIF4A-dependent in vitro system (data not shown). The yeast strain DDY6 and the isogenic wild-type strain CWO4 were grown at 32 °C on rich medium containing galactose as carbon source. Synthesis of GST-eIF4A is induced in DDY6 cells, and under these conditions, only the fusion protein, but not eIF4Ats, is functional (DDY6 cells do not grow on glucose at 32 °C). Lysates prepared from these cells were incubated with GSH-Sepharose beads, and after extensive washing, GST-eIF4A and the associated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Copurification of eIF4G or control proteins was determined by Western blotting (Fig.4). eIF4G was retained on the resin only in the presence of GST-eIF4A (lane 6). No eIF4G could be recovered in the bound fraction of extracts from wild-type CWO4 cells, in which no GST-eIF4A is expressed (lane 3). Similar results were obtained when the DDY6 strain grown on glucose at 25 °C (no GST-eIF4A is synthesized) was used as a negative control (data not shown). Only a small fraction of eIF4G could be isolated in a complex with eIF4A. The association is, however, specific as illustrated by the fact that neither p20 (a negative regulator of eIF4E activity (23Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) nor eIF4B, both involved in translation initiation, was retained on the beads (Fig. 4, lane 6). The amount of eIF4G·GST-eIF4A complex detected in these experiments is probably an underestimation of the real amount present in the cells. First, DDY6 cells encode, in addition to GST-eIF4A, a thermosensitive copy of eIF4A. Despite being inactive at 32 °C, this protein might still interact with eIF4G in competition with GST-eIF4A. Second, for reasons that remain unknown, only part of GST-eIF4A bound to the beads (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5 and lane 6). Therefore, it is not possible from these experiments to estimate the real levels of the eIF4G·eIF4A complex in yeast cells. However, they demonstrate that yeast eIF4G and eIF4A do interact in vivo. To evaluate the biological significance of the eIF4G-eIF4A interaction, we intended to disrupt it and to analyze the effects on translation. We reasoned that the eIF4G1-(542–883) protein, i"

Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These interactions are thought to be dynamically regulated by signaling molecules. One of the candidate molecules is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which appears to be necessary for stabilizing moesin-CD44 interaction (4Niggli V. Andreoli C. Roy C. Mangeat P.

Moesin is phosphorylated in human platelets by thrombin activation at a single site, Thr558, that is located within or near the F-actin binding domain in the C-terminal region of the moesin sequence (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This region is nearly identical for all moesin-like proteins, and experiments in other cell types identified Thr558 as a common phosphorylation site as well (18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Thrombin stimulation of human platelets induces a rapid but transient increase in phosphorylation that correlates with F-actin binding activity of moesin (18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although several phosphokinase and phosphatase inhibitors, including some acting on enzymes specific for modifying tyrosine residues, modulated phosphorylation at the Thr558site, regulatory mechanisms of moesin phosphorylation are not well understood. Rho-dependent kinase phosphorylates two threonine residues of a C-terminal fragment of the homologous protein radixin in vitro, but the enzyme did not phosphorylate the full-length protein or did so rather poorly (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Protein kinase Cθ also phosphorylates Thr558 as one site of moesin in vitro, but it remains to be established how phosphorylation is regulated in blood cells, in which this enzyme is predominantly expressed (20Nakamura F. Huang L. Pestonjamasp K. Luna E. Furthmayr H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2669-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). With regard to phosphatases, in vitro phosphorylated moesin has been dephosphorylated with myosin phosphatase, a calyculin A-sensitive enzyme (13Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Matsui et al. (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of Thr558 in the C-terminal fragment of radixin inhibited the interaction of the fragment with the N-terminal fragment. This modification had no effect on the constitutive F-actin binding activity of the C-terminal fragment. More recent evidence strongly suggests that phosphorylation and other factors in the full-length protein disrupt structural features in vitro under certain conditions, causing a substantial conformational change that exposes the high affinity binding site for F-actin (20Nakamura F. Huang L. Pestonjamasp K. Luna E. Furthmayr H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2669-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Huang L. Wong T.Y.W. Lin R.C.C. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12803-12810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the modified protein would be expected to reverse this allosteric change and to lead to inactivation of this binding site. The present work demonstrates that calyculin A-sensitive and -insensitive phosphatases are detectable in human platelet lysates with a newly developed assay with a moesin-specific substrate. The calyculin A-insensitive enzyme was purified and identified as a type 2C protein phosphatase. The purified enzyme efficiently dephosphorylates highly purified in vivo phosphorylated platelet moesin and inactivates F-actin binding. This result lends support to previous speculation that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate F-actin binding of full-length endogenous moesin by an allosteric mechanism (19Matsui T. Maeda M.

Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and polymerized (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calyculin A, okadaic acid, and mycrocystin-LR were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Phenyl-Sepharose HP and Superose 12 (1.0 × 300 mm) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DEAE-cellulose (DE52) was purchased from Whatman. Protamine-agarose was purchased from Sigma. Phosphorylated moesin (phospho-moesin) was isolated from human platelets treated with calyculin A, and Cys-Lys555-Tyr-Lys-Thr(P)-Leu-Arg560(KYK p TLR)-coupled bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared as described previously (18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). para-Nitrophenylphosphate was purchased from Sigma. The KYK cp TLR-agarose (where cp T indicates γ-phosphono-valine, nonhydrolyzable phosphothreonyl mimetic, the so-called C-P compound) affinity column was prepared as follows. The peptide, Cys-Lys555-Tyr-Lys-cp Thr-Leu-Arg560) was chemically synthesized by Peptide Company (Osaka, Japan). The synthetic peptide (1 mg/ml of gel) was coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (6% cross-linked beaded agarose; Pierce) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Outdated platelets were provided as platelet-rich plasma by the Miyagi Red Cross Blood Center (Japan). Gel-filtered platelets (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at 30 °C and resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm E-64, 100 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4). The platelets were quickly homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and subsequently subjected to an ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. This first supernatant is referred to as the “cytosol.” The pellet was rehomogenized using 1 × Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm E-64, 100 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4) and again centrifuged at 15,600 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. This second supernatant is referred to as the “membrane fraction.” For other experiments, gel-filtered platelets were resuspended in 100 μl of Tyrode's buffer (136 mm NaCl, 2.9 mmKCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.36 mmNaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 1 × 109 platelets/ml. Platelets were activated by the addition of 1.0 National Institutes of Health unit of thrombin/ml at 37 °C or incubated for 10 min with 100 nmcalyculin A or 1 μm staurosporine at 37 °C. Platelets were lysed by addition of an equal volume of 2 × Triton X-100 lysis buffer. The lysates were immediately centrifuged at 15,600 × g at 4 °C for 4 min to sediment cytoplasmic actin filaments. This supernatant is referred to as the “Triton X-100 extract.” The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 1× Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, homogenized, and again centrifuged at 15,600 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. The supernatant of this step is referred to as the “NaCl extract.” To monitor purification of phosphatase, BSA-KYK p TLR was used as a substrate in the enzyme assays. Microtiter plate wells were coated overnight at room temperature with 100 μl of peptide solution (10 mg of peptide, KYK p TLR, as BSA conjugate/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide). After coating, wells were washed three times with TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 136 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked for 1 h with TTBS containing 5% nonfat milk, and washed again with TTBS. After addition of 90 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MnCl2) the phosphatase assay was started by adding 10 μl of enzyme preparation and incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. Wells were washed three times with TTBS, incubated with pAbKYK p TLR in TTBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h, washed three times with TTBS, incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate in TTBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h, and washed again three times with TTBS. Finally, peroxidase was assayed with 0.01 mg/ml 3′,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and 0.01% H2O2 in a buffer of 0.1m sodium acetate (pH 6.0). After addition of an equal volume of 1 m H2SO4, the optical density 450 nm was determined. In some experiments, pAbKYKTLR was used instead of pAbKYK p TLR. The specific phosphatase activity was calculated with purified phospho-moesin as the substrate as follows. The standard reaction mixture of phosphatase assay contained buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2) and enzyme. Reaction at 30 °C was initiated by the addition of phospho-moesin (final concentration, 50 μg/ml = 750 nm) and terminated with equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) followed by boiling for 5 min. A control incubation was performed without enzyme. The sample (500 ng of moesin) was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 9.0% polyacrylamide gel run under reducing conditions. The stoichiometry of moesin dephosphorylation was determined from densitometric data of Western blots obtained with affinity purified pAbKYK p TLR antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphatase activity was calculated from the decrease in the phosphorylation level of moesin. One unit of phosphatase activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the release of 1 nmol phosphate/min from phospho-moesin in the standard assay. In some assays 20 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, 20 mm MES, 20 mm Tris-HCl, or 20 mm glycine/NaOH was used as the reaction buffer to obtain appropriate pH conditions. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Because of limits of sensitivity and interference by β-mercaptoethanol in this assays, protein concentrations were also determined by densitometric analysis of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Outdated platelets were washed as previously described (26Kouns W.C. Fox C.F. Lamoreaux W.J. Coons L.B. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13891-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysed with 1× Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was subjected to successive chromatographic steps of purification either directly or after ethanol treatment (27Erdodi F. Csortos C. Sparks L. Muranyi A. Gergely P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. At each step, phosphatase activity was measured by the ELISA procedure. The sample was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (15.6 × 320 mm), pre-equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% glycerol), and developed with a 640-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the equilibrating buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing phosphatase activity were pooled. Phenyl-Sepharose HP column (15 × 57 mm) was washed with ethanol, followed by buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. After loading the sample from step 1, the column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear salt gradient (150 ml) from 1 to 0 m NaCl in the equilibrating buffer. The phosphatase fractions were pooled. The pooled fractions from the previous step were loaded onto a protamine-agarose column (10 × 13 mm), equilibrated with Buffer C. The phosphatase was eluted with a linear salt gradient (40 ml) from 0 to 1 m NaCl in the equilibrating buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing phosphatase were pooled and diluted 1:4 with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2. The diluted sample from the previous step were loaded onto a KYK cp TLR affinity column (10 × 13 mm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Phosphatase was eluted with a linear salt gradient (24 ml) from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in the equilibrating buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing phosphatase were pooled. The highly purified preparations were stored at 4 °C until they were used. For longer storage, the enzyme was stored in buffer C containing 20% glycerol at −85 °C. An aliquot of the purified phosphatase was concentrated in a ultrafree centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and chromatographed on a Superose 12 column (HR 10/30) equilibrated at 4 °C with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The volume at which standard proteins eluted from the column was determined in separate runs. Phosphorylated moesin (0.3 μm) was incubated with phosphatase in buffer B. After various periods of time, the mixture was incubated with phalloidin-stabilized F-actin in buffer F (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 140 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) for 30 min at 25 °C (20Nakamura F. Huang L. Pestonjamasp K. Luna E. Furthmayr H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2669-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The filaments were then sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 25 °C. Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid containing 2 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate, and the precipitates were washed with ice-cold acetone. Samples were then solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Moesin and phosphorylated moesin were detected by immunoblotting. Purified phospho-moesin was treated with alkaline phosphatase from calf intestine or Escherichia coli (Takara, Japan) (19Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) or wheat germ acid phosphatase (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) (28Waymack P.P. Van Etten R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as described previously. The dephosphorylation was detected by Western blotting probed with pAbKYK p TLR. Originally, dephosphorylation of moesin was observed after lysis of 32P-labeled platelets in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting the presence of a moesin phosphatase (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To study this further, we developed two nonradioactive methods, an ELISA and an in vitro dephosphorylation assay. Both assays are based on an antibody reagent that specifically recognizes the phosphorylation state of moesin. The ELISA was performed with BSA-KYK p TLR as the substrate. The substrate constitutes a hexapeptide centered around the phosphorylation site of moesin. This substrate can be dephosphorylated by addition of platelet lysates, and dephosphorylation is detected with specific antibodies (Fig.1 A). To confirm that this assay is measuring phosphatase and not protease activity, which might have removed the phosphopeptide, we tested with antibodies that specifically recognize the dephosphorylated peptide (18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, pAbKYKTLR reacted with BSA-KYK p TLR after this substrate was incubated with cell lysate, indicating dephosphorylation rather than proteolytic modification. This was also substantiated by the unchanged reactivity of the antibodies with BSA-KYK p TLR when incubated with the cell lysate in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Fig.1 A, lane 4). Because ELISA is simple and time-saving, we used this method to monitor phosphatase activity during purification. Both antibodies can be used for ELISA; however, the pAbKYK p TLR reagent is more sensitive and specific than pAbKYKTLR (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Hirota C. Mizuno Y. Furthmayr H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore primarily used pAbKYK p TLR. To make sure that KYK p TLR phosphatase dephosphorylates full-length phospho-moesin, an in vitro dephosphorylation assay was also carried out using highly purified platelet phospho-moesin as the substrate, followed by Western blotting with pAbKYK p TLR. This method allows to determine specific phosphatase activity, because the amount of moesin and phospho-moesin can be quantitated by Western blotting using pAb Mo (95/2) or mAbMo (38/87) and pAbKYK p TLR, respectively. We have previously shown that the addition of calyculin A to human platelets caused a substantial increase in the number of phosphorylated moesin molecules (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This large increase is explained by inhibition of all phosphatase activity in the platelet lysate. However, some phosphatase activity was detectable when 10 mm MgCl2 was added together with calyculin A (Fig. 2 A). This suggested that distinct calyculin A-sensitive and -insensitive phosphatases existed in the human platelets lysate. The contribution of each phosphatase activity for the dephosphorylation of KYK p TLR peptide is about 1:1 in this assay (Fig. 2 A). This result is inconsistent with our previous observations that preincubation of human platelets with calyculin A for 10 min induced phosphorylation of all or nearly all moesin molecules (17Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We examined whether addition of calyculin A and/or MgCl2 before lysis affected the calyculin A-insensitive phosphatase activity, but MgCl2made no significant difference (Fig. 2 B). Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared from human platelets (29Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the associated phosphatase activity was measured by the ELISA procedure. About 65% of the total phosphatase activity was recovered in the Triton X-100 soluble membrane fraction, whereas about 35% was in the soluble cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3 A). The calyculin A-insensitive phosphatase activity preferentially fractionated with the Triton X-100 soluble membrane material (compare bars 3 and 4 in Fig. 3 A), whereas the calyculin A-sensitive activity was almost equally distributed in the two fractions (bars 2 minus 1 versus bars 4 minus 3 in Fig. 3 A). Thrombin activation did not change this distribution, and phosphatase activity was not contained in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction either before or after thrombin activation of human platelets (Fig. 3 B). The extraction studies established the Triton X-100-solubilized preparation of resting human platelets as the optimal starting material for purification of calyculin A-insensitive phosphatases. The Triton X-100 extract was treated with ethanol, and this treatment was necessary to remove contaminants prior to chromatographic steps. The ethanol-treated sample was solubilized in buffer C and passed through the DE52 column, which resolved two peaks of phosphatase activity. Phosphatase activity was detected in fractions eluted with an NaCl gradient at ionic strengths corresponding to 110–200 mm NaCl (Fig. 4). Addition of 100 nm calyculin A during ELISA inhibited part of the activity (130–200 mm NaCl in Fig. 4), indicating the calyculin A-insensitive phosphatase activity to elute at 110–130 mm NaCl. The calyculin A-sensitive fractions contain PP1 and/or 2A by Western blotting with anti-PP1 (data not shown). The calyculin A-insensitive activity was further purified using phenyl-Sepharose HP column chromatography. Phosphatase activity eluted at ionic strengths corresponding to 750–550 mm NaCl (Fig.5 A). Sodium chloride was used instead of ammonium sulfate, because ammonium sulfate negatively affected the phosphatase assay. Peak fractions were pooled and chromatographed on a protamine-agarose column (Fig. 5 B), and fractions containing phosphatase were pooled again, diluted 1:4 with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.2, and affinity purified on a KYK cp TLR affinity matrix. The phosphonopeptide KYK cp TLR is similar to KYK p TLR but contains a nonhydrolyzable phosphate mimetic instead of the phosphate group (30Landt M. Boltz S.C. Butler L.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 915-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The diluted sample was adsorbed and eluted after washing with equilibrating buffer with a linear gradient of 0–500 mmNaCl. A major peak of activity eluted at 130–200 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 C). Peak fractions from each purif"

Alternative cleavage of the APP by α-secretase at Aβ16/17 releases the secreted derivative sAPPα. In yeast, α-secretase activity has been attributed to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl proteases. To examine the role of GPI-anchored proteins, we specifically removed these proteins from the surface of mammalian cells using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). PI-PLC treatment of fetal guinea pig brain cultures substantially reduced the amount of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the medium but had no effect on sAPPα. A mutant CHO cell line (gpi85), which lacks GPI-anchored proteins, secreted lower levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and sAPPβ than its parental line (GPI+). When this parental line was treated with PI-PLC, Aβ40, Aβ42, and sAPPβ decreased to levels similar to those observed in the mutant line, and the mutant line was resistant to these effects of PI-PLC. These findings provide strong evidence that one or more GPI-anchored proteins play an important role in β-secretase activity and Aβ secretion in mammalian cells.

APP is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The Aβ peptide begins 99 amino acids from the C terminus of APP, and it extends from the extracellular region to a point half-way through the APP membrane-spanning domain (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Aβ is released from APP by cleavage on its N- and C-terminal ends by β- and γ-secretase, respectively. β-Secretase cleavage before residue 1 of Aβ (672 of APP770) also releases the secreted derivative sAPPβ, whereas an alternative cleavage before residue 17 by α-secretase releases sAPPα. In most culture systems tested, the predominant cleavage product is sAPPα, and this may serve to prevent the production of Aβ (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

Aβ42 is deposited early and selectively in the senile plaques that are observed in all forms of AD, so these findings provide strong evidence that the FAD-linked mutations all act to cause AD by increasing the extracellular concentration of Aβ42. The evidence implicating Aβ in AD pathogenesis has made both β- and γ-secretase important therapeutic targets, but neither has yet been identified. It was recently demonstrated, however, that APP is proteolytically processed by an α-secretase-like pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Hines V. Zhang W. Ramakrishna N. Styles J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27799-27802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This processing pathway was shown to involve the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aspartyl proteases YAP3 and MKC7 (25Zhang W. Espinoza D. Hines V. Innis M. Mehta P. Miller D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Komano H. Seeger M. Gandy S. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

In mammals, GPI-anchored proteins are a relatively small class of membrane proteins that are anchored to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane by a glycolipid anchor consisting of ethanolamine, mannose, glucosamine, and phosphatidylinositol (27McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). These proteins can be removed from the cell surface by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the phosphatidylinositol in GPI-anchored proteins to release the protein. In this study we used PI-PLC to evaluate the role of GPI-anchored proteins in mammalian secretase activity and Aβ biogenesis. Our data indicate that at least one form of β-secretase or one of its essential, constitutively active regulators is GPI-anchored. It appears, however, that α-secretase is not a GPI-anchored protease in mammalian cells. PI-PLC was expressed in Bacillus subtilis cultures transformed with a plasmid containing the Bacillus thuringiensis gene and was purified from 8 liters of the culture media (28Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.R. Yang S.H. Ferguson T.R. Reinhold V.N. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18573-18580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the secreted PI-PLC was concentrated by filtration through a Millipore pelican filter, adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, and loaded onto a 50-ml octyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 100 ml of 20 mm Na3PO4, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7, and eluted with 20 mm Na3PO4, pH 7. Fractions containing active PI-PLC were adjusted to pH 8.5 and 0.055% Triton X-100 and loaded onto an 80-ml DEAE column. The column was washed with 70 ml of Tris acetate, pH 8.5, 0.55% Triton X-100 and eluted with 20 mm Tris acetate, 0.55% Triton X-100, pH 5.0. The activity of the fractions was assayed by the measurement of its capacity to hydrolyze 3H-labeled phosphatidylinositol (PI) in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). The free inositol released by PI-PLC was measured in the aqueous fraction after stopping the reaction in 10:5:0.1 chloroform:methanol:HCl. The protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). At this stage the PI-PLC is very pure as judged by the detection of a single band on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was subsequently stained with silver. For most of our treatments, we used 2 μg/ml of this purified PI-PLC. Mixed brain cultures from guinea pig fetuses were prepared from 30-day embryos using a method developed by Dr. Yasumasa Ohyagi (see Ref. 29Clarke N.J. Tomlinson A.J. Ohyagi Y. Younkin S. Naylor S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pregnant guinea pig was sacrificed with carbon dioxide, and six embryos were recovered from the uterus. The brains were dissected and minced into fine pieces. These pieces were treated with 10 volumes of 0.03% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 6.4, for 3 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 5% calf serum in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of Opti-MEM containing 5% calf serum and filtered through a 67-μm polyester mesh (Spectrum). The resulting cells were plated at a high density (107 cells per dish) to prevent astrocytic overgrowth. These cultures can be maintained in the same medium for over a month without loss of viability. In addition to being a good cell culture model for events that occur in the brain, this system benefits from the secretion of easily detectable levels of the Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides. Furthermore, unlike rodents, the guinea pig Aβ sequence is identical to that in man, thereby allowing the use of the human-specific antibody against Aβ1–16 (BAN50) for the analysis of sAPPα (30Johnstone E.M. Chaney M.O. Norris F.H. Pascual R. Little S.P. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A wild type CHO-K1 cell line (GPI+) expressing GPI-anchored human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and a derivative line with a mutation in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (gpi85) were kind gifts from Dr. Victoria Stevens (31Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The gpi85 mutant is deficient in N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase which is responsible for the second step in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor (32Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These cultures were maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml G418. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed using 24 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate in 1 m diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.6, containing 20 mm homoarginine. The samples were first heated to 55 °C for 10 min to increase the specificity for placental alkaline phosphatase activity (33Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). All treatments were carried out in the serum-free CCM5 medium (HyClone) after adapting the cultures for 24 h in the same medium. Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu 1 mm; Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO, which was also added to controls and other treatments. Me2SO concentrations were maintained at 0.2% for PDBu treatments. Bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) stocks were prepared in distilled water and directly diluted to 2.5 μm into the culture medium (4Petryniak M.A. Wurtman R.J. Slack B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies BAN50 (Aβ1–16), BNT77 (Aβ11–24), BC05(Aβ42), and BA27 (Aβ40) have been previously described (20Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) and were gifts from Dr. Nobu Suzuki (Takeda Industries). Ivan Lieberburg and John Anderson (Elan Corp.) kindly provided the 192 antibody, specific for sAPPβ (34Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). When appropriate, selected antibodies were tagged with horseradish peroxidase, using a kit from Pierce as described by the manufacturer. Aβ was measured using an established, sensitive, and specific sandwich ELISA (20Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Briefly, Nunc immunomax dishes were coated with capture antibodies BAN50 (guinea pig) or BNT77 (CHO) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and blocked with 0.5% block ace (Wako) in PBS, pH 7.4. The media samples (100 μl) were incubated overnight in 50 μl of ELISA buffer I (0.02m sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.4% block ace, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.0), washed three times with PBS, and treated overnight with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled detection antibodies BA27 and BC05 diluted in ELISA buffer II (0.02m sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 0.002% thimerosal, pH 7.0). After washing twice with PBS and once with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using a Pierce ELISA kit as described by the manufacturer. Addition of PI-PLC-containing CCM5 medium did not influence the measurement of standard Aβ. The human/guinea pig-specific BAN50 antibody and the sAPPβ-specific 192 antibody were used to determine the levels of sAPPα and sAPPβ, respectively, by Western blotting using methods described earlier (20Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 34Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R.

Anderson J.P. Pappolla M.A. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We also verified the specificity of the 192 antibody by probing peptide spots CSEVKM, CSEVK, and CSEVKMD. As expected, strong signals were only obtained for the CSEVKM peptide, which corresponds to sAPPβ cleavage, and the other two-peptide spots were negative, demonstrating the end specificity of the 192 antibody (data not shown). Total sAPP in the medium was detected using the 22C11 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Guinea pig mixed brain cultures were treated with PI-PLC for 1 and 3 days in triplicate. Over 3 days of PI-PLC treatment, sAPPα was not reduced in amount (Fig.1), but both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were substantially reduced (Table I). This large reduction was readily observed after 1 day of treatment and was sustained for at least 3 days. Since PI-PLC treatment is known to release GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, these data suggest that one or more GPI-anchored proteins are involved in Aβ biogenesis. The lack of an effect on sAPPα indicates that cleavage by α-secretase is not affected by the removal of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins and that PI-PLC treatment has no appreciable effect on APP synthesis.Table IPI-PLC reduces Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion in guinea pig mixed brain culturesPI-PLCDaysAβ40Aβ42μg/mlpm01118 ± 1318 ± 220116 ± 21-ap < 0.01.3 ± 01-ap < 0.01.03465 ± 1446 ± 323105 ± 271-ap < 0.01.13 ± 21-ap < 0.01.20336 ± 21-ap < 0.01.5 ± 01-ap < 0.01.Guinea pig brain cultures prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” were treated for 1 or 3 days with the indicated dose of PI-PLC.

Open table in a new tab Guinea pig brain cultures prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” were treated for 1 or 3 days with the indicated dose of PI-PLC. Media were collected and analyzed for Aβ40 and Aβ42. To investigate further the role of GPI-anchored proteins in Aβ biogenesis, we investigated the mutant CHO cell line, gpi85. This line was derived (31Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) from a recombinant CHO cell line (GPI+), which expresses human PLAP as a GPI-anchored reporter protein. The gpi85 line is deficient in N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase (4Petryniak M.A. Wurtman R.J. Slack B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is responsible for the second step in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor (32Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The loss of GPI anchor synthesis is neither lethal nor detrimental to the growth of mammalian cells. However, in cells (e.g. gpi85) that do not synthesize the GPI anchor, proteins that are normally GPI-anchored are degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (36Field M.C. Moran P. Li W. Keller G.A. Caras I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10830-10837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Delahunty M.D. Stafford F.J. Yuan L.C. Shaz D. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12017-12027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are not, therefore, found at the cell surface. To determine the concentration of PI-PLC needed to remove GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, we treated GPI+ cultures with two doses of PI-PLC and measured the release of PLAP (Fig.2). More than 80% of total cellular PLAP was released in 1 h by treatment with 20 μg/ml PI-PLC. The small amount of PLAP remaining after this treatment appears to be inaccessible to PI-PLC and is presumably mostly intracellular because no additional PLAP was released by treating cells for 3 h with 20 μg/ml PI-PLC (Fig. 2). The amount of PLAP released by treatment with 2 μg/ml PI-PLC for 1 h was 75% of that released by 20 μg/ml, but essentially the same amount was released when treatment with 2 μg/ml PI-PLC was extended to 3 h (Fig. 2). Thus treatment with 2 μg/ml PI-PLC for 3 h appears to be adequate to remove virtually all of the GPI-anchored protein at the cell surface, and subsequent experiments were conducted using 2 μg/ml PI-PLC. In 10 independent experiments, secreted Aβ was compared in gpi85 and GPI+ cells cultured in parallel. In 9 of these experiments, the effect of PI-PLC treatment (2 μg/ml for 3 h) was analyzed in both cell types. The results of this study, which were analyzed statistically using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, are shown in Table II. In untreated gpi85 cells, which lack GPI-anchored proteins, there was a consistent, highly significant reduction in Aβ40 (p< 0.0008) and Aβ42 (p < 0.03) relative to untreated GPI+ cells. In gpi85 cells, PI-PLC had no significant effect on Aβ40 or Aβ42, as expected. In GPI+ cells, as in fetal guinea pig brain cultures, removal of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins with PI-PLC caused a consistent, highly significant reduction in Aβ40 (p < 0.008) and Aβ42 (p < 0.03). As shown in Table II, GPI+ cells treated with PI-PLC and mutant gpi85 cells produced remarkably similar amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 that were consistently ∼40% less than the amount produced by normal GPI+ cells. Thus, the removal of GPI-anchored proteins by PI-PLC and by mutation causes a similar, highly significant reduction in Aβ40 and Aβ42. Confirming these findings, we have also observed that total secreted Aβ (4-kDa band), immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cells expressing high levels of human APP695, is reduced upon PI-PLC treatment (p < 0.05) to approximately the same extent as shown in Table II without significantly changing sAPPα (data not shown).Table IIPI-PLC reduces Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion in GPI+ CHO cells but not in the GPI-anchor-deficient mutant, gpi85Cell linePI-PLCHoursAβ40Aβ42μg/mlpmGPI+03193 ± 488 ± 2GPI+23124 ± 312-ap < 0.01.5 ± 22-bp < 0.03.gpi8503113 ± 202-ap < 0.01.5 ± 12-bp < 0.03.gpi8523110 ± 255 ± 1GPI+024550 ± 4621 ± 2GPI+224251 ± 522-ap < 0.01.8 ± 22-ap < 0.01.gpi85024447 ± 132-bp < 0.03.15 ± 12-bp < 0.03.gpi85224391 ± 2414 ± 1GPI+ and gpi85 CHO cultures were treated for 3 h with PI-PLC.

Media were collected and analyzed for Aβ40 and Aβ42. In many cell types, PKC activation results in a substantial stimulation of sAPPα release coupled with a reduction in Aβ secretion (3Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). By hydrolyzing PI in membranes, PI-PLC treatment could, in principle, activate PKC by releasing diacylglycerol (DAG). It is, however, highly unlikely that PKC activation contributes significantly to the effect of PI-PLC on guinea pig brain cultures, because PI-PLC decreased Aβ but did not increase sAPPα in this preparation (Fig.1). That Aβ was reduced similarly in PI-PLC-treated GPI+ cells (where DAG may be released) and in untreated gpi85 cells (where no DAG is released) also makes it highly unlikely that DAG release contributes importantly to the Aβ reduction observed in PI-PLC-treated CHO cells. To address further the question of DAG-induced PKC activation, the PKC inhibitor BIS (G109203X) was added to GPI+ cultures prior to treatment with PI-PLC. This compound has previously been shown to block the changes in APP metabolism (4Petryniak M.A. Wurtman R.J. Slack B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that occur when PDBu is used to activate PKC (4Petryniak M.A. Wurtman R.J. Slack B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our control experiments showed that PDBu reduces Aβ secretion in GPI+ cells, and this reduction was completely blocked by 2.5 μm BIS. In addition, as previously reported (4Petryniak M.A. Wurtman R.J. Slack B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), PDBu treatment elevated total sAPP secretion by about 15-fold, and this was also blocked by the BIS treatment (data not shown). Treatment of GPI+ cultures with BIS did not, however, block the reduction in Aβ40 and Aβ42 caused by PI-PLC (Table III). Thus, our results clearly show that the effect of PI-PLC on Aβ biogenesis is not due to DAG-induced PKC activation.Table IIIAddition of the PKC inhibitor BIS blocks PDBu-mediated but not PI-PLC-mediated Aβ reduction in GPI+ culturesAβ40Aβ42Control147 ± 2912 ± 5BIS136 ± 1711 ± 4PI-PLC97 ± 228 ± 4PI-PLC BIS86 ± 197 ± 4PDBu125 ± 18NT3-aNT, not tested.PDBu BIS168 ± 42NTThe GPI+ and gpi85 cultures were treated for 3 h with PDBu, PI-PLC, and/or BIS.

Media were collected and analyzed for Aβ40 and Aβ42. The PI-PLC-induced reduction in Aβ could be caused by a reduction in either β- or γ-secretase activity. To evaluate whether β-secretase activity is reduced when GPI-anchored proteins are removed, several experiments were performed in which we treated GPI+ and gpi85 cultures in triplicate with PI-PLC for 24 h and then evaluated sAPPβ and total sAPP (sAPPα + sAPPβ) by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). For specific detection of sAPPβ, we used antibody 192, which efficiently binds APP cleaved between residues −1 and +1 of the Aβ sequence but shows a low affinity for full-length APP, sAPPα, and other APP fragments (34Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We could not specifically analyze the sAPPα secreted from the GPI+ and gpi85 cell lines, because antibodies to human Aβ1–16 do not detect the hamster APP sequence (GenBank accession number AF030413), which is the same as the sequence in other rodents. For this reason, we analyzed total sAPP (sAPPα + sAPPβ) by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 22C11, which recognizes both human and rodent sAPP. Densitometric analysis showed that sAPPβ was reduced by approximately 90% upon PI-PLC treatment of GPI+ cultures (Fig. 3). In contrast, total sAPP (sAPPβ + sAPPα) was only slightly reduced (∼16%). Since sAPPα is the major secreted species in GPI+ cells, the small reduction in total sAPP indicates that PI-PLC has little effect on sAPPα. Levels of sAPPβ were also highly (71%) reduced in untreated gpi85 cells as compared with GPI+ cells, but again total sAPP was only slightly affected. As expected, PI-PLC treatment did not consistently affect sAPPβ or the total sAPP secreted by gpi85 cells. These results provide strong evidence that GPI-anchored cell-surface proteins play an important role in β-secretase activity. The proteins involved in Aβ biogenesis are important therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease. To date, none of these proteins has been unequivocally identified. In this study, we investigated the role of GPI-anchored cell- surface proteins in Aβ biogenesis. Our results provide strong evidence that, in mammalian cells, one or more cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins play an important role in β-secretase activity and Aβ secretion. In addition, they indicate that cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins do not play a major role in α-secretase activity. These conclusions are based on the following observations. (i) PI-PLC, which removes GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, substantially reduces the Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted from fetal guinea pig brain cultures and the wild type GPI+ CHO cell cultures. (ii) The mutant gpi85 line, which lacks cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins, shows reductions in secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 similar to those observed when the parental GPI+ line is treated with PI-PLC. (iii) The PI-PLC treatment that lowers the Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted from GPI+ cells has no detectable effect on the residual Aβ secretion that occurs in gpi85 cells. (iv) sAPPβ is substantially reduced in gpi85 cells and in PI-PLC-treated GPI+ cells but shows no additional reduction in PI-PLC-treated gpi85 cells. (v) PI-PLC treatment does not affect the levels of sAPPα in fetal guinea pig brain cultures and only slightly reduces total sAPP (sAPPα + sAPPβ) in GPI+ and gpi85 cultures. The coordinate reduction of Aβ40 and Aβ42, the profound reduction of sAPPβ, and the lack of change in sAPPα that occurs when GPI-anchored proteins are removed from the cell surface clearly implicate one or more cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins in β-secretase activity and Aβ biogenesis. This finding fits well with recent reports that APP and Aβ are found in detergent-insoluble membrane domains enriched in GPI-anchored proteins (38Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G. Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These domains are rich in cholesterol, which has been reported to be important for Aβ production (40Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8108) Google Scholar, 41Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Although reduced, secretion of sAPPβ, Aβ40, and Aβ42 continues both in PI-PLC-treated cells and in mutant gpi85 cells deficient in GPI-anchored proteins. This suggests that normal β-secretase activity may involve both GPI-dependent and -independent proteins. One should, however, be cautious in drawing this conclusion. A small percentage of the GPI-anchored proteins may be resistant to PI-PLC because of fatty acylation of the GPI anchor (28Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.R. Yang S.H. Ferguson T.R. Reinhold V.N. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18573-18580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI-PLC treatment removes cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins but may not remove intracellular GPI-anchored proteins that could continue to produce Aβ and sAPPβ. In gpi85 cells, GPI-anchored proteins continue to be synthesized. These proteins are rapidly degraded when they fail to be GPI-anchored, and they do not accumulate at the cell surface, but some residual protein precursor capable of processing intracellular APP to sAPPβ and Aβ may remain in the secretory pathway. Thus our findings are consistent with separate GPI-anchored protein-dependent and -independent β-secretase pathways, but they do not eliminate the possibility that normal β-secretase cleavage is carried out entirely by one or several GPI-anchored proteins. Given the complexity of the cell surface and intracellular events that are involved in Aβ biogenesis, it is likely that some secreted Aβ is produced through alternative proteolytic pathways that do not involve cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins. Thus there is likely to be an upper limit to the reduction in Aβ secretion that can be achieved by removing GPI-anchored proteins. In the CHO cell lines that we examined, removal of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins caused a coordinate ∼50% reduction of Aβ40 and Aβ42 at 24 h that was smaller than the 80–90% reduction in sAPPβ. This sizable difference suggests that, in CHO cells, most sAPPβ is produced by a GPI-anchored protein-dependent pathway, whereas a substantial percentage of Aβ is produced by alternative pathways that do not result in the secretion of sAPPβ. This finding agrees well with the published evidence for the presence of secondary β-secretase activities, which cleave APP at alternative locations close to the N-terminal end of the Aβ sequence. The sequence of the secreted Aβ begins at all known residues ranging from 1 to 11 indicating that the cleavage can occur at any one of these residues (42Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 43Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The sAPPβ-specific antibody, 192, will not detect sAPP cleaved at these secondary sites, but the sandwich ELISA will detect the Aβ generated by these cleavages which may be GPI anchor-independent. The number of cell-surface GPI-anchored proteins that are involved in β-secretase activity and the precise nature of these proteins remain to be determined. It is entirely possible that the effects we have observed are all due to the removal of a single catalytically active β-secretase that is GPI-anchored to the cell surface. Alternatively, a GPI-anchored protein could (i) be an essential non-catalytic subunit in a multi-subunit β-secretase; (ii) perform a post-translational modification required to sustain β-secretase activity; (iii) chaperone to bring together APP and β-secretase into one compartment; or (iv) activate another factor that performs one of the functions listed above. Whatever its precise nature, any cell-surface GPI-anchored protein involved in β-secretase activity is of great interest as a therapeutic target in AD. GPI-anchored proteins can be substantially enriched in cell lysates on the basis of their detergent insolubility, and they can be released specifically from intact cells or cell lysates by PI-PLC. In addition, these proteins can be incorporated from the medium into live cultured cells in a functionally active form. These unique properties and the relatively small number of mammalian GPI-anchored proteins should be highly advantageous in the effort to isolate and characterize the specific GPI-anchored protein(s) that are involved in β-secretase activity.

To identify coactivators that mediate long-range transactivation by this locus control region (LCR), we assessed the influence of E1A, an inhibitor of the CBP/p300 histone acetylase, on LCR function. E1A strongly inhibited transactivation of Aγ- and β-globin promoters by the HS2, HS2-HS3, and HS1-HS4 subregions of the LCR in human K562 and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Short- and long-range transactivation mediated by the LCR were equally sensitive to E1A. The E1A sensitivity was apparent in transient and stable transfection assays, and E1A inhibited expression of the endogenous γ-globin genes. Only sites for NF-E2 within HS2 were required for E1A sensitivity in K562 cells, and E1A abolished transactivation mediated by the activation domain of NF-E2. E1A mutants defective in CBP/p300 binding only weakly inhibited HS2-mediated transactivation, whereas a mutant defective in retinoblastoma protein binding strongly inhibited transactivation. Expression of CBP/p300 potentiated HS2-mediated transactivation. Moreover, expression of GAL4-CBP strongly increased transactivation of a reporter containing HS2 with a GAL4 site substituted for the NF-E2 sites. Thus, we propose that a CBP/p300-containing coactivator complex is the E1A-sensitive factor important for LCR function.

The involvement of NF-E2 in functioning through these sites has been established in CB3 cells, murine erythroleukemia cells that lack p45 (23Lu S.J. Rowan S. Bani M.R. Ben-David Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8398-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, disruption of the murine p45 gene does not greatly impair β-globin synthesis (25Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be redundant factors functioning through the NF-E2 sites. The p45 gene disruption resulted in defective platelet formation, implicating NF-E2 as a critical regulator of megakaryopoiesis. Based on the requirement of NF-E2 for megakaryopoiesis and importance for globin synthesis in CB3 cells, it is of considerable interest to determine how NF-E2 activates transcription. Sequences within the amino terminus of p45 are necessary for strong transactivation (26Bean T.L. Ney P.A.

Since these sequences are not required for DNA binding, and their deletion does not confer protein instability, they may engage in protein-protein interactions with coactivators. Several proteins have been suggested to be important for NF-E2-mediated transactivation, including WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases (28Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K.

We have shown that a PTY sequence within a 41-amino acid region of the amino terminus of p45, which is necessary for strong transactivation, mediates specific and high-affinity binding to WW domains from the WWP1 ubiquitin ligase (28Mosser E.A.

WW domains are protein modules that mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to PP X Y ligand sequences (31Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The functional significance of a WW domain protein interaction was supported by mutagenesis studies in which PTY was mutated to AAA, resulting in a 73% reduction in transactivation (28Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, this p45 mutant retained weak but significant activity, suggesting that the protein binding to PTY is not the sole mediator of transactivation. In this study, we asked whether the CBP/p300 interaction with NF-E2 is functionally important within the context of the β-globin LCR. It is possible that the interaction would be critical for the activity of a simple promoter driven exclusively by NF-E2, but not for a complex element containing multiple factor-binding sites such as the LCR. The requirements for transactivation from simple and complex activating elements can differ, as was exemplified recently by studies of glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation (32Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the receptor enhanced transactivation of a reporter gene containing a simple glucocorticoid-responsive promoter but not a complex glucocorticoid-responsive promoter with multiple transcription factor-binding sites. Here, we show that an inhibitor of CBP/p300, the adenoviral E1A protein, almost completely abolishes LCR-mediated transactivation of Aγ- and β-globin promoters. The implications of this result are discussed vis à vis models of LCR function invoking the recruitment of HATs that remodel chromatin and regulate the activity of nonhistone components. The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 (33Dean A. Erard F. Schneider A.P. Schechter A.N. Science. 1981; 212: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was maintained in IMEM medium (Biofluids) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). In certain experiments, K562 cells were treated with 40 μm hemin for 48 h to induce erythroid differentiation before transfection. The mouse erythroleukemia cell line MEL (34Marks P.A. Sheffrey M.

Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells (5 × 105) were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.5 ml of IMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and mixed with 3.5 ml of identical medium in each well of a 6-well plate. Plasmid DNA (4 μg in 150 μl of IMEM (for K562 cells) or DMEM (MEL cells)) was incubated with 16 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 15 min at room temperature and then added to cells. Cells were incubated for 40 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (10Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized by the protein content of the lysate, determined by Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard. In certain experiments, the constitutively active β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1 μg) was included in each transfection reaction, so that luciferase activity could be normalized for differences in transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with a luminescent substrate (Galacton Plus) according to the manufacturer's instructions (TROPIX, Inc.). Since the expression of CBP increased the activity of the SV40 promoter, which controls β-galactosidase expression from pCH110, the experiment of Fig. 10 was done without co-transfecting pCH110. Expression of E1A did not influence the activity of the SV40 promoter of pCH110. All transient transfection experiments except for Figs. 8and 10 were done in the presence and absence of pCH110, and similar results were obtained regardless of whether the luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.Figure 8Transactivation mediated by the activation domain of p45 is inhibited by E1A.

The plasmid GAL4-p45(1–90) encodes amino acids 1–90 of murine p45 fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) in the vector pcDNA3. β106(hAP1)2-luc and β106-luc plasmids were derived from pGL2-Basic (Promega) and contained a minimal human β-globin promoter fused to luciferase with or without upstream tandem NF-E2-binding sites from human HS2, respectively (Dr. Ross Hardison, Penn State University, University Park, PA). pGAL-CBP FL encodes a fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to wild-type CBP (41Chrivia J.C.

K562 clonal line HS2(2.2)γluc#20 contained two copies of a stably integrated HS2(2.2)γluc reporter gene. The line was derived from K562 cells by co-transfection of the HS2(2.2)γluc plasmid with a selection plasmid containing the thymidine kinase promoter driving the hygromycin resistance gene as described previously (38Bresnick E.H. Tze L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4566-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Clones were isolated by limiting dilution analysis in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin, and cells were then cultured in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin. To assess the influence of transiently expressed E1A on the activity of the stably integrated luciferase reporter gene, cells were transiently co-transfected with the pGFPemd-c [R] control expression vector, containing the SV40 enhancer and promoter driving EGFP, and either pCL1-E1A or pcDNA3. EGFP was used as a marker for transfection, allowing one to test the influence of transiently expressed E1A on the activity of the stably integrated luciferase reporter gene. A ratio of pCL1-E1A or pcDNA3 to EGFP of 3:1 was used to ensure that EGFP-positive cells contained pCL1-E1A or pcDNA3. Cells (5 × 105) were collected by centrifugation at 240 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.5 ml of IMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin, and mixed with 3.5 ml of identical medium in each well of a 6-well plate. Plasmid DNA (6 μg in 150 μl of IMEM) was incubated with 24 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 15 min at room temperature and then added to cells. Cells were incubated for 65 h, harvested, and triplicate transfection reactions for each condition were combined. EGFP-positive cells were isolated by FACS with a FACStar-plus instrument (Becton Dickinson). Equal numbers of cells (5000 cells) transfected with pcDNA3 and pCL1-E1A were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed with the sorted cells as described above. Exponentially growing K562 cells (12 × 106) were transfected with a total of 72 μg of DNA in 288 μl of Superfect. The ratio of pCL1-E1A or pcDNA3 to EGFP was 5:1. Cells were incubated for 3 days, and equal numbers of EGFP-positive cells transfected with E1A or pcDNA3 were isolated by FACS. Trizol-extracted RNA was analyzed using the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining of a 1.2% agarose gel. The intensity of staining was estimated by image analysis with NIH Image software. Primer sequences: γ-globin, 5′-GGAGGAGAAACCCTGGGAAG and 5′-CCCAGGAGCTTGAAGTTCTC; HPRT, 5′-CAGACTGAAGAGCTATTGTAATG and 5′-CTTAGATGCTGTCTTTGATGTG. A prokaryotic expression vector containing the cDNA for murine p45 was obtained from Beverly Emerson (Salk Institute). Polyhistidine-tagged p45 was overexpressed in the BL21DE3pLysS strain of Escherichia coli and purified on a column containing nickel-NTA resin equilibrated in buffer containing 8 murea, as described previously (28Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8, at 4 °C with two changes of buffer. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard. Purified baculovirus expressed, flag epitope-tagged human p300 was kindly provided by Drs. Alex Vassilev and Yoshihiro Nakatani (National Institutes of Health). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed as described previously (28Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Purified p300 or GST (100 ng) was immobilized in triplicate wells of a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Costar EIA/RIA number 3590). Wells were blocked by incubation with bovine serum albumin (1 mg) for 1 h. The immobilized protein was incubated with increasing amounts of purified p45 and then washed five times with 300 μl of wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). Anti-p45 antibody (28Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (1/2000 dilution in wash buffer, 50 μl total) was added for 1 h, and then the plate was washed five times. After incubation with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1/1500 dilution in wash buffer, 50 μl total) (Sigma), the plate was washed five times, and the horseradish peroxidase substrate ABTS was added (0.2 mg/ml). Color development was allowed to proceed for 20 min, and absorbance measurements were made at 405 nm with an Elx800 universal microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc.), under conditions in which the absorbance was in the linear range. Incubations were done at room temperature with gentle agitation. To test the functional significance of the NF-E2-CBP/p300 interaction for LCR-mediated transactivation, we used the adenoviral E1A protein, an inhibitor of CBP/p300. Transient transfection assays were done in K562 erythroleukemia cells with luciferase reporter constructs containing a human Aγ-globin promoter with or without HS2, HS2-HS3, or a mini-LCR containing HS1-HS4. As shown in Fig. 1, co-transfection of small amounts of an E1A expression vector abolished transactivation mediated by HS2, HS2-HS3, and the mini-LCR. E1A slightly increased the activity of the Aγ-globin promoter without LCR elements. Thus, inhibition by E1A was mediated by factors binding to the LCR elements and not the promoter. The experiments of Fig. 1 were done with uninduced K562 cells, and it is possible that the requirements for transactivation may differ in cells of varying differentiation states. We tested whether HS2-mediated transactivation was also sensitive to E1A in hemin-treated K562 cells, which differentiate along the erythroid lineage. Similar to the results of Fig. 1, expression of E1A abolished HS2-mediated transactivation in induced K562 cells (data not shown). MEL cells represent a later stage of erythroid differentiation than K562 cells and express β-globin rather than ε- and γ-globins characteristic of K562 cells. We assessed the sensitivity of LCR-mediated transactivation to E1A in MEL cells to determine whether the sensitivity was dependent on the stage of erythroid differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, transactivation of a β-globin promoter mediated by HS2 was strongly inhibited by E1A in MEL cells. In contrast to the K562 cell system, the inhibition was incomplete, suggesting that a component of the activity in MEL cells is resistant to inhibition by E1A. These results are consistent with a requirement of the E1A-sensitive factor for HS2-mediated transactivation at multiple stages of erythroid differentiation. The transactivation property of the LCR is often studied with constructs containing the LCR positioned near (within 1–2 kb) a β-globin promoter linked to a reporter gene. However, within the endogenous β-globin locus, the LCR is 7–50 kb upstream of the β-globin promoters. Thus, it was important to determine whether the E1A sensitivity of LCR-mediated transactivation is also apparent over long distances. We asked whether transactivation of a Aγ-globin promoter by HS2-HS3 and by the mini-LCR positioned 5.1 kb from the promoter was sensitive to E1A in a transient transfection assay. Regardless of whether the LCR elements were positioned 20 base pairs or 5.1 kb from the promoter, E1A strongly inhibited transactivation (Fig.3). We also tested the influence of E1A on the activity of linearized templates in transient transfection assays to determine whether the requirement of the E1A-sensitive factor was unique to plasmids. Constructs containing HS2 20 base pairs or 5.1 kb from the promoter or the promoter alone were linearized downstream of the luciferase gene with Not I, and linear DNA was transfected into K562 cells. Expression of E1A completely inhibited the activity of both HS2-containing templates without affecting the activity of the construct containing the promoter alone (data not shown). Thus, short- and long-range transactivation mediated by the LCR are equally sensitive to inhibition by E1A with circular and linear templates. The experiments described above used transient transfection assays, in which the DNA is nonreplicating and may not be assembled into organized chromatin. As the transactivation requirements may differ for templates in transient and stable assays, we asked whether HS2-mediated transactivation of an integrated reporter gene was sensitive to E1A. An expression vector encoding E1A or the blank vector and a vector encoding EGFP were transiently co-transfected into the K562 clonal cell line HS2(2.2)γluc#20, which contains two copies of an integrated HS2(2.2)γluc reporter gene. Cells positive for EGFP were isolated by FACS and assayed for luciferase activity. This procedure allows one to assess the influence of the transiently expressed E1A on the reporter gene present in all cells. Expression of E1A strongly reduced luciferase activity relative to the control vector (Fig. 4). Thus, the E1A-sensitive factor is required for strong LCR-mediated transactivation in stable transfection assays, in addition to transient assays as described above. To determine the influence of E1A on endogenous γ-globin gene expression, K562 cells were co-transfected with the control vector pcDNA3 or an E1A expression vector and a vector encoding EGFP. EGFP-positive cells were isolated by FACS, and RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR using primer pairs to detect human γ-globin or HPRT transcripts. Expression of E1A strongly reduced the steady-state level of γ-globin transcripts without influencing the level of HPRT transcripts (Fig. 5). The average decrease from two independent experiments was 3.2-fold. Since inhibition by E1"

To test this hypothesis, directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were employed to create a C172S substitution in the Rubisco large subunit of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The C172S mutant strain was not substantially different from the wild type with respect to growth rate, and the purified mutant enzyme had a normal circular dichroism spectrum. However, the mutant enzyme was inactivated faster than the wild-type enzyme at 40 and 50 °C. In contrast, C172S mutant Rubisco was more resistant to sodium arsenite, which reacts with vicinal dithiols. The effect of arsenite may be directed to the cysteine 172/192 pair that is present in the wild-type enzyme, but absent in the mutant enzyme. The mutant enzyme was also more resistant to proteinase K in vitro at low redox potential. Furthermore, oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) or osmotic (mannitol) stress-induced degradation of Rubisco in vivo was delayed in C172S mutant cells relative to wild-type cells. Thus, cysteine residues could play a role in regulating the degradation of Rubisco under in vivo stress conditions.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 43: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 2Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, O2 is mutually competitive with CO2 at the same large-subunit active site, and oxygenation of RuBP leads to the loss of CO2 through the seemingly wasteful photorespiratory pathway. In all plants and green algae, Rubisco is composed of eight 55-kDa large subunits (encoded by the chloroplast rbcL gene) and eight 15-kDa small subunits (encoded by a family of nuclear rbcS genes). Photosynthetic prokaryotes have plant-type hexadecameric holoenzymes, homodimeric enzymes composed of large-subunit homologues, or both (reviewed in Ref. 3Watson G.M.F. Tabita F.R. FEMS Lett. 1997; 146: 13-22Crossref Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of representative enzymes have been solved (4Andersson I. Knight S. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T.

Because the difference between the velocities of carboxylation and oxygenation determines net photosynthetic CO2 fixation (1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Directed mutagenesis of eukaryotic Rubisco is hindered by the need to transform the highly polyploid chloroplast genome. However, the chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas and tobacco can be transformed (e.g. Refs. 10Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

In addition to its enzymatic function, Rubisco is a remarkably abundant protein storing a considerable amount of nitrogen. The reutilization of this nitrogen through the turnover of the enzyme and the mobilization of its amino acids during natural or stress-induced senescence plays a role in the nutritional balance of plants (reviewed in Ref. 14Leegood R.C. Lea P.J. Adcock M.D. Hausler R.E. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1397-1414Crossref Google Scholar). Proteolysis of Rubisco is indeed a prominent feature in the stress responses of plants and algae, and several studies have shown that Rubisco is oxidatively modified prior to its degradation (15Ferreira R.B. Davies D.D. Planta (Heidelb.). 1989; 179: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol.

(Bethesda). 1996; 111: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidation of Cys residues in vitro has been proposed to switch Rubisco from a protease-resistant to protease-sensitive form (21Penarrubia L. Moreno J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 227-235Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Moreno J. Penarrubia L. García-Ferris C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 121-127Google Scholar). The critical residues have not yet been identified, but because oxidative modification of Rubisco is widespread among species (15Ferreira R.B. Davies D.D. Planta (Heidelb.). 1989; 179: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol.

(Bethesda). 1996; 111: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it is likely that these residues are conserved. Redox regulation by oxidation/reduction of Cys thiol groups has been demonstrated for other chloroplast proteins, including carbohydrate metabolism enzymes (24Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar), ATP synthase (25Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ketcham S.R. Davenport J.W. Warncke K. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7286-7293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), components of photosynthetic membrane complexes (27Tanaka S. Wada K. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and translation factors (28Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is as yet no evidence for a physiological role of such a regulatory mechanism acting on Rubisco stability/turnover in vivo. Thus, we have started to use directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation of Chlamydomonas to scan for the proposed regulatory properties of Cys residues. Accordingly, the highly conserved Cys-172 has been changed to Ser, and the mutant Rubisco has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. C. reinhardtii 2137 mt + is the wild-type strain (29Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rubisco mutant 18-7G mt + was used as the host for transformation. Mutant 18-7G lacks Rubisco holoenzyme and requires acetate for growth (30Spreitzer R.J. Ogren W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6293-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It results from an rbcL nonsense mutation that changes large-subunit Trp-66 to amber (31Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All strains were maintained at 25 °C in the dark with medium containing 10 mm sodium acetate and 1.5% Bacto-agar (29Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, photosynthesis-competent strains were grown in acetate liquid medium (without agar) in either 500-ml or 2.5-liter half-filled Erlenmeyer flasks under continuous white light (15 microeinsteins/m2/s) on a rotary shaker at 28 °C. For Rubisco extraction, cells were harvested at stationary phase (∼107 cells/ml). Growth curves were determined in 50-ml cultures with acetate or minimal (without acetate) medium at 15 microeinsteins/m2/s. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer. A 2951-base pair Hae III DNA fragment (bases −175 to 2776), containing the entire rbcL gene (bases 1–1428) (32Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was cloned into Sma I-digested pBluescript SK+(Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Vandeyar et al. (33Vandeyar M. Weiner M. Hutton C. Batt C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) by employing a T7-GEN kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. as described previously (10Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce the C172S mutation, the rbcL gene sequence TGT (bases 514–516) was changed to TCT. This mutation abolished an Rsa I site and expedited the initial screening of transformants. The mutation was confirmed by performing DNA sequencing with an IsoTherm DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies Corp.) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.). The plasmid containing the C172S rbcL mutant gene was named pLS-C172S. Chloroplast transformation with this plasmid was performed via microprojectile bombardment (34Finer J.J. Vain P. Jones M.W. McMullen M.D. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) as described previously (10Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

Although the phenotype conferred by the rbcL mutant gene could not be predicted, transformation of the 18-7G rbcL mutant with pLS-C172S was found to yield photosynthesis-competent colonies. Successive rounds of single-colony isolation were performed to ensure homoplasmicity of the mutant genes (10Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Total DNA was then purified (31Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the rbcL gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (35Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13449) Google Scholar); and the entire coding region was sequenced. Only the intended mutation was present. The rbcL mutant strain created by directed mutagenesis and transformation was named C172S. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min. Pellets were weighed, frozen with liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended (0.25 g/ml) in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated at 0 °C. After adding 2% (w/v) polyvinylpolypynolidone and stirring for 5 min at 4 °C, the crude extract was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min. Rubisco was purified from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose gradient fractionation, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as previously detailed (22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final protein preparation contained >90% Rubisco (ascertained by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels) and was essentially free of nucleic acids (A280/260 nm > 1.7). Purified Rubisco was activated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaHCO3 by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10) and further diluted to an absorbance of 0.31 at 280 nm (∼0.2 mg/ml). RuBP carboxylase activity was measured as the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from NaH14CO3 (22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amount of total protein in the extracts was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Far (195–240 nm) and near (250–300) UV circular dichroism spectra were obtained in a CD-6 dicrograph (Jobin-Yvon) using quartz cells of 0.1- and 10-mm optical paths, respectively. Spectra were recorded at 0.5 nm/s with an integration constant of 1 s. After averaging three runs for each sample, solvent spectra were subtracted from those for purified Rubisco (0.2 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaHCO3). Molar ellipticity is expressed as degrees cm2/dmol, where the molar units refer to amino acid residues in the far-UV spectrum and to Rubisco heterodimer in the near-UV region. Purified Rubisco samples (0.2 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaHCO3) were placed in Eppendorf tubes and submerged in a water bath at 40 or 50 °C. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots of the samples were mixed with 180 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmNaHCO3 in preincubated (30 °C) plastic vials (Bio-vial, Beckman Instruments). The mixtures were further incubated at 30 °C for 15 min before the RuBP carboxylase assay was started by the addition of RuBP and NaH14CO3 (22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aliquots ( 200 μl) of purified Rubisco (0.2 mg/ml) were combined with 100 μl of cystamine/cysteamine mixtures of constant monomeric concentration (120 mm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmNaHCO3). Different cystamine/cysteamine ratios or other oxidative agents were added as specified. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and 20-μl aliquots were then assayed for RuBP carboxylase activity. To measure proteolysis, 80-μl aliquots were incubated with 20 μl of freshly prepared proteinase K (0.5 μg/ml in the same buffer; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 30 °C for 5 min. Proteolysis was stopped by adding 10 μl of 22 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 100% ethanol and keeping the mixture on ice for 10 min. Then, 55 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 6.5% SDS, and 25% (w/v) glycerol were added, and the samples were boiled for 4 min. Aliquots (10–20 μl) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting with rabbit antiserum directed against Euglena gracilis Rubisco, and blot densitometry as described previously (17García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 208-215Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rubisco content was determined by centrifuging 1 ml of culture at 5000 × g for 1 min; resuspending the pellet in 0.2 ml of 83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.66 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.17% SDS, and 8.3% (w/v) glycerol; and boiling for 4 min. The samples were quantified by blot densitometry (17García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 208-215Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C172S mutant was recovered by transforming the 18-7G rbcL nonsense mutant with pLS-C172S DNA and selecting for photosynthetic ability on minimal medium in the light. Thus, it was clear that the C172S mutant Rubisco retained substantial catalytic activity. The C172S mutant strain was indistinguishable from the wild type when grown on acetate-supplemented medium, and no difference was observed when its rate of growth in liquid culture was compared with that of the wild type under photoautotrophic, photoheterotrophic, or heterotrophic conditions (Fig.1). However, crude extracts of the C172S mutant cells had less RuBP carboxylase activity (∼50 or 25% less in extracts of autotrophically or photoheterotrophically grown cells, respectively) than wild-type extracts. This difference was due both to a decreased enzyme content of the C172S mutant cells and to a lower specific activity of the purified C172S enzyme (∼20% lower than that of the wild-type enzyme). Circular dichroism spectra obtained for the purified C172S and wild-type Rubisco enzymes were coincident, both in the far- and near-UV regions (Fig.2), indicating that the single-atom substitution in C172S Rubisco did not substantially affect the secondary or tertiary structure. However, when incubated at elevated temperatures of 40 or 50 °C, C172S Rubisco was inactivated faster than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the loss of a possible Cys-172–Cys-192 disulfide bond (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) might be responsible for a decrease in the thermal stability of C172S Rubisco. However, reduction of disulfide bonds with DTT caused similar increases in thermal inactivation for both the mutant and wild-type enzymes at 50 °C (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Thermal inactivation of purified C172S mutant (○) and wild-type (■) Rubisco enzymes at 40 °C (A) and 50 °C (B) in the absence (○ and ■) or presence (• and ▪) of 40 mm DTT.

Cystamine and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) substantially reduced RuBP carboxylase activity, whereas copper ions and oxidized glutathione had less effect. The only difference between the C172S and wild-type Rubisco enzymes was observed with arsenite (Table I). Arsenite, a reagent for vicinal dithiols (37Torchinsky Y.M. Sulfur in Proteins. Pergamon Press plc, Oxford1981Google Scholar), decreased wild-type RuBP carboxylase activity by 26%, but the effect on the mutant enzyme was negligible. In wild-type Rubisco, arsenite may link the thiol groups of the closely associated Cys-172 and Cys-192 residues (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I.

Incubation of the purified C172S and wild-type Rubisco enzymes with different ratios of cystamine and cysteamine showed that similar amounts of oxidative inactivation took place at similar redox potentials (Fig. 4). A cystamine/cysteamine ratio of 2, which is close to the value of 1.5 found for Euglena Rubisco (22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), caused a 50% inactivation of both the C172S and wild-type Rubisco enzymes (Fig. 4). The proteolytic sensitivity of the Rubisco large subunit also increased with increasing ratios of cystamine to cysteamine (Fig.5), and this has also been observed for the Euglena enzyme (22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, C172S mutant Rubisco was more resistant to proteolysis under moderately oxidative conditions than was the wild-type enzyme. For example, a disulfide/thiol ratio of 4.5 was required to obtain the same amount of mutant Rubisco proteolysis as observed for the wild-type enzyme at a ratio of 3.5 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Proteolytic susceptibility of purified C172S mutant (○) and wild-type (■) Rubisco enzymes after 2 h of incubation at 30 °C with different ratios of 40 mmcystamine/cysteamine. After incubation with the redox buffer mixtures, Rubisco was digested with proteinase K (0.5 μg/ml) for 5 min. The extent of degradation was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and densitometry of the large subunit of the enzyme (17García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 208-215Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

Despite the reduced structural stability of C172S mutant Rubisco in vitro (Fig. 3), its stress-induced half-life in vivo was 2–3 times greater than that of wild-type Rubisco (Fig. 6). This held true regardless of whether the amount of Rubisco was calculated as a percentage of initial Rubisco content (Fig. 6) or as a percentage of total protein (data not shown), indicating that the observed difference in turnover rate was selective for Rubisco. Thirty years ago, Sugiyama et al. (38Sugiyama T. Nakayama N. Ogawa M. Akazawa T. Oda T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) discovered that chemical modification of Rubisco thiols with p-chloromercuribenzoate inactivated the enzyme, disassembled its subunits, and facilitated its proteolysis. More recently, several studies have shown that Rubisco is oxidatively modified and degraded in vivo under stress conditions (16Mehta R.A. Fawcett T.W. Porath D. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2810-2816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 208-215Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Ferreira R.B. Shaw N.M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1989; 179: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The discovery that oxidative modification of Cys residues also sensitizes purified Rubisco to proteolysis (21Penarrubia L. Moreno J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 227-235Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) leads one to consider that Cys oxidation in vivo may mark the enzyme for degradation during natural senescence or under stress conditions that are known to produce an oxidative environment in the chloroplast (23Moreno J. Penarrubia L. García-Ferris C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 121-127Google Scholar). Despite indirect evidence such as finding that some Rubisco Cys residues are indeed oxidized at the onset of stress (17García-Ferris C. Moreno J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1994; 193: 208-215Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), no direct connection between Cys oxidation and Rubisco degradation in vivo has been demonstrated. Now that it is possible to use directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation of Chlamydomonas as a means for examining eukaryotic Rubisco (9Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), we decided to examine the potential role of Cys oxidation in the regulated degradation of Rubisco. Only three pairs of Cys residues are close enough within the Rubisco crystal structure to have the potential for forming disulfide bonds (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,40Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large-subunit Cys-247/Cys-247 (between subunits) and Cys-172/Cys-192 residues are conserved among eukaryotic Rubisco enzymes (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Whereas the tobacco and Chlamydomonas Rubisco enzymes may also have a disulfide bond between Cys-449 and Cys-459 (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), spinach Rubisco contains Thr-449. Cys-172 and Cys-192 are particularly interesting because they appear to form a covalent bond in unactivated tobacco Rubisco, but are only in van der Waals contact in activated Rubisco (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity labeling of spinach Rubisco with N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate also revealed that Cys-172 and Cys-459 were chemically modified in unactivated Rubisco, but not in activated Rubisco (41Schloss J.V. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5707-5711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Cys residues do not play a direct role in catalysis (reviewed in Ref. 2Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they may have a dynamic role in function, structure, or regulation. When Cys-172 was replaced by Ser (substitution of only a single atom) in the Chlamydomonas large subunit, no significant effect on the growth of the mutant cells was observed (Fig. 1), and C172S mutant Rubisco assembled into a native structure (Fig. 2). Thus, the identity of Cys-172 and the proposed dynamics of Cys-172–Cys-192 disulfide bond formation (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not essential for holoenzyme assembly or catalysis. This is particularly surprising because previous analysis of Chlamydomonas rbcL mutations showed that substitutions G171D and T173I eliminate RuBP carboxylase activity without affecting the amount of Rubisco in vivo (42Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar,43Spreitzer R.J. Brown T. Chen Z. Zhang D. Al-Abed S.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1988; 86: 987-989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C172S Rubisco is less stable to elevated temperature than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). This might be expected if the C172S substitution disrupts a Cys-172–Cys-192 disulfide bond. However, activated mutant Rubisco was used in this study, and based on interpretation of the tobacco Rubisco crystal structures (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Cys-172 and Cys-192 are not expected to form a disulfide bond under this condition. There are additional reasons for doubting that the C172S mutation exerts its influence by disrupting a disulfide bond. Treatment of both the C172S mutant and wild-type Rubisco enzymes with the disulfide-exchanging thiol DTT decreased the thermal stability of both enzymes to the same extent (Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the increase in thermal sensitivity is due to DTT acting on disulfides other than the Cys-172/Cys-192 pair. Nonetheless, one may argue that the putative Cys-172–Cys-192 disulfide bond is resistant to DTT, as is the Cys-247–Cys-247 disulfide bond that is buried within the hydrophobic core of spinach Rubisco (7Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 44Ranty B. Lorimer G. Gutteridge S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the RuBP carboxylase activity of C172S Rubisco was found to be resistant to arsenite inactivation (TableI). Because arsenite reacts exclusively with vicinal thiol groups (37Torchinsky Y.M. Sulfur in Proteins. Pergamon Press plc, Oxford1981Google Scholar), it is likely that arsenite bridges the only free thiols (Cys-172 and Cys-192) that are close together in wild-type Rubisco (5Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the RuBP carboxylase-specific activity of the wild-type enzyme by 25% (Table I). The mutant enzyme would be resistant to arsenite because it lacks one of these free thiols (Cys-172). Thus, the results are consistent with the idea that Cys-172 and Cys-192 do not form a disulfide bond in activated wild-type Rubisco. The C172S substitution does not affect the critical redox potential for enzyme inactivation (Fig. 4), further indicating that a Cys-172–Cys-192 disulfide bond is not required for the catalytic function of Rubisco. However, in comparison to wild-type Rubisco, the C172S mutant enzyme is somewhat more resistant to proteolysis in vitro at lower redox potentials (Fig. 5). Furthermore, mutant Rubisco degradation in vivo is slower than that of wild-type Rubisco under oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) or osmotic (mannitol) stress conditions (Fig. 6). This indicates a subtler role for Cys-172 than merely stabilizing Rubisco structure through a disulfide bond. In fact, the delayed degradation of Rubisco in stressed cells is opposite to what one would expect from the lower thermal stability of C172S Rubisco observed in vitro (Fig. 3). Perhaps the delayed degradation of C172S Rubisco observed in vivo results from alteration of an oxidative signal transduction pathway that triggers Rubisco turnover. Cys-172 would be a significant component of this pathway. The absence of Cys-172 shifts the critical redox potential for Rubisco proteolysis to more oxidative conditions (Fig. 5) and protects Rubisco from degradation under stress conditions (Fig. 6). However, the C172S substitution does not completely prevent induced Rubisco turnover, indicating that more than one Cys residue may contribute to redox regulation of Rubisco degradation. Additional Cys substitutions may help to elucidate the redox signaling pathway.

In this signaling paradigm, JAKs are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, and STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are the cytoplasmic transcription factors they activate. Once activated, STATs dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to enhancer elements, culminating in gene induction. Subsequent studies have determined that all members of the cytokine family transduce signals through one or more of the seven members of the STAT family (4Ihle J.N.

These STATs share several functionally conserved domains including an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain, a DNA binding domain, a linker domain, an SH2 domain, a tyrosine activation domain, and a divergent carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain (6Chen X.

Moreover, a number of studies have determined that these ligands transduce signals through several isoforms of Stat5.

In the absence of both Stat5a and Stat5b, there are significant defects in the development of CFU-Mix, CFU-Eos, and CFU-GM colonies, as well as defects in the induction of target genes (20Teglund S.

In myeloid progenitors, IL-3 stimulates the induction of carboxyl-terminally truncated isoforms of both Stat5a (i.e. 77 kDa) and Stat5b (i.e. 80 kDa). These isoforms, which are missing their transcriptional activation domain, are functionally distinct and fail to promote the induction of Stat5 target genes (19Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schindler C.

A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the truncated isoforms of Stat5 are generated through a unique protein-processing event. Previous studies have indicated that this protease is specific for Stat5 and can only be found in several immature cell lines (19Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schindler C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this work, we extend these studies and demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the expression of truncated Stat5 isoforms and protease activity. Moreover, this activity is only found in myeloid progenitors, supporting our hypothesis that the Stat5 protease plays an important regulatory role during myelopoiesis. We find no evidence for this during lymphoid development. Biochemical characterization of this protease has revealed that it has an apparent molecular mass of ∼25 kDa and exhibits a unique pattern of sensitivity to serine protease inhibitors. Functional evidence is provided for a role of this protease in myeloid development. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

FDC-P1 (cl.19) cells were transfected by electroporation (Gentronics model ECM600; 260 V, 1050 farads with infinite resistance) and neomycin-resistant clones (G418 at 0.5 mg/ml) selected by limiting dilution (36Pernis A. Gupta S. Gollob K. Garfein E. Coffman B. Schindler C. Rothman P. Science. 1995; 269: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Stat5 cleaving activity was evaluated either through immunoblotting or electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Briefly, 1 μl of recombinant Stat5b (or Stat5a) substrate (prepared by transient transfection; see above) was incubated with 1–5 μl of crude or partially purified protease for 30–60 min at 37 °C. The reactants were then evaluated either by SDS-PAGE or EMSA with an IRF1-GAS probe (gatcGATTTCCCCGAAAT; Oligos Etc.), as described previously (37Bonni A. Frank D.A. Schindler C. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For pH optima studies, either 1 mHepes or 1 m Tris, at the appropriate pH, was added to each cleavage assay to achieve a final concentration of ∼330 mm (i.e. 1 μl of buffer + 1 μl of protease + 1 μl of rStat5b*). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (1Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schindler C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with antibodies at a 1:2000-fold dilution or as recommended by the manufacturer (38Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Pan-Stat5 and antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. The mass of peptides was determined by MALDI mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE RP with a 337-nm pulsed nitrogen laser; Perspective Biosystems) at the Columbia University Protein Core facility. Briefly, 200–300 pmol of biotinylated peptides, biotin-GSGATYMDQAPS and biotin-GASATYMDQAPS (prepared at Amgen, Boulder, CO), were incubated with 5–8 μl of crude or partially purified protease in CHAPS buffer in a final volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactants were dried and redissolved in 10 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid + bradykinin as an internal standard). Crude protease was prepared by gentle resuspension of a pellet of washed cells (∼2 × 106cells) in 2 volumes of cold (4 °C) CHAPS buffer adjusted to 150 mm NaCl (CHAPS, 150 mm). This material was then homogenized by 30 strokes in a 7-ml glass Dounce with a “type A” pestle (Kontes). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (12000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). For purification, 10 ml of extracts were prepared from 500 ml of cultured FdTrk cells at one time and then snap-frozen. 20 ml of accumulated extract was fractionated on a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 10 cm), equilibrated in 1× CHAPS, 150 mm. Proteins were eluted with a linear 0.15–1.2m NaCl gradient (in 1× CHAPS buffer), and protease activity was determined by EMSA. Peak fractions, eluting between 500 and 650 mm NaCl (radiometer conductivity meter), were pooled, diluted to 150 mm NaCl, and applied to a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column (1.5 × 12 cm), also equilibrated in 1× CHAPS, 150 mm. Bound proteins were again eluted with a linear 0.15–1.2 m NaCl gradient (in 1× CHAPS buffer). Peak fractions, which eluted between 600 and 800 mm NaCl, were diluted to 150 mm NaCl and applied to a Econo-Pac CM Cartridge (2 tandem 5-ml columns; Bio-Rad), equilibrated as described above. Peak activity eluted between 280 and 380 mm NaCl. Next, 1–2 ml of this peak activity was either applied to a 50-ml size exclusion column (2 × 27 cm; SE100/40, Bio-Rad) or a second 3-ml DEAE-MacroPrep column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated to pH 8.4. A concentrated sample (∼4-fold; Centricon-3, Millipore) was applied to the exclusion column both before and after calibration with Sigma molecular weight standards. These included blue dextran (200,000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), lysozyme (14.3 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Conditions for the second DEAE fractionation were similar to the first, except binding and elution were carried out at pH 8.5. In both of these final chromatographic steps, fractions with peak activity were concentrated 3–5-fold by Centricon 10 membranes (Millipore) or 50–60-fold by lyophilization and then fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Stimulation of cells with members of the IL-3 family of cytokines leads to the induction of two distinct types of Stat5 DNA binding complexes (1Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M.

A slower migrating complex, consisting of the full-length isoforms of Stat5a (i.e. p96) and Stat5b (i.e. p94), is found in most other cells (1Azam M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M.

Recent studies have determined that a protease is responsible for the generation of the truncated isoforms of Stat5 in DA-3 and FDC-P1 cells (19Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schindler C.

To extend these initial observations, extracts were prepared from several additional cell lines and evaluated for Stat5 protease activity (Fig. 1). In the absence of protease activity, the full-length DNA binding activity (i.e. an “Intact” p94 homodimer) was recovered. If protease activity was present, then the full-length recombinant activated Stat5b (i.e. rStat5b) was cleaved into the faster migrating “truncated” DNA binding activity (i.e. the “Cleaved” p80 homodimer). Extracts prepared from FdTrk cells served as the positive control for protease activity ((19) see Fig. 1, lane 2). In several cases, an additional intermediate complex (i.e. a p94:p80 heterodimer; data not shown), which correlated with less potent protease activity (e.g. see Fig.3 A), was recovered (see Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5). Similar results were obtained with the slower migrating (19Azam M. Lee C. Strehlow I. Schindler C.

A, protease activity recovered from the final SE100/40 size exclusion chromatography step was evaluated as outlined in Fig. 1. Recombinant activated Stat5b (rSt5b*) was either loaded directly (lane 1), incubated with buffer alone (lane 2), incubated with the column load (lane 3), or incubated with the indicated column fractions (Frn.)

B, fractions from subsequent chromatographic steps were run on an SDS-PAGE and evaluated by silver staining to evaluate the progress in purification. Included in the analysis were the peak fractions from the DEAE-Sephacel (lane 1), CM Econo-Pac (lane 2), and DEAE-MacroPrep (lanes 6 and 7) chromatographic steps. The peak fraction (#31) from the SE100/40 column (see A) was evaluated both before (lane 4) and after (lane 5) an ∼10-fold concentration. An inactive fraction (#24, lane 3) from this column was included for comparison. Likewise, both an inactive (I, lane 6) and active (A, lane 7) fraction from the DEAE-MacroPrep eluate have been included.

The full-length sertolin cDNA consists of 853 base pairs with an open reading frame of 381 base pairs coding for a 127-amino acid polypeptide that shares limited identities with antaxin/josephin and thrombospondin proteins. Sertolin (calculated molecular mass, 13,759 daltons) has two mRNA transcripts of 2.3 and 1 kilobase. A 22-amino acid peptide based on the deduced amino acid sequence of sertolin (NH2-KKEHFNLFKAASVSHLVQVVPQ) was synthesized and used for polyclonal antibody production. Immunoblot analysis detected a 17-kDa immunoreactive band in the Sertoli cell cytosol. Using Sertoli-germ cell cocultures, sertolin expression was found to be reduced by as much as 5-fold at the time when germ cells attach onto Sertoli cells but preceding the establishment of specialized inter-Sertoli-germ cell junctions. Neither FSH nor 17β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-3-one was able to affect sertolin expression, whereas estradiol-17β and progesterone induced a significant increase in Sertoli cell sertolin expression in vitro. In addition, interleukin-1α, a germ cell-derived cytokine, was also able to elicit a transient but significant increase in Sertoli cell sertolin expression. Sertolin expression was also shown to increase with testicular development and is likely to be associated with the onset of spermatogenesis. In addition, sertolin expression increased in the testis when generalized inflammation was induced in adult rats by injection of fermented yeast.

Waites G.M.B. Hamilton D.W. Greep R.O. The Handbook of Physiology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1975: 143-172Google Scholar, 2de Kretser D.M. Kerr J.B. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. 1. Raven Press, New York1988: 837-932Google Scholar). During the process of germ cell movement, it is envisioned that specialized inter-Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell junctions must be intermittently disassembled and reassembled in a highly organized manner. As such, germ cell movement must consist of intermittent phases of junction disassembly and reassembly. These events probably also require the active participation of several proteases, protease inhibitors, junctional complex components, and signaling molecules that are found in the testis (3Byers S. Pelletier R.M. Suarez-Quian C. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 431-446Google Scholar, 4Fritz I.B. Tung P.S. Ailenberg M. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 217-235Google Scholar). However, the intricate cascade(s) of events underlying spermatogenesis with respect to germ cell migration has not been elucidated. Recent studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that when germ cells consisting largely of spermatogonia and spermatocytes are cocultured with Sertoli cells in vitro for a short period of time prior to the establishment of specialized intercellular junctions, there are changes in the expression of several proteases, protease inhibitors (5Mruk D. Zhu L-J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chung S.S.W. Zhu L-J. Mo M-Y. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 686-703PubMed Google Scholar), and cell adhesion molecules (7Chung S.S.W. Mo M-Y. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showing that germ cell attachment to Sertoli cells with the eventual establishment of specialized cell junctions consists of a series of dynamic biochemical events. A better comprehension of how germ cells interact with Sertoli cells in vitro could be instrumental in interrupting or facilitating the migration of developing germ cells from the basal to adluminal compartment, thereby disrupting male fertility, although many investigators have focused and still continue to focus primarily on understanding how to disrupt the delicate hormonal balance between the pituitary and testis as a means of fertility control. One reason for this lack of knowledge in understanding the mechanism(s) of germ cell movement in the seminiferous epithelium is the shortage of available markers that can be used to examine Sertoli-germ cell interactions in the testis. Moreover, many of the biomolecules that participate in the events of germ cell movement and cell-cell interactions are not known. Therefore, we have found it necessary to identify such molecules as part of an attempt to study the biology of Sertoli-germ cell interactions. In the present study, we have utilized the mRNA differential display technique (8Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar, 9Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl.

A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) in conjunction with PCR1 to identify and clone a new Sertoli cell gene product designated sertolin. Much of the data presented in this paper rely on the relative levels of mRNA detected by RT-PCR, which is necessary due to the low level of expression of sertolin. We, however, have used an antibody prepared against a 22-amino acid peptide specific to sertolin to verify some of our observations. Preliminary studies illustrate that sertolin is a potential candidate that can be used to probe Sertoli-germ cell interactions particularly at the time preceding the establishment of specialized Sertoli-germ cell junctions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsMale or female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats of 250–300 g, body weight, and male pups at 20 or 27 days of age were obtained (Charles River Laboratories, Kingston, MA). Rats were killed by CO2asphyxiation. For testicular cell cultures, testes were removed immediately for the isolation of cells. For RNA extraction, organs were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, and stored at −80 °C until use. The use of animals for this study was approved by the Rockefeller University Animal Care and Use Committee with Protocol Numbers 95129-R1, 91353-R1, 91353-R2, and 97117.Preparation of Testicular Cell CulturesHigh and Low Density Sertoli Cell CulturesPrimary Sertoli cell cultures were prepared from 20-day-old male rats by sequential enzymatic treatments as described previously (5Mruk D. Zhu L-J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cheng C.Y. Mather J.P. Byer A.L. Bardin C.W.

Reprod. 1998; 59: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For high density Sertoli cell cultures to allow the formation of specialized occluding, anchoring, and communicating junctions, isolated cells were plated on MatrigelTM (Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA; diluted 1:7 with serum-free Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (F-12/DMEM, 1:1, v/v), Life Technologies, Inc.)-coated 12-well dishes at a density of 0.5 × 106 cell/cm2 in F-12/DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (20 mg/liter), sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/liter), 15 mm HEPES, bovine insulin (10 μg/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bacitracin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (2.5 ng/ml). Cells were incubated at 35 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (v/v). For low density Sertoli cell cultures where specialized tight junctions did not form but cell-cell and cell-substratum adhering and communicating junctions were present, isolated cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in F-12/DMEM supplemented with factors as described above. To obtain Sertoli cells with a purity of greater than 95%, cultures were hypotonically treated 48 h after plating with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 22 °C for 2.5 min to lyse contaminating germ cells (14Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This was followed by two successive washes with F-12/DMEM. Media were replaced every 24 h thereafter. Day 0 of Sertoli cell cultures represents 24 h after the hypotonic treatment. These high and low cell density cultures were then incubated for an additional 1–5 days and subsequently processed for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from cells by RNA STAT-60TM (Tel-test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) as described previously (5Mruk D. Zhu L-J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mruk D. Cheng C-H. Cheng Y-H. Mo M-Y. Grima J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol.

The concentration of RNA for all samples in this study was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm, and its integrity was assessed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The establishment of tight junctions in high density Sertoli cell cultures was assessed as described previously using bicameral units (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by the measurement of transepithelial resistance, polarized secretion of transferrin, and maintenance of nonequilibrium of media between the basal and apical compartments (5Mruk D.

Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These germ cells, which were greater than 95% pure, consisted primarily of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes with a few round spermatids. The ratio of spermatogonia:spermatocytes:round spermatids was found to be 4:5:1 when analyzed by DNA flow cytometry as described (17Aravindan G.R. Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is comparable with a previously published report (18Clermont Y. Perey B. J. Anat. 1957; 100: 241-267Crossref Scopus (530) Google Scholar). These germ cells were then used within 1 h of their isolation for coculture experiments with Sertoli cells. The somatic cell contamination in these germ cell preparations was virtually negligible when assessed by various criteria as detailed elsewhere (17Aravindan G.R. Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Aravindan G.R. Mruk D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Sertoli-Germ Cell Cocultures at High Cell DensityPrimary Sertoli cells isolated as described above were used for Sertoli-germ cell coculture experiments as described previously (5Mruk D. Zhu L-J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Isolated Sertoli cells were plated on MatrigelTM-coated 12-well dishes at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2. Cultures were hypotonically treated 48 h after their isolation. Cells were rinsed in F-12/DMEM, media were replaced 24 h thereafter, and Sertoli cells were cultured for an additional 5 days to allow the establishment of specialized junctions as assessed by previously published criteria (5Mruk D. Zhu L-J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 612-622PubMed Google Scholar,12Grima J. Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21040-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These Sertoli cells were then used for coculture experiments, and media were replaced every 24 h. Briefly, freshly isolated germ cells were cocultured with Sertoli cells using a Sertoli:germ cell ratio of 1:1 in F-12/DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (20 mg/liter), sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/liter), 15 mm HEPES, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 6 mm sodiumdl-lactate, bovine insulin (10 μg/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bacitracin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (2.5 ng/ml) and terminated at specified time points at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 h. It is noteworthy to mention that specialized Sertoli-germ cell junctions such as desmosome-like junctions are formed within 24–48 h in vitro (20Enders G.C. Millette C.F. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cameron D.F. Muffly K.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 623-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell viability of these cocultures was greater than 95% as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (22Fong R. Kissmeyer-Nielsen F. Tissue Antigens. 1972; 2: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) throughout the entire coculture period. Total RNA was subsequently extracted from these cells. Control experiments included Sertoli cells cultured alone under the same conditions as described above without the addition of germ cells.Preparation of Germ Cell-conditioned Medium (GCCM)GCCM was prepared by a nonenzymatic mechanical method as described previously (17Aravindan G.R. Pineau C.P. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Aravindan G.R. Mruk D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using germ cells isolated from adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g, body weight). These germ cells consisting largely of spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids (elongated spermatids and spermatozoa were removed by passing cells through glass wool) were greater than 95% pure when examined by DNA flow cytometry and direct microscopic examination. Furthermore, RNA extracted from these germ cells for RT-PCR failed to amplify testin cDNA, a Sertoli and Leydig cell product, demonstrating negligible somatic cell contamination. The resulting germ cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/cm2 (22 × 106 cells/100-mm dish/9 ml of F-12/DMEM) and cultured as described above. Germ cell viability was greater than 90% at the end of the 18-h culture period as determined by the erythrosine red dye exclusion test (23Phillips H.J. Terryberry J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1957; 13: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A batch of 1 liter of GCCM routinely obtained from five adult rats was pooled, concentrated at 4 °C, and equilibrated against F-12/DMEM using a Millipore MinitanTM tangential ultrafiltration unit equipped with eight MinitanTM plates with a Mr cut-off at 10,000. The sample was then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 45 min to remove cellular debris, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter unit, and stored at −20 °C until use in Sertoli cell cultures.Preparation of Sertoli Cell-conditioned Medium (SCCM)SCCM was prepared as described previously (13Mruk D. Cheng C-H. Cheng Y-H. Mo M-Y. Grima J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using primary Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. The resulting Sertoli cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. Cultures were hypotonically treated 48 h after plating. Thereafter, Sertoli cells were cultured for an additional 8 days. Spent media collected on days 4 and 8 were stored at −20 °C until use. Batches of 6–10 liters of SCCM routinely obtained from about 40–60 rats were pooled, concentrated, and equilibrated against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 22 °C as described (13Mruk D. Cheng C-H. Cheng Y-H. Mo M-Y. Grima J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for subsequent immunoblot analysis.Preparation of Cytosols and Membrane ExtractsCytosols were prepared using primary cultures of Sertoli cells, germ cells, and adult rat testes. Briefly, cells and tissue were suspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a serine protease inhibitor), and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.0, at 22 °C and homogenized with 3–5 strokes in a glass homogenizer and a Teflon-coated pestle. Samples were then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min to remove membrane debris and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter unit. Membrane extracts were obtained by solubilizing pellets obtained in the above step in a lysis buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, at 22 °C containing 1% SDS (w/v)). Protein estimation was performed by the Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213615) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.mRNA Differential Display and Cloning of Sertolin cDNAmRNA differential display was performed essentially as described (8Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar, 9Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) using RNAs isolated from primary cultures of Sertoli cells, germ cells, and Sertoli-germ cell cocultures. Sertoli and germ cells were prepared as described above using rats at 20 and 27 days of age, respectively. Cocultures of Sertoli-germ cells were prepared by layering germ cells onto Sertoli cells (which had previously been incubated for 5 days to allow the formation of specialized inter-Sertoli junctions) for 2 days before RNA was extracted for use in mRNA differential display experiments. Briefly, RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNAs utilizing an oligo(dT)11CA primer. Subsequent PCR was performed using a random sense primer of 5′-CCTGCAGATCTG-3′ (nucleotides 56–67; see Fig. 2 A) and oligo(dT)11CA with [35S]dATP (specific activity, 1370 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to amplify cDNAs. The cycling parameters for the PCR were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 42 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. A total of 40 cycles were performed. The cycles were followed by a 15-min extension period at 72 °C. Aliquots of resultant PCR products were resolved by PAGE on a 8% T sequencing gel. PCR products were visualized by autoradiography. A cDNA clone of 676 bp, designated sertolin, which was detected in Sertoli cells and Sertoli-germ cell cocultures but apparently present at a low abundance in germ cells, was selected, electroeluted from the gel, reamplified by PCR, and subcloned into pGEM-TTM vector (Promega, Madison, WI) for nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using SequenaseTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (25Cheng C.Y. Chen C-L.C. Feng Z.M. Marshall A. Bardin C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 15: 398-404Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This 676-bp clone contained about 90% of the entire open reading frame of sertolin. mRNA differential display experiments using RNAs isolated from different batches of Sertoli, germ, and Sertoli-germ cell cocultures were repeated five times, and the band corresponding to sertolin was seen in three out of five experiments. To confirm that this clone was not the result of an artifact, another sertolin cDNA was isolated using the Marathon kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer using a sertolin antisense primer of 5′-AATTCATCACAGTCTATCCCACTGA-3′ (nucleotides 215–239), which isolated a clone of about 1.4 kilobase. Briefly, 1 μg of Sertoli cell poly(A+) RNA isolated by the mRNA Separator kit (CLONTECH) was used for double-stranded cDNA synthesis. Subsequent PCR was performed using the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH). In addition to the two sertolin cDNA clones obtained and described above for sequencing, we have subsequently isolated a third sertolin cDNA by PCR containing the entire open reading frame to confirm the sertolin nucleotide sequence.Preparation of Sertolin Synthetic Peptide and Polyclonal Antibody ProductionTo confirm that the isolated sertolin cDNA indeed translates into a protein found in Sertoli cells and/or germ cells corresponding to the calculated Mr of sertolin based on its deduced amino acid sequence, a 22-amino acid internal peptide of NH2-KKEHFNLFKAASVSHLVQVVPQ based on the primary sequence for sertolin was synthesized (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA), which shared no significant homologies when compared with the existing peptide sequences in data bases at BLAST and Protein Identification Resource (PIR). To purify the synthetic peptide, about 300 μg of the crude peptide was loaded onto a VydacTM (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250-mm inner diameter) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The bound peptide was eluted using a linear gradient of 30–70% solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 5% water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, v/v) for a period of 30 min. The eluents were monitored by UV absorbance at 220 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Thereafter, about 0.1 nmol of the purified sertolin peptide was sequenced as described previously (13Mruk D. Cheng C-H. Cheng Y-H. Mo M-Y. Grima J. Silvestrini B. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol.

Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified and quantified by HPLC utilizing a BrownleeTM PTH-C18 (2.1 × 220-mm inner diameter) column (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Protein sequencing was repeated twice using two different batches of the purified sertolin synthetic peptide. The repetitive yield was about 96%. Thereafter, a total of about 2 mg of this purified peptide was conjugated to cationized bovine serum albumin at a peptide:carrier ratio of 1:1 via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl (EDC) using the Imject SuperCarrierTM EDC System for Peptides (Pierce). Subsequently, the peptide-carrier conjugate was purified by gel filtration and used for immunization (28Vaitukaitis J.L. Robbins J.B. Nieschlag E. Ross G.T. J. Clin.

Sertoli cells, prepared essentially as described above, were cultured on MatrigelTM-coated 12-well dishes at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2. Cultures were hypotonically treated 48 h thereafter. Sertoli cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h to allow for cell recovery. Thereafter, Sertoli cells were cultured for an additional 0–24 h in the presence of IL-1α (10 units/dish), INF-γ (100 units/dish), or bFGF (150 ng/dish). Total RNA was subsequently extracted from these cells for RT-PCR.

Sertoli cells, prepared as described above, were cultured on MatrigelTM-coated 12-well dishes at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2. After 48 h, cultures were hypotonically treated, followed by two washings with F-12/DMEM, and allowed to recover for 24 h. Sertoli cells were then cultured for an additional 4 days. Thereafter, Sertoli cells were cultured for 0 to 24 h in the presence of either FSH (100 ng/dish), estradiol-17β (1 × 10−7m), progesterone (1 × 10−7m), or 17β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-3-one (dihydrotestosterone, 1 × 10−7m) (Sigma).

Briefly, rats were injected subcutaneously at multiple sites with 10 ml/kg body weight of 10% (gm/ml) fermented brewer's yeast suspended in sterile water. Fermentation was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for approximately 15 h. Thereafter, the fermented yeast was stored at 4 °C for at least 24 h before its use. Animals were killed by CO2asphyxiation, and testes, brain, and liver were removed at 2, 6, 24, 48, and 96 h after the injection of yeast.

Recent demonstrations that inhibitors of this enzyme block the growth of a variety of human tumors point to the importance of this enzyme in human tumor formation. In this paper, we report that a mutant form of human FTase, Y361L, exhibits increased resistance to farnesyltransferase inhibitors, particularly a tricyclic compound, SCH56582, which is a competitive inhibitor of FTase with respect to the C AAX (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is the C-terminal residue that is preferentially serine, cysteine, methionine, glutamine or alanine) substrates. The Y361L mutant maintains FTase activity toward substrates ending with CIIS. However, the mutant also exhibits an increased affinity for peptides terminating with CIIL, a motif that is recognized by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I). The Y361L mutant also demonstrates activity with Ha-Ras and Cdc42Hs proteins, substrates of FTase and GGTase I, respectively. In addition, the Y361L mutant shows a marked sensitivity to a zinc chelator HPH-5 suggesting that the mutant has altered zinc coordination. These results demonstrate that a single amino acid change at a residue at the active site can lead to the generation of a mutant resistant to FTase inhibitors.

This modification is critical for membrane association and subsequent protein-protein interactions of these proteins. FTase is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of α- and β-subunits. The α-subunit of FTase is shared with the related prenyltransferase, protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I), whereas the β-subunits of FTase and GGTase I are approximately 30% homologous. The FTase enzyme recognizes the C AAX motif (C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is the C-terminal residue that is preferentially serine, cysteine, methionine, glutamine or alanine) that is found at the C termini of the substrate proteins. GGTase I enzyme also recognizes a C AAX motif; however, the terminal X amino acid is predominantly leucine or phenylalanine. This motif is referred to as the C AAL motif.The three-dimensional structures of the rat FTase enzyme have recently been resolved without substrate bound (5Park H.W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F.

In the structure without bound substrate, a non-cognate peptide provided by an adjacent β-subunit was modeled into the active site of the enzyme. The structure showed that the α- and β-subunits are largely composed of α-helices. The β-subunit forms a barrel-like structure, and one side of this barrel is wrapped by the α-subunit in a crescent shape. One molecule of zinc ion is bound to the heterodimer, and the binding of zinc is coordinated by β-subunit residues Asp-297, Cys-299, His-362, and a water molecule (5Park H.W. Boduluri S.R.

Amino acid changes at positions 159, 362, and 366 of the yeast enzyme exhibited altered substrate recognition. The crystal structures suggest that the corresponding residues of rat FTase are located in α-helices that surround the central cavity formed by the β-barrel structure (5Park H.W. Boduluri S.R.

Remarkably, these inhibitors have little effect on untransformed cells. Moreover, FTIs do not exhibit significant toxicity in animal studies (2Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These inhibitors are currently being assessed in clinical trials (28Barinaga M.

These mutants should provide valuable tools to probe important elements of the active site structure required for the recognition of the inhibitors and substrate proteins. In addition, such mutants should be invaluable for assessing whether in vivo effects of the inhibitors, such as morphological changes (19Bishop W.R. Bond R. Petrin J. Wang L. Patton R. Doll R.

A hint for identifying mutant FTase resistant to FTIs came from our previous work on yeast FTase. As described above, mutants having a single amino acid change at either residue 159, 362, or 366 exhibited altered substrate recognition. They acquire the ability to recognize the C AAL motif, which is normally recognized by GGTase I (14Mitsuzawa H. Esson K. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Del Villar K. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since many of the inhibitors act to compete with FTase substrates, we speculated that mutants resistant to FTIs could be found among such mutants that exhibited altered substrate recognition. To test this idea, we introduced mutations into human FTase that corresponded to the yeast mutations and characterized these mutant enzymes.We show in this paper that an amino acid change at residue 361 has a significant effect on the sensitivity of FTase to FTIs. In particular, the mutant shows more than several thousand-fold increase in the resistance to a tricyclic FTI, SCH56582 (19Bishop W.R. Bond R. Petrin J. Wang L. Patton R. Doll R. Njoroge G. Catino J. Schwartz J. Windsor W. Syto R. Schwartz J. Carr D. James L. Kirschmeier P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30611-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mutant also exhibits altered sensitivity to a zinc chelator, suggesting that conformational changes have occurred at the active site of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we report, for the first time, identification of a mutant form of FTase resistant to FTase inhibitors. The mutant has increased resistance to FTIs, particularly to tricyclic inhibitors. Since the tricyclic inhibitors act as competitors of the C AAX substrate, these results suggest that the mutant is capable of recognizing subtle differences between the inhibitors and the substrate protein. This idea is further supported by the observation that the mutant is capable of recognizing differences between two tricyclic compounds, SCH56582 and SCH44342. These two compounds differ only in the presence of a bromine on the tricyclic ring of SCH56582 (31Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Resistance to other classes of FTIs, specifically C AAX peptidomimetics, was also observed to a lesser extent, indicating that inhibitors generally bind differently to the active site of FTase. An important feature of our mutant is that it exhibits FTase activity toward normal substrates. The kcat /Km values of the Y361L mutant FTase for CIIS substrate are comparable to those of the wild type enzyme, whereas the kcat /Km for CIIL substrate is 10-fold greater for the mutant. In addition, the Y361L mutant enzyme can functionally replace yeast FTase in vivo as seen with the complementation of yeast FTase-defective mutants, dpr1 and ram2. A mutation of Arg-202 to alanine was previously identified that suggested discrete recognition differences among classes of peptidomimetic FTIs (10Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. deSolms S.J. Williams T.M. Kohl N.E. Omer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27319-27323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this mutant, however, the affinity for substrate peptides was completely abrogated as indicated by a greater than 400-fold increase in the Km value for C AAX substrate.Mutagenesis of yeast FTase has provided several clues regarding substrate recognition (10Kral A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis of regions conserved among prenyltransferases has suggested the importance of residues that are in close proximity to the catalytic zinc ion in the three-dimensional crystal structure. However, previous studies with yeast FTase suggested Tyr-362 greatly impacted the recognition of peptide substrates (15Del Villar K. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in this paper, the corresponding residue Tyr-361 of human FTase also plays a critical role in the recognition of the C AAX substrate. Alteration of this residue to a hydrophobic residue such as leucine or methionine results in increased affinity for the C AAL motif proteins. This suggests that the residue Tyr-361 is located in or close to the C AAX peptide-binding site in the ternary substrate-bound enzymatic complex.Recent structure determinations support the above idea (5Park H.W.

Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) shows that this residue is located very close to the presumed C AAX peptide-binding site in a hydrophobic pocket lined with aromatic residues. Moreover, Dunten et al. (6Dunten P. Kammlott U. Crowther R. Weber D. Palermo R. Birktoft J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7907-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have published an FTase structure that differs from the previous structure determination in the placement of the peptide and prenyl substrates in the active site cavity; however, the residues Pro-152, Tyr-361, and Tyr-365 are located along one side of the hydrophobic pocket in the center of the β-subunit barrel wherein the substrates presumably bind. Most recently, Strickland et al. (8Strickland C.L. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Wang L. Bond R. Wu Z. Schwartz J. Le H.V. Beese L.S. Weber P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16601-16611Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have shown that the ternary structure of rat FTase complexed with acetyl-Cys-Val-Ile-seleno-Met-COOH and α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid results in major rearrangements of active site side chains upon substrate binding. Tyr-361 and Pro-152 lie in narrow pockets in which the Ile and Met side chains are sequestered, respectively. This again suggests that these residues effect substrate recognition, while having little effect on catalysis. The conservation of position 361 among all FTases, but its lack of conservation among prenyltransferases including GGTase I, also suggests a significant recognition role rather than catalytic role.According to various three-dimensional structures, Tyr-361 is located very near the FPP substrate molecule and the peptide substrate in the presumed active site (Fig.7 A). When an energy minimized substitution of residue 361 with leucine was performed, the orientation of Leu-361 was pointed away from the FPP molecule, suggesting a relaxed active site in which a tetrapeptide containing X = leucine could be accommodated (Fig. 7 B). In contrast to the result with Y361L, alteration of residues Pro-152 or Tyr-365 resulted in only a minor increase in the C AAL affinity. Mutations at these residues in the yeast FTase display an increased affinity for the C AAL motif. Along with Tyr-361, residues Pro-152 and Tyr-365 reside in an interior hydrophobic pocket formed by the β-subunit, wherein the peptide and prenyl substrates bind (6Dunten P. Kammlott U. Crowther R. Weber D. Palermo R. Birktoft J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7907-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, not all mutations identified in yeast FTase exert similar effects in human FTase. Further mutagenic analysis of positions 152 and 365 are required to determine the importance of these sites in the human FTase enzyme.Another interesting characteristic of the Y361L mutant is that it exhibits increased sensitivity to zinc chelators HPH-5 and HPH-6. The restoration of FTase enzymatic activity upon addition of excess ZnCl2 at the start of the enzymatic reaction, rather than after the zinc chelator was preincubated with the FTase enzyme, suggests a complex is formed by HPH compounds bound to zinc at the active site. We believe that zinc affinity is not significantly altered in the mutant, since the mutant and the wild type enzymes were inhibited by similar concentrations of general metal chelators such as 1,10-phenanthroline, dipyridyl, and ethylenediamine. Taken together with the FTI results, it appears that the active site of the enzyme is altered in the mutant in a way that makes the mutant enzyme inaccessible to tricyclic FTIs but more accessible to HPH-5 and HPH-6. Structural analysis of the active site after an energy minimized mutation is imposed at position 361 (Fig. 7) reveals a definite realignment of the leucine at 361 away from the zinc ion, resulting in a relaxed configuration that may make the mutant enzyme more susceptible for inhibitor chelation and the observed sensitivity toward the HPH compounds. Alternatively, introduction of this mutation may shift the orientation of adjacent zinc ligand side chains such as His-362. However, further structural and mutational analysis of Tyr-361 and adjacent residues may be necessary to evaluate this idea.Because the Y361L mutant exhibits FTI-resistant FTase activity, we speculated that introduction of the mutant gene into transformed cells may render cells resistant to FTI. To test this idea, we transiently expressed the Y361L mutant FTase β-subunit together with the α-subunit in v-K -ras transformed NRK (KNRK) cells. 2K. Del Villar and F. Tamanoi, unpublished results. The β-subunit was fused with the green fluorescent protein to observe selectively the transfected cells. Previously, we have shown that KNRK cells undergo dramatic morphological changes by SCH56582 (20Suzuki N. Del Villar K. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10499-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these morphological changes were not observed when KNRK cells expressed the mutant FTase. In contrast, KNRK cells expressing the wild type FTase at a similar level to that of the Y361L mutant still underwent FTI-induced morphological changes. These results support the possibility that the FTI-induced morphological changes may be potentiated by the inhibition of FTase in KNRK cells. There are other effects of FTI on KNRK cells which include inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, decrease of S-phase cells, accumulation of G1-phase cells, and induction of apoptosis (20Suzuki N. Del Villar K. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10499-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Suzuki N. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15356-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether these FTI effects are altered by the expression of the Y361L mutant FTase. In addition, the Y361M and Y361I mutants, which demonstrated varying degrees of C AAL recognition, were resistant to SCH56582. These may be utilized to disseminate further the phenotypic characteristics resulting from FTI treatments. This line of investigation may provide critical results to pinpoint biologically significant effects induced by FTIs.Our finding that a single amino acid change causes FTase to become completely resistant to FTase inhibitors raises general issues about the use of FTase inhibitors for cancer treatments. FTIs need to be administered continuously, since the termination of treatment with the inhibitors in a mouse mammary tumor model system led to recurrence of tumors (26Kohl N.E. Omer C.A. Conner M.W.

Collecting a variety of mutants resistant to the FTIs may provide information on how FTI-resistant mutants could be generated, and this knowledge could be important in predicting how readily such mutants arise.It has not escaped our attention that our finding of the inhibition of FTase activity by a zinc chelator HPH-5 raises a possibility that a novel type of FTase inhibitor based on zinc chelation could be developed. Because the zinc ion participates in FTase catalysis (5Park H.W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 6Dunten P.

In this regard, it is intriguing that HPH-5 may form a complex with the enzyme rather than simply chelating a zinc ion away from the enzyme. This suggests that a compound with specificity toward FTase might be obtained by the use of derivatives of HPH-5. Further work is needed to develop derivatives of HPH-5 that demonstrate suitable potency against the wild type human FTase.Note Added in ProofRecently, Strickland et al. (Strickland, C. L., Weber, P.

Under conditions of high copper concentration, Mac1 represses transcription of genes coding for copper transport proteins. Mac1 binds to DNA sequences called copper response elements (CuREs), which have the consensus sequence 5′-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3′. Mac1 contains two zinc binding sites, a copper binding site, and the sequence motif RGRP, which has been found in other proteins to mediate binding to the minor groove of A/T-rich sequences in DNA. We have used hydroxyl radical footprinting, missing nucleoside, and methylation interference experiments to investigate the structure of the complex of the DNA binding domain of Mac1 (called here Mac1t) with the two CuRE sites found in the yeast CTR1 promoter. We conclude from these experiments that Mac1t binds in a modular fashion to DNA, with its RGRP AT-hook motif interacting with the TTT sequence at the 5′ end of the CTR1 CuRE site, and with another DNA-binding module(s) binding in the adjacent major groove in the GCTCA sequence.

These sites, designated copper-response elements (CuREs),1 have the consensus sequence 5′-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3′. Binding of Mac1 to CuREs is required for transcriptional activation of the target genes (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

The CuREs are oriented as either direct or inverted repeats. The spacing between CuRE sites is variable, and changes in spacing have a limited effect on expression (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement for the presence of at least two CuRE sites likely lies in the need for synergism for proper copper-dependent gene regulation (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C.

The distribution of charged amino acid residues in Mac1 is not uniform; the N-terminal segment (residues 1–201) is strongly basic, while the C-terminal segment (residues 202–417) is mostly acidic (6Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of Mac1 maps to the N-terminal 159 residues. Two Zn(II) ions are coordinated by the protein in the DNA-binding domain (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Part of the Mac1 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–40) is homologous to the conserved zinc-binding module found in the copper-activated transcription factors Ace1 and Amt1 from S. cerevisiae and Candida glabrata, respectively (6Jungmann J.

This zinc-binding subdomain has been implicated in making direct interactions with DNA in the minor groove of an A/T-rich sequence (13Farrell R.A. Thorvalsden J.L. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Copper at concentrations above 1 nm represses Mac1 function in vivo by attenuating DNA binding activity. Footprinting experiments in vivo revealed that Mac1 binds to the CuREs upstream of the CTR3 gene in copper-starved but not copper-replete cells (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown, however, that copper-dependent inactivation of Mac1 is more complex than this simple picture might suggest. First, DNA binding in vitro either by the minimal DNA binding domain of Mac1 or by full-length Mac1 prepared by in vitro transcription/translation is not copper-dependent (7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M.

Second, the transactivation activity of Mac1 is repressed in copper-supplemented cells (14Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transactivation activity maps to two cysteine-rich sequences (residues 264–337) in the C-terminal region of Mac1 (15Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Eight Cu(I) ions bind within this domain (16Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Binding of Cu(I) to the Cys-rich motif induces an intramolecular interaction with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (16Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The CuRE sequences bound by Mac1 resemble the DNA binding sites for Ace1 and Amt1 in having an A/T-rich sequence upstream of a related core element (4Labbe S.

This observation suggests that Ace1 and Mac1 may interact with DNA in a similar manner, even though Ace1 activates the copper sequestration machinery of the cell, while Mac1 activates the copper acquisition machinery (7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).To investigate the interaction of Mac1 with its DNA binding site, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting, missing nucleoside, and methylation interference experiments. For these experiments we used a truncated version of Mac1, which we call Mac1t. This protein contains the minimal DNA-binding domain of Mac1, and consists of residues 1–159 of Mac1 (see Fig. 1) plus a C-terminal His tag. We studied the binding of Mac1tto a fragment of the CTR1 promoter in order to establish the contacts that Mac1 makes with a CuRE site.RESULTSThe minimal DNA-binding domain of Mac1 consists of the N-terminal 159 residues (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For our experiments we used a His-tagged derivative of this 159-residue truncated version of Mac1, which we call Mac1t. Mac1t binds to the CuRE sequence with an apparent affinity of 5 nm (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mac1-(1–194) fused to glutathione S-transferase gave similar results to Mac1t in DNA binding experiments, demonstrating that the His tag of Mac1t does not affect DNA binding. We carried out footprinting, missing nucleoside, and methylation interference experiments with Mac1t bound to the 96-bp CTR1 DNA molecule, which contains two CuRE sites separated by 14 bp. In the CTR1 promoter the two CuRE sites are arranged as an inverted repeat.Hydroxyl Radical Footprints of Mac1t Bound to the CTR1 PromoterWe see a single strong hydroxyl radical footprint for Mac1t on only one DNA strand in each of the two CuRE sites in the CTR1 promoter (Fig. 2). The region most strongly protected is found at positions −336 to −331 on the coding strand and at −304 to −308 on the noncoding strand. The most protected nucleotides are T(−334) on the coding strand and the symmetry-related T(−305) on the noncoding strand. The strong footprint is centered on the 5′-TTTG-3′ sequence in each CuRE inverted repeat. One or two nucleotides to the 5′ side of each CuRE consensus sequence also are protected.Figure 2Hydroxyl radical footprints of Mac1t bound to the CTR1 promoter.

The four nucleotides that make up the 3′-half of each CuRE site (5′-CTCA-3′) are not protected (in fact, are slightly enhanced in cleavage in the presence of protein). The next 15 nucleotides are protected to a slight but noticeable extent from hydroxyl radical cleavage by bound Mac1t.Missing Nucleoside Analysis of Mac1t Binding to the CTR1 PromoterWe used the missing nucleoside interference assay to obtain information about specific nucleosides that are important for DNA binding by Mac1t. In this experiment (20Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a protein is allowed to bind to a sample of DNA that has first been randomly gapped by reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Each individual DNA molecule in the sample has at most one gap in its backbone. Certain gaps in the DNA backbone (missing nucleosides) interfere with protein binding, while other gaps have no effect on binding. To determine which missing nucleosides fall into which category, the mixture of gapped DNA and protein is electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel, which separates free DNA from DNA-protein complexes. DNA extracted from the bound and free fractions is subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis to reveal which missing nucleosides interfered with protein binding, and which had no effect.The missing nucleoside pattern for the coding strand shows that loss of any of the nucleosides from positions −335 to −328 and −312 to −307 interferes with protein binding (Fig. 3). The pattern for the non-coding strand shows that nucleosides at positions −332 to −324 and −313 to −305 are important for protein binding.Figure 3Missing nucleoside analysis of Mac1t binding to the CTR1 promoter.

These genes include the plasma membrane permeases CTR1 and CTR3, the cell surface metalloreductase FRE1, and a FRE1 homolog of unknown function designated FRE7 (1Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S.

These genes are maximally expressed in copper-deficient yeast, but are repressed in copper-replete cells. Copper-dependent expression of CTR1, CTR3, FRE1, and FRE7 is regulated by the transcriptional activator Mac1 (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

These sites, designated copper-response elements (CuREs),1 have the consensus sequence 5′-TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G)-3′. Binding of Mac1 to CuREs is required for transcriptional activation of the target genes (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The CuRE is present in at least two copies in each of the four genes. The CuREs are oriented as either direct or inverted repeats. The spacing between CuRE sites is variable, and changes in spacing have a limited effect on expression (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apparent requirement for the presence of at least two CuRE sites likely lies in the need for synergism for proper copper-dependent gene regulation (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Joshi A. Serpe M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Mac1 protein consists of 417 amino acids (Fig. 1). The distribution of charged amino acid residues in Mac1 is not uniform; the N-terminal segment (residues 1–201) is strongly basic, while the C-terminal segment (residues 202–417) is mostly acidic (6Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of Mac1 maps to the N-terminal 159 residues. Two Zn(II) ions are coordinated by the protein in the DNA-binding domain (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Part of the Mac1 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–40) is homologous to the conserved zinc-binding module found in the copper-activated transcription factors Ace1 and Amt1 from S. cerevisiae and Candida glabrata, respectively (6Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J.

Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This zinc-binding subdomain has been implicated in making direct interactions with DNA in the minor groove of an A/T-rich sequence (13Farrell R.A. Thorvalsden J.L. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Copper at concentrations above 1 nm represses Mac1 function in vivo by attenuating DNA binding activity. Footprinting experiments in vivo revealed that Mac1 binds to the CuREs upstream of the CTR3 gene in copper-starved but not copper-replete cells (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown, however, that copper-dependent inactivation of Mac1 is more complex than this simple picture might suggest. First, DNA binding in vitro either by the minimal DNA binding domain of Mac1 or by full-length Mac1 prepared by in vitro transcription/translation is not copper-dependent (7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, the transactivation activity of Mac1 is repressed in copper-supplemented cells (14Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transactivation activity maps to two cysteine-rich sequences (residues 264–337) in the C-terminal region of Mac1 (15Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Eight Cu(I) ions bind within this domain (16Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Binding of Cu(I) to the Cys-rich motif induces an intramolecular interaction with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (16Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CuRE sequences bound by Mac1 resemble the DNA binding sites for Ace1 and Amt1 in having an A/T-rich sequence upstream of a related core element (4Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that Ace1 and Mac1 may interact with DNA in a similar manner, even though Ace1 activates the copper sequestration machinery of the cell, while Mac1 activates the copper acquisition machinery (7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To investigate the interaction of Mac1 with its DNA binding site, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting, missing nucleoside, and methylation interference experiments. For these experiments we used a truncated version of Mac1, which we call Mac1t. This protein contains the minimal DNA-binding domain of Mac1, and consists of residues 1–159 of Mac1 (see Fig. 1) plus a C-terminal His tag. We studied the binding of Mac1tto a fragment of the CTR1 promoter in order to establish the contacts that Mac1 makes with a CuRE site. RESULTSThe minimal DNA-binding domain of Mac1 consists of the N-terminal 159 residues (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For our experiments we used a His-tagged derivative of this 159-residue truncated version of Mac1, which we call Mac1t. Mac1t binds to the CuRE sequence with an apparent affinity of 5 nm (8Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23805-23811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mac1-(1–194) fused to glutathione S-transferase gave similar results to Mac1t in DNA binding experiments, demonstrating that the His tag of Mac1t does not affect DNA binding. We carried out footprinting, missing nucleoside, and methylation interference experiments with Mac1t bound to the 96-bp CTR1 DNA molecule, which contains two CuRE sites separated by 14 bp. In the CTR1 promoter the two CuRE sites are arranged as an inverted repeat.Hydroxyl Radical Footprints of Mac1t Bound to the CTR1 PromoterWe see a single strong hydroxyl radical footprint for Mac1t on only one DNA strand in each of the two CuRE sites in the CTR1 promoter (Fig. 2). The region most strongly protected is found at positions −336 to −331 on the coding strand and at −304 to −308 on the noncoding strand. The most protected nucleotides are T(−334) on the coding strand and the symmetry-related T(−305) on the noncoding strand. The strong footprint is centered on the 5′-TTTG-3′ sequence in each CuRE inverted repeat. One or two nucleotides to the 5′ side of each CuRE consensus sequence also are protected.Besides the strong single-strand footprint we see in each of the two CuRE sites, much weaker footprints are found on both strands in the 14 bp that separate the CuRE sites (Fig. 2, B and C). The four nucleotides that make up the 3′-half of each CuRE site (5′-CTCA-3′) are not protected (in fact, are slightly enhanced in cleavage in the presence of protein). The next 15 nucleotides are protected to a slight but noticeable extent from hydroxyl radical cleavage by bound Mac1t.Missing Nucleoside Analysis of Mac1t Binding to the CTR1 PromoterWe used the missing nucleoside interference assay to obtain information about specific nucleosides that are important for DNA binding by Mac1t. In this experiment (20Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a protein is allowed to bind to a sample of DNA that has first been randomly gapped by reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Each individual DNA molecule in the sample has at most one gap in its backbone. Certain gaps in the DNA backbone (missing nucleosides) interfere with protein binding, while other gaps have no effect on binding. To determine which missing nucleosides fall into which category, the mixture of gapped DNA and protein is electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel, which separates free DNA from DNA-protein complexes. DNA extracted from the bound and free fractions is subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis to reveal which missing nucleosides interfered with protein binding, and which had no effect.The missing nucleoside pattern for the coding strand shows that loss of any of the nucleosides from positions −335 to −328 and −312 to −307 interferes with protein binding (Fig. 3). The pattern for the non-coding strand shows that nucleosides at positions −332 to −324 and −313 to −305 are important for protein binding.Figure 3Missing nucleoside analysis of Mac1t binding to the CTR1 promoter.

The most protected nucleotides are T(−334) on the coding strand and the symmetry-related T(−305) on the noncoding strand. The strong footprint is centered on the 5′-TTTG-3′ sequence in each CuRE inverted repeat. One or two nucleotides to the 5′ side of each CuRE consensus sequence also are protected. Besides the strong single-strand footprint we see in each of the two CuRE sites, much weaker footprints are found on both strands in the 14 bp that separate the CuRE sites (Fig. 2, B and C). The four nucleotides that make up the 3′-half of each CuRE site (5′-CTCA-3′) are not protected (in fact, are slightly enhanced in cleavage in the presence of protein). The next 15 nucleotides are protected to a slight but noticeable extent from hydroxyl radical cleavage by bound Mac1t. Missing Nucleoside Analysis of Mac1t Binding to the CTR1 PromoterWe used the missing nucleoside interference assay to obtain information about specific nucleosides that are important for DNA binding by Mac1t. In this experiment (20Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a protein is allowed to bind to a sample of DNA that has first been randomly gapped by reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Each individual DNA molecule in the sample has at most one gap in its backbone. Certain gaps in the DNA backbone (missing nucleosides) interfere with protein binding, while other gaps have no effect on binding. To determine which missing nucleosides fall into which category, the mixture of gapped DNA and protein is electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel, which separates free DNA from DNA-protein complexes. DNA extracted from the bound and free fractions is subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis to reveal which missing nucleosides interfered with protein binding, and which had no effect.The missing nucleoside pattern for the coding strand shows that loss of any of the nucleosides from positions −335 to −328 and −312 to −307 interferes with protein binding (Fig. 3). The pattern for the non-coding strand shows that nucleosides at positions −332 to −324 and −313 to −305 are important for protein binding.

Methylation Interference Analysis of Mac1t Binding to the CTR1 PromoterMethylation of any of the guanines in the two CuRE sequences interferes with protein binding (Fig.4).

https://openalex.org/W1994161864,"Recently the genes encoding the human and Escherichia coli GDP-mannose dehydratase and GDP-fucose synthetase (GFS) protein have been cloned and it has been shown that these two proteins alone are sufficient to convert GDP mannose to GDP fucose in vitro. GDP-fucose synthetase from E. coli is a novel dual function enzyme in that it catalyzes epimerizations and a reduction reaction at the same active site. This aspect separates fucose biosynthesis from that of other deoxy and dideoxy sugars in which the epimerase and reductase activities are present on separate enzymes encoded by separate genes. By NMR spectroscopy we have shown that GFS catalyzes the stereospecific hydride transfer of the ProS hydrogen from NADPH to carbon 4 of the mannose sugar. This is consistent with the stereospecificity observed for other members of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase family of enzymes of which GFS is a member. Additionally the enzyme is able to catalyze the epimerization reaction in the absence of NADP or NADPH. The kinetic mechanism of GFS as determined by product inhibition and fluorescence binding studies is consistent with a random mechanism. The dissociation constants determined from fluorescence studies indicate that the enzyme displays a 40-fold stronger affinity for the substrate NADPH as compared with the product NADP and utilizes NADPH preferentially as compared with NADH. This study on GFS, a unique member of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase family, coupled with that of its recently published crystal structure should aid in the development of antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory compounds that act by blocking selectin-mediated cell adhesion.

GDP-fucose synthetase short chain dehydrogenase reductase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol GDP fucose is synthesized mainly by a de novo pathway from GDP mannose in a three-step reaction involving two enzymes as shown in Fig. 1. In the first step GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose is formed by oxidation at C-4 and subsequent reduction at C-6 of the mannose ring, catalyzed by an NADP-dependent enzyme GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. In reactions catalyzed by GDP-fucose synthetase, this intermediate then undergoes an epimerization at C-3 and C-5 of the mannose ring followed by reduction of the keto group at C-4 to yield GDP fucose (1Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.-Y. Rouse J. Chang X. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8193-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fucose is found widely distributed in complex carbohydrates as a component of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids in a wide variety of species from humans to bacteria. Fucose is added to these glycoconjugates by specific transferases that utilize GDP fucose as the sugar donor. In bacteria fucose is present as a component of the capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides which function as antigenic determinants. In several species defects in the genes encoding GFS1 have shed some light on the role played by fucose in these organisms. Inactivation of the nolK genes in Azorhizobium caulinodans results in an inability to introduce the 6-O-fucosyl branch on the lipochitooligosaccharides of the Nod factors which is an important modification for nodulation in some host plants (2Mergaert P. Montagu V.M. Holsters M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that the GFS gene which is responsible for biosynthesis of the O-antigen in Heliobacter pylori is induced at low pH and plays a role in the survival of the bacterium under acidic conditions and potentially in the virulence of the organism (3McGowan C. Necheva A. Thompson S. Cover T. Blasser J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In mammals fucose is present as a component of human blood group antigens and also is involved in regulation of the immune response. Humans deficient in the biosynthesis of GDP fucose suffer from the immune disorder leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (4Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 5Sturla L. Etzioni A. Bisso A. Zanardi D. De Flora G. Silengo L. De Flora A. Tonneti M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These patients fail to synthesize fucosylated blood groups and their leukocytes do not express fucose as a component of the selectin ligand, sialyl Lewis X (6Feizi T. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of fucose on different glycoconjugates does not seem to arise from a defect in fucosyltransferase activities but is related to the decrease in the intracellular production of GDP fucose, which serves as a substrate for these transferases. Conversely, increased fucosylation of glycoconjugates involved in metastasis has been observed in cancer patients (8McEver R.P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of synthesis of GDP fucose should aid in the development of drugs having potential as anti-inflammatory or antimetastatic agents. The NADH/NADPH-dependent short chain dehydrogenase reductase family consists of enzymes which comprise a wide variety of activities and include alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases, steroid dehydrogenases, prostaglandin dehydrogenases, carbonyl reductases, dihydropteridine reductases, and ketoacyl reductases (9Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzales R. Jefffrey J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6002-6013Crossref Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 10Persson B. Krook M. Jornvall H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 372: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These enzymes are present in bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals indicating that these enzymes are evolutionarily important in several metabolic pathways. Based on sequence and structural alignment studies, the short chain dehydrogenase family has also been shown to be distantly related to the family of steroid dehydrogeanses which include enzymes like 3-β-hydroxy-5-ene steroid dehydrogenase, UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (Gal E), and some other proteins which in sum comprise five EC classes, dehydrogenases, reductases, dehydratases, epimerases, and isomerases. Most of the members of the SDR family show residue conservations of only about 15–30% with only 9 residues being conserved in more than 90% of the enzymes. These include the Ser-Tyr-Lys catalytic triad and the glycine residues involved in coenzyme binding. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of GFS indicates that it contains a conserved Ser-Tyr-Lys catalytic triad, suggesting that it belongs to the family of short chain dehydrogenase reductases (11Somers S.W.

However, in contrast to UDP-galactose-4-epimerase and other enzymes of the SDR family, GFS catalyzes two distinct reactions, epimerizations at C-3 and C-5 of the mannose ring and the subsequent NADPH-dependent reduction at C-4 (1Sullivan F.X.

Furthermore, we present evidence that the epimerizations at C-3 and C-5 differ from that catalyzed by other members of the SDR family in that they do not involve the transient reduction and oxidation of an NAD or NADP cofactor and that the epimerization occurs in the absence of its cofactor NADPH. Our investigations also included various inhibition and fluorescence binding studies that indicated that GFS follows a random bi-bi mechanism. Our results show that the enzyme displays a much higher affinity for its cosubstrate NADPH, as compared with the product NADP, consistent with the catalytic mechanism in which NADPH binds to the enzyme transfers the hydride and is released as NADP. The E. coli GFS gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified from pSEWCAG (1Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.-Y. Rouse J. Chang X. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8193-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using the following two oligonucleotides: GGCGCATATGAGTAAACAACGAGTTTTTATTGC and GGCGAAGCTTACCCCCGAAAGCGGTCTTGAT. The amplified DNA was gel purified, digested with Nde I and Hin dIII, and ligated into the Nde I and Hin dIII sites of the E. coli expression vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) to yield pT7WCAG. This resulted in isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inducible expression of GFS having its native sequence, driven by a T7 promoter.E. coli strain BL21(DE3/pLysS), containing pT7WCAG, was grown in DM4 minimal salts with 0.5% glucose, trace metals, and supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin, and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol at 25 °C in a 10-liter Biostat C fermenter (B. Braun Biotech International) to an OD600 of 6.0 At that point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and the cells were grown for an additional 4 h before harvest by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Typically 5 g of cells were broken in a French Press at 12,000 p.s.i. The cells were spun in a SS34 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded onto a 20-ml DEAE Toyopearl column (Toso Hass). The enzyme was eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl followed by chromatography over a 10-ml heparin-Toyopearl column (Toso Hass) from which it was eluted with a stepwise gradient from 0 to 0.5m NaCl. The protein was then loaded onto a propyl aspartamide column and eluted with a reverse gradient of 1–0m ammonium sulfate. The resulting protein was greater than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Commasie Blue staining. Alternatively E. coli strain GI934 containing plasmid pSEWCAG was grown in LB media containing ampicillin at 37 oC. The cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside once they reached an OD of 0.5 at A600 and then grown for an additional 4 h. Cell pellets were then frozen and the protein was purified by the same procedure as above. The purified protein was assayed in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 150 μm NADPH, and 300 μm GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. A 96-well plate was incubated at 37 oC for 10 min and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.25 μg of GFS. Initial rates were determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADPH (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) to NADP. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was synthesized from GDP mannose using the purified E. coli GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase by a slight modification of a previously published procedure (1Sullivan F.X. Kumar R. Kriz R. Stahl M. Xu G.-Y. Rouse J. Chang X. Boodhoo A. Potvin B. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8193-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Typical reaction conditions were 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmDTT, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm GDP mannose, 10 μm NADPH, and 100 μm NADP at 37 oC for 3–6 h. GDP mannose dehydratase (0.1 mg/ml), which had been previously incubated with NADP at 37 oC, was added to initiate the reaction. The reactions were allowed to proceed to completion as judged by high performance liquid chromatography and the protein was removed by ultrafiltration using a Centricon 10. The remaining mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G-10 desalting column eluted with water and the peak for GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was determined by following the absorbance at 260 nm (ε260 = 11.8 mm−1cm−1). GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was then lyophilized and stored at −20 oC as a powder. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose prepared by this procedure is ∼100% pure as checked by NMR and mass spectroscopy. 4 S-[2H]NADPH was prepared by a previously published procedure for its synthesis from NADP, reduced glutathione, DTT, triethanolamine, and glutathione reductase in2H2O (25Orr G.A. Blanchard J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Benson T.E. Marquardt J.L. Marquardt A.C. Etzkorn F.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protiated NADPH was also prepared in a similar manner using H2O instead of D2O. 4 R-[2H]NADPH was also prepared by a previously published procedure using NADP, acetaldehyde-D4, DTT, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (25Orr G.A. Blanchard J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Benson T.E. Marquardt J.L. Marquardt A.C. Etzkorn F.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The protinated and deuterated NADPH/D generated by the method above were then purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column followed by elution using a 0–1 m KCl gradient in 20 mmtriethanolamine (25Orr G.A. Blanchard J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 200 μm 4 S- and or 4 R-[2H]NADPH was reacted with 400 μm GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The enzyme was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 oC. The reaction was allowed to go to completion determined by following the decrease in 340. After the reaction was over the mixture was lyophilized and exchanged with 1 ml of D2O twice. The mixture was finally resuspended in 0.7 ml of D2O and 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a 600 MHz Varian Unity Plus NMR spectrometer. 14C-Labeled GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was synthesized beginning with14C-labeled GDP mannose by the same procedure as stated above. The 14C-labeled GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was then incubated with GFS and NADPH, GFS and NADP, and GFS alone. The reaction products were then reduced with 0.2 m NaBH4 for 15 min to reduce the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose and then were cleaved from the sugar by incubating in 1 m trichloroacetic acid for 10 min in boiling water. The resulting mixture was chromatographed on Whatman 3MM paper in descending mode using a solvent system consisting of ethyl acetate:pyridine:water (3.6:1.0:1.15) for 7 h. Free sugar standards were localized by AgNO3 staining in acetone followed by NaOH in methanol. Radioactivity was detected by cutting the paper into strips of 1 cm × 1 cm and counting on a scintillation counter. Assays were carried out as described above at varying concentrations of NADPH and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. Since the order of substrate binding was not known, initial velocities were measured at various concentrations of NADPH (10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 μm) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 μm) at varying concentrations of NADP (5 to 100 μm) and GDP fucose (20 to 140 μm) at unsaturating concentrations of either NADPH or GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. The data were fit to double reciprocal plots of 1/NADPH and 1/GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose versus 1/intial velocity (Vo). We also explored the effect of GDP at varying concentrations of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose on the reaction and the data were analyzed by the same procedure as above. Purified proteins were assayed in 100 mm MES, pH 5.0–6.0, and 25 mmHEPES, pH 6.5–8.0, buffer that contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 150 μmNADPH. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was varied from 20 to 300 μm. A 96-well plate was incubated at 37 oC for 10 min and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.25 μg of GFS. Initial rates were determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADPH (ε340= 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) to NADP. The deuterium isotope effect was determined using the spectrophotometric assay as described above. To minimize errors arising from slight variations in enzyme activity or assay conditions data were collected at varying 4 S-[1H]NADPH and 4 S-[2H]NADPH on the same day. All fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25 oC at pH 7.0 on a Photon Technology International Fluorimeter with 0.55 and 5.5 μm GFS. Binding of NADPH and NADP to GFS was followed by monitoring the quenching of enzyme fluorescence intensity induced by their binding to the apoenzyme. The apoenzyme was prepared by a previously published procedure (27He X. Thorson S.J. Liu H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) followed by dialyzing the purified protein against 2 liters of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and the buffer was changed periodically over a period of 2 days. The excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm and the quenching of the fluorescence emission of the protein at 339 nm was followed. The excitation and emission slits were 3 and 9 nm. The same procedure as above, quenching of fluorescence of apoenzyme, was used to determine the affinity of GFS for GDP fucose and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. The quenching of GFS fluorescence was analyzed using a previously published nonlinear least squares procedure (27He X. Thorson S.J. Liu H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that fit the average number of moles (ν) of bound substrate per mole of protein and the free ligand [L]f to the Adair-Klotz equation. ν was calculated by the same procedure using the relationship ν = n (I −Ia)/(Ih −Ia), where n = number of binding sites, Ia = fluorescence of apoenzyme, I = measured fluorescence intensity at a particular concentration of substrate, Ih = fluorescence of holoenzyme with its n of binding sites saturated with substrate. [L]f was determined by using the relation [L]f = [L]t − n[Et], where Lt and Et represent total ligand and total enzyme concentration, respectively. 90% loss in fluorescence intensity was observed when enzyme was completely saturated with NADP and NADPH. Only 5% of the original fluorescence intensity of apoenzyme remained on complete satuaration, of GFS, with GDP fucose, GDP and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. Enthalpy of the binding of GDP fucose was obtained by microcalorimetry performed on a Microcal Isothermal Titration Calorimeter. The cell was calibrated to 28 oC using an internal cell heater. The cell was equilibrated in 10 mm Trizma (Tris base) buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl buffer at 28 oC with stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min. Subsequently 1.4 ml of 70 μm GFS (ε280 = 31,300 m−1cm−1) which was dialyzed overnight in 10 mmTrizma buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl solution was transferred into the calorimeter cell using a syringe. A 50-μl glass syringe containing 20 mm GDP fucose in the same buffer and an extended attachment to perform injections was attached to the calorimeter. The baseline signal was collected for at least 15 min before initiating the reaction by subsequent injections of GDP fucose. Integration of the thermogram was performed by the ITC program for Origin supplied by Microcal. The 1H NMR spectrum of NADP generated at the end of the reaction was analyzed for the retention of deuterium at the 4 position of the pyridine ring (Fig.2) (28Arnold J.L. You K. Allison W.S. Kaplan O, N. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A ProS specific enzyme removes deuterium from 4 S-[2H]NADPH and the NADP formed as an end product of the reaction shows a doublet at 8.8 ppm for the proton at the 4 position of the pyridine ring. Analogously when 4 R-[2H]NADPH is used no doublet should be observed since it is the ProS proton that is transferred and the deuteron remains attached to the C-4 position of the pyridine ring. When NADPH deuterated at the 4 S position was reacted with GFS the proton left over at the C-4 position exhibited a H1 splitting at about 8.8 ppm. When the experiment was repeated with NADPH deuterated at the 4 R position no H1 splitting at position C-4 was observed, indicating deuterium was still attached at that position. This confirms that like all other enzymes belonging to the SDR class the hydride transfer catalyzed by GFS is stereospecific and occurs at the 4 S position of NADPH. To characterize the products of the epimerization and reduction reaction and to investigate the requirement for NADP in the epimerization reaction catalyzed by GFS we incubated the enzyme with14C-labeled GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose under different conditions and the products of the reaction were identified by descending paper chromatography. Our data indicate that incubation of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose with GFS alone or with GFS plus NADP converts GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose. The expected monosaccharides resulting from reduction of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose by borohydride and cleavage from the nucleotide by acid, 6-deoxyglucose, and fucose, comigrate with their unlabeled standards (Fig. 3). This confirms that GFS alone is sufficient to convert GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose to the epimerized product GDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose and that NADP is not required for the epimerization reaction. We confirmed that the product produced on incubation of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose and NADPH with GFS was GDP fucose by co-chromatography with authentic GDP fucose (Fig. 3). Incubation of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose alone under the same conditions as above followed by reduction and cleavage yielded rhamnose and 6-deoxytalose. 6-Deoxytalose is not observed as it runs off the chromatograph in this solvent system (data not shown). Values for Vmax, Km, and kcat/Km for NADPH and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose were determined by initial velocity studies which monitored the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH at varying concentrations of NADPH and GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose (Table I). Based on initial velocity studies GFS displayed a much more lower affinity for NADH (Km = 108.8 μm and Vmax = 6.6 μmol min−1mg−1) as compared with NADPH. Product inhibition studies were carried out in order to elucidate the suspected order of substrate binding of GDP fucose synthetase. GDP fucose was a competitive inhibitor with respect to NADPH and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose since the double-reciprocal plots of 1/V versus 1/S at unsaturating concentrations of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy mannose and NADPH intersect on the 1/V axis (Fig.4, A and B). NADP, the other product of the reaction, was also a competitive inhibitor when varied at different concentrations of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose and NADPH (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus the steady state kinetic results are consistent with a random bi-bi mechanism in which either the cofactor or substrate can bind to the enzyme in the absence of the other. GDP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose with a Ki of 60.5 ± 6.8 μm.Table ISteady sate parameters of E. coli GDP-fucose synthetaseSubstrateVmaxkcat/KmKmKdμmol min−1mg−1mm−1min−1μmGDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose363.5 ± 21.28.1 ± 0.529 ± 1.42.9 ± 0.1NADPH363.5 ± 21.226.3 ± 1.59 ± 0.81.3 ± 0.1NADH6.6 ± 1.20.3 ± 0.04108.8 ± 9NADPKi = 69.3 ± 5.974.2 ± 6.9GDP fucoseKi = 55.3 ± 3.947 ± 2.8 Open table in a new tab A number of buffers were screened to find a system where the rate of the reaction would be independent of buffer concentration. We found that MES over pH values 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 and HEPES over pH values 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 were suitable for assays over the pH range 5.0–8.0. The effect of pH on log Vmax/Km indicates that there exists at least one catalytic group on the enzyme with a p Ka between 6 and 6.5 (Fig.5). An isotope effect of 1.4 ± 0.2 was observed on DV arising from deuterium substitution at the pro-S hydrogen at C-4 of NADPH. This effect is to small to be significant, hence hydride transfer may only be partially rate-limiting in the mechanism. When excited at 280 nm the emission spectrum of GFS has two maxima, a primary maxima at 339 nm which is about twice as intense as the secondary maxima at 450 nm. The dissociation constants were determined by monitoring the increase and decrease in signal intensity at 450 nm and 338 nm induced by the binding of NADPH and NADP to the apoenzyme. The Kd for NADPH was determined to be 1.29 ± 0.07 μm assuming a ratio of 1 between concentration of binding sites and protein concentration. The dissociation constant for NADP was determined by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence intensity at 339 nm. The enzyme displayed a much weaker affinity for its product NADP as compared with NADPH and had a Kd of 74.2 ± 6.9 μm with the data best fitting the Adair-Klotz equation assuming n = 1 per monomer. This agrees with the crystal structure studies, which also indicates a 1:1, stoichiometry between NADPH/NADP and binding site per subunit (11Somers S.W. Stahl L.M. Sullivan F.X.

The affinity of apoenzyme for GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was determined by monitoring the quenching of enzyme fluorescence upon substrate binding at 338 nm. The Kd was determined to be 2.9 ± 0.10 μm with n = 1 per monomer. Thus like NADP and NADPH the enzyme has two substrate-binding sites per functional dimer. We also determined the affinity of GFS for its product GDP fucose by fluorescence spectroscopy and calorimetry. The dissociation constant obtained from fluorimetry was 47 ± 2.8 μmand was comparable to that obtained from calorimetry which was 51 ± 3.2 μm (Fig. 6).

To investigate the route of electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme, we generated mutants at Lys423 in the heme proximal site of neuronal NOS and examined the catalytic activities, electron transfer rates, and NADPH oxidation rates. A K423E mutant showed no NO formation activity (<0.1 nmol/min/nmol heme), in contrast with that (72 nmol/min/nmol heme) of the wild type enzyme.

From the crystal structure of the oxygenase domain of endothelial NOS, Lys423 of neuronal NOS is likely to interact with Trp409 which lies in contact with the heme plane and with Cys415, the axial ligand. It is also exposed to solvent and lies in the region where the heme is closest to the protein surface.

NOS consists of an oxygenase domain with a thiol-coordinated heme active site similar to that of cytochrome P450 (P450), and an electron-transfer domain related to NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase which binds FMN and FAD. For NOS to catalyze efficient monooxygenation reactions, the presence of effectors such as calmodulin (CaM) and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) as well as the formation of the homodimer are prerequisite. It is conceivable that CaM plays an important role in arranging the protein structure for efficient electron transfer to occur from the reductase domain to the heme domain (8Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H4B is bound to a site distant from thel-Arg-binding site located on the heme distal side within the oxygenase domain, based on the x-ray crystal structure of the dimeric oxygenase domain of inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) (9Crane B.R.

Another structurally important factor, consisting of a cysteine-bound zinc center, was indicated by two groups (10Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 11Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A recent report suggested an emerging role for H4B, suggesting that it may deliver a second electron to the intermediate Fe(II)-O2-l-Arg ternary complex for the activation of molecular oxygen during P450-type monooxygenation at the heme active site (12Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Another role for H4B recently proposed suggests that a non-heme iron-pterin complex is involved in the activation of molecular oxygen during the monooxygenation ofl-Arg, functioning in a similar way to aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (13Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of eNOS also suggests that a pterin radical is directly involved in the catalysis (10Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Thus, the first step of NO synthesis, monooxygenation of l-Arg to N G-hydroxy-l-Arg (NHA), is a matter of debate in regard to the role of H4B. The mechanism of the second monooxygenation from the intermediate compound, NHA, to NO and l-citrulline has also been controversial, although it seems likely that the heme iron is directly involved in this process (15Korth H.-G. Sustman R. Thater C. Butler A.R. Ingold K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17776-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pufahl R.A. Wishnok J.S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whichever mechanism is followed, introduction of electrons into the oxygenase domain is necessary for the activation of molecular oxygen during catalysis (20Johnson E.F. Waterman M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 1-430Google Scholar, 21Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450, Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry, 2nd Ed.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If H4B is involved in the introduction of the second electron to the heme active site (12Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the electron must initially reach H4B via the heme distal side from NADPH per se or directly via the reductase domain. Likewise, electron transfer via the heme distal side would be possible if the non-heme iron-pterin complex is involved in the activation of molecular oxygen for the monooxygenation of l-Arg (13Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or if a pterin radical is involved in the process (10Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). However, it seems likely that electrons pass directly to the heme iron for the second step, monooxygenation of NHA, since the heme iron seems certain to be the site for this process. Interestingly, a recent report proposed that intermolecular electron transfer from the adjacent reductase domain to the oxygenase domain occurs in the homodimer of iNOS (24Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Previous work in this laboratory suggested that basic amino acids such as Lys and Arg on the proximal surface of microsomal P450s are important for the interaction between the reductase and P450 for efficient electron transfer to occur (25Shimizu T. Tateishi T. Hatano M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3372-3375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mayuzumi H. Sambongi C. Hiroya K. Shimizu T. Tateishi T. Hatano M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5622-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar interactions are required for electron transfer to occur in the homodimer of NOS, particularly in view of the structural rearrangement which probably occurs at the reductase domain-heme domain interface on CaM binding. In the present study, we mutated a moderately conserved basic amino acid, Lys423 of neuronal NOS (nNOS), to several neutral and acidic amino acids and studied the mutation effect on the catalytic activity and electron transfer rate from NADPH to the heme. Note that the 423 position is conserved as Lys for both nNOS and eNOS, while it is Asn for iNOS (Fig. 1). A K423E mutant had no NO formation activity with either l-Arg or NHA as substrate. This mutant also showed a very low electron transfer rate from the reductase domain to the heme iron under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Also, the heme of the K423E mutant proved difficult to reduce by sodium dithionite. Thus, we suggest that Lys423 is involved in catalysis, perhaps in regulating the rate of electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme active site of nNOS. H4B was purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Other reagents, which were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), were of the highest guaranteed grade and were used without further purification. Rat nNOS cDNA was kindly gifted by Dr. S. H. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). nNOS was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the acid phosphatase promoter previously used for the expression of cytochrome P450 1A2 (25Shimizu T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8570-8574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers for the mutations of Lys423 to Glu, Met, Leu, and Asn were 5′-CCAGTGGTCCGAGCTGCAGG-3′, 5′-CAGTGGTCCATGCTGCAGGT-3′, 5′-CAGTGGTCCCTGCTGCAGGT-3′, and 5′-AGTGGTCCAATCTGCAGGTG-3′, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction-based mutageneses were performed using oligonucleotide-directed dual amber long and accurate PCR kits (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). Purification of wild-type and mutant nNOS enzymes were carried out using 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatographies as described previously (28Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For all enzymes, purified nNOS was more than 95% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and by Western blot analysis. The purified and concentrated enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 4 μm H4B, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The concentration of nNOS was determined optically from the [CO-reduced] − [reduced] difference spectrum using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1 cm−1. This Δε value was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen method (28Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) assuming that one heme is bound to one subunit of this enzyme. The rate of NO formation was determined from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, monitored at 401 nm using a methemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin extinction coefficient of 49 mm−1 cm−1 (1Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester1996Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.1 mm NADPH, 5 μm each of FAD and FMN, 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm H4B, 5 μm DTT, and 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS in the presence or absence of 0.5 mml-Arg or NHA. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient = 21 mm−1 cm−1. Potassium ferricyanide reductase activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 420 nm using an extinction coefficient = 1.2 mm−1 cm−1. The reductase activities of the Lys423 mutants were essentially the same as those of the wild type. The H2O2 generation rate was measured by the formation of ferric thiocyanate under similar conditions as described for the NO formation activity and NADPH oxidase activity, but without catalase and superoxide dismutase present. Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C by a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer maintained at 14 °C in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with an O2 concentration of less than 10 ppm. To ensure that the temperature of the solution was appropriate, the cell was incubated for 10 min prior to spectroscopic measurements. Titration experiments were repeated at least three times for each complex. Regression analyses were performed and lines giving an optimum correlation coefficient were selected. Linear least-squares fitting was carried out on a Power Macintosh 6100/60AV personal computer using DeltaGraphTM software as described previously (23Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Shimizu T. Tateishi T. Hatano M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol.

Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) were obtained through the WWW from the Protein Data Bank. RasMac 2.6-ucb1.0 software was used to determine the distance between Lys194 and Trp180 in eNOS. We generated K423E, K423M, K423L, and K423N mutants. The Soret spectral band of the resting Fe(III) form of the all mutants appeared to consist of a mixture of the high spin and low spin complexes as observed for the wild type enzyme (A and B in Fig. 2). The Soret bands of the mutants were moved to 395 nm and became narrower on addition ofl-Arg, similar to the wild type enzyme, suggesting that thel-Arg-binding site was not altered by the mutation of the proximal site of nNOS and that the spin state change still occurred as normal. The lower part of Fig. 2 shows difference absorption spectra of the Fe(II)-CO complexes of the wild type and K423E mutant purified from the supernatant of the yeast crushed homogenized solution. No absorption band around 420 nm ascribed the denatured complex, P420, was observed for the K423E mutant as with the wild type enzyme (28Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The K423M, K423L, and K423N mutants also generated in the present study all had similar spectra. Table I summarizes various kinetic parameters associated with the catalysis of this enzyme, whenl-Arg is used as a substrate. The NO formation rate of K423E was less than 0.1 nmol/min/nmol heme, in contrast with that of the wild type enzyme (72 nmol/min/nmol heme). The K423M and K423L mutants had relatively low NO formation activities, 18 and 25 nmol/min/nmol heme, respectively. In contrast, K423N had a similar catalytic activity (78 nmol/min/nmol heme) to the wild type enzyme. We also examined the NO formation rate of the Lys423 mutants using NHA, the reaction intermediate, as the substrate (TableII). When NHA was used, the NO formation activity of the K423E mutant was 3 nmol/min/nmol of heme, whereas those of the other mutants were between 52 and 78 nmol/min/nmol of heme, which is comparable to that of the wild type enzyme (72 nmol/min/nmol of heme). These relatively high activities could be caused by the shunt reaction with H2O2, a by-product of O2 reduction on catalytic uncoupling (14Groves J.T. Han Y.-Z. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

However, this is unlikely in the presence of catalase, therefore, it may indicate that the second step of the reaction (monooxygenation of NHA) is less dependent on the supply of electrons to the heme iron than the first step (monooxygenation of l-Arg). This is consistent with the fact that monooxygenation of NHA requires only 1 electron equivalent per NO generated, whereas NO generation froml-Arg requires 3 electron equivalents.Table IKinetic parameters (nmol/min/nmol heme) of the Lys423 mutants of nNOS in the presence of l-ArgEnzymesNO formation1-aSolutions consisting of 0.5 mml-Arg, 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm H4B, and 5 μm DTT.Heme reduction1-aSolutions consisting of 0.5 mml-Arg, 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm H4B, and 5 μm DTT. with NADPHNADPH1-aSolutions consisting of 0.5 mml-Arg, 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm H4B, and 5 μm DTT. oxidationH2O21-bSolutions consisting of 0.5 mml-Arg, 0.05–0.1 μm nNOS, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 5 μmH4B, and 5 μm DTT.formationWild type72>101637.8K423E<0.10.014315.2K423M180.056412.0K423L250.121096.3K423N780.101794.4Experiments were repeated at least three times, the averaged values are shown.

Experiments were repeated at least three times, the averaged values are shown. Experimental errors were less than 20%. Since the low activity of the K423E mutant appeared to be associated with the heme reduction rate and/or the electron transfer rate from NADPH via FAD and FMN in the reductase domain to the heme iron, the rate of the heme reduction on addition of excess NADPH was examined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Fig.3 shows the Soret absorption spectral changes of the wild type and K423E mutant in the presence of CO on addition of NADPH under anaerobic conditions. The 0.5 μmwild type nNOS quickly (in less than 0.5 min) showed a peak at around 445 nm on addition of 0.1 mm NADPH, while the K423E mutant showed only a small peak at around 445 nm even after 40 min incubation under the same conditions. A similar trend was seen under aerobic conditions. Table I summarizes the rate of heme reduction in the presence of NADPH for the other Lys423 mutants. All the mutants generated in this study showed significantly slower rates of heme reduction than the wild type enzyme. It was also interesting to note that the intensity of the wild-type Fe(II)-CO complex caused by adding excess NADPH under anaerobic conditions reached up to about 50% of that caused by adding sodium dithionite. This intensity with excess NADPH never increased to the same intensity as with sodium dithionite even in the presence ofl-Arg and H4B. The Lys423 mutants behaved similarily. This phenomenon may be caused by the slow disproportionation of electrons required for full reduction by NADPH, and/or the fact that the reduction potential of NADPH is not as negative as dithionite so that it is a less effective reducing agent even after equilibration. Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of NHA, the Soret intensity of the wild type Fe(II)-CO with NADPH was 60–70% of that with sodium dithionite for the wild type (not shown). For the Lys423 mutants, no essential difference betweenl-Arg and NHA solutions was observed. The heme reduction rate with NADPH in the presence of NHA was merely 10–20% higher than in the presence of l-Arg for the wild type. Similar increase of the reduction rate was observed for the Lys423mutants. In order to understand the coupling of electron transfer to NO formation, we obtained the NADPH oxidation rate during catalysis (TableI). The rates of NADPH oxidation of the wild type and the mutants compare well with the corresponding NO formation rates. Namely, both the wild type and the K423L and K423N mutants, which have large NO formation activities, showed relatively high NADPH oxidation rates, whereas both the K423E and K423M mutants, which have low NO formation activities, also had relatively low NADPH oxidation rates. In the presence of NHA, the NADPH oxidation rates of the K423M, K423L, and K423N mutants were comparable to that of the wild type enzyme, whereas that of the K423E mutant was lower (Table II). The electrons from NADPH may be used to generate H2O2 to a certain extent, which may then be used for propagating NHA monooxygenation via the shunt reaction. It should be also noted as a possibility that a significant amount of reducing equivalents leaked to form superoxide anion radicals. During P450-type catalysis, H2O2 is formed when O-O bond cleavage is not coupled well to electron transfer (20Johnson E.F. Waterman M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 1-430Google Scholar, 21Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450, Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry, 2nd Ed.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H2O2 formation rates of the K423E and K423M mutants, which exhibit low catalytic activities with l-Arg, were higher than those of the wild type enzyme and the K423N and K423L mutants (Table I). The reciprocal relationships between catalytic activity and H2O2 formation rates for the wild type and Lys423 mutants were also observed in the P450 system. It is difficult to obtain the redox potential of the heme iron of the holoenzyme since FAD and FMN absorption bands overlap with the heme absorption band (30Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, we estimated the relative reduction ability of the heme iron of the mutant enzymes on addition of sodium dithionite. Fig. 4 shows how the heme of the wild type and the K423E mutant were reduced by addition of the same amount of sodium dithionite under anaerobic conditions. The 0.3 μm wild type heme was almost completely reduced in 3 min in the presence of CO by adding 40 μm sodium dithionite, while only 15% of the K423E mutant heme was reduced even after 20 min following the same procedure. Thus, it appears that the heme of the K423E is difficult to reduce by both sodium dithionite and NADPH. If ionic interactions are important in the formation of protein-protein complexes, determining protein conformation and catalytic activity, changes in salt concentration should influence the enzyme's kinetic parameters (31Nishimura J.S.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of KCl on the NO formation activities of the wild type enzyme and Lys423 mutants. The NO formation activity of the wild type enzyme increased by 1.8-fold when the KCl concentration was increased up to 200 mm. However, the activity of K423N did not essentially change even on adding up to 500 mm KCl. The activities of K423M and K423L decreased by half on addition of 500 mm KCl. In order to understand how mutations influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium, we examined low-temperature SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration column chromatography. Essentially no change in the equilibrium was found when the mutant enzymes were compared with the wild type (not shown). The absorption spectrum of the Fe(II)-CO complex of P450 or P450-type heme proteins reflects the integrity of the heme active site structure in that the presence of a 420-nm peak indicates enzyme denaturation. Since all the Lys423 mutants we generated had normal Fe(II)-CO spectra, with no band around 420 nm, the Lys423 residue is unlikely to be directly involved in the binding of heme to the active site. If Lys423 were to directly contact the heme plane and/or the heme propionate, heme binding to the apoprotein would be expected to be destabilized if these interactions were disrupted by the mutations. As can be seen in the amino acid sequence comparison (Fig. 1), Lys423 is not well conserved throughout the NOS isoforms. Lys423 of nNOS corresponds with Asn202 of iNOS. The K423N mutant of nNOS we generated in this study had similar catalytic activity to the wild type enzyme and its other kinetic parameters were comparable. Thus, there appears to be no significance in the lack of conservation of this residue in nNOS and iNOS. The crystal structure of the oxygenase domain of bovine eNOS indicates that the amino nitrogen of the axial ligand, Cys186(Cys184 of human eNOS, Ref. 11Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. Niu X.D. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Reichert P. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), interacts with several proximal site amino acids, including Gly188, Arg189, and Trp180 via ionic or hydrogen bonds (10Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The proximal structure of nNOS is likely to be similar to that of eNOS, in which case the axial ligand, Cys415, will interact with Trp409 of nNOS. The crystal structure of eNOS also indicates that Lys194, which corresponds with Lys423 of nNOS, probably interacts with Trp180, which corresponds with Trp409 of nNOS, via a hydrogen bond over about 2.4 Å distance (with RasMac 2.6-ucb1.0 software) (Fig.6). In the present study, the replacement of Lys423 with acidic or neutral residues (Glu, Met, or Leu) resulted in a clear decrease in the NO formation activity observed. Therefore, these results suggest that ionic interactions or hydrogen bonding between Lys423 and Trp409 in the oxygenase domain or adjacent residues in the reductase domain are tightly associated with NO formation and electron transfer from the reductase domain. Thus, the disruption of these ionic interactions by mutation of Lys423 markedly reduced the NO formation activity and the rate of electron transfer from NADPH to the heme iron. The K423N mutant retained NO formation activity, confirming its compatibility with this position indicated by the sequence of iNOS. Presumably, Asn is able to form similar contacts to Lys, recreating a viable electron transfer route from the reductase domain to the heme. In the crystal structure of the eNOS oxygenase domain, the heme is clearly displaced to one side of the protein. The region in which the heme lies closest to the solvent exposed surface of the domain includes the Lys194 residue (Lys423 in nNOS), which crystallizes in direct contact with several water molecules. In fact, the heme is only 6 Å from this residue and only 5 Å from the solvent exposed surface. In view of this, it seems likely that Lys423 may form direct contact with the reductase domain, acting as the start of an electron transfer pathway also including the aromatic residue Trp409 which would bridge the gap between the heme and Lys423. As a matter of fact, the molecular surface near the FMN-binding site of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase has several acidic residues which are conserved in nNOS (Fig.7) (32Sevrioukova I.F. Li H.

It is conceivable that these acidic amino acids of the reductase domain interact with basic amino acids of the oxygenase domain for effective electron transfer (Fig.7).Figure 7Hypothetical surfaces of interaction of NOS oxygenase domain (left) and FMN-binding domain (right). The oxygenase domain is based on the structure odimeric eNOS (10Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L.

The FMN is in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ionic interactions in the heme vicinity may also be important to control the redox potential of the heme iron maintaining an appropriate driving force for electrons to transfer to the heme iron (34Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It was difficult, however, to obtain redox potentials for the mutant enzymes because the absorption bands of FAD and FMN hamper the monitoring of the heme absorption accompanying the redox change. However, the reduction rate of the K423E ferric heme by sodium dithionite appeared to be lower than that of the wild type enzyme under the same conditions. Thus, it is possible that the lowered NO formation activity and electron transfer rate of the K423E mutant is also associated with a change in the redox potential of the heme iron. However, dithionite may reduce the heme directly via an alternative pathway. As such, the slow reduction of the heme in the K423E mutant could be simply a consequence of charge repulsion between dithionite ion and the glutamic acid side chain. Increasing the KCl concentration increases the rate of cytochrome c reduction by NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (35Shen A. Christensen M.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19976-19980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, P450 monooxygenase activity increases with increasing KCl concentration when the P450:NADPH-P450 reductase molar ratio is 10 (36Voznesensky A.I. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14669-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not uncommon for protein-protein interactions to be stabilized at high concentrations of KCl and intermolecular electron transfer rates increased. The NO formation rate of the wild type enzyme increased with the KCl concentration (Fig. 5), similar to the results obtained elsewhere (31Nishimura J.S. Narayanasami R. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Panda S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5399-5406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following the Lys423 mutations, this tendency was markedly changed. The salt (KCl) effect probably implies a possible direct solvent exposure of this area including Lys423. Therefore, it seems clear that the ionic interaction of Lys423 with other amino acids is important in catalyzing NO formation and in facilitating electron transfer from NADPH to the heme. Such a change in ionic strength dependence is characteristic of intermolecular electron transfer, but in the case of NOS this would involve interdomain or intersubunit electron transfer. However, if the domains involved retain a degree of relative conformational mobility, the same principles would apply. Intermolecular electron transfer across the interfacial surface between the oxygenase and adjacent reductase of the microsomal P450 system was found to involve the conserved Lys/Arg residues of the proximal surface which interact with Asp/Glu residues of the NADPH-P450 reductase surface (25Shimizu T. Tateishi T. Hatano M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3372-3375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A similar interaction appears to be involved in the case of nNOS. The optical absorption intensity of the Fe(II)-CO complex caused by NADPH reduction (Fig. 3) was only about 50% of that induced by sodium dithionite in the presence of l-Arg. Similar observations are reported for wild-type iNOS (24Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and a C331A mutant of nNOS (37Martasek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman L.J. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S. Gross S.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34799-34805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The intensity never reached the same level with sodium dithionite even in the presence of a large excess of NADPH under strict anaerobic conditions. It is conceivable that catalytically generated NO quickly binds to the reduced heme and hampers further binding of CO to the heme. However, this is unlikely under anaerobic conditions because NO formation would be negligible. It is also possible that electron transfer between reductase domains is necessary to aid full reduction, which would be a slow process. NADPH is only able to supply electrons in pairs, limiting the equilibration process severely. When reduced, the electrons will be shared according to the redox potentials of the various NOS cofactors, the equilibrium may be unattainable without rapid inter-subunit electron transfer or introduction of an electron transfer mediator. Dithionite possesses both a lower reduction potential and the ability to donate single electrons. Both factors may cause it to be more effective at reducing the NOS heme than NADPH. In summary, it was found that Lys423 is very much involved in the catalytic generation of NO and in electron transfer from NADPH to the heme iron. Based on the NADPH oxidation rate and the heme reduction rate of the Lys423 mutants, it appears that Lys423 forms a key contact in the electron transfer route from the FMN of the reductase domain to the heme of the oxygenase domain via the proximal site."

Polyclonal antibodies raised against X. laevis pcMTase were immunoreactive with a 33-kDa protein in whole cell lysate. These antibodies were also reactive with a 33-kDa product from in vitro translation of the pcMTase cDNA. Aldosterone application increased pcMTase activity resulting in elevation of total protein methyl esterification in vivo, but pcMTase protein levels were not affected by steroid, suggesting that aldosterone increased activity independent of enzyme number. Inhibition of pcMTase resulted in a reduction of aldosterone-induced Na+transport demonstrating the necessity of pcMTase-mediated transmethylation for steroid induced Na+ reabsorption. Transfection with an eukaryotic expression construct containing pcMTase cDNA increased pcMTase protein level and activity. This resulted in potentiation of the natriferic actions of aldosterone. However, overexpression did not change Na+ reabsorption in the absence of steroid, suggesting that pcMTase activity is not limiting Na+ transport in the absence of steroid, but that subsequent to aldosterone addition, pcMTase activity becomes limiting. These results suggest that a critical transmethylation is necessary for aldosterone-induction of Na+ transport.

Methylation is analogous to phosphorylation with both being molecular switches that control protein activity/locale in a reversible manner. Protein methylation is mediated by a class of enzymes, the protein methyltransferases that use AdoMet as a methyl donor to transfer a methyl moiety onto a nucleophilic oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur in a polypeptide. Protein methyltransferases are classified in two major groups, those that modify carboxyl groups to form methyl esters and those that modify sulfur and nitrogen. Methylation catalyzed by the prior enzymes is reversible and can regulate protein activity. In contrast, methylation of sulfur and nitrogen is irreversible and produces alternative forms of physiological amino acids. Four types of protein carboxyl methyltransferases are known: 1) type I modifies glutamate residues contained in bacterial chemoreceptors; 2) type II modifies aspartyl residues targeting proteins for repair or degradation; 3) type III modifies the carboxyl group of COOH-terminal isoprenylcysteines (pcMTase; EC 2.1.1.100); and 4) type IV modifies the carboxyl group of COOH-terminal leucines (for review, see Ref. 12Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The most well described transmethylation involved in eukaryotic cell signal transduction is reversible methyl esterification of proteins on the carboxyl groups of COOH-terminal isoprenylcysteines. Small, monomeric G proteins, such as p21Ras, nuclear lamin B, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and subunits of trimeric G proteins all contain COOH-terminal cysteine isoprenoids. These proteins are post-translationally modified by transmethylation (12Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Methylation of these signaling molecules controls their activity and cellular localization. In particular, Ras localizes to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane after methyl esterification. In some instances, this may be the rate-limiting step controlling Ras activity (14Dudler T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12434-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that this reversible methylation is involved in regulation of function and important for cellular signal transduction. The gene encoding isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase initially identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recently cloned in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the past 2 years, vertebrate homologs have been identified: first in Xenopus laevis (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and then in humans (16Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Presently, cellular characterization of pcMTase protein in vertebrates is limited to a single study where antibody was used to characterize the cellular localization of human pcMTase (16Dai Q.

Although there is substantial evidence that transmethylation regulates Na+ transport, the specific type of methyltransferase catalyzing this post-translational event in response to aldosterone remains unclear. Moreover, the direct effects of aldosterone on methyltransferase protein expression and the role this plays in aldosterone induction of Na+ transport remain unclear. Regulation of the natriferic action of aldosterone by pcMTase was tested in this study. In addition, the effects of aldosterone on pcMTase protein level and activity were determined. The cellular properties of pcMTase protein also were further characterized. Isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase activity was found to be critical for aldosterone-induced Na+ transport. Moreover, the activity of this enzyme can become limiting in the presence of steroid. Aldosterone increased pcMTase enzyme activity without affecting enzyme number. Overexpression of pcMTase potentiated aldosterone-induced Na+ transport, but failed to mimic all steroid actions suggesting that pcMTase is not itself an aldosterone-induced protein but ultimately is regulated by an aldosterone-induced protein. A6 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were used for all experiments. This cell line is a well characterized model of the mammalian renal, principal cell that is capable of aldosterone-sensitive vectorial Na+ transport. Cells were maintained in culture as described previously (7Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. J. Biol.

Complete media included aldosterone (1.5 μm) and fetal bovine serum (10%), whereas basic media lacked steroid and serum. This study focused on the early actions of aldosterone. Thus, all experiments were performed 4 h after addition of aldosterone or vehicle unless indicated otherwise. A full-length X. laevis pcMTase clone was amplified using a high stringency reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with specific primers (forward primer, 5′-gccttctccaagatggccg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cattggcttctactgctcccacc-3′) developed from the published X. laevis pcMTase cDNA sequence (accession number D87750) (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (in conjunction with cDNA created from A6 cell Poly(A)+mRNA (Marathon cDNA amplification kit;CLONTECH) that was harvested using the FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). The 981-base pair product of amplificaiton was consistent with full-length pcMTase and was subsequently ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) (Invitrogen) with Not I. Nucleotide sequence data from the expression plasmid (pxMT.zeo) was identical to that reported by Imai et al. (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of pcMTase from pxMT.zeo is controlled by the cytomegalo virus promotor. In vitro translation of pxMT.zeo produced a protein of appropriate size (∼33 kDa) indicating a complete open reading frame. A6 cells were transfected with pxMT.zeo using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (7Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3842-3850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Zeocin (600 μg/ml) treatment was used to select for successfully transfected cells. Subpassages (up to 4) of the zeocin-selected (mass population) A6 cells were used for experimentation. Control transfectancts contained either vector alone or pVgRXR (Invitrogen). Neither control plasmid was observed to affect Na+ transport or enzyme activity. Peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acid residues (NH2-CYKKKVPTGLPFIKGVKMEP-COOH; AB601), and 191–209 (NH2-CHIVQNEKSDSHTLVTSGV-COOH; AB596) of X. laevis pcMTase were synthesized with an amino-terminal cysteine, linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits (Lofstrand Labs Ltd.) to create polyclonal anti-pcMTase antibodies. In X. laevis, the only polypeptide with identity to these antigens as described by a blastp (National Center for Biotechnology Information) search was pcMTase. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed on whole cell lysates harvested with detergent (1% Nonidet P-40) using standard protocols. Lysates and immunoprecipitations were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of reducing reagent and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed in Tris-buffered saline with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Reactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Band density was then quantified using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific). Reactive proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-pcMTase antibody subsequent to a brief pre-boiling (80 °C, 2 min) to expose antigenic sequences. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with A/G-Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and centrifugation. Reactive proteins were released by boiling in the presence of reducing reagent and detergent. Substrate methylation in vivo and in vitro was quantified using a protocol previously described (7Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3842-3850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.

In brief, protein methylation was quantified using alkaline hydrolysis of methyl esters in a vapor phase assay. For assessing in vitro isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methylation, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC) was used as an artificial substrate, [3H]AdoMet as the methyl donor, and A6 cell lysate harvested by Dounce homogenization (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) as the source of methyltransferase. For in vivo protein methylation, cells were treated withl-[methyl-3H]methionine 18 h before experimentation. After washing and addition of vehicle or aldosterone for 4 h, A6 cells were harvested, and base labile, radiolabeled methyl esters released and counted. Short circuit current and equivalent short circuit current were assessed using standard procedures (7Stockand J.D. Al-Baldawi N.F. Al-Khalili O.K. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3842-3850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Rokaw M.D. Benos D.J. Palevsky P.M. Cunningham S.A. West M.E. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4491-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For all measurements of short circuit current, A6 cells were grown to confluence on permeable, 25-mm tissue culture inserts (Anopore membrane; Nalge NUNC International). All reagents were purchased from Sigma, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, or Calbiochem unless indicated otherwise. For every cell lysate, the protein concentration was established using the Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significances (p ≤ 0.05) were determined using Student's t test for paired and unpaired data as appropriate. Based on the published sequence (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), pcMTase should be a protein of approximately 33 kDa. Fig.1 shows the specific reaction of anti-pcMTase antibody (AB601) with a protein in whole cell lysate of approximately 33 kDa. In a typical Western blot (n = 9), AB601 identified the 33-kDa protein, but pre-immune antisera and antibody pre-absorbed with antigenic peptide (0.3 mg/ml) failed to react with this protein. AB601 also immunoprecipitated the product (∼33 kDa) of in vitro translation of pxMT.zeo (not shown). The 33-kDa protein also was specifically recognized (n= 4) by AB596 (not shown), a polyclonal antibody created against an epitope within pcMTase distinct from that recognized by AB601. Both AB601 and AB596, but not pre-immune antisera immunoprecipitated the 33-kDa protein from whole cell lysate (n = 5; not shown). The relationship between the 33-kDa protein and a different 66-kDa protein also identified by our antibodies remains unclear. Aldosterone addition increased protein methylation in vivo and pcMTase activity in vitro but did not affect pcMTase protein levels. Aldosterone addition (Fig.2 A and TableI) significantly increased methyl esterification of total protein from steroid-free levels of 8.0 ± 0.6 to steroid-treated levels of 20.1 ± 0.8 methyl ester cpm/μg (n = 3). Similarly, pcMTase activity as assayed by artificial substrate methyl esterification (Fig. 2 B and Table I) was significantly greater in lysate prepared from aldosterone-treated cells compared with untreated cells with an activity of 5.6 ± 0.9 × 106 in the presence of steroid compared with 2.2 ± 0.3 × 106 cpm/mg in the absence (n = 12). In contrast, Fig. 2, C and D (summary in Table I) shows that aldosterone failed to affect pcMTase protein level. Fig. 2 C shows a typical Western blot probed with anti-pcMTase antibody on lysate prepared from A6 cells deprived of aldosterone for 48 h compared with lysate from cells treated with steroid. Aldosterone failed to significantly affect pcMTase protein levels with lysate prepared from treated cells having 3.7 ± 0.3 arbitrary units compared with 3.7 ± 0.3 for lysate from untreated cells (Fig. 2, panel D;n = 8). Fig. 2 B also shows that GTPγS (1 mm) enhances the ability of aldosterone to increase pcMTase activity from 3.8 ± 1.1 × 106 cpm/mg with GTPγS in the absence of steroid to 9.0 ± 1.2 × 106 cpm/mg with GTPγS plus steroid.Table IAldosterone action on pcMTase protein level and activityGrouppcMTase levelAFC methylationProtein methylationarbitrary unitscpm/mg × 106cpm/μgSteroid-free3.7 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.38.0 ± 0.6Steroid-treated3.7 ± 0.35.6 ± 0.920.1 ± 0.8-Fold change1-a-Fold change from basal levels in response to 1.5 μm aldosterone treatment for 4 h.1.002.62.51-a -Fold change from basal levels in response to 1.5 μm aldosterone treatment for 4 h. Open table in a new tab Table I summarizes the changes of protein level, protein methylation, and pcMTase activity in response to aldosterone. Although pcMTase protein levels did not change in response to aldosterone, pcMTase activity and total protein methylation increased comparably by 2.6- and 2.5-fold, respectively, suggesting that the increase in protein methylesterification resulted mainly from an increase in pcMTase activity. Fig. 3shows that active pcMTase is essential for aldosterone-induced increases in Na+ transport. Fig.3 A demonstrates that simultaneous addition of farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, 100 μm), a competitive inhibitor of pcMTase (18Marciano D. Ben-Baruch G. Marom M. Egozi Y. Haklai R. Kloog Y. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), with aldosterone significantly decreased methylation of AFC from 43.5 ± 4.8 cpm/μg/h to 0.8 ± 0.2 cpm/μg/h (n = 3). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 B, aldosterone-induced Na+ reabsorption is significantly reduced by the pcMTase inhibitors, FTS and AFC. The Western blot of Fig.4 A (inset) shows that lysate prepared from two consecutive passages (lanes 2 and 3) of cells transfected with pxMT.zeo had a greater amount of pcMTase compared with control transfectants (lane 1). The data represented in the summary graph of Fig. 4 A show that the relative density of pcMTase in lysate prepared from cells transfected with pxMT.zeo was 3.14-fold greater compared with control transfectant lysate (n = 8). The methyltransferase activity in lysate prepared from pcMTase overexpressing cells was significantly greater than that in lysate from cells transfected with control plasmid (Fig.4 B). Similarly, lysate prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pxMT.zeo showed increased methyl esterification of AFC (95.5 ± 20.2 cpm/μg/h) compared with that from control transfections (20.8 ± 2.4 cpm/μg/h;n = 5; data not shown). Cells overexpressing pcMTase, as shown in Fig.5, had significantly more aldosterone-induced Na+ reabsorption compared with control transfectants at both 4 and 24 h. The relative (compared with time 0) increase in Na+ current in response to aldosterone addition for 4 and 24 h in cells overexpressing pcMTase was 8.1 ± 1.7- and 8.6 ± 1.0-fold, respectively, but was only 3.2 ± 0.3- and 3.6 ± 0.3-fold, respectively, for control transfectants (n = 12). Whereas the aldosterone-induced currents of pcMTase overexpressing A6 cells were greater compared with control transfectants, the basal currents in the absence of steroid and serum in both transfectants were similar with 0.5 ± 0.1 and 0.3 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 in pxMT.zeo and control transfectants, respectively. Current in all transfectants was amiloride sensitive. The data presented support the hypothesis that carboxyl methyl esterification is critical to the aldosterone signal transduction, which culminates in increased Na+ reabsorption. These results demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzing this critical methyl esterification is likely isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase. Though active pcMTase was essential to aldosterone-induced transport, and steroid increased transferase activity in vivo and in vitro, pcMTase was not established as an aldosterone-induced protein, because protein levels did not change with aldosterone treatment. This observation was strengthened further by the results showing that overexpression of pcMTase failed to affect Na+ transport in the absence of aldosterone but potentiated transport in the presence of steroid. Potentiation of aldosterone-induced Na+ transport by pcMTase overexpression suggests that in A6 cells, pcMTase activity becomes limiting after the addition of steroid. Isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase was identified in A6 epithelia as a 33-kDa protein using Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation with two distinct antibodies. This is consistent with the predicted size of pcMTase in X. laevis (15Imai Y. Davey J. Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The current results, moreover, show that the product of in vitro translation of X. laevis pcMTase cDNA is in fact 33 kDa and that this protein is immunoreactive with anti-pcMTase antibody. In the only other study directly characterizing pcMTase protein, Dai et al. (16Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) also showed this protein to be 33 kDa in human myeloid cells. The cellular localization of the pcMTase that regulates Na+transport is unclear. Single channel experiments on ENaC activation by AdoMet suggest luminal localization for pcMTase (2Eaton D.C.

Moreover, biochemical experiments on A6 epithelia also suggest apical localization (for review, see Ref. 19Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 965-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, pcMTase in both human myeloid cells and yeast cells is localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (16Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In contrast, Phillinger et al. (20Phillinger M.H. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1486-1492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a plasma membrane-associated pcMTase activity in human neutrophils. The current results show that FTS, a competitive inhibitor of pcMTase in other tissues (18Marciano D. Ben-Baruch G. Marom M. Egozi Y. Haklai R. Kloog Y. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), inhibits pcMTase activity and Na+ transport in A6 cells suggesting that methyl esterification catalyzed by pcMTase is the transmethylation most relevant to Na+ reabsorption. Also supporting this notion are our results that AFC, also a competitive inhibitor of pcMTase (21Volker C. Miller R.A. McCleary W.R. Rao A. Poenie M. Backer J.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21515-21522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreases aldosterone-induced current, and the results of Blazer-Yost et al. (22Blazer-Yost B.L. Hughes C.L. Nolan P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1928-C1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that N-acetyl-S-geranyl-geranyl-l-cysteine inhibits Na+ reabsorption. This later isoprenoid-cysteine analog is an inhibitor of esterification of both S-farnesyl and S-geranylgeranyl modified COOH-terminal isoprenylcysteines (23Volker C. Lane P. Kwee C. Johnson M. Stock J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 295: 189-194Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Perez-Sala D. Gilbert B.A. Tan E.W. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our result showing a dependency of Na+ transport on pcMTase activity is consistent with results of Eaton et al. (2Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Ismailov et al. (9Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showing that addition of the methyl donor, AdoMet, to the intracellular face of a membrane containing the trimeric epithelial Na+ channel increases channel open probability. In these studies, GTP potentiated the actions of AdoMet. Thus, the current results showing that GTP complements aldosterone action on pcMTase also are consistent with these earlier studies. Taken together, they suggest that a luminal pcMTase activity is associated with and regulates ENaC. The mechanism of channel regulation, however, remains unclear. It is possible that either a subunit of ENaC or a regulator of ENaC is modified by transmethylation. Both possibilities are active areas of research by this and other laboratories. In fact, aldosterone recently has been shown to increase the methyl esterification of the β subunit of ENaC (8Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shyonsky V.

Stockand J.D. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1998; 21 (abstr.): 2447Google Scholar). Thus, both proteins are possible effectors of aldosterone-induced methylation. Interestingly, transcription of K-ras 2A mRNA in A6 cells is increased by aldosterone suggesting that this Ras is an aldosterone-induced protein (3Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test further whether these or other effectors of transmethylation, which also regulate ENaC activity (for review, see Refs. 2Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, and 19Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 965-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are the signaling proteins responsible for the natriferic actions of aldosterone and AdoMet. Aldosterone increased activity of pcMTase 2.6-fold. Similarly, steroid increased total protein methylation 2.5-fold suggesting that the majority of methylesterification in response to aldosterone resulted from elevated pcMTase activity. Activation of pcMTase did not result from an increase in pcMTase protein. Beacuse pcMTase activity in response to steroid is elevated in vitro, it is likely that some post-translational event mediates the increase. This notion is consistent with the results of Wong et al. (26Wong D.L. Lesage A. Siddall B. Funder J.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3310-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrating that phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity in adrenal medulla chromaffin cells is regulated by glucocorticoids independent of the steroid increasing transferase protein number. The relative protein levels of pcMTase in cells transfected with pxMT.zeo were 3.14-fold higher than that in cells transfected with control plasmid. However, pcMTase activity was 10 times greater. This dramatic increase in activity in cells expressing only 3.14-fold more protein likely results from additional actions of aldosterone on transferase regulation. If aldosterone increases activity approximately 2.6-fold and protein levels are 3.14-fold higher, then pcMTase activity in pxMT.zeo transfectants should be 8.2-fold higher than control transfectants. This number is close to the observed 10-fold increase. The observation that overexpression of pcMTase potentiates the actions of aldosterone suggests that in the presence of steroid, transferase can become rate-limiting for Na+ transport. Moreover, the observations that cells overexpressing pcMTase have greater transferase activity, but no significant increase in Na+ transport in the absence of steroid suggest that pcMTase activity is in excess at rest or that a regulator or downstream effector of pcMTase is limiting. Because the increase in methyltransferase activity in lysate prepared from pcMTase overexpressing cells (10-fold) does not correlate well with the aldosterone-induced increase in current (2.5-fold), it appears that pcMTase activity is no longer rate-limiting for steroid-induced Na+ transport in cells overexpressing pcMTase as it is in control cells. Methyl esterification and Na+ transport are, in part, under metabolic regulation by the activity of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K.

Thus, the current results in conjunction with this earlier observation suggest that aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption by activating pcMTase through some yet to be described post-translational event, in addition to relieving the enzyme from end-product inhibition. Thus, a critical methyl esterification is necessary for the aldosterone signal transduction that culminates in increased Na+channel activity, and pcMTase likely is the enzyme mediating this critical esterification. Aldosterone does not affect pcMTase protein levels but increases its activity, which increases protein methylation in vivo. That aldosterone-induced but not basal Na+ current is potentiated by overexpression of methyltransferase suggests that pcMTase is not an aldosterone-induced protein but is regulated by one. The aldosterone-induced protein regulating pcMTase activity, and the downstream effectors of pcMTase relevant to aldosterone signaling remain to be determined and will be the focus of future studies.

https://openalex.org/W1986663686,"Fission yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe possess two types of excision repair systems for UV-induced DNA damage, nucleotide excision repair (NER) and UV-damaged DNA endonuclease (UVDE)-dependent excision repair (UVER). Despite its high efficiency in damage removal, UVER defects have less effect on UV survival than NER defects. To understand the differential roles of two pathways, we examined strand-specific damage removal at the myo2 and rpb2 loci. Although NER removes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the transcribed strand more rapidly than from the nontranscribed strand, UVER repairs cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers equally on both strands and at a much higher rate than NER. The low rate of damage removal from the nontranscribed strand in the absence of UVER indicates inefficient global genome repair (GGR) in this organism and a possible function of UVER as an alternative to GGR. Disruption of rhp26, the S. pombe homolog of CSB/RAD26, eliminated the strand bias of NER almost completely and resulted in a significant increase of UV sensitivity of cells in a uvdeΔ background. We suggest that the combination of transcription-coupled repair of NER and rapid UVER contributes to UV survival in growing S. pombe cells, which is accomplished by transcription-coupled repair and GGR in other organisms.

In NER in these species, DNA damage on the transcribed strands of transcriptionally active genes is repaired more rapidly than damage on the opposite strand or in transcriptionally silent regions of DNA (1Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 239-241Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This strand-specific damage removal is considered to be due to the existence of two modes of NER, one acting specifically on transcribed regions and the other acting uniformly (at macroscopic level) throughout the genome. These two modes of NER are called transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genome repair (GGR), respectively. Several gene products have been reported to be specifically involved in either one of the two modes (2Venema J. Mullenders L.H. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a human genetic disorder in which patients show photosensitivity and impaired physical and mental development. Two genes, CSA and CSB are responsible for the classical form of CS (5Henning K.A. Li L. Iyer N. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C.

Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). CSB gene is also known as ERCC6, which can complement the UV sensitivity of rodent UV-sensitive mutants belonging to complementation group 6 (6Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). General conservation of the core mechanisms of NER between mammalian cells and budding yeast prompted researchers to search for yeast counterparts of these TCR-related genes, and RAD28 and RAD26 have been identified as CSA and CSB homologs, respectively (7Bhatia P.K. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5977-5988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Strangely, however, Rad26 but not Rad28 is involved in TCR of this organism. In addition, the defect in TCR in S. cerevisiae caused by the rad26 mutation does not significantly increase the UV sensitivity and does not bring about any other remarkable phenotypes (8van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although strong similarity between CSB and Rad26 suggests homology and conservation of this phenomenon between mammals and budding yeasts or even throughout eukaryotes, defective TCR somehow leads to different consequences in two organisms. NER in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has not been extensively studied, although several genes, such as rad13, rad15, rad16, swi10, ercc3sp., and rhp16, have been identified that are considered to be involved in NER mainly based on their sequence similarity to mammalian and budding yeast counterparts (for a review, see Ref. 9Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, there has been no report of strand-specific damage removal in S. pombe. Like the filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, S. pombe possesses the second excision repair pathway initiated by an enzyme called UVDE (10Bowman K.K. Sidik K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Doetsch P.W.

This enzyme specifically cleaves a phosphodiester bond 5′ adjacent to a UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) or a 6-4 photo product ((6-4) PP). After the nicking of damaged DNA, repair is thought to be completed by a base excision repair-like process partially dependent on the structure-specific endonuclease Rad2 (13Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is the S. pombe homolog of mammalian FEN-1 and S. cerevisiae Rad27. Our previous work showed that although UVDE-dependent excision repair (UVER) removes UV-induced lesions more rapidly from bulk DNA than NER, NER defect results in a greater effect on UV survival. We have been interested in the relationship between the two repair pathways in S. pombe. The present work reports the transcription dependence of NER at two loci of S. pombe and demonstrates remarkably inefficient GGR. We have also identified the Rad26/CSB homolog of S. pombe and showed its involvement in TCR of this organism. We have examined several possibilities that would explain the differential contribution of the two excision repair systems to UV survival. Our result suggests that the existence or the absence of transcription dependence at least partially accounts for the differential effect of NER and UVER. We also show that UVER acts as an alternative to GGR, especially in growing phase. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains were grown in either YES or minimal medium at 30 °C (14Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Double mutants were made by crossing each of the single mutants. Transformation of S. pombe cells was done by electroporation with ECM600 Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX) following the manufacturer's protocol.Table IStrains used in this workStrainGenotypeY4h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32Y21h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad13Δ::ura4Y26h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad13Δ::ura4 uvdeΔ::LEU2Y53h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 uvdeΔ::LEU2Y80h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rhp26Δ::ura4Y88h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rhp26Δ::ura4 uvdeΔ::LEU2Y99h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad3Δ::ura4Y101h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad3Δ::ura4 uvdeΔ::LEU2Y103h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad3Δ::ura4 rad13Δ::ura4Y105h+ ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 rad3Δ::ura4 rad13Δ::ura4 uvdeΔ::LEU2 Open table in a new tab For experiments with exponentially growing cells, a preculture was diluted 100–500-fold in fresh YES medium, and cells were grown for 10–14 h with shaking to a cell density of 1–2 × 107/ml. For experiments with stationary phase cells, a similarly diluted culture was incubated for 72 h. The small and round shape of the cells was confirmed microscopically. Exponentially growing or stationary phase cells in YES liquid medium were appropriately diluted with distilled water and 500 or 10,000 cells/plate were seeded on YES agar plates. 254-nm UV light was administered using a set of germicidal lamps (GL-10, Toshiba, Japan) at a dose rate of 0.02–3.3 J/m2/sec. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, colonies were counted. Exponentially growing cells in YES medium were washed twice with distilled water and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Approximately 30 ml of cell suspension was poured into a 15 cm plastic dish (Falcon) and irradiated with 100 J/m2 of 254-nm UV light. During the washing and UV irradiation processes cells were kept on ice, and all materials were pre-chilled. For each strain, a total of 300 ml of UV-irradiated cell suspensions were prepared and divided into 10 aliquots. Each aliquot was centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 30 ml of prewarmed YES medium and incubated at 30 °C for 0, 20, 40, 60, or 120 min (two aliquots for each time point). The cells were pelleted again, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until DNA preparation. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (14Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After digestion with Hin dIII, DNA was treated with T4 endonuclease or mock-treated and electrophoresed under alkaline condition (15Yasuhira S. Mitani H. Shima A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 53: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA was transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were prepared in duplicate with the same DNA sample, and one was hybridized with a sense strand-specific myo2 or rpb2 probe; the other was hybridized with an antisense-specific probe (see below) using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were analyzed using FLA-2000 Fluoroimage Analyzer (Fuji, Japan). The number of CPDs in the target fragment was calculated assuming Poisson distribution. After the first hybridization and the analysis, the blots were incubated at 100 °C in 0.5% SDS for 5 min to remove probes and rehybridized reciprocally with the opposite strand-specific probes. A part of myo2 gene ((16Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) nucleotides 1,496–2,302 of GenBank™ accession number U75357) was amplified by PCR with primers SY78 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCCAAAGCTACTTTATTGGTATTTT-3′) and SY79 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCATTATCTCATATCTGACTCTAAA-3′) using Y4 strain genomic DNA as a template and cloned into pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). Strand-specific probes were generated by asymmetric PCR using the cloned fragment as a template and either SY78 or SY79 as a primer (17Konat G.W. Laszkiewicz I. Grubinska G. Wiggins R.C. Griffin H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology: Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 37-42Google Scholar). After the PCR reaction, the probe was purified by passing through G-50 column. Approximately 3 × 106 cpm/ml was used in hybridization. For rpb2 strand-specific probes, a part of the gene ((18Kawagishi M. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) nucleotides 2,623–3,138 of GenBank™ accession numberD13337) was PCR-amplified with primers SY49 (5′-GAACTGGATCCTGCACAAAGAGTTAAGCCA-3′) and SY50 (5′-CCCCCGGATCCGTCGTACGTACCGTGTTTCATCCT-3′) and similarly labeled. A pair of PCR primers, SY99 (5′-GGGGGGAATTCTGACGGACTTGCACGATTTGTTTAC-3′) and SY100 (5′-GGGGGGGATCCGTCGGGCAAGAAGAGTGCTTGAAGT-3′) were designed based on a partial sequence found in the course of the S. pombe genome project conducted in Genome Research Group at National Institute of Radiological Sciences (Chiba, Japan) that is highly similar to S. cerevisiae RAD26 and human CSB. The PCR fragment (∼0.5 kb) obtained thus from Y4 genomic DNA was used as a probe to screen a partial S. pombe genomic library constructed in the Eco RI site of pBluescriptII SK+, and the positive plasmid clone pSY69 was sequenced on both strands using DSQ-1000 DNA Sequencer (Shimadzu, Japan). Open Reading Frame (ORF) search and exon/intron structure predictions were conducted by POMBE running on a SUN SPARC workstation (19Chen T. Zhang M.Q. Yeast. 1998; 14: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Subcelluar localization of Rhp26 was predicted by PSORTII, which is available on the Internet (20Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic cluster analysis was done using a MOLPHY2.3b3 package with a maximum-likelihood method (21Adachi J. Hasegawa M. Computer Science Monographs , No. 27. Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo1992Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by priming of 40 μg of DNaseI-treated total RNA with oligo(dT) (mixture of SY127–129: 5′-T20(A/C/G)-3′). The presence of rhp26 cDNA was checked by PCR with a pair of primers, SY119 (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTGTTGTTGTTCTTCATG-3′) and SY126 (5′-GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGGATTCCAATCAGGATCA-3′). The consecutive 1.7-and 0.1-kb Bgl II fragments within rhp26 ORF of pSY69 were replaced with an ura4 Bam HI cassette. The vector sequence was removed by Eco RI digestion, and the obtained fragment was used to transform the haploid S. pombe strain Y4. Five stable Ura+ transformants were checked for targeted integration of the ura4 marker by colony PCR, and three rhp26-mutated clones were obtained. Exponentially growing cells were appropriately diluted with distilled water, and 10 to 104 cells in 5 μl were spotted on H2O2-containing YES plates. The plates were incubated for 3 days and photographed. We and others have previously reported that S. pombe has two different excision repair pathways for UV-induced DNA damage, NER and UVER (12Freyer G.A. Davey S. Ferrer J.V. Martin A.M. Beach D. Doetsch P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4572-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By using an immunological damage assay, we found that UVER removes CPDs and (6-4) PPs, which are the major DNA damage induced by UV, from bulk DNA more rapidly than does NER, although in terms of UV survival, the contribution of NER is greater (Ref. 13Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and Fig. 5 a of this paper). We have been interested in the relative roles of these two repair systems in repair of UV-induced damage and what distinguishes them. Since there have been no reports of TCR in S. pombe, we first studied the transcription dependence of CPD removal by NER or UVER using a T4 endonuclease-based endonuclease-sensitive site assay. We decided to measure the repair rate of CPDs in the myo2 gene, which encodes a type II myosin heavy chain of S. pombe, taking advantage of its relatively high transcription level (16Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) 2C. Kitayama, personal communication. and the availability of an appropriately sized restriction fragment when digested with Hin dIII (∼4.1 kb). In wild type cells, CPDs were removed rapidly from both transcribed and nontranscribed strands with essentially equal rates (Fig.1, WT). NER-deficient rad13Δ cells were also able to repair CPDs on both strands with a comparable rate to wild type cells. This implies that UVER is the major component of CPD removal in wild type S. pombe cells, which is consistent with our previous result (13Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and also that there is no clear transcription dependence in UVER (Fig. 1, rad13Δ). When the UVER pathway was eliminated by the disruption of uvde, a clear strand bias of CPD removal emerged (Fig. 1, uvdeΔ). In fact, under our experimental conditions, CPD removal on the nontranscribed strand was hardly detected in this strain, whereas CPDs on the transcribed strand were removed efficiently. Cells deficient in both NER and UVER were not able to repair UV-induced CPDs during the period of time studied, suggesting that there is no third excision repair system (Fig. 1, rad13Δ uvdeΔ). We also studied TCR at the less transcriptionally active rpb2 locus (18Kawagishi M. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a homologous locus of which has been commonly used in S. cerevisiae for studies of TCR (8van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,23Tijsterman M. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The result obtained was essentially the same as in myo2 locus (data not shown). This suggests that within this range, a difference in transcription level does not significantly affect the efficiency of TCR. CSB and Rad26 belong to Swi/Snf2 protein family, which is a subgroup of a vast helicase superfamily (24Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We identified a short sequence in our S. pombe genome data base that shows the highest similarity with both S. cerevisiae Rad26 and human CSB and also lower similarity with other Swi/Snf2 family members. Southern blot analysis of S. pombe genomic DNA indicated that this sequence hybridized to a 7-kb Eco RI fragment under stringent conditions. We constructed a partial genomic library from Eco RI-digested and size-selected genomic DNA and screened it with the same probe. Sequencing of the consecutive 4.3 kb out of the 7-kb Eco RI insert of the positive clone revealed an ORF of 2922 base pairs, encoding a 973-amino acid protein with an estimated molecular weight of 110,900. Scanning of the sequenced region with the POMBE program (19Chen T. Zhang M.Q. Yeast. 1998; 14: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) did not identify either any introns within this ORF or any other significant ORFs. Expression of this ORF was checked by a reverse transcription-PCR experiment. The expected size of PCR product was observed only from the RNA sample reacted with reverse transcriptase (data not shown). Fig.2 a shows a schematic alignment of the ORF with S. cerevisiae Rad26 and Homo sapiens CSB. The middle part of the ORF contains the eight helicase motifs (25Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), showing a high degree of conservation with the corresponding regions of the other two homologs. Examination of this ORF with PSORTII programs picked up one putative nuclear localization signal and predicted it to be a nuclear protein (20Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). We concluded that this ORF encodes the S. pombe ortholog of S. cerevisiae Rad26 and H. sapiens CSB based on the following two observations. First, the deduced amino acid sequence shows the highest similarity with Rad26 and CSB among Swi/Snf2 family members. Second, phylogenetic analysis put this ORF in the same clade as Rad26 and CSB, leaving other Swi/Snf2 family members such as S. cerevisiae Mot1 in an out-group (data not shown). We propose to designate the gene rhp26 following the standard nomenclature for the S. pombe orthologs of S. cerevisiae genes. CSB/Rad26 is known to be specifically involved in the TCR mode of NER. In budding yeast and mammals, disruption of the gene eliminates most of the transcription dependence of NER. To examine the presumed involvement of Rhp26 in the homologous pathway in S. pombe, we constructed a rhp26 disruption mutant by replacing the N-terminal two-thirds of the endogenous ORF with a ura4 +marker in the haploid wild type strain Y4 (Fig. 2 b). The resultant strain did not show any abnormal morphology nor growth deficiency, suggesting no essential function of Rhp26. To assay the effect of the disruption on TCR, we also generated a rhp26 uvde double mutant by crossing each of single mutant, since TCR of CPDs was detected only in uvdeΔ background (Fig. 1). In the double mutant, the difference in repair rate between transcribed and nontranscribed strands disappeared almost completely (Fig.3 a). Just as NER on the nontranscribed strand was hardly observed in the uvde single mutant (Fig. 1 c), the rhp26 uvde double mutant did not show any detectable CPD repair on either strand similar to a rad13 uvde double mutant. As mentioned above, our previous genetic data showed that NER is more relevant to UV resistance than UVER. One possibility to explain the differential effect of the two repair systems is the existence or the absence of transcription dependence. We first examined if a defect in TCR affects the cell survival of S. pombe. rad26Δ strains turned out to be slightly, but reproducibly more sensitive than wild type cells (Fig. 3 b). This reduction of cell survival by the rad26 mutation was more dramatic in a uvdeΔ background (Fig. 3c). In other words, the difference between NER and UVER was reduced when the transcription-dependent component was removed from NER. The residual difference of UV resistance between rhp26ΔuvdeΔ and rad13Δ might be attributed to Rhp26-independent TCR (see “Discussion”). Although both NER and UVER are able to repair the two major types of UV-induced DNA lesions, CPDs and (6-4) PPs, NER can also repair other types of DNA damage induced by non-UV agents. If there are any minor types of UV-induced damage that are repaired only by NER and that are also relevant to cell survival, this would explain the differential effects of NER and UVER. Thymine glycol probably is the best candidate to fit this possibility. This DNA damage is known to be induced by UV irradiation as minor lesions and mostly repaired by base excision repair but, at least in vitro, can be repaired by NER also (26Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We next examined the cell sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, which is known to induce thymine glycol on DNA effectively, by a spot assay. Under the conditions used no difference in sensitivity was observed among the wild type and NER- or UVER-deficient strains (Fig.4 a). A repair intermediate in NER, but not unexcised damage, is believed to trigger a checkpoint control induced by UV irradiation (27Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell.

This means that a defect in NER may interfere with checkpoint signaling. In S. pombe, a checkpoint signal is considered to be bifurcated to the mitotic arrest and damage tolerance subpathways (29Murray J.M. Lindsay H.D. Munday C.A. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6868-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although mitotic arrest probably acts only to allow time for repair and is therefore significant only when repair systems are functional, damage tolerance may provide cells with a means for cell survival besides damage repair. This suggests the possibility that rad13 disruption may actually disrupt both NER and the checkpoint-dependent damage tolerance pathway, thus resulting in a more serious effect on UV survival than uvde disruption. We checked this possibility by examining the cell survival in a checkpoint-minus background. The result indicated that even in a rad3Δ background, rad13 disruption leads to a stronger effect on UV survival than uvde disruption (Fig. 4 b). This suggests that possible checkpoint control-related effects caused by rad13 disruption is not the major reason for the apparent difference between NER and UVER. Our data have shown that UVER plays the role of GGR in S. pombe. In other words, GGR of NER may have only a minor role when UVER is functional. We hypothesized that rapid damage removal by UVER may have less significance in cells in stationary phase. To examine this possibility, we studied the UV sensitivity of wild type and UVER- or NER-deficient cells in stationary phase. Unexpectedly, wild type cells in stationary phase turned out to be more UV-sensitive than those in the exponential phase of growth under our conditions (Fig. 5 a and b). uvde disruption led to a much smaller effect in cells in stationary phase, where NER defect caused as a dramatic reduction in UV survival as in the growing phase. In the present work we examined transcription dependence of two types of excision repair systems, NER and UVER in S. pombe. It has been generally believed that transcription dependence is a property peculiar to NER. However, it is not self-evident that other types of excision repair systems do not have transcription dependence, since there has been accumulating evidence that some types of oxidative damage not usually repaired by NER are also removed preferentially from the transcribed strands of active genes (30Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our study showed that in S. pombe the UVER pathway operates equally on both transcribed and nontranscribed strands at two loci, myo2 and rpb2, which differ in transcription levels, whereas the NER pathway has a clear strand bias. Probably due to the predominance of UVER pathway over NER in repair of CPDs, this strand bias was not observed in wild type cells, where both pathways were functional. Notably, at least in our assay conditions, CPD removal from the nontranscribed strand by NER was almost undetectable. A possible explanation is that GGR for CPDs of S. pombe may not be as efficient as in S. cerevisiae. We speculate that it is because UVER plays the role of GGR in repair of UV-damage in S. pombe. This is consistent with the fact that disruption of rhp16 gene dose not increase UV sensitivity in S. pombe as dramatically as disruption of RAD16 gene does in S. cerevisiae (31Bang D.D. Ketting R. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), both of which are considered to play a role specifically in GGR in respective organisms. On the other hand, rhp16 disruption does increase the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin, probably because UVER is not involved in repair of this type of damage (31Bang D.D. Ketting R. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The present work identified Rhp26, the S. pombe homolog of Rad26/CSB. As a member of Swi/Snf2 family, Rhp26 possesses a highly conserved helicase domain in its middle part. Despite its name, many of the proteins having this domain do possess DNA-dependent ATPase activity but do not really show helicase activity, and this applies to CSB and Rad26 (32Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, Rhp26 is not considered to have a helicase activity, but still its helicase domain is likely to be crucial for the function. van Gool et al. (8van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) report that both Rad26 and CSB have a stretch of acidic amino acids and discuss that this motif might also be involved in their function. Rhp26, however, does not have such an obvious acidic region at its N terminus. This suggests either that this region is not relevant to CSB/Rad26 function or another part of this protein or that another protein(s) compensates for the absence of the acidic region in S. pombe. Disruption of rhp26 increased UV sensitivity slightly but reproducibly, and this effect was more pronounced in a uvdeΔ background. This situation is somewhat similar to that between TCR and GGR in S. cerevisiae. Although rad26 disruption hardly increases the UV sensitivity of wild type S. cerevisiae, it causes a dramatic effect in the GGR minus rad16Δ strain (31Bang D.D. Ketting R. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This also supports the idea that in S. pombe UVER acts as an alternative to GGR, and that it partially (but importantly not completely) compensates TCR defect (see below). We have been concerned with why a UVER defect causes a weaker effect on cell survival than a NER defect. In general, when two pathways are apparently redundant for a single function, and the disruption of one results in a weaker phenotype than the disruption of the other, the former pathway is regarded as a backup system to the latter and is not relevant when the latter pathway is functional. However our present work showed that even when both NER and UVER operate, UVER is predominant in removal of CPDs. UV survival experiments with rad3Δ background showed that a checkpoint control-related process is not involved in the difference between NER and UVER. Differential ability to repair thymine glycol, which is known to be repaired by NER in vitro, but not by UVER, is also shown not to be able to explain the difference. This result, however, does not exclude the possible existence of other minor UV damage, which is differentially repaired by NER and UVER and relevant to UV survival. NER is likely to act on a broader range of damage substrate than UVER, and it is reasonable to suppose such UV damage exists, although we do not have any positive evidence for this hypothesis at the moment. Disruption of rhp26 reduced the difference between NER and UVER but did not erase it completely. This residual difference might be attributed to Rhp26-independent TCR. Brouwer and co-workers report that there is a Rad26-independent TCR in S. cerevisiae at the short regions downstream of the promoters of active genes (34Verhage R.A. van Gool A.J. de Groot N. Hoeijmakers J.H. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The contribution of this Rad26-independent TCR was expressed as the difference in UV survival between a NER− strain and a rad16 rad26 double mutant. Our preliminary work showed that also in S. pombe, rhp16Δrhp26Δ uvdeΔ is much more UV-resistant than rad13Δ uvdeΔ, suggesting that Rhp26-independent TCR significantly contributes to UV survival. 3S. Yasuhira and A. Yasui, unpublished result. It would be interesting to find mutants lacking both Rhp26-dependent and -independent TCR and to study how this affects the UV survival. Such a mutant would be also very useful to clarify the molecular mechanism of TCR. Assuming that the difference between NER and UVER is explained by the existence or the absence of transcription dependence, why is highly efficient UVER only equally effective in UV survival to GGR, which is almost undetectable in our assay? This again is a difficult question to answer. One point is that in (6-4) PP repair, NER is very efficient and is almost comparable to UVER (13Yonemasu R. McCready S.J. Murray J.M. Osman F. Takao M. Yamamoto K. Lehmann A.R. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In fact in most organisms NER repairs (6-4) PPs at a much higher rate than CPDs. There is a general belief that (6-4) PPs are stronger barriers against replication or transcription and, thus, more toxic than CPDs and a major determinant in cell killing by UV. Taken together, this might explain the apparent irrelevance of CPD repair rates by UVER or GGR for UV survival. If UVER has less significance than NER in UV survival due to the lack of transcription dependence or other reasons, what is its advantage? We speculate that the high efficiency of UVER is advantageous in rapidly growing cells. To support this possibility, disruption of uvde leads to an even weaker effect on the survival of stationary phase cells. It is an attractive hypothesis that in stationary phase, even inefficient GGR may be able to compensate for the UVER defect taking advantage of plenty of time for damage removal. However, it should be noted that other explanations such as down-regulation or some toxic effect of UVER in stationary phase are also possible. Taking into account the fact that wild type cells in stationary phase are more UV-sensitive than those in exponential phase, these possibilities should be examined in the future studies. Nevertheless, UVER certainly plays a important role in the UV resistance of growing cells. Cells generally possess multiple repair pathways for a single type of DNA damage. Despite this apparent redundancy, each pathway may have some special condition in which it is more advantageous than others, and this probably has enabled multiple pathways to be maintained during evolution.

Polyglutamation constitutes a mechanism to trap folates within mammalian cells; the long chain folylpolyglutamates are poorly accepted by the membrane carriers responsible for efflux. The enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of these polyglutamates, folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS),1 is found in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria of mammalian cells (1Lin B.-F.

Interestingly, alternate exon usage is not involved in the mechanism whereby the two mRNA species encoding the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of this enzyme are produced, but rather, alternate transcriptional start sites are used on the same first exon under the control of a TATA-less promoter (2Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The study of FPGS has lagged behind the interest in and importance of this enzyme, in large part because of the low levels of enzyme present in even the richest endogenous source. However, with the cloning of the cytosolic (3Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) forms of FPGS from human leukemic cells, heterologous expression has allowed access to substantial levels of this protein for the first time. We have presented a preliminary report (4Sanghani P.C. Sanghani S.P. Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 379Google Scholar) describing purification of recombinant human leukemic cell cytosolic FPGS expressed in insect cells to typical yields of 5–25 mg/liter of culture. Such quantities of FPGS now allow direct studies on the mechanism of the FPGS reaction and the characteristics of the active site. The FPGS found in the cytoplasm of CEM human leukemic cells contains 545 amino acids. In our initial attempts to locate the active site of rhcFPGS, we noted the presence of three highly reactive, solvent-exposed cysteines that were protected from iodoacetamide by ATP, one of the substrates for the FPGS reaction. Each of the cysteines was adjacent to regions of the protein in which several amino acids have been conserved in the several species of FPGS now sequenced, which range from bacteria, through yeast and lower multicellular eukaryotes, to higher mammals. To determine the function of these peptides directly, we have mutated each of six highly conserved charged residues within these domains. We now report that the mutation of three of these amino acids induced substantial changes in the kinetic properties of FPGS, consistent with the hypothesis that they are located in the active site of this enzyme. A recently published (5Sun X. Bognar A. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) x-ray structure of the Lactobacillus casei FPGS to which was bound Mg-ATP, but not folate or glutamic acid, allowed a partial visualization of the ATP binding site. This paper now allows a more detailed placement of the active site of FPGS within this structure. A cDNA encoding cytosolic rhFPGS was ligated into the plasmid vector pBlueBacIII to give the baculoviral transfer vector phcFPGS, and a recombinant baculovirus was produced by recombination of phcFPGS with linearized wild-type AcMNPV baculoviral DNA in Sf9 cells. The starting FPGS cDNA was from CEM leukemia cells (2Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and extended from the more downstream of the two start methionines up to 200 bp into the 3′-untranslated region. The expression and purification of wild-type recombinant FPGS will be described in detail elsewhere. Each mutated cDNA construct in pBluebac III (3 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of linearized Bac-N-Blue viral DNA (Invitrogen) and lipofected into 2.5 × 106 Sf9 insect cells. After 100 h, supernatants were used for plaque purification of viruses. Blue plaques without occlusion bodies were chosen, and initial viral stock was checked for purity by PCR as described by Invitrogen. One highly expressing virus for each mutant was then further amplified and used for production of the protein. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified by a three-step procedure consisting of ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column followed by gradient elution of a DEAE-Sephacel column. Purified rhcFPGS was estimated to be >95% pure by electrophoresis of overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1), and all of the mutant proteins behaved similarly to the wild-type FPGS during this purification procedure. Purified proteins were stored at −25 °C in 50% glycerol. During kinetic studies for estimation of the Km value of ATP, a very high background was observed, suggesting contamination of the concentrated protein with ATP. A PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) removed the contaminant. Alanine mutants at positions Asp-335, His-338, Cys-346, Asp-376, Arg-377, Asp-378, and Lys-384 (numbered considering the cytosolic start codon (2Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J.

BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-411PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure uses three primers, two gene-specific (one forward, 5′-GAGCCAAAGGCATCCAGGCCAGGGCT-3′; and one reverse, 5′-TTCGTCCAGGTGGTTCCAGTGC-3′) and a third forward-mutated primer. The mutating primers were designed to either generate or delete a restriction site to allow for efficient analysis of mutants and were 5′-phosphorylated. These primers were as follows: for D335A, 5′p-CTCACCTGGTATCTGGCCGGTG-CGCA-3′; for H338A, 5′p-CTGGACGGTGCA GCCACCGCCAGCA-3′; for C346A, 5′p-AGCGCGCAGGCCGCTGTGCGCTGGTTC-3′; for D376A, 5′p-AATGCTACCGGTGCCCGGGACCCGGC-3′; for R377A, 5′p-AATGCTACCGGCGACGCGGACCCGGCG-3′; for D378A, 5′p-TACCGGGGACCGGGCACCGGCGGCCCT-3′; and for K384A, 5′p-GGCCCTGCTGGCGCTGCTGCAGCCCT-3′. (The nucleotides that have been changed are underlined, and those responsible for the mutation are listed in boldface.) Five ng of phcFPGS was used as the template, and the mutated and unmutated primers were 7.5 and 0.75 μm, respectively. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (0.2 mm), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), NAD (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) (1.25 units), and Taq ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) (10 units) were added in a 25-μl reaction volume using Taq polymerase buffer (Promega). The PCR cycle conditions used were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 65 °C for 4 min. The product was amplified for 29 cycles, and the final elongation step was 10 min at 65 °C to ensure the incorporation of the mutated primer. Two products were obtained, a short product extending from the mutated primer to the reverse primer and the longer product (460 bp) from the gene-specific forward primer to the reverse primer. For those mutant sequences in which a unique restriction site was deleted (for D335A, a Kpn I site; for H338A, a Fsp I site; for C346A, a Stu I site), the 460-bp PCR fragment was enriched for mutated products by endonuclease digestion prior to purification. The 460-bp PCR product was digested with Apa I and Tth III to generate a 270-bp fragment, which was cloned into similarly digested phcFPGS. The entire ligation mixture was precipitated with ethanol and transfected into XL1-blue cells. The PCR-generated regions of the resultant clones were manually sequenced to confirmed the presence of mutations. Mutant cDNAs constructed in pBluebac III were excised as a 1.7-kilobase Bst EII/Xba I fragment and ligated into hcFPGS cDNA in the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector cut with the same enzymes, generating FPGS cDNAs which initiate at the cytosolic start methionine and extend 100 bp into 3′-untranslated region. AUXB1 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish in α+ medium and then overlaid the next day with 5 μg of cDNA constructs mixed with 5 μg of pY3, which encodes the hygromycin B resistance marker (7Blochlinger K. Diggelmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), as a mixed calcium phosphate precipitate (8Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 1 ml. Double selection with α-medium formulated without nucleosides (α−) and with hygromycin B at 400 μg/ml was applied 4 days after transfection (2Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Colonies were fixed, stained, and scored on day 15. A 50% glycerol stock of rhcFPGS was passed through a PD-10 gel filtration column equilibrated with labeling buffer (20 mm NaHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5 (at 25 °C)). The enzyme (174 pmol in 0.4 ml) was incubated in labeling buffer at 20 °C for 5 min before the addition of 2 mm IAM in the presence or absence of ATP (3 mm) with or without methotrexate (2 mm). For stoichiometry studies, 1 nmol of rhcFPGS was preincubated at 20 °C for 5 min in 175 μl of labeling buffer prior to the addition of 350 nmol of [14C]IAM (8.63 cpm/pmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2-ME to 50 mm, enzyme activity was determined, and solid urea was added to 8 m. The resulting clarified solution was applied to 25-mm Immobilon-P membrane discs, and the membranes were washed with 50 ml of 20% methanol containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.7 (at 25 °C). A standard amount of [14C]IAM was spotted onto membranes and counted under identical conditions to allow conversion of protein-bound 14C to pmol of bound IAM. Filtration of reaction mixes through two stacked membranes and subsequent staining with Coomassie Blue indicated that less than 3% of the FPGS applied was penetrating to the second disc. rhcFPGS (5.5 nmol in 0.65 ml) was labeled with 2 mm [14C]IAM at 20 °C for 12 min as described above. 2-ME was added to a concentration of 50 mm, and the solution was brought to 50% in ethanol. The precipitate was washed three times with alcohol and water to remove excess label and was then dissolved in 100 μl of 8 m urea in 0.4 m NH4HCO3, pH 8. Dithiothreitol (0.45 μmol in 10 μl) was added, and the tube was kept at 50 °C for 15 min. Nonradioactive IAM (1 μmol in 10 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. The concentration of urea was adjusted to 2 min 0.1 m NH4HCO3. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 72 h with the addition of a second aliquot of trypsin at 36 h. For the purpose of exhaustive peptide analysis, the tryptic digest was subjected to HPLC on a C-8 column, and all radioactive peaks eluting after 20 min were lyophilized, redissolved in 2 murea/100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and digested for another 48 h with trypsin at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w). For peptide purification and analysis, the enzyme was reacted with IAM for 12 min to a stoichiometry of 3:1 bound IAM:FPGS, and the tryptic digestion of the labeled protein was carried out at 37 °C in 2m urea containing 0.1 mNH4HCO3, pH 8.3, at 1:10 (w/w) trypsin to rhcFPGS. The labeled peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a 300-Å Whatman C-8 column (4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The digest was applied as a 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid solution, and the peptides were eluted using a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The elution of peptides was monitored at 220 nm; 0.5-min fractions were collected and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Radioactive peptides corresponding to peaks I, II, and III, which eluted after 21, 13.5, and 25.3 min, respectively, were combined from several experiments, lyophilized, and dissolved in 2m urea in 0.1 mNH4HCO3, pH 8.3. Each peak was further purified by HPLC using a Whatman 300-Å C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) eluted with gradients of acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The peptides pooled from the C-8 column were each chromatographed twice on a C-18 column as 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid solutions, after which a single peak eluted that had coincident profiles of A220 and 14C. Pools of each peptide were submitted for microsequencing and mass spectrometry at 1–2 nmol/0.2 ml. HPLC-purified peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation on a Hewlett Packard G1005A protein sequencer at Commonwealth Biotechnologies Inc. (Richmond, VA). The effluent from individual cycles of HPLC was concentrated, and 14C was determined. Peptides were also analyzed in a Nermag 30-10 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an Analytica electrospray ionization source (Branford, Inc.). Samples were diluted in a 50% methanol solution containing 0.5% acetic acid and injected at a flow rate of 1 μl/min using CO2 for counter-current drying. The temperature of the CO2 at the heater was 250 °C. For each sample, several mass spectra were acquired over m/z = 3–1600 in 9 s. These analyses were kindly performed by Dr. John Fenn and associates (9Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M.

Initial steady state kinetic analyses involved FPGS assays carried out at 37 °C in 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.9, containing 30 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 50 mm 2-ME, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Buffer A), and 1–10 mm[3H]glutamic acid, using aminopterin as a substrate. The product was quantitated by charcoal adsorption (10Moran R.G. Colman P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consumption of the limiting substrate was limited to <15%. The enzyme concentration used for D335A, H338A, and R377A was 1.67 μm, and for all other enzymes, 1–3 nm was used. HPLC-purified [3H]aminopterin (Moravek Biochemicals) was dried and reconstituted in Buffer A. When used as a fixed substrate, ATP was held at 5 mm, glutamic acid at 400 mm, and aminopterin was held constant between 100 and 500 μm. As a variable substrate, the concentration of aminopterin was varied between 2.5 and 400 μm, ATP was varied between 2 and 1000 μm, and glutamic acid ranged from 12 mm to 400 mm. Assays were carried out at 37 °C and were stopped by a 2 min incubation at 100 °C. Double-strength tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate buffer (Low UV PicA reagent; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was added and the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Sep-pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corp.) were washed with methanol and equilibrated in PicA prior to loading the centrifuged reaction mixtures. The cartridges were washed with 3 ml of PicA buffer and then with 3 ml of 90% PicA, 10% methanol; reaction products were centrifugally eluted with 500 μl of 60% methanol. The eluant was dried, and the residue was reconstituted in 100 μl of PicA. This solution was passed through a 0.2-μm filter (Gelman), and 80 μl of the filtrate was injected onto a 4.6 × 100 mm, 3-μm, C18 reverse phase Luna column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). A two-phase linear gradient of methanol/PicA (pH 6.0) was used: 20–28% methanol over 10 min followed by an increase to 36% methanol over 15 min. The eluant was monitored at 304 nm, and the peak corresponding to aminopterin diglutamate was collected as 20-s fractions. The specific activity of aminopterin was determined by HPLC. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Enzfitter software (Elsevier Biosoft). Reactions were initiated at 37 °C by the addition of 2.5 μg of FPGS to 5 μm DDATHF (or its di- or triglutamate derivatives), 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glutamic acid, 30 mm KCl, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm 2-ME in a total volume of 500 μl of 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.9, and terminated at 100 °C for 2 min. The samples were prepared for HPLC as above, but eluants from Sep-pak columns were reconstituted in 200 μl of PicA buffer. A 50-μl aliquot was injected onto a Luna column eluted with mobile phase consisting of multiphase gradients of PicA and methanol; an initial methanol concentration of 27% was increased to 35% in 10 min, followed by an increase to 42% in the next 15 min, and was then held at 42% for another 10 min. The identity of peaks was confirmed by coinjection with standards that were generously provided by Dr. Chuan Shih (Lilly). In these experiments, the stock solutions of glutamic acid and aminopterin were dissolved in Tris buffer. The final strength of Tris buffer was 0.5 m at pH 8.9. Reactions contained 0.4m glutamic acid, 0.5 mm aminopterin, 5 mm ATP as the Tris salt, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm 2-ME, and bovine serum albumin at 0.6 mg/ml in a reaction volume of 500 μl. Potassium chloride was varied from 0 to 100 mm. The enzyme ranged from 0.3 μg/reaction for rhcFPGS to 3 μg/reaction for R377A. IAM inactivated rhcFPGS, with a loss of 30–85% activity in 5 min, depending on the enzyme concentration during exposure (Fig.2). Inhibition of enzyme activity followed a biphasic time course, and the initial rapid phase was particularly noticeable at higher enzyme concentrations, with 80% enzyme inactivation within 0.5 min. (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of MgATP alone or with methotrexate, the inactivation of rhcFPGS by IAM was substantially reduced (Figs.2 A). 2Control experiments indicated no appreciable direct reaction between IAM and ATP under these conditions (pH 7.5, 20 °C). The kinetics of binding of [14C]IAM to rhcFPGS was also biphasic and reflected the time course of inhibition of enzyme activity (Fig.2 B). During the rapid initial phase of enzyme inhibition, IAM labeled enzyme to a stoichiometry of about 1 mol/mol of enzyme. Interestingly, rhcFPGS that had reacted with 1 mol of IAM/mol of enzyme still had about 25% enzyme activity, and complete inhibition of enzyme activity required labeling to about 3 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme (Fig. 2 B). Hence, either IAM inactivated rhcFPGS by alkylating multiple amino acids in or close to the active site or by alkylating three reactive surface residues on peptides that became mobile following substrate binding, burying the reactive residues away from solvent. Because either possibility would indicate a crucial role in the behavior of this enzyme, the peptides to which IAM was binding were identified. After an initial proteolytic digestion of [14C]IAM-inactivated FPGS, several of the tryptic peptides detected at A220 in the effluent of a C-8 HPLC column were labeled with 14C (Fig.3, A and B). In the presence of ATP and methotrexate, the amount of peptide-bound14C derived from IAM that was detected in tryptic digests of rhcFPGS was substantially decreased, and interestingly, every labeled peptide peak was diminished (Fig. 3 B). When the several radioactive peptides labeled in the absence of ATP (Fig.3 B) were pooled and again treated with trypsin, a simpler HPLC profile of labeled peptides was observed (Fig. 3 C), which did not further simplify with more extensive tryptic digestion. Each of the three major labeled peptides (Fig. 3 C) was repetitively chromatographed on a C-18 HPLC column until the profile of radioactivity and of A220 indicated the presence of a single labeled peptide. A microsequence from each of the three labeled peptides unambiguously matched peptide sequences predicted by the cDNA sequence. Automated sequencing of peptide I stopped after 12 cycles, and the data fit a tryptic peptide deduced from the cDNA sequence of rhcFPGS corresponding to the cytosolic FPGS peptide G66STCAFTECILR77. The majority of the radioactivity associated with peptide I was liberated in the cycle when the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of cysteine 69 was released, although a small amount of radioactivity was also observed at cysteine 74. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS) (9Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6314) Google Scholar) of peptide I revealed two mass ions; the major peak, at m/z = 1413.6, corresponded to the molecular weight calculated for the peptide sequence GSTCAFTECILR. Automated sequencing of peak II clearly indicated the peptide sequence LLQPC, then stopped after the fifth cycle. This amino acid sequence matched that of the rhcFPGS tryptic fragment starting at residue L385 and ending with C389, as deduced from the cDNA sequence. The last amino acid released during this sequencing, a cysteine, also contained the radioactivity associated with this peptide. As expected, the largest molecular ion in the EIMS fragmentation pattern of Peak II had the molecular weight (629.4) calculated for the peptide LLQPC. Peak III was found to contain a single peptide of 21 amino acids, which unambiguously matched the sequence expected for tryptic cleavage at Arg-327 and at Arg-348 of rhcFPGS. The radioactivity was associated with Cys-346 in this peptide. EIMS of peak III indicated two molecular ions at 1130 and 753.3 m/z, corresponding to m/2 e and m/3 e for a peptide of 2260 daltons, the calculated mass of the FPGS peptide328GPLTWYLDGA-HTASSAQACVR348. It was of interest to determine whether the early phase of reaction of enzyme with IAM (Fig. 2) involved the modification of a single very reactive cysteine. To address this question, rhcFPGS that had been incubated with IAM for 30 s, after which a single mol of reagent had reacted per mol of enzyme (Fig. 2 B), was exhaustively digested with trypsin, and the labeled tryptic peptides were subjected to HPLC. Surprisingly, this experiment revealed that all three peptides (I, II, and III; Fig. 3 C) reacted during the initial labeling event. We concluded that labeling of 1 mol of any of these reactive cysteines substantially inhibited the enzyme and also decreased the accessibility of the other two cysteines for reaction, as indicated by the decreased slope of both functions shown in Fig.2 B after the initial phase of reaction. A homology comparison of the sequences of FPGS from 12 species indicated a number of residues immediately adjacent to these IAM-sensitive cysteines that have been completely conserved throughout evolution (Fig.4). It was noted that the three IAM-sensitive cysteines were not found in the bacterial FPGS sequences and, hence, appear unlikely to be essential to the FPGS reaction, which has similar but not identical characteristics in bacteria and higher species. Peptide I was clearly part of the ATP binding site (11Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar, 12Toy J. Bognar A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and was not studied further, whereas peptides II and III were potentially part of the folate or glutamate binding sites, which have not yet been experimentally definable. Because these peptides were clearly solvent-exposed and were potentially located in the active site, several adjacent charged amino acids that were particularly conserved in peptides II and III were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Each of these residues (Asp-335, His-338, Asp-376, Arg-377, and Asp-378) were mutated to alanines, as was Cys-346, one of the three iodoacetamide-sensitive residues, and Lys-384, an amino acid conserved only among higher species (Fig. 4). Selection of these amino acids as potential active site residues based on homology considerations was later supported by the structure of L. casei FPGS complexed with ATP, for which the x-ray coordinates were released while this manuscript was being reviewed. The Chinese hamster ovary derivative, AUXB1, is auxotrophic for an exogenous source of the end products of folate metabolism, thymidine and purines, as a result of a lack of expression of FPGS activity (13Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,14McBurney M.W. Whitmore G.F. Cell. 1974; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). cDNA constructs encoding seven mutant FPGS species were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and the resultant plasmids were co-transfected into AUXB1 cells along with pY3, a plasmid encoding resistance to hygromycin B (7Blochlinger K. Diggelmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2929-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Complementation of the AUXB1 phenotype by transfection of a cDNA encoding wild-type rhcFPGS or these several mutant enzymes is shown in Fig.5. Transfection of the C346A mutant resulted in the formation of colonies in medium lacking thymidine and purines (Fig. 5), indicating that Cys-346 was not required for FPGS enzyme activity; the colonies that were formed looked morphologically identical to those formed in the control rhcFPGS plates. Plasmids encoding the H338A, D376A, D378A, and K384A proteins partially supported the growth of AUXB1 cells, with 50–75% of the number of colonies on the wild-type rhcFPGS control. The colonies in plates transfected with these mutants grew vigorously, similar to those for rhcFPGS transfectants. However, plates transfected with R377A had far fewer colonies, and the colonies were sparse clusters of rounded cells that were poorly attached to the plates. It was concluded that this mutant barely supported the growth of AUXB1 cells. A few very small colonies were formed from cells transfected with the D335A mutant, and those consisted of a small number of large, rounded cells that stained poorly, which was very similar to the cell debris remaining"
https://openalex.org/W2092692992,"Using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor as a sensitive and specific monitor, we have isolated two distinct bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-binding proteins, and identified them as lipovitellin 1 and Ep45, respectively. Lipovitellin 1 is an egg yolk protein that is processed from vitellogenin. Both vitellogenin and Ep45 are synthesized under estrogen control in the liver, secreted, and taken up by developing oocytes. In this paper, we have shown that of the TGF-β family members tested, Ep45 can bind only to BMP-4, whereas lipovitellin 1 can bind to both BMP-4 and activin A. Because of this difference in specificity, we have focused on and further studied Ep45. Kinetic parameters were determined by surface plasmon resonance studies and showed that Ep45 associated rapidly with BMP-4 (<i>k</i><sub>a</sub> = 1.06 × 10<sup>4</sup>m<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) and dissociated slowly (<i>k</i><sub>d</sub> = 1.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>). In <i>Xenopus</i> embryos microinjected with Ep45 mRNA, Ep45 blocked the ability of follistatin to inhibit BMP activity and to induce a secondary body axis in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had no effect on other BMP antagonists, chordin and noggin. These results support the possibility that Ep45 interacts with BMP to modulate its activities <i>in vivo</i>."

Removal of the ubiquitin modification, or deubiquitination, is performed by ubiquitin-specific proteases and is an important mechanism regulating this pathway.

A USP3 probe detects two mRNA transcripts, one of which corresponds in length to the cDNA. Both are expressed at low levels in all tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas.

These enzymes, which include ubiquitin-activating enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin protein ligases, are complemented by the deubiquitinating activity of enzymes termed ubiquitin-specific proteases (Ubps),1 deubiquitinating enzymes or ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (reviewed in Refs. 1Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev.

The Ubps can cleave either peptide bonds linking ubiquitin as part of a precursor fusion protein, releasing free ubiquitin moieties, or cleave bonds conjugating ubiquitin (post-translationally) to proteins. Based on sequence similarity to conserved amino acid regions observed in the first Ubps studied, numerous Ubps have been, and continue to be, identified in many species, with 16 known to exist in yeast. Because studies have shown that the presence of these motifs strongly correlates with Ubp activity, not all these Ubps have actually been functionally characterized as deubiquitinating enzymes. In humans, the ability to cleave ubiquitin bonds has been illustrated for only four of seven published Ubps; Unph, Tre-2, Hausp, and isopeptidase T (4Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Veda R.

Of the four characterized Ubps, each has its own characteristic substrate specificity and role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, and it follows that novel deubiquitinating enzymes may also play a distinct role in regulating the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway. Fundamental to their regulatory role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is the ubiquitin cleavage activity exhibited by the Ubps. Moreover, the cleavage specificity of individual Ubps dictates at which point(s) they contribute to this regulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This is reflected by the detrimental effects caused by overexpression of, or mutations to, the Ubps, which have been best studied in yeast. Triple null mutants of the yeast Ubp1p, Ubp2p, and Ubp3p are extremely sensitive to stress conditions, presumably because of a reduction in the rate of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (14Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast Doa4p (Ubp4p) cleaves peptide or isopeptide bonds linking multi-ubiquitin chains to peptide remnants following proteasomal degradation of the ubiquitin-targeted protein (9Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The doa4 null mutant causes general inhibition of ubiquitin proteolysis and phenotype defects ranging from slow growth to defects in DNA repair. Overexpression of Doa4p increases the degradation rate of several substrates, indicating that Doa4p is one rate-limiting factor in their degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. When yeast Ubp14p (which disassembles unanchored polyubiquitin chains) is deleted, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is generally inhibited because of the accumulated free chains inhibiting the proteasome (15Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Ubp14p can inhibit the degradation of some proteins although not affecting others, possibly because of its effects on preassembled ubiquitin chains being attached to some substrates (15Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, the characteristic substrate specificity of a Ubp greatly influences its role in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. In this study, we present the isolation and characterization of a novel human ubiquitin-specific protease. We have adopted the nomenclature suggested by the Human Genome Project nomenclature committee and have termed this enzyme USP3. It is demonstrated that USP3 is a functional Ubp, capable of cleaving the artificial ubiquitin-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in vitro. We have localized the USP3 gene to chromosome 15q22.3, distinct from any known human Ubp. USP3 expression in yeast has a general inhibitory effect on ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, as assayed with the degradation of L-β-gal, a specific introduced N-end rule substrate of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway, and on the degradation of abnormal endogenous proteins. In addition, USP3 is able to efficiently cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond. To date this cleavage activity has only been attributed to the mouse Ubp, Unp, and its human homolog, Unph (5Gilchrist C.A. Gray D.A. Baker R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32280-32285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone Hsaaadqei (EBI accession number Z21167) was obtained from the UK-Human Genome Mapping Project as a λNM1149 phage clone. The ∼1.7-kb Eco RI insert was subcloned into the vector pRS316 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, following restriction endonuclease mapping, completely sequenced (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to reveal an artifact of two fused cDNA clones (see “Results”). The Ubp-like portion was isolated as a Sac I/Eco RI fragment, termed USP3, and used for subsequent experiments. The partial cDNA clone was used as a random primed probe (Megaprime; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for screening a λgt11 phage human testis tissue cDNA library (CLONTECH) (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After selecting positive clones derived from tertiary screening, phage DNA was isolated (Promega Wizard λ Preps purification system) and the inserts amplified using λ-specific primers (New England Biolabs, catalogue numbers 1218F and 1222R). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with Eco RI and ligated into pBluescript and sequenced. Computer sequence data bases were searched using the BLAST algorithm (18Altshul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar); this identified two expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNAs, which confirmed the fragment order and sequence of the majority of the 2,324-bp sequence. The open reading frame was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide primers (USP3BamHI, 5′-d(TCGGATCCATGGAGTGTCCACACCTGAG);USP3Hin dII I, 5′-d(ATAAAGCTTGCAGCCTTGAGAGACAAGC)) and a proofreading DNA polymerase to reduce errors (Pfu-Turbo, Stratagene). The product was digested with Bam HI/Hin dIII and ligated into protein expression vectors as required (see below). The probe used for Southern hybridization was a 760-bp Sca I-Eco RI fragment from the 3′ end of the cDNA, whereas the probe for Northern hybridization was a 488-bp Bsp HI-Xba I fragment, extending from bp 605 to bp 1093 of the USP3 sequence. Probes were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dATP using random priming (Megaprime; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Genomic DNA was isolated from human blood samples (19Grünebaum L. Caznave J.P. Camerino G. Kloepfer C. Mandel J.L. Tolstoshev P. Jaye M. De-la-Salle H. Lecocq J.P. J. Clin.

The digests were electrophoresed on 1× TAE, 1% agarose gel, and capillary blotted (20Ausübel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A.

Northern hybridization used aCLONTECH Premade Multiple Human Tissue Northern blot (catalog no. 7760), containing ∼2 μg of mRNA per lane, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Radiation hybrid mapping data was searched at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The probe used for localization of the USP3 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization was the IMAGE cDNA clone 45276 obtained from Genome Systems (accession number H08387) in the vector Lafmid BA. The probe was nick-translated with biotin-14-dATP and hybridized in situ at a final concentration of 5 ng/μl to metaphases from two normal males. The fluorescence in situ hybridization method was modified from that previously described (21Callen D.F. Baker E. Eyre H.J. Chernos J.E. Bell J.A. Sutherland G.R. Ann. Genet. 1990; 33: 219-221PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomes were stained before analysis with both propidium iodide (as counterstain) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for chromosome identification). Images of metaphase preparations were captured by a cooled CCD camera using the CytoVision Ultra image collection and enhancement system (Applied Imaging Int Ltd.). Saccharomyces cerevisiae BWG1–7A and BBY45 strains were cultured and transformed as described elsewhere (22Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a GST-USP3 fusion expression plasmid, the complete USP3 open reading frame was cloned as a Bam HI/Hin dIII fragment into the yeast pRS316-based (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), single copy shuttle vector pRD56 (gift of Dr. Danesh Moazed) to form pKT7. pKT7 expresses GST-USP3 from the GAL10 promoter. A second plasmid for the expression of GST-USP3 in yeast, pKT8, was constructed by transferring the pGAL10/GST-USP3 insert from pKT7 into the high copy vector YEplac195 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The pRD56 plasmid, which expresses GST alone, was used as a negative control. Preparation of the [35S]-labeled Ub-GST fusion substrate required for in vitro ubiquitin cleavage assays has been described previously (24Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An extract from S. cerevisiae BWG1–7A cells expressing either GST-USP3 (pKT8) or GST alone was prepared using a large scale version of an established method (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

A portion of crude extract was retained as a positive control. The remaining extract was incubated with goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, then 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) added and incubated for a further 30 min. Following extensive washing of the pellet with TN buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 15 μl of TN buffer was added to the Sepharose beads, to which the GST-USP3 protein was still attached. This Sepharose/protein slurry and the crude extract as the positive control, were both used for in vitro ubiquitin cleavage assays. This involved adding 5 μl of [35S]-labeled Ub-GST fusion substrate, incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, electrophoresis on denaturing 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and fluorography as described elsewhere (26Baker R.T.

Plasmids pUb23-P and pUb23-L, which express Ub-P-β-gal and Ub-L-β-gal fusion proteins, respectively, from a hybrid CYC-GAL10 promoter on a yeast high copy plasmid (27Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) were used to express β-gal reporter proteins. Steady state β-gal activity was determined using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as a substrate as described elsewhere (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Degradation of Ub-P-β-gal andl-β-gal proteins in yeast was assayed by pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine, extraction, immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody to β-gal (Promega), electrophoresis in a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and fluorography (26Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BBY45 yeast cultures transformed with the plasmids expressing GST or GST-USP3 (see above) were grown for 48 h in galactosidase + Gro-medium at 30 °C as described previously (30Bartel B. Wunning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), subcultured into SD-Ura/Gal, and grown overnight at 30 °C until they reached A600 = 0.5–1.0. The yeast cultures were serially diluted and plated in triplicate on selective media (SD-uracil, -arginine; Ref. 17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0, 0.5, 1, or 1.5 μg/ml canavanine. Sensitivity to canavanine was determined by expressing the number of colonies present at each concentration of canavanine as a percentage of those present at 0 μg/ml canavanine (control). We identified an EST cDNA clone arising from the UK Human Genome Mapping Project (accession number Z21167, clone name Hsaaadqei) by similarity to the conserved Ubp Cys-box originally identified in the yeast Ubp1p, Ubp2p, and Ubp3p enzymes (14Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the Hsaaadqei cDNA clone, followed by sequence comparison to computer data bases revealed that this clone was a fusion of two clones, a partial Ubp-like clone containing the conserved Cys-box, and a second cDNA clone derived from the human thyroid receptor-interacting protein gene Trip1 (HUMTRIP1). These were joined together by their 5′ ends, producing the ∼1.7-kb Hsaaadqei cDNA clone presumably as an artifact of cDNA library construction. Using the partial Ubp-like portion (∼770-bp, renamed USP3) as a probe for screening a human testis library, several positive clones, including C2 and C3 (clone 2 and clone 3) were obtained. The products of Eco RI digests of these clones were sequenced. Clone C2 produced two Eco RI fragments, C2.1 and C2.2 (Fig.1 A). Clone C3 produced three Eco RI fragments, C3.1, C3.2, and C3.3 (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of the C2.1 and C3.2 fragments confirmed the 770-bp USP3 sequence, including a 64-bp extension 5′ to the Sac I site used to obtain the partial 770-bp Sac I/Eco RI USP3 cDNA clone from Hsaaadqei. The sequences from C2.2 and C3.1 were not similar to USP3 as they presumably represented adjoining Eco RI fragments. The necessary overlaps were found through subsequent detection of the EST clone H08387 by data base searches with the 770-bp USP3 sequence. The known sequence of the USP3 cDNA was thus extended to 2.32-kb, containing both the Cys- and the His-conserved sequence boxes common to all Ubps, an open reading frame (ORF) extending from a start codon at base pair 100 to a stop codon at bp 1,666, and a polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tail downstream of this ORF (Fig. 1 B). The 3′ end of the sequence contains a well defined mammalian polyadenylation signal AATAAA (bp 2,263–2,268), followed by a diffuse GU-rich (GT-rich in cDNA) sequence spanning approximately 28 bp until the actual site of polyadenylation (bp 2,297) (31Birnstiel M.L. Busslinger M. Strub K. Cell. 1985; 41: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 32Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 33Proudfoot N. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). At the 5′ end of the sequence, located 5′ to the start codon, is a GC-rich region, consistent with a 5′-untranslated region. The flanking nucleotide sequence around this initiation codon, containing a G at −3 and +4 (Kozak consensus sequence; Ref. 34Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the ATG at bp 100 being the actual initiation codon. However, as there are no in-frame stop codons upstream of the start codon at bp 100, we cannot rule out a further upstream initiation codon. The present ORF would produce a protein of approximately 59 kDa, and the cDNA is consistent in length with subsequent Northern blot hybridization analysis (see below). Alignment of multiple USP3 ESTs detected through data base searches with the USP3 sequence in Fig. 1 confirmed the latter was the consensus. While this manuscript was under review, several EST clones appeared in the data base that confirm the 5′ end of the cDNA, and two ESTs suggest that the sequence in Fig. 1 B may be preceded by GGCCGAGCGC (accession numbers AI525838, AA371059,AA356126, AA361954). One EST identified through data base searches with the USP3 sequence contained an additional insert of 138 bp. This clone, GenBankTM accession numberH93896, deviates from the USP3 sequence at bp 383, for 138 bp, then matches USP3 sequence identically from bp 384 (Fig.1 A). This raises the possibility that alternative splicing of the USP3 gene occurs. The only other EST clone that spans this region of USP3 (accession number AI525838) does not contain this additional sequence, and the 138-bp sequence was not found to be similar to any other EST clone apart from itself. As this extra sequence introduces stop codons in all three frames, it is most likely a splicing error rather than a normally alternatively spliced exon, as it would produce a severely truncated protein. Sequence comparisons between the amino acid sequence deduced from the ORF of the complete USP3 cDNA clone and other known Ubps did not identify any strong sequence identities or similarities aside from a number of conserved regions, which include the Cys-, His-, Asp- and KRF-boxes (Figs. 1 A and 2). Among the 16 yeast Ubps, USP3 is most similar to Ubp8p (27% identity/40% similarity over the whole 471 residues of the latter; Fig.2). The function of Ubp8p is not known (2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis using a fragment spanning bp 1564 to 2324 of the USP3 cDNA and restriction-enzyme-digested human genomic DNA produced one or at most two hybridizing bands with each enzyme, consistent with a single copy gene (Fig.3; see also Fig. 1). The presence of two bands in the Eco RI digest is presumably due to at least one intron occurring within the region covered by the probe. If any closely related gene to USP3 was present, it must have an identical restriction map, at least with the enzymes used here. Northern hybridization analysis of total RNA did not detect specific bands (data not shown). Hybridization of a multiple human tissue poly(A)+ RNA Northern blot (CLONTECH) with a USP3 probe produced a band representing a 2.45-kb transcript and a more weakly hybridizing band of 5.8 kb (Fig.4 A). The 5.8-kb transcript, and a third very weakly hybridizing 4.0-kb transcript, were more evident on longer exposures (not shown). The 2.45-kb mRNA corresponds to the 2.3-kb cDNA sequence, the difference accounted for by additional poly(A) tail and possibly additional 5′-untranslated region not present in the cDNA. The functional significance of the two major transcripts is not known, but the 5.8-kb transcript may be because of either the presence of a gene highly homologous to USP3, or an alternatively polyadenylated/spliced transcript of USP3 (see “Discussion”). Both the 2.45- and 5.8-kb USP3 transcripts were expressed in all the human tissues examined in approximately the same proportion to each other, including the heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas tissues. Abundance of both transcripts was reduced in brain tissue (relative to the β-actin control), whereas in both pancreas and, to a lesser extent, kidney tissue, increased expression is apparent. An USP3 EST (GenBankTM accession number H08388) had been mapped by radiation hybrid panel analysis to the chromosomal region 15q22–15q22.3, marker interval D15S159-D15S125, 58.8–63.8cM. To confirm this assignment, we obtained the same clone from Genome Systems (IMAGE cDNA clone 45276), which spans bp 600–2,324 of the USP3 cDNA (Fig. 1 A), and used it as probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization. Twenty metaphases from a normal male were examined for fluorescent signal. All of these metaphases showed signal on one or both chromatids of chromosome 15 in the region 15q22–15q22.3; 70% of this signal was at 15q22.3 (data not shown), confirming the RH mapping result, and indicating that no closely related sequences were present elsewhere in the genome. There was a total of 12 nonspecific background dots observed in these 20 metaphases. A similar result was obtained from hybridization of the probe to 15 metaphases from a second normal male (data not shown). The USP3 protein contains conserved sequence motifs found in all active Ubps (Fig. 2). These motifs contain a conserved cysteine residue and two histidine residues, respectively, that are thought to form part of the active site of these thiol proteases (14Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the presence of these conserved regions in USP3 correlates with Ubp activity, we initially attempted to express the USP3 protein in Escherichia coli. Unlike all previous Ubps expressed in E. coli, plasmids expressing USP3 could not be maintained in this bacteria, presumably because of toxicity (data not shown). USP3 was therefore expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because S. cerevisiae has 16 Ubps, it was necessary to isolate the USP3 protein to assay its ubiquitin cleavage ability. USP3 was, therefore, expressed as a GST-USP3 fusion and isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-GST antibody. (Attempts to purify GST-USP3 by glutathione affinity chromatography were unsuccessful (data not shown).) It should be noted that GST-USP3 was expressed in yeast at very low levels, barely detectable by Western immunoblot analysis with an anti-GST antibody (data not shown). The assay was conducted using the GST-USP3·antibody·protein G-Sepharose complex. The USP3 ubiquitin cleavage activity was assayed against an artificial linear35S-labeled ubiquitin GST-fusion protein (Fig.5) (5Gilchrist C.A. Gray D.A. Baker R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32280-32285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Baker R.T. Smith S.A. Marano R. McKee J. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25381-25386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the isolated GST protein alone (control) exhibited no cleavage of the Ub-GST fusion protein, an increase in cleavage of this fusion by the GST-USP3 protein was apparent, although at a very low level. This result is reinforced by evidence for USP3 cleavage of ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusions in vivo (see below). The Ub-X-β-galactosidase (Ub-X-β-gal) fusion proteins are commonly used as model substrates of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in yeast (e.g. see Refs. 26Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We investigated the effect of USP3 expression on ubiquitin-dependent degradation of L-β-gal, an N-end rule substrate, and Ub-P-β-gal, a non-N-end rule substrate, in yeast. Yeast Ubps efficiently cleave Ub-L-β-gal to L-β-gal, an N-end rule substrate, whereas yeast Ubp activity against the ubiquitin-proline bond of Ub-P-β-gal is 20-fold slower than for other amino acids (27Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 38Bachmair A. Varshavsky A.

At present, only the mouse Ubp, Unp, and its human homolog Unph have been found to efficiently cleave the ubiquitin-proline bond (5Gilchrist C.A. Gray D.A. Baker R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32280-32285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In yeast, L-β-gal has a half-life of ∼3 min, whereas the uncleaved Ub-P-β-gal is degraded with a half-life of ∼7 min (27Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1985385885,"The 2 S seed storage protein, sunflower albumin 8 (SFA-8), contains an unusually high proportion of hydrophobic residues including 16 methionines (some of which may form a surface hydrophobic patch) in a disulfide cross-linked, alpha-helical structure. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy show that SFA-8 is highly stable to denaturation by heating or chaotropic agents, the latter resulting in a reversible two-state unfolding transition. The small m(U) (-4.7 M(-1) at 10 degrees C) and DeltaC(p) (-0.95 kcal mol(-1) K(-1)) values indicate that relatively little nonpolar surface of the protein is exposed during unfolding. Commensurate with the unusual distribution of hydrophobic residues, stopped-flow fluorescence data show that the folding pathway of SFA-8 is highly atypical, in that the initial product of the rapid collapse phase of folding is a compact nonnative state (or collection of nonnative states) that must unfold before acquiring the native conformation. The inhibited folding reaction of SFA-8, in which the misfolded state (m(M) = -0.95 M(-1) at 10 degrees C) is more compact than the transition state for folding (m(T) = -2.5 M(-1) at 10 degrees C), provides direct kinetic evidence for the transient misfolding of a protein."

These bonds are found buried in the interface, far removed from solvent, in an environment of low dielectric constant. The high affinity of the interaction has been attributed to the presence of these salt links, and computational analyses of the interaction have focused on these electrostatic interactions (12Novotny J.

We have recently cloned the genes for the Fab fragment of HyHEL-5 into Escherichia coli and expressed and refolded an active Fab, whose interactions with HEL and bobwhite quail lysozyme (BQL) are energetically similar to those of the whole IgG (16Wibbenmeyer J.A. Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of the Fab at E50H were prepared to address the role of the salt links in the interaction with antigen. The interaction of each mutant with HEL and BQL, an avian variant containing an arginine to lysine mutation at position 68, was characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and/or sedimentation equilibrium. In this paper, we report on the energetic contributions of the salt links formed between residue E50H in the Fab and arginine residues 45 and 68 in lysozyme. By mutating a single amino acid residue, the affinity and specificity of the interaction has been dramatically reduced. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the dominantly enthalpic character of bonds formed between charged residues in this highly desolvated interface. Mutagenesis was done using crossover polymerase chain reaction or the M13 method as described by Kunkel et al. (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was performed in a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp System 2400 with Taq DNA polymerase from Promega. Three polymerase chain reaction reactions were necessary for the E50HQ mutant. Two primers (GCTACCACTCC C GGGTAAAAT CTG TCCAATCCA (sense) and TGGATTGGA CAG ATTTTACCCGGGAGTGGTAGC (antisense); both from Bioserve Biotechnologies) were designed to introduce both the mutant nucleotide sequence (shown in bold) and an additional 1-base pair change to introduce a Sma I site (shown underlined). The first set of reactions contained the heavy chain DNA template (pET MH5wt), the sense primer containing the mutation, and a T7 reverse primer (T7 AS), while the companion reaction used the antisense primer containing the complementary sequence along with a T7 forward primer (T7 S). After the polymerase chain reaction was completed (15 cycles of 94 °C/55 °C/74 °C for 1 min each with a final 6-min extension at 72 °C), an aliquot of each purified fragment was added to a final reaction containing only the T7 sense and antisense primers. This “crossover” reaction resulted in a 900-base pair band which was double-digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII to release a 480-base pair fragment to subclone into the double-digested (Bam HI/Hin dIII) and dephosphorylated pET MH5wt vector. Positive clones bearing the primer-encoded Sma I site were identified by the appearance of a band at 1200 base pairs when restricted by Sma I (the vector contains one constitutive Sma I restriction site) and further verified by DNA sequencing on an automated ABI fluorescence sequencer (University of Texas Health Science Center-Houston) prior to protein expression. The E50HD mutant was prepared by the Kunkel method after subcloning a Bam HI/Hin dIII fragment of the heavy chain gene into M13mp19. The primer used, GGA GAT AT C TTACCTGGAAGTGGT, included a silent mutation to insert an Eco RV site, and positive clones were identified by the appearance of a 1.6-kilobase band upon digestion with Eco RV. The mutated fragment was subcloned into the MH5wt vector and the sequence verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were purified as described previously for the wild-type Fab (16Wibbenmeyer J.A. Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-liter cultures of induced cells expressing either the mutant heavy chain or the wild-type light chain were harvested by centrifugation. Cells containing the light chain were lysed by French Press. Inclusion bodies were washed once with buffer (100 mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.9), recentrifuged, and the final pellet resuspended in denaturation buffer (100 mmTris, 6 m guanidine HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.4ml-arginine HCl, pH 7.9) to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Whole cells expressing the heavy chain were dissolved in the denaturation buffer (plus 100 mmdithiothreitol) to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. After stirring at room temperature for 1 h, the solutions were mixed in a 1:2 (light:heavy) molar ratio in the presence of 4 mmglutathione and diluted 10-fold with denaturation buffer. The solutions were exhaustively dialyzed against Tris buffer to remove, through successive changes, the guanidine and l-arginine. The refolded protein was concentrated using tangential flow filtration and purified by Q Sepharose and nickel-charged chelating Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography. The resulting protein was at least 95% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Hen egg lysozyme (2 times crystallized) was purchased from Worthington Biologicals. BQL was prepared from eggs purchased from Stevenson's Game Bird Farm (Riverside, TX) as described by Shick et al. (9Shick K.A. Xavier K.A. Rajpal A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Concentrations of all proteins were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients reported previously (16Wibbenmeyer J.A. Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Aune K.C. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4579-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). ITC was performed in an MCS Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (Microcal) essentially as in previous work (11Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biophys J. 1998; 74: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, the calorimeter was equilibrated overnight at a temperature 5 °C below that intended for the experiment. HyHEL-5 Fab and HEL or BQL were allowed to co-dialyze overnight in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (ITC buffer), pH 8.0. Experiments were also performed in Tris buffer to measure protonation effects. A typical experiment used 1.7 ml of HyHEL-5 Fab (about 20 μm) in the sample cell. The antigen (HEL or BQL, about 300 μm) was titrated into the HyHEL-5 Fab in 16 injections of 10 μl, 300 s apart. An initial injection of 2 μl was made to clear the syringe of any Fab from the sample cell which might have mixed with the lysozyme in the syringe during equilibration. All titrations were performed at least in duplicate. The reported errors are the standard deviations. Data analysis was performed using the software program Origin, and is based on the amount of heat liberated upon association as described (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 179: 131-137Crossref Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). The change in Gibbs free energy upon association, ΔG°, was calculated using the formula,ΔG°=−RTlnKaEquation 1 where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The entropy change of association, ΔS°, was calculated using,ΔG°=ΔH°−TΔS°Equation 2 where ΔH° is the measured enthalpy of association of the reaction at temperature T. The equivalence number, n, Ka, and ΔH° could be determined for all interactions except the E50HQ/BQL and the E50HA associations, which were too weak to be measured by ITC. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an 8-hole An 50 Ti rotor, at several rotor speeds between 15,000 and 25,000 rpm at 17 °C. Two-channel epon centerpieces were filled with an 0.18-ml sample, giving column heights of approximately 5 mm; the compartment adjoining each sample was filled with ITC buffer. Loading concentrations of Fab and lysozyme were varied in a series of experiments, covering a range of concentrations from 0.1 to 44 μm Fab and 2 to 30 μm lysozyme. The buoyant molar mass of lysozymem*Lys = mlys(1 −ν¯ρ) and of the Fab fragments m*Fab =mfab(1 − ν¯ρ) were measured in independent sets of experiments. The absence of non-ideality effects or self-aggregation in the measured sedimentation profiles of the individual species at high concentrations was demonstrated by their constant apparent molar mass in the centrifugal field over the entire range of concentrations used in the experiments. Sedimentation equilibrium was established by random radial distribution of the difference of signals from successive scans. The absorbance distributions were measured at wavelengths of 250, 280, or 305 nm, chosen so that the measured maximum absorbance was smaller than 1.5 OD. The extinction coefficients were based on a molar extinction coefficient of 83,800 OD280 nmm−1 cm−1 for the Fab fragments and 37,700 OD280 nmm−1cm−1 for the lysozyme. The extinction coefficients at 230, 250, and 305 nm were measured in the analytical ultracentrifuge in sedimentation equilibrium experiments with the single species, by taking multiple scans at the respective wavelengths and obtaining the ratio of the absorbance at the reference radius after modeling the radial absorbance distribution (see below). Data analysis employed the global least-squares modeling of between 5 and 13 absorbance profiles αλ(r) taken at different loading concentrations, rotor speeds, and wavelengths. The fitting function for the mixtures was the sum of the expressions for the distributions of individual components in the centrifugal field,aλ(r)=aλ,Lys(r0)expMLys*ω22RT(r2−r02)+aλ,Fab(r0)expMFab*ω22RT(r2−r02)+aλ,Fab(r0)aλ,Lys(r0)ελdexplnKa+(MFab*+MLys*)ω22RT(r2−r02)+δEquation 3 where αλ,Lys(r) and αλ,Fab(r0) denote the absorbance contribution of free Fab fragment or lysozyme, respectively, at a reference radius r0, ω denotes the angular velocity of the rotor, R denotes the gas constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, δ denotes a baseline offset, Ka denotes the association equilibrium constant in molar units, d denotes the optical path length, and ελ denotes a predetermined extinction coefficient,ελ=ελ,Fab×ελ,Lysελ,Fab+ελ,LysEquation 4 which transforms the association constant from absorbance units into molar units. Fitting parameters local to each of the data sets were αλ,Lys(r0), βλ,Fab(r0), and δ; the global fitting parameter was ln(Ka) (20Lewis M.S. Shrager R.I. Kim S.-J. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhäuser, Boston1994Google Scholar). Global fits were performed using the modeling software MLAB (Civilized Software, Inc., Bethesda, MD). Confidence intervals were estimated using projections of the objective function (21Press, W. H., Teukolsky, S. A., Vetterling, W. T., and Flannery, B. P. (1992) Numerical Recipes in C. The Art of Scientific Computing, 2nd Ed., p. 693, (corrected 1994), University Press, CambridgeGoogle Scholar) and F-statistics (22Bevington B.R. Robinson D.K. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. Mc-Graw-Hill, New York1992Google Scholar), taking into account propagated errors resulting from the uncertainty in the determination of the buoyant molar masses of the lysozyme (1.6%) and the Fab fragments (4.2%). Throughout the denaturation and refolding process, each of the mutant proteins behaved identically to the wild-type HyHEL-5 Fab, eluting at the same gradient positions from the Q Sepharose and the metal-chelate columns. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments demonstrated that each of the recombinant proteins was non self-aggregating, all running with the same apparent molar mass at concentrations up to 40 μm. Preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis indicates the E50HQ/HEL crystals are isomorphous with the proteolytic HyHEL-5 Fab·HEL complex (PDB3HFL; 1). 2M. D. Miller, personal communication. A typical isothermal titration calorimetry experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1. TableI lists the values determined at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C in ITC buffer. To correct for any heat of dilution, the integrated areas of the last three injections (after saturation) were averaged and subtracted from the raw data. Heats of dilution were less than 1 kcal mol−1 at Fab concentrations around 20 μm. Experimental equivalence ratios, N, are also shown.Table ITitration calorimetric energetics of interaction between HyHEL-5 Fab mutants and HEL or BQLTemperatureΔH°Ka (× 10−5)ΔG°ΔS°Equivalence ratio°Ckcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1E50HD/HEL association 9.9−12.6 ± 0.101460 ± 298−10.6 ± 0.11−7.36 ± 0.130.87 ± 0.01 16.6−15.4 ± 0.04979 ± 242−10.6 ± 0.11−16.5 ± 0.230.85 ± 0.00 25.0−18.7 ± 0.56562 ± 168−10.5 ± 0.13−27.2 ± 1.440.88 ± 0.00 30.1−20.3 ± 0.10447 ± 156−10.6 ± 0.16−31.9 ± 0.270.90 ± 0.00E50HQ/HEL association 11.0−12.5 ± 0.3417.0 ± 3.0−8.07 ± 0.11−15.7 ± 0.800.93 ± 0.04 18.1−13.5 ± 0.3510.3 ± 6.7−8.01 ± 0.02−18.8 ± 1.140.90 ± 0.03 25.1−16.4 ± 0.449.4 ± 4.3−8.09 ± 0.27−27.8 ± 0.550.89 ± 0.00 30.2−17.2 ± 0.434.4 ± 0.3−7.83 ± 0.04−31.0 ± 1.260.88 ± 0.05E50HD/BQL association 10.4−15.3 ± 0.0135.8 ± 5.0−8.50 ± 0.01−23.9 ± 0.010.95 ± 0.01 16.6−16.9 ± 0.2922.1 ± 2.0−8.37 ± 0.07−29.4 ± 0.760.85 ± 0.03 25.1−17.9 ± 0.429.7 ± 8.0−8.22 ± 0.06−32.2 ± 1.290.88 ± 0.03 30.1−18.1 ± 1.087.4 ± 1.0−8.17 ± 0.04−30.1 ± 0.250.86 ± 0.00 Open table in a new tab The affinity of the wild-type Fab/HEL interaction has been estimated to be about 4 × 1010m–1 at 25 °C (23Lavoie T.B. Drohan W.N. Smith-Gill S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 503-513PubMed Google Scholar). The HEL affinity at 25 °C of the E50HQ mutant was reduced by 40,000-fold, while that of the E50HD was reduced by 400-fold, corresponding to an overall decrease in free energy of 6.4 and 4.0 kcal mol–1, respectively. An E50HA mutant showed no evidence of HEL binding in ITC experiments, indicating a decrease of at least 105-fold in affinity for the single mutation based on a lower ITC detection limit of 1 × 105m–1. The affinity of wild-type Fab association with BQL, the R68K avian mutant, has been measured by ITC to be 6.6 × 106m–1 at 25 °C (16Wibbenmeyer J.A. Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Only the E50HD mutant showed BQL affinity high enough to be measured through ITC; the Ka of the interaction was 1.0 × 106m−1, a 6.6-fold decrease in the affinity, accounting for a ΔΔG° of 1.1 kcal mol–1. The Ka of each mutant/lysozyme interaction studied is lower than that of the wild-type Fab/HEL, and decreases as the temperature increases. Both ΔH° and ΔS° become more negative throughout the temperature range, leading to a relatively constant ΔG° (Fig.2). The ΔCp of each interaction is less negative than that of the wild-type Fab/lysozyme interactions (TableII). Negligible protonation effects (≤0.1 mol mol−1) were observed for all associations.Table IIEnergetic contributions to association of Fab mutants with HEL or BQLLysozymeFabKaΔH°ΔG°TΔS°ΔCpΔΔG°ΔΔH°ΔTΔS°ΔΔCpm−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1 K−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1cal mol−1K−1Wt Fab4 × 1010 2-aFrom Lavoie et al.

Open table in a new tab Values were obtained from ITC at 25 °C or sedimentation equilibrium at 17 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sedimentation equilibrium experiments resulted in a Ka of 1.16 × 105m−1 (error limits 1.3 × 104 to 1.6 × 105) for the E50HQ/BQL interaction at 17 °C, a 55-fold decrease in the affinity, corresponding to a ΔΔG° of 2.7 kcal mol–1 from the wild-type interaction. To further understand the energetic changes observed upon mutating position 50H in the HyHEL-5 Fab, double-mutant cycles were constructed (Fig.3). Each cycle was based on the substitution at position 50H of the Fab, and the R68K substitution (and other mutations known to exert much smaller effects) in BQL. In each of the interactions examined, the sums of ΔΔG° of the single-mutant interactions were different from those obtained for the double-mutant interactions, indicating coupling between the mutations (Table III). Subtracting the sum of the free energy changes of the two single mutations from that of the double-mutant gave a coupling energy of +2.9 kcal mol−1 for the wt/HEL → E50HD/BQL pathway and +3.7 kcal mol−1 for the wt/HEL → E50HQ/BQL pathway (Fig. 3).Table IIICalculation of coupling energy from double-mutant cycleInteractionE50HDE50HQwt Fab/HEL → wt Fab/BQL5.25.2wt Fab/HEL → mutant Fab/HEL4.06.4Total ΔΔG°association (kcal mol−1)9.211.6wt Fab/HEL → mutant Fab/BQL6.37.9Coupling energy (kcal mol−1)2.93.7 Open table in a new tab In the HyHEL-5/lysozyme interaction, glutamic acid residues at heavy chain positions 50 in CDR 1 and 35 in CDR 2, have long been predicted to form the core of the functional combining site. In crystal structures, E50H is juxtaposed with and believed to form salt links to arginines at positions 45 and 68 in the HEL molecule. In BQL, which bears an arginine to lysine mutation at position 68, a new water molecule appears in the interface at the position formerly occupied by the terminal nitrogens of Arg68. These residues are buried in the center of the interface, far removed from solvent, in an environment of low dielectric constant. To study the role of the glutamate at position 50 in these interactions, three mutations, an alanine, aspartate, and glutamine, were introduced into the Fab and the association with HEL and BQL measured by either ITC or sedimentation equilibrium. Substitution of Ala, which both neutralizes the charge and decreases the length of the side chain, produced the greatest affinity changes. When the charge was maintained but the length of the side chain decreased, in the E50HD mutant, binding was decreased by 400-fold (HEL) and 6.6-fold (BQL). The E50HQ maintained the side chain length, but neutralized the charge of the side chain decreasing the binding by 40,000-fold (HEL) and 55-fold (BQL), reducing the free energy of association by more than 6 kcal mol−1in the HEL interaction and 2.7 kcal mol−1 in the BQL interaction. Mutational studies of interacting surfaces in other proteins have demonstrated that only a small number of residues play a dominant role in binding (24Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). For example, in the interaction of human growth hormone with its receptor, 11 residues constitute the functional hormone epitope; mutation of either of two tryptophans to alanine, reduces association energy by over 4.5 kcal mol−1. The mutational ΔΔG° of 6.4 kcal mol−1 for E50HQ/HEL and 4.0 kcal mol−1 for E50HD/HEL are generally consistent with those predicted by Slagle et al. (14Slagle S.P. Kozack R.E. Subramaniam S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1994; 12: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) who calculated a ΔΔGelectrostatic of +11 kcal mol−1 for E50HQ and +2.5 kcal mol−1 for E50HD. Most importantly, in both the model and the experimental results, each mutation yields a positive ΔΔG° and the effect of the E50HQ mutation is larger. For both mutants studied, the entropic contribution to HEL association was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type Fab (−8.3 kcal mol−1) at 25 °C (Table II). ΔH°, in contrast, decreased by an average of 5.3 kcal mol−1 and by up to 6.5 kcal mol−1 from that of the wild-type Fab. Consequently, the affinity decrease for each mutant results almost entirely from loss of favorable enthalpic interactions. For each mutant studied, the loss of enthalpic contribution to HEL association is among the highest reported, which may be due to the favorable desolvated local environment in which the electrostatic interaction occurs. Ross and Subramanian (27Ross P.D. Subramanian S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3096-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4667) Google Scholar) have suggested that salt links may contribute to enthalpy changes when formed in an environment of low dielectric constant. Other studies have associated salt bridge formation in desolvated environment with enthalpic contributions (9Shick K.A. Xavier K.A. Rajpal A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,24Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Entropic contributions appear to play a greater role when electrostatic bonds are formed in solvated environments, where their contributions to binding affinity are lower (e.g. the anti-lysozyme antibody HyHEL-10) (27Ross P.D. Subramanian S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3096-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (4667) Google Scholar). In each of the mutant Fab/lysozyme interactions examined, enthalpy-entropy compensation exists (Table I). As the temperature increases, the enthalpy change of each interaction becomes more favorable (Fig. 2), while the entropy change becomes less favorable and affinity is relatively constant. This behavior (and the observed negative values of ΔCp) has been suggested to be an indicator of hydrophobic interactions. The unfavorable entropy change upon association may arise from loss of protein translational, rotational, and conformational degrees of freedom on complex formation, part of which arises from the stabilization of the mobile loop found in the HyHEL-5 epitope. Crystal structures reveal that, upon complex formation, this epitope is immobilized (1Cohen G.H. Davies D. Sheriff S. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Amide exchange studies show that residues in HEL far removed from the interface are also perturbed upon binding, possibly altering the dynamics of the molecule and adding to an unfavorable entropy (29Benjamin D.C. Williams Jr., D.C. Smith-Gill S.J. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9539Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ordering of water molecules in and around the interface will decrease entropy, while likely contributing positively to the enthalpy, while burial of hydrophobic residues will increase the solvent entropy through water liberation. The ΔCp value calculated for each mutant complex was less negative than that obtained for the wild-type HyHEL-5 Fab (Table II). For the E50HD/BQL interaction, ΔCp is only approximately one-half of that of the wild-type Fab/BQL interaction. A negative ΔCp has been interpreted as an indication of hydrophobic interactions; burial of interfacial surface area (31Murphy K.P. Freire E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 313-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or the presence of waters buried in the interface (32Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Greene M.I. Tello D. Dall'Acqua W. Souchon H.

J. 1998; 73: 2116-2125Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have been suggested to be contributors. While the large changes in ΔCp produced by relatively conservative mutations in this study argue against the former (Table II), water uptake values estimated using the method of Spolar and Record (36Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) argue in favor of the latter. The number of water molecules taken up by each mutant complex was estimated to be less from that of the wild-type interaction (wt Fab/HEL, 17; E50HD/HEL, 16; E50HQ/HEL, 10; wt Fab/BQL, 10; E50HD/BQL, 4). Along with the large changes in affinity and enthalpy seen in the mutant interactions, this result is consistent with a less well ordered interface, leading to a lower water capture contribution to ΔCp. Structural analysis of mutant complexes now underway may address these issues. Each mutation reduces the specificity of the interactions, increasing cross-reactivity. The E50HD mutation decreased the affinity of HyHEL-5 interaction with HEL by 400-fold; with BQL, less than 10-fold. The E50HQ mutation decreased the affinity of the interaction with HEL by 40,000-fold; with BQL, 55-fold. Each mutation reduces the affinity of the Fab for HEL much more than for BQL, reducing the specificity and increasing the cross-reactivity of the interaction by 61- or 727-fold, respectively. These data point to the importance of the electrostatic interactions and the shape complementarity seen in the association of HyHEL-5 Fab with HEL. The side chains of the amino acid mutations in the Fab may pack differently leading to new bonding patterns or to the introduction of water molecules into newly formed cavities in the interface. Structural analysis may assist in understanding these data; very subtle structural changes in other complexes have been shown to produce affinity changes from 10-fold (37Tulip W.R. Harley V.R. Webster R.G. Novotny J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7986-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to 1000-fold (8Chacko S. Silverton E.W. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Shick K.A. Xavier K.A. Willson R.C. Jeffrey P.D. Chang C.Y. Sheriff S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 26: 55-65Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Double-mutant cycles were constructed to test the expectation that the E50H mutations and the R68K substitution in BQL perturb the same critical interactions (Table III; Fig. 3). In each of the interactions examined, the sum of the ΔΔG° of the single mutations differed from ΔΔG° for the double mutation. The effect of each double mutation is well less than the sum of the effects of individual mutations, confirming that the same interactions are perturbed (26Goldman E.R. Dall'Acqua W. Braden B.C. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The calculated coupling energies in these interactions are comparable to the 3.5 to 4.3 kcal mol−1 attributed to buried salt links in the folding pathway of barnase (38Tissot A.C. Vuilleumier S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6786-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in an anti-HIV Fv/peptide interaction (25Faiman G.A. Levy R. Anglister J. Horovitz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13829-13833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By mutating a single residue in the HyHEL-5 Fab involved in a buried salt bridge, the affinity of the interaction with HEL was decreased up to 100,000-fold, corresponding to a decrease in ΔG° of over 8 kcal mol−1. Our results verify the predicted importance of E50H in the interaction; we find this to be a “hot spot” in the functional epitope. The energy changes can be assigned almost entirely to enthalpic contributions and are among the highest reported ΔΔH°s for a single mutation. This result is in contrast to those reported for the deletion of salt bridges in a more heavily solvated environment in the interface between another anti-lysozyme antibody, HyHEL-10, and HEL (28Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32612-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mutations studied in this work also greatly reduce the specificity of the antibody for HEL. Crystallographic analyses presently underway should aid in further understanding the overall association process."
