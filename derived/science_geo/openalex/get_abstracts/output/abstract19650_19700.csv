https://openalex.org/W2072478579,"Tumor cell lines derived from malignant schwannomas removed from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have been examined for the level of expression of NF1 protein. All three NF1 lines examined expressed lower levels of NF1 protein than control cells, and the level in one line was barely detectable. The tumor lines expressed normal levels of p120GAP and p21ras. Although the p21ras proteins isolated from the tumor cells had normal (nonmutant) biochemical properties in vitro, they displayed elevated levels of bound GTP in vivo. The level of total cellular GAP-like activity was reduced in extracts from the tumor line that expresses very little NF1 protein. Introduction of the catalytic region of GAP into this line resulted in morphological reversion and lower in vivo GTP binding by endogenous p21ras. These data implicate NF1 protein as a tumor suppressor gene product that negatively regulates p21ras and define a ""positive"" growth role for ras activity in NF1 malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2090995659,"The mechanism of action of the anticancer compound cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) involves covalent binding to DNA. In an effort to understand the tumor-specific cytotoxicity of such DNA damage, the interactions of these lesions with cellular proteins have been studied. One such protein has been identified as the high-mobility group protein HMG1. Recombinant rat HMG1 binds specifically (dissociation constant 3.7 +/- 2.0 x 10(-7) molar) to DNA containing cisplatin d(GpG) or d(ApG) intrastrand cross-links, which unwind and bend DNA in a specific manner, but not to DNA modified by therapeutically inactive platinum analogs. These results suggest how HMG1 might bind to altered DNA structures and may be helpful in designing new antitumor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2032345748,"Differential adhesion between embryonic cells has been proposed to be mediated by a family of closely related glycoproteins called the cadherins. The cadherins mediate adhesion in part through an interaction between the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and intracellular proteins, called the catenins. To determine whether these interactions could regulate cadherin function in embryos, a form of N-cadherin was generated that lacks an extracellular domain. Expression of this mutant in Xenopus embryos causes a dramatic inhibition of cell adhesion. Analysis of the mutant phenotype shows that at least two regions of the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain can inhibit adhesion and that the mutant cadherin can inhibit catenin binding to E-cadherin. These results suggest that cadherin-mediated adhesion can be regulated by cytoplasmic interactions and that this regulation may contribute to morphogenesis when emerging tissues coexpress several cadherin types."
https://openalex.org/W1601845527,"Glucocorticoids block the induced secretion of prostaglandins in a variety of biological contexts. We have identified a primary response gene, TIS10, which encodes a mitogen-inducible prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase in Swiss 3T3 cells. TIS10 is distinct from prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase. (EC 1.14.99.1), previously cloned from mouse, man, and sheep. Dexamethasone blocks prostaglandin E2 synthesis by 3T3 cells in response to tetradecanoylphorbol acetate. Dexamethasone also blocks both phorbol ester- and forskolin-induced TIS10 mRNA accumulation. In contrast, phorbol esters, forskolin, and dexamethasone have little or no effect on the levels of prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase mRNA in 3T3 cells. Moreover, dexamethasone does not inhibit induction of TIS8/egr-1, another primary response gene. Inhibition of the synthesis of TIS10 prostaglandin synthase/cyclooxygenase may be a principal mechanism by which glucocorticoids block prostaglandin synthesis and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2020200846,"Following receptor activation in Xenopus oocytes, spiral waves of intracellular Ca2+ release were observed. We have identified key molecular elements in the pathway that give rise to Ca2+ excitability. The patterns of Ca2+ release produced by GTP-gamma-S and by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) are indistinguishable from receptor-induced Ca2+ patterns. The regenerative Ca2+ activity is critically dependent on the presence of IP3 and on the concentration of intracellular Ca2+, but is independent of extracellular Ca2+. Broad regions of the intracellular milieu can be synchronously excited to initiate Ca2+ waves and produce pulsating foci of Ca2+ release. By testing the temperature dependence of wavefront propagation, we provide evidence for an underlying process limited by diffusion, consistent with the elementary theory of excitable media. We propose a model for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in which wave propagation is controlled by IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores, but is modulated by the cytoplasmic concentration and diffusion of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1980669547,"Secretory proteins are segregated from cytosolic proteins by their translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A modified secretory protein trapped during translocation across the ER membrane can be crosslinked to two previously identified proteins, Sec61p and BiP (Kar2p). The dependence of this cross-linking upon proteins and small molecules was examined. Mutations in SEC62 and SEC63 decrease the ability of Sec61p to be cross-linked to the secretory polypeptide trapped in translocation. ATP is also required for interaction of Sec61p with the secretory protein. Three kar2 alleles display defective translocation in vitro. Two of these alleles also decrease the ability of Sec61p to be cross-linked to the secretory protein. The third allele, while exhibiting a severe translocation defect, does not affect the interaction of Sec61p with the secretory protein. These results suggest that Sec61p is directly involved in translocation and that BiP acts at two stages of the translocation cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2076118871,"The neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene product, neurofibromin, contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain, or NF1 GRD, that is able to down-regulate p21ras by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase. Since p21ras.GTP is a major regulator of growth and differentiation, mutant neurofibromins resulting from somatic mutations in the NF1 gene might interfere with ras signaling pathways and contribute to the development of tumors. We describe an amino acid substitution in the NF1 GRD, altering Lys-1423, that has occurred in three tumor types: colon adenocarcinoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic astrocytoma, and in one family with neurofibromatosis 1. The GAP activity of the mutant NF1 GRD is 200- to 400-fold lower than that of wild type, whereas binding affinity is unaffected. Thus, germline mutations in NF1 that cause neurofibromatosis 1 can also occur in somatic cells and contribute to the development of sporadic tumors, including tumors not associated with neurofibromatosis 1."
https://openalex.org/W1969554101,"Backbone-engineered HIV-1 protease was prepared by a total chemical synthesis approach that combines the act of joining two peptides with the generation of an analog structure. Unprotected synthetic peptide segments corresponding to the two halves of the HIV-1 protease monomer polypeptide chain were joined cleanly and in high yield through unique mutually reactive functional groups, one on each segment. Ligation was performed in 6 molar guanidine hydrochloride, thus circumventing limited solubility of protected peptide segments, the principal problem of the classical approach to the chemical synthesis of proteins. The resulting fully active HIV-1 protease analog contained a thioester replacement for the natural peptide bond between Gly51-Gly52 in each of the two active site flaps, a region known to be highly sensitive to mutational changes of amino acid side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1980129974,"3T3-L1 adipoblasts that express large amounts of c-Myc cannot terminally differentiate, raising the possibility that Myc inhibits the expression of genes that promote adipogenesis. The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα) is induced during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis when cells commit to the differentiation pathway. Transfection of 3T3-L1 adipoblasts with the gene that encodes C/EBPα caused overt expression of the adipocyte morphology. Expression of Myc prohibited the normal induction of C/EBPα and prevented adipogenesis. Enforced expression of C/EBPα overcame the Myc-induced block to differentiation. These results provide a molecular basis for the regulation of adipogenesis and implicate Myc and C/EBPα as pivotal controlling elements."
https://openalex.org/W2121040242,"Most of the thoracic and abdominal segments of Drosophila are specified early in embryogenesis by the overlapping activities of the hunchback (hb), Krüppel, knirps, and giant gap genes. The orderly expression of these genes depends on two maternal determinants: bicoid, which activates hb transcription anteriorly, and nanos, which blocks translation of hb transcripts posteriorly. Here we provide evidence that the resulting gradient of hb protein dictates where the Krüppel, knirps, and giant genes are expressed by providing a series of concentration thresholds that regulate each gene independently. Thus, hb protein functions as a classical morphogen, triggering several distinct responses as a function of its graded distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2008291157,"We present evidence that the cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF), originally purified from cardiac and skeletal muscle cell-conditioned medium and found to be identical to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), promotes survival of embryonic day 14 rat motoneurons in vitro. These neurons were retrogradely labeled with the fluorescent tracer Dil and enriched on a density gradient or purified to homogeneity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Subnanomolar concentrations of CDF/LIF supported the survival of 85% of the motoneurons that would have died between days 1 and 4 of culture. The enhanced survival was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity per culture. CDF/LIF also increased ChAT activity in dorsal spinal cord cultures, but had no detectable effect on ChAT levels in septal or striatal neuronal cultures. For comparison, other neurotrophic molecules were tested on motoneuron cultures. Ciliary neurotrophic factor had effects on motoneuron survival similar to those of CDF/LIF, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor was somewhat less effective. Nerve growth factor had no effect on the survival of rat motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1668286863,"Selenium compounds like selenite (SeO3(2-) may form a covalent adduct with glutathione (GSH) in the form of selenodiglutathione (GS-Se-SG), which is assumed to be important in the metabolism of selenium. We have isolated GS-Se-SG and studied its reactions with NADPH and thioredoxin reductase from calf thymus or with thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin from Escherichia coli. Incubation of 0.1 microM calf thymus thioredoxin reductase or 0.1 microM thioredoxin reductase and 1 microM thioredoxin from E. coli with 5, 10, or 20 microM GS-Se-SG resulted in a fast initial reaction, followed by a large and continued oxidation of NADPH. However, anaerobic incubation of 0.1 microM calf thymus thioredoxin reductase and 20 microM GS-Se-SG resulted only in oxidation of a stoichiometric amount of NADPH; admission of oxygen started continuous NADPH oxidation. Contrary to the mammalian enzyme, GS-Se-SG was not a substrate for thioredoxin reductase from E. coli. The rate of the oxygen-dependent reaction between calf thymus thioredoxin reductase and GS-Se-SG was increased 2-fold in the presence of 4 mM GSH, indicating that HSe- was the reactive intermediate. Glutathione reductase from rat liver reduced GS-Se-SG with a very slow continued oxidation of NADPH, and the presence of the enzyme did not affect the oxygen-dependent nonstoichiometric oxidation of NADPH by GS-Se-SG and thioredoxin reductase. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed GS-Se-SG to be a very efficient oxidant of reduced thioredoxin from E. coli and kinetically superior to insulin disulfides. Thioredoxin-dependent reduction of CDP to dCDP by ribonucleotide reductase was effectively inhibited by GS-Se-SG."
https://openalex.org/W2058022253,"The proto-oncogene c-abl encodes a protein tyrosine kinase that is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The large carboxyl-terminal segment of c-Abl was found to contain a DNA-binding domain that was necessary for the association of c-Abl with chromatin. The DNA-binding activity of c-Abl was lost during mitosis when the carboxyl-terminal segment became phosphorylated. In vitro phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain by cdc2 kinase abolished DNA binding. Homozygous mutant mice expressing a c-Abl tyrosine kinase without the DNA-binding domain have been reported to die of multiple defects at birth. Thus, binding of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase to DNA may be essential to its biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2060723832,"Positive control of the sex-specific alternative splicing of doublesex (dsx) precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in Drosophila melanogaster involves the activation of a female-specific 3' splice site by the products of the transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) genes. The mechanisms of this process were investigated in an in vitro system in which the female-specific 3' splice site could be activated by recombinant Tra or Tra-2 (or both). An exon sequence essential for regulation in vivo was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for activation in vitro. Nuclear proteins in addition to Tra and Tra-2 were found to bind specifically to this exon sequence. Therefore, Tra and Tra-2 may act by promoting the assembly of a multiprotein complex on the exon sequence. This complex may facilitate recognition of the adjacent 3' splice site by the splicing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2050085937,Smaller chromosomes have higher rates of meiotic reciprocal recombination (centimorgans per kilobase pair) than larger chromosomes. This report demonstrates that decreasing the size of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomal DNA molecules increases rates of meiotic recombination and increasing chromosome size decreases recombination rates. These results indicate that chromosome size directly affects meiotic reciprocal recombination.
https://openalex.org/W2078365866,"We show by photocross-linking that nascent secretory proteins, during their passage through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of S. cerevisiae, are in physical contact with Sec61p and Sec62p, two genetically identified membrane proteins that are essential for in vivo translocation. Sec61p seems to be in continuous contact, whereas Sec62p is involved only transiently. Translocation comprises both ATP-dependent and -independent phases of interaction with the Sec proteins. The results suggest a direct role of the Sec proteins in translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1531979776,"Animals subjected to immunostimulatory conditions exhibit reduced tissue levels of total cytochrome P450 and P450-dependent drug metabolism. We have investigated the possibility that depressed levels of two carcinogen-metabolizing cytochrome P450s may be due to decreased levels of the mRNAs encoding these enzymes by studying the effect of monocyte-derived cytokines on the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in isolated rat hepatocytes. Medium conditioned by activated human peripheral blood monocytes or by the U937 monocyte cell line suppressed the induction of both mRNAs by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, whereas beta-fibrinogen mRNA levels increased 30-40-fold. CYP1A2 mRNA induction was maximally inhibited more than CYP1A1 mRNA (approximately 95 and 65%, respectively), and lower concentrations of conditioned medium suppressed CYP1A2 mRNA induction (half-maximal at 1.9 and 3.1%, respectively). Low concentrations of recombinant interleukin-1 suppressed the inducer-dependent accumulation of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in a dose-dependent fashion (half-maximal at 2 and 0.5 units/ml, respectively), while two other monocyte-derived cytokines, interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-beta, did not. Run-on transcription analysis demonstrated that conditioned medium and interleukin-1 rapidly suppressed the transcription rate of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in inducer-treated hepatocytes. The close correspondence between the reductions in CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 transcription rates and mRNA levels suggest that conditioned medium and interleukin-1 suppress the induction of these mRNAs principally through a transcriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2000002736,"Max is a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper protein capable of forming sequence-specific DNA binding complexes with Myc proteins. An alternatively spliced messenger RNA has been identified that encodes a form of Max truncated at the COOH-terminus. This delta Max protein retained the ability to bind to the CACGTG motif in a complex with c-Myc but lacks the nuclear localization signal and the putative regulatory domain of Max. When tested in a myc-ras cotransformation assay in rat embryo fibroblasts, Max suppressed, whereas delta Max enhanced, transformation. Thus, the max gene may encode both a negative and a positive regulator of c-Myc function."
https://openalex.org/W2008542517,"Chlamydial cell types are adapted for either extracellular survival or intracellular growth. In the transcriptionally inert elementary bodies, the chromosome is densely compacted; in metabolically active reticulate bodies, the chromatin is loosely organized. Condensation of the chlamydial nucleoid occurs concomitant with expression of proteins homologous to eukaryotic histone H1. When the Chlamydia trachomatis 18-kilodalton histone homolog Hc1 is expressed in Escherichia coli, a condensed nucleoid structure similar to that of chlamydiae is observed with both light and electron microscopy. These results support a role for Hc1 in condensation of the chlamydial nucleoid."
https://openalex.org/W2151534687,"Microtubules were assembled from pure tubulin with axonemal pieces serving as nuclei. They were observed by video-enhanced differential-interference-contrast light microscopy. Their lengths were measured from videotaped images at frequent intervals (0.13-5 s). Error analysis indicated that the uncertainty in measuring a single length was quite small; the 95% confidence limit approximated the microscope's limit of resolution. Rates of growth and shortening of the dynamically unstable microtubules, obtained from the length-versus-time data, were found to be highly variable. The variability was far too large to be attributed to known random error of measurement and must be a property of the microtubules. Further experiments were aimed at finding its structural cause. The variability of rates exhibited by a single microtubule was as great as that of the whole population. The locations at which a growing microtubule changed its rate of growth were not related to the locations at which rates changed during its subsequent shortening. The cause of the variability must therefore be both small relative to the size of a microtubule and transient relative to its lifetime. Fluctuations in configuration of the microtubule's cap appear to be the likeliest source."
https://openalex.org/W2145442226,"The recently discovered organic cofactor of bovine serum amine oxidase, topa quinone, is an uncommon amino acid residue in the polypeptide backbone (Janes, S. M., Mu, D., Wemmer, D., Smith, A. J., Kaur, S., Maltby, D., Burlingame, A. L., and Klinman, J. P. (1990) Science 248, 981-987). The amine oxidase gene from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha has been cloned and sequenced (Bruinenberg, P. G., Evers, M., Waterham, H. R., Kuipers, J., Arnberg, A. C., and Geert, A. B. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1008, 157-167). In order to understand the incorporation of topa quinone in eukaryotes, we have isolated yeast amine oxidase from H. polymorpha. Following protocols established with bovine serum amine oxidase, yeast amine oxidase was derivatized with [14C]phenylhydrazine, followed by thermolytic digestion and isolation of a dominant radiolabeled peptide by high pressure liquid chromatography. Comparison of resonance Raman spectra for this peptide to spectra of a model compound demonstrates that topa quinone is the cofactor. By alignment of a DNA-derived yeast amine oxidase sequence with the topa quinone-containing peptide sequence, it is found that the tyrosine codon, UAC, corresponds to topa quinone in the mature protein. In a similar manner, alignment of a tryptic peptide from bovine serum amine oxidase implicates tyrosine as the precursor to topa quinone in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1578843331,"We have recently demonstrated that the Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg sequence is a signal for precursor cleavage catalyzed by furin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast precursor-processing endoprotease Kex2, within the constitutive secretory pathway. In this study, we further examined sequence requirements for the constitutive precursor cleavage by expression of various prorenin mutants with amino acid substitutions around the native Lys-Arg cleavage site in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results delineate the following sequence rules that govern the constitutive precursor cleavage. (a) A basic residue (Lys or Arg) at the 4th (position -4) or 6th (position -6) residue upstream of the cleavage site besides basic residues at positions -1 and -2 is necessary. (b) At position -2, a Lys residue is more preferable than Arg. (c) At position -4, an Arg residue is more preferable than Lys. (d) At position 1, a hydrophobic aliphatic amino acid is not suitable."
https://openalex.org/W1569668268,"A yeast gene for a methionine aminopeptidase, one of the central enzymes in protein synthesis, was cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequence encodes a precursor protein containing 387 amino acid residues. The mature protein, whose NH2-terminal sequence was confirmed by Edman degradation, consists of 377 amino acids. The function of the 10-residue sequence at the NH2 terminus, containing 1 serine and 6 threonine residues, remains to be established. In contrast to the structure of the prokaryotic enzyme, the yeast methionine aminopeptidase consists of two functional domains: a unique NH2-terminal domain containing two motifs resembling zinc fingers, which may allow the protein to interact with ribosomes, and a catalytic COOH-terminal domain resembling other prokaryotic methionine aminopeptidases. Furthermore, unlike the case for the prokaryotic gene, the deletion of the yeast MAP1 gene is not lethal, suggesting for the first time that alternative NH2-terminal processing pathway(s) exist for cleaving methionine from nascent polypeptide chains in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1604671970,"Stimuli which act through the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) often increase free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a localized subcellular area. Actively propagated Ca2+ waves then extend this focal Ca2+ signal to other parts of the cell. To understand how cells may control the spatial distribution of Ca2+, we investigated the mechanism by which Ca2+ waves propagate through the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. Heparin, which inhibits the binding of InsP3 to its receptor, prevented the migration of Ca2+ waves induced by a poorly metabolized InsP3 (InsP3S3). This result suggested that Ca2+ waves move through the cell via the serial release of Ca2+ from InsP3-sensitive stores. Interventions which caused a localized increase in [Ca2+]i without elevations of InsP3 did not trigger Ca2+ waves. In the presence of a Ins-P3S3, however, endogenously released or locally injected Ca2+ elicited Ca2+ waves. A cooperative interaction between Ca2+ and InsP3 may therefore be responsible for the propagation of Ca2+ waves."
https://openalex.org/W1560642806,"The outer surface of the moderate halophilic archaebacterium Haloferax volcanii (formerly named Halobacterium volcanii) is covered with a hexagonally packed surface (S) layer glycoprotein. The polypeptide (794 amino acid residues) contains 7 N-glycosylation sites. Four of these sites were isolated as glycopeptides and the structure of one of the corresponding saccharides was determined. Oligosaccharides consisting of beta-1,4-linked glucose residues are attached to the protein via the linkage unit asparaginyl-glucose. In the related glycoprotein from the extreme halophile Halobacterium halobium, the glucose residues are replaced by sulfated glucuronic acid residues, causing a drastic increase in surface charge density. This is discussed in terms of a recent model explaining the stability of halophilic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2091431412,"A cell-free system has been developed that executes centriole duplication. Surf clam (Spisula solidissima) oocytes, arrested at late prophase of meiosis I, do not contain centrioles, centrosomes, or asters. Serial section high-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) of asters and spindles isolated from potassium chloride-activated oocytes indicates that within 4 minutes oocytes assemble a single centriole that is duplicated by 15 minutes when assembly of the first meiotic spindle is complete. A mixture of lysates from unactivated oocytes and potassium chloride-activated oocytes induces centriole formation and duplication. Astral microtubule content in these lysate mixtures increases with time."
https://openalex.org/W2013251855,"Several molecules involved in the development of the nervous system have specific binding sites for the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of proteoglycans. Exogenous GAGs should bind to these sites, competitively inhibit interactions with proteoglycans, and perturb development. GAGs added to the culture medium perturb the in situ growth of pioneer axons in cultured cockroach embryos by producing axon defasciculation and growth in incorrect directions. The specificity of this phenomenon is evident from the following observations: Of all the GAGs tested only heparin and heparan sulfate produced perturbation; of the six axon tracts being pioneered during the culture period only two of them are perturbed by the GAGs; and similar perturbations are produced when embryos are cultured in the presence of heparinase II and heparitinase."
https://openalex.org/W1999261530,"Transcription factor NF-κB comprises two proteins, p50 and p65, that have sequence similarity to the v-rel oncogene. In primary hematopoietic cell populations an alternatively spliced form of NF-κB p65 mRNA was observed that encoded a protein designated p65Δ. Expression of the p65Δ cDNA in Rat-1 fibroblasts resulted in focus formation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and tumor formation in athymic nude mice, effects not obtained with expression of p65 or a p65Δ mutant that contains a disruption within the transcriptional activation domain. Thus, p65Δ, which associated weakly and interfered with DNA binding by p65, may sequester an essential limiting regulatory factor or factors required for NF-κB function."
https://openalex.org/W1583495578,"In a patch-clamp study, we found antimycin A in low (1-2) microM concentrations decreased the open probability of the multiple conductance channel activity and the approximately 110 picosiemens channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane (for a review of mitochondrial channels see Kinnally, K. W., Antonenko, Yu. N., and Zorov, D. B. (1992) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 24, 99-110). Higher antimycin A concentrations (e.g. 10 microM) facilitated multiple conductance channel opening. These effects were reversible, and the binding site(s) are probably distinct from those responsible for the inhibition of the electron transport chain, since the latter are virtually irreversible. A model with two closed and two open states is presented for the approximately 110-picosiemens activity."
https://openalex.org/W1492063511,"The three main isoforms of the 19-kDa lipid body proteins (oleosin) have been purified to homogeneity from embryos of rapeseed. The secondary structures of these proteins as derived from circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were compared with the secondary structures predicted from the primary sequences. The salient feature of the primary sequence of all oleosins is its division into three defined structural domains: a central hydrophobic domain flanked on either side by relatively hydrophilic domains, respectively. Using a variety of predictive methods based on primary amino acid sequence data, the oleosins exhibited a high probability of beta-strand structure in the 70-residue central hydrophobic domain, with relatively little alpha-helical content. Secondary structure data derived from CD and FTIR were consistent with the predictions from primary sequence, showing that the oleosins contained about 45% beta-strand and 13% alpha-helical structure. Under high salt conditions, a 40-kDa polypeptide was obtained from purified preparations of the 19-kDa oleosins. The 40-kDa polypeptide has a very similar secondary structure, as analyzed by CD and FTIR, to that of the 19-kDa oleosins. This polypeptide is therefore probably a dimer of the 19-kDa oleosins that is formed in high salt environments. A model of the general structure of oleosins is proposed whereby the central hydrophobic domain of the protein with a predominantly beta-strand structure is embedded into the non-aqueous phase of lipid-bodies. This hydrophobic region is flanked by putative alpha-helical structures in the polar N- and C-terminal domains which are probably oriented at the lipid-water interface."
https://openalex.org/W1593417211,"The cellular and biochemical events which transduce chemical insults into signals for increased expression of the stress-responsive gene gadd 153 were investigated using nephrotoxic cysteine conjugates. In LLC-PK1 cells, cysteine conjugate toxicity is initiated by covalent binding, but depletion of cellular thiols, an increase in cytosolic free calcium, and lipid peroxidation couple the binding to cell death (Chen, Q., Jones, T. W., Brown, P. C., and Stevens, J. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21603-21611; Chen, Q., Jones, T. W., and Stevens, J. L. (1991) Toxicologist 11, 101, 1991). Three different toxic cysteine conjugates induced gadd 153 mRNA. With S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), the induction was both concentration and time-dependent. Preventing the metabolism of DCVC and covalent binding of DCVC-derived reactive metabolites to cellular macromolecules with the beta-lyase inhibitor (aminooxy)acetic acid blocked the induction. However, buffering free calcium with a cell permeable calcium chelator or blocking lipid peroxidation with an antioxidant did not affect the induction of gadd 153 mRNA by DCVC even though these treatments inhibit toxicity. These data suggest that covalent binding of reactive metabolites to cellular macromolecules may serve as a primary signal for the induction of gadd 153 mRNA by nephrotoxic cysteine conjugates. Interestingly, the sulfhydryl agent dithiothreitol, which was nontoxic and prevented the toxicity of DCVC, also induced an increase in gadd 153 mRNA. When both dithiothreitol and DCVC were added to cells, there were no inhibitory or additive effects on expression. Therefore, cellular thiol-disulfide status may also play a role in gadd 153 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1999226534,"An antibody generated against a neutral phosphonate diester transition-state analog was found to catalyze the aminoacylation of the 3'-hydroxyl group of thymidine with an alanyl ester. A comparison of the apparent second-order rate constant of the antibody-catalyzed reaction [5.4 x 10(4) molar-1 minute-1 (M-1 min-1)] with that of the uncatalyzed reaction (2.6 x 10(-4) M-1 min-1) revealed this to be a remarkably efficient catalyst. Moreover, although the concentration of water (55 M) greatly exceeds that of the secondary alcohol, the antibody selectively catalyzes acyl transfer to thymidine. The antibody exhibits sequential binding, with Michaelis constants of 770 microM and 260 microM for acyl acceptor and donor, respectively, and a dissociation constant of 240 pM for hapten. This antibody-catalyzed reaction provides increased insight into the requirements for efficient aminoacylation catalysts and may represent a first step toward the generation of ""aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases"" with novel specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1607361832,"We have analyzed the developmental pattern of expression of the chicken transferrin receptor (CTR) gene in various chick embryonic tissues. Northern analyses of RNA from embryonic tissues at different stages of development and cultured chick embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) show that CTR is hyperexpressed in differentiating erythroid cells such that the steady-state level of CTR mRNA in these cells could be 200 or more times higher than in nonerythroid cells. In vitro nuclear transcription assays using nuclei from embryonic erythroid and brain cells, as well as CEFs, demonstrate that the vast differences in CTR mRNA levels in these cells are reflected in their respective CTR gene transcriptional activities. During development, the steady-state level of CTR mRNA declines in all tissues and, in erythroid cells, this pattern is accompanied by a similar decline in beta-globin mRNA levels. These changes are concurrent with the decreases in CTR and beta-globin mRNA transcriptional activities during erythroid maturation. Taken together, our results indicate that the hyperexpression of the CTR gene in differentiating erythroid cells is regulated to a significant degree at the transcriptional level. We also demonstrate that, in erythroid cells, neither CTR gene transcription nor CTR mRNA stability is regulated by intracellular iron levels."

A strongly hybridizing clone was rescued as a pBluescript derivative, pGAO9, by in vivo excision. The sequence of 3466 nucleotides of pGAO9 insert DNA was determined by progressively designing sequencing primers. The translation product of the single long open reading frame matches the available galactose oxidase peptide sequence data, which represents 42% of the residues in the protein. The mature enzyme has 639 residues, which have been assigned to a 1.7-A electron density map (Ito, N., Phillips, S. E. V., Stevens, C., Ogel, Z. B., McPherson, M. J., Keen, J. N., Yadav, K. D. S., and Knowles, P. F. (1991) Nature 350, 87-90). The gene lacks introns and encodes an mRNA of approximately 2.5 kilobases with three transcription initiation start points at least 324 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site. Multiple ATG codons are present between the transcription initiation region and the start of the mature protein; two in-frame ATGs could encode the initiating Met residue to give proteins with 89 or 41 residue N-terminal leader peptides. The shorter potential leader has N-terminal features characteristic of a secretion signal sequence and may also contain a pro-sequence processed by an enzyme specific for a monobasic (arginine) cleavage site, as proposed for other fungal genes. The codon bias of gaoA is characteristic of other filamentous fungal genes. No significant homologies exist between galactose oxidase and other protein sequences available in data bases."
https://openalex.org/W1565708310,"We have studied the structure, biosynthesis, intracellular routing, and vacuolar localization of carboxypeptidase ysCS in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two forms of carboxypeptidase yscS with different electrophoretic mobility. Antibodies specific for carboxypeptidase yscS recognized two glycoproteins of 77- and 74-kDa apparent molecular mass which differ by one N-linked carbohydrate residue. Both observations suggest that carboxypeptidase yscS exists in two catalytically active forms. The enzyme was found to be synthesized as two active high molecular mass precursor forms which are converted to the mature forms with a half-time of 20 min. The mature forms of carboxypeptidase yscS appeared soluble in the vacuolar lumen, while the precursor proteins accumulated tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane. The single hydrophobic domain present at the N terminus is believed to be responsible for the membrane association of the precursor molecules. Double mutants defective in proteinase yscA and proteinase yscB synthesize solely the carboxypeptidase yscS precursor forms. Correct proteolytic cleavage of the precursor forms was performed using purified proteinase yscB in vitro. Sec61, sec18, and sec7 mutants, conditionally defective in the secretory pathway, accumulate carboxypeptidase yscS precursor protein. Thus the carboxypeptidase yscS precursor molecules are delivered to the vacuole in a membrane bound form via the secretory pathway. After assembly into the vacuolar membrane, proteinase yscB presumably cleaves the precursor molecules to release soluble carboxypeptidase yscS forms into the lumen of the vacuole. The proposed mechanism is different from the delivery mechanism found for the other soluble vacuolar hydrolases in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1617649427,"A prolyl endopeptidase was purified from Flavobacterium meningosepticum. It was digested with trypsin. Two oligonucleotides, based on tryptic peptide sequences and used in PCR experiments, amplified a 300-base pair (bp) fragment. A 2.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment that hybridized to the 300-bp probe was cloned in lambda ZAP and sequenced from both strands. It contains a reading frame of 2115 bp, encoding the complete protein sequence of 705 amino acids. Ion-spray mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated the presence of an NH2-terminal signal peptide: the periplasmic mature protease is 685 residues in length for a molecular mass of 76784 Da. The prolyl endopeptidase showed no general sequence homology with known protein sequences except with that of porcine brain prolyl endopeptidase. In order to identify the active-site serine, the prolyl endopeptidase was labeled with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. One labeled peptide was purified and sequenced. The active-site serine was located in position 536 within the sequence GRSNGG. This sequence is different from the active-site sequence of the trypsin (GDSGGP) and subtilisin (GTSMAS) families."
https://openalex.org/W1601579247,"In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and in the enterobacterium Escherichia coli delta-amino-levulinic acid (ALA) is formed from glutamyl-tRNA by the sequential action of two enzymes, glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. E. coli has two GluTR proteins with sizes of 45 kDa (GluTR45) and 85 kDa (GluTR85) (Jahn, D., Michelsen, U., and Soll, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2542-2548). The hemA gene, isolated from E. coli and several other eubacteria, has been proposed to encode a structural component of GluTR. Because of the inability to overexpress this gene in E. coli, we demonstrate directly GluTR function for the E. coli hemA gene product by its expression and functional analysis in yeast, which does not form ALA from Glu-tRNA. Gel filtration experiments demonstrated definitively that the yeast-expressed HemA protein corresponded to GluTR45. Furthermore, analysis of GluTR activity in an E. coli strain with a disrupted hemA gene displayed GluTR85, but not GluTR45 activity. The hemA gene from Synechocystis 6803 was cloned by functional complementation in E. coli. DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a 427-amino acid polypeptide (molecular mass of 47,525 Da). The Synechocystis 6803 amino acid sequence shows significant similarity upon alignment with HemA sequences from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Chlorobium vibrioforme but does not contain the amino acid sequence derived from the N terminus of the previously purified GluTR protein (Rieble, S., and Beale, S. I. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9740-9745). These experiments are the first direct demonstration of GluTR activity of the HemA protein and provide further evidence for two pathways of ALA formation in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1568438881,"The TaqI restriction endonuclease recognizes and cleaves the duplex DNA sequence T decreases CGA. Steady state kinetic analysis with a small oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrate showed that the enzyme obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 53 nM, kcat = 1.3 min-1 at 50 degrees C and Km = 0.5 nM, kcat = 2.9 min-1 at 60 degrees C). At 0 degree C, the enzyme was completely inactive, while at 15 degrees C, turnover produced nicked substrate as the major product in excess of enzyme indicating dissociation between nicking events. Above 37 degrees C, both strands in the duplex were cleaved prior to dissociation. In contrast to the tight, temperature-dependent binding of substrate, binding of the Mg2+ cofactor was weak (Kd = 2.5 mM) and the same at either 50 degrees C or 60 degrees C. Single-turnover experiments using oligonucleotide substrate showed that hydrolysis of duplex DNA occurred via two independent nicking events, each with a first order rate constant (kst) of 5.8 min-1 at 60 degrees C and 3.5 min-1 at 50 degrees C. The pH dependence of Km (pKa = 9) and kst (pKa = 7) suggests Lys/Arg and His, respectively, as possible amino acids influencing these constants. Moreover, although kst increased significantly with pH, kcat did not, indicating that at least two steps can be rate-controlling in the reaction pathway. Binding of protein to canonical DNA in the presence of Mg2+ at 0 degree C or in the absence of Mg2+ at 50 degrees C was weak (Kd = 2.5 microM or 5,000-fold weaker than the optimal measured Km) and equal to the binding of noncanonical DNA as judged by retention on nitrocellulose. Similar results were seen in gel retardation assays. These results suggest that both Mg2+ and high temperature are required to attain the correct protein conformation to form the tight complex seen in the steady state analysis. In the accompanying paper (Zebala, J. A., Choi, J., Trainor, G. L., and Barany, F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8106-8116), we report how these kinetic constants are altered using substrate analogues and propose a model of functional groups involved in TaqI endonuclease recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1583331377,"The kinetics of ligand binding to the periplasmic C4-dicarboxylate binding protein (DctP) from Rhodobacter capsulatus were investigated by exploiting the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon binding ligands. Steady state measurements have shown that L-malate, succinate, and fumarate are all bound with sub-micromolar Kd values, whereas D-malate is bound 2 orders of magnitude more weakly. Stopped-flow studies have revealed that the binding process involves at least three steps. In the absence of ligand, the protein is in equilibrium between an essentially nonbinding form, BP1, and the binding form, BP2. Ligands bind to the BP2 form, shifting the equilibrium toward the BP2-L conformation, and also inducing a further isomerization of the protein, to the BP3-L form. The kinetic properties of the four different conformational states of the DctP protein identified in this study would be consistent with their identification as the closed-conformation, the open-conformation, an open-liganded conformation, and a closed-liganded conformation. The latter three states have been identified by x-ray crystallographic studies of binding proteins, but no kinetic or structural data have been presented previously to support the possibility of a closed but unliganded conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1566050563,"A procedure that combined ion exchange, gel permeation, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP-3) affinity chromatography with chromatofocusing and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography was used to isolate high molecular weight precursors of human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) from acetic acid extracts of Cohn fraction IV1. Two precursors had isoelectric points (pI) of 5.1 and 5.4 and apparent Mr values of 15,000 and 11,500, respectively. An apparent Mr = 16,000 RLPG/Ser29 variant of IGF-II was also identified in the acetic acid extracts. Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the major E domain-containing peptide that had been isolated from apparent Mr = 15,000 IGF-II (pI 5.1), following its digestion with the endoprotease Lys-C, indicated the carboxyl terminus of this precursor was near or at Lys88. During the sequencing of this peptide, a sharply reduced yield of derivatized amino acid occurred at cycle 10, indicating that Thr75 had been posttranslationally modified, possibly by O-glycosylation. To evaluate this possibility, the 125I-labeled high molecular weight IGF-IIs and their endoprotease-generated peptides were treated with glycosidases, and their effects were determined from the change in relative mobilities of the polypeptide and peptides during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Neuraminidase treatment of apparent Mr = 15,000 and 11,500 IGF-II reduced their Mr values to a common value of 10,500. When the desialylated precursors of IGF-II were treated with O-glycosidase, but not when treated with N-glycosidase, the Mr values were reduced further to about 10,000. This was the Mr value that would be predicted for an unglycosylated form of precursor IGF-II that had a carboxyl-terminal end at or near Lys88. When the Ser66-Lys88 endoprotease-generated E domain peptides from pI5.1 and 5.4 high Mr IGF-II were treated with the glycosidases, they had relative mobility changes during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that were similar to those of the intact precursors. Finally, the association of O-linked oligosaccharide with the E domain peptide of IGF-II was confirmed by demonstrating the specificity of binding of the Ser66-Lys88 asialoglycopeptide to jackfruit lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1549997811,"It has been argued both that there is a high affinity noncompetitive inhibitor binding site in the lumen of the acetylcholine receptor and that this lumen exists on the central axis of the receptor. Such a site would be expected to be 20-40 A from the membrane lipids. We tested whether, in fact, quinacrine, a potent fluorescent noncompetitive inhibitor, binds to such a site. We measured quenching of receptor-bound quinacrine fluorescence by fluorescence dipolar energy transfer to lipid probes, 5-(N-dodecanoylamino)eosin and N-(3-sulfopropyl)-4-(p-didecylaminostyryl)pyridinium, or by collision with paramagnetic lipid probes 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl and 3-doxyl-17 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstane (spin-labeled androstane). Initial control experiments established that in the presence of carbamylcholine, quinacrine binds to a phencyclidine-sensitive site on the Torpedo receptor with a Kd equal to 0.14 microM and with a quantum yield of 0.18. Fluorescence energy transfer from receptor-bound quinacrine had a magnitude consistent with quinacrine being less than 10 A from the lipid fluorescent probes. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl and spin-labeled androstane were two to five times more effective at quenching receptor-bound quinacrine fluorescence than the fluorescence from membrane-partitioned 5-(dodecanoylamino)fluorescein. These results suggest that the quinacrine binding site is too close to the lipid domain to be in the lumen of the receptor, and therefore it is probably located on the outer surface of the membrane-spanning domain of the acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1550137702,"DNA ligation catalyzed by all DNA ligases involves two intermediary steps, the formation of the ligase-AMP and the AMP-DNA complexes. A method was developed to purify and analyze the AMP-DNA intermediate from the DNA ligation reaction catalyzed by DNA ligases. This AMP-DNA complex was maximally accumulated by preincubation of human DNA ligase I or II with ATP, followed by interaction with the DNA substrate for 5 s at 0 degrees C. The gel-purified AMP-DNA complex maintained its property as a ligation intermediate. The AMP was directly linked to the 5'-phosphate of DNA with a pyrophosphate bond. The successive ligation reaction following the AMP-DNA complex formation required DNA ligase and Mg2+ ion but was inhibited by ATP and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, indicating that the availability of the AMP binding site in the enzyme is essential for the completion of the reaction. Furthermore, the formation of the AMP-DNA complex and the subsequent DNA ligation were substrate specific for human DNA ligases I and II. These data, together with previously reported results, suggest that a major difference between human DNA ligases I and II is in their DNA-binding domains. The methods make it convenient to study in depth the kinetics of the overall DNA ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1517640879,"The prenylation of proteins utilizes the polyisoprenyl pyrophosphates (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) as prenyl donors. These polyisoprenoids are also precursors to ubiquinone and dolichol synthesis. We have previously described the geranylgeranylation of rab 1b from labeled mevalonate in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Khosravi-Far, R., Lutz, R. J., Cox, A. D., Conroy, L., Bourne, J. R., Sinensky, M., Balch, W. E., Buss, J. C., and Der, C. J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 6264-6268). We now directly demonstrate the incorporation of mevalonate into FPP and GGPP in rabbit reticulocyte cytosol. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis reveals that only all-trans-E,E,E-GGPP, the prenyl donor for in vivo protein geranylgeranylation, is synthesized. Incubations with recombinant H-ras and rab1b result in an increased synthesis of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl derivatives, respectively. The increase is wholly accounted for by protein-incorporated polyisoprenoids with no change in the polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate pools. Further, GGPP inhibits its own synthesis, without affecting FPP synthesis, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 3 microM GGPP. Inhibition of FPP synthesis by the inhibition of isopentenyl isomerase causes a dramatic increase in isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis. FPP also inhibits conversion of mevalonate into FPP. These findings indicate that these polyisoprenyl pyrophosphates can down-regulate their own synthesis in vitro, and this regulation may control the levels of these polyisoprenoids in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1657906844,"A family of synthetic genes was constructed encoding a rainbow trout metallothionein (MT), a human MT, and two chimeric molecules which contained respectively (i) the N-terminal (or head) domain of human MT followed by the C-terminal (or tail) domain of a fish MT (termed mermaid MT) and (ii) the head domain of fish MT fused with the tail domain of human MT (denoted fishman MT). These were expressed in Escherichia coli and the four recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity therefrom. All four were found to bind 7 g atoms of Cd(II) per mol; at pH 7.0, but not at pH 8.6, four Cd(II) ions were sequestered preferentially in the tail (or alpha) domain. Reciprocally, copper was found to bind preferentially in the head (or beta) domain. The human and fishman MTs displayed a stoichiometry of 12 g atoms of Cu(I) per mol, while rainbow trout and mermaid MTs bound only 10. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the different positional organization of cysteine residues close to the N and C termini of mammalian and piscine metallothioneins."
https://openalex.org/W2010041321,"The inhibition of the voltage-dependent, K+ M-current (IM) following receptor-independent G protein activation with controlled intracellular perfusion of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs had an exponential time course, with rates hyperbolically dependent on GTP analog concentration, and a limiting value of 0.53 min−1. The inhibitory agonist muscarine caused a concentration-dependent acceleration of the rate of nucleotide-induced inhibition, with a plateau of about 20 min−1 and an exponential time course. In neurons not treated with nucleotide analogs the IM recovery rate following agonist removal was 3–7 min−1. It is proposed that the overall kinetics of the transduction pathway for IM modulation is governed by the agonist-dependent kinetics of nucleotide interaction with G proteins. A simple model of IM modulation based on G proteins' kinetics has been developed. These data suggest a possible cellular process responsible for the time course of slow synaptic potentials caused by IM inhibition in sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1494570516,"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB) encodes a 928-amino acid protein (pRB) that is hypothesized to function in a pathway that restricts cell proliferation. The immortalizing proteins from three distinct DNA tumor viruses (SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1a, and human papilloma virus Type 16 E7) have been shown to interact with RB protein through two noncontiguous regions comprised of amino acids 393-572 (domain A) and 646-772 (domain B). We constructed a truncated form of RB (RB p60) that retains these two domains but eliminates the N-terminal 386 amino acids of RB. RB p60 was expressed in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies. After solubilization, it was refolded in the presence of magnesium chloride, and the active protein was isolated with an E7 peptide affinity column. The protein that elutes from this column is functionally homogenous in its ability to bind immobilized E7 protein. Thermal denaturation studies provide additional evidence for the conformational homogeneity of the isolated protein. This purification scheme allows the isolation of significant amounts of RB p60 protein that is suitable for structural and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1553446480,"It has been proposed that protein-DNA recognition is mediated via specific hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, and/or electrostatic interactions between the protein and DNA surfaces. We have attempted to map and quantitate the energies of these interactions for the TaqI endonuclease by constructing substrates substituted with base or phosphate analogues that either remove or sterically obstruct particular functional groups in the canonical TCGA sequence. The DNA backbone was also modified using a chemical approach (phosphate ethylation) which identified several phosphates in the recognition sequence essential for cleavage. The base analogues, N6-methyl-A, N7-deaza-A, N7-deaza-G, inosine, N4-methyl-C, 5-methyl-C, uracil, 5-bromo-U, and the phosphate analogues, alpha-thio-A, alpha-thio-G, alpha-thio-T, alpha-thio-A, were substituted for their corresponding unmodified counterpart in one strand of the TCGA duplex. The effects of these analogues were monitored by measuring the steady state (Km, kcat) and single-turnover (kst) kinetic constants. Only the N6-methyl-A-substituted DNA, which mimics in vivo methylation, was unreactive while the remaining analogue substitutions exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In general, the Km was either unchanged or lowered by the analogue substitutions. In contrast, many of the analogues severely reduced kcat, suggesting the modified functional groups served mainly to destabilize the transition state. Single-turnover measurements paralleled the kcat results, pointing to the N7 and N6 of A, the N7 of G, and one of the nonbridging oxygens 3' to T as putative contacts made in achieving the transition state. Substrates with double substitutions displayed simple additivity of delta delta G implying that these changes behaved independently. The unmodified strand in 10 out of 12 hemisubstituted substrates had a normal kst value suggesting that a particular cleavage center is controlled predominantly by recognition of determinants on the same strand as the scissile bond. These results are discussed in relation to base analogue work from the EcoRI, RsrI, and EcoRV restriction endonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W1597021929,"Hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is a pathogenic feature of hypertension which may contribute to abnormal vessel tone and function. As a consequence of the increase in cell size associated with hypertrophy, it is likely that alterations in the mechanisms that regulate VSMC intracellular volume occur. Because the Na+/H+ exchanger plays an important role in volume regulation and because we previously observed long term alterations in Na+/H+ exchange and pHi in response to angiotensin-II-induced (ang II) hypertrophy, we studied cell-acidifying mechanisms. To do this, we measured alkaline recovery from NH4Cl-mediated alkalinization, using the fluorescent dye, 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. VSMC were growth-arrested (0.4% calf serum for 24 h) or hypertrophied (100 nM ang II in 0.4% calf serum for 24 h). Ang II-treated cells exhibited a 107% increase in alkaline recovery over control cells (13.86 +/- 1.87 versus 6.68 +/- 1.01 mmol H+/min/liter cells). The increase in alkaline recovery was not a result of increased Cl-/HCO-3 exchange becaue it was not HCO-3 dependent nor inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid. Studies with bumetanide and the sterically inhibited substrate N(CH3)4+ showed that the alkaline recovery was mediated by NH4+ transport via the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter. Ang II-treated cells exhibited a 334% increase in bumetanide-sensitive alkaline recovery over control cells (9.16 +/- 1.90 versus 2.11 +/- 1.46 mmol H+/min/liter cells). Ang II-treated cells also exhibited a 90% increase in bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb uptake over control cells. These findings demonstrate that Na/K/2Cl cotransport activity is specifically induced in ang II-hypertrophied VSMC and establish this transporter as a component of the hypertrophic growth response."
https://openalex.org/W1497298408,"Resting muscle is generally perceived as a glucose-utilizing organ; however, we show that resting well-oxygenated frog muscle recovering from strenuous exercise can release significant amounts of glucose. The metabolic pathway responsible for this process does not involve glucose-6-phosphatase because this enzyme is undetectable in frog muscle. The participation of amylo-1,6-glucosidase in the production of glucose is also ruled out since neither marked net phosphorolytic breakdown of glycogen nor considerable cycling between glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate occur. The glucosidic pathways of glycogen breakdown are the likely source of glucose as they are the only metabolic avenues with sufficient capacity to account for the rate at which glucose is released from post-exercised muscle. This rate of glucose production is high enough to be of physiological importance. Our results clearly indicate that to measure lactate glycogenesis in muscle, the simultaneous hydrolysis of muscle glycogen by the glucosidic pathways must be taken into account to prevent marked underestimation of the rate of glycogen synthesis. The glucosidic pathways seem the predominant avenues of glycogen breakdown in post-exercised resting frog muscle and are active enough to account for the rate of glycogen breakdown in resting muscle, suggesting that these rather than the phosphorolytic pathways are the chief routes of glycogen breakdown in resting muscle."
