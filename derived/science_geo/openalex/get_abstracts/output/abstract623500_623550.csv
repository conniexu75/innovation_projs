https://openalex.org/W2905475552,"Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disorder affecting the respiratory, digestive, reproductive systems and sweat glands. This lethal hereditary disease has known or suspected links to the dysbiosis gut microbiota. High-throughput meta-omics-based approaches may assist in unveiling this complex network of symbiosis modifications. Objectives The aim of this study was to provide a predictive and functional model of the gut microbiota enterophenotype of pediatric patients affected by CF under clinical stability. Methods Thirty-one fecal samples were collected from CF patients and healthy children (HC) (age range, 1–6 years) and analysed using targeted-metagenomics and metabolomics to characterize the ecology and metabolism of CF-linked gut microbiota. The multidimensional data were low fused and processed by chemometric classification analysis. Results The fused metagenomics and metabolomics based gut microbiota profile was characterized by a high abundance of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus and Clostridiaceae, including Clostridium difficile, and a low abundance of Eggerthella, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae, associated with overexpression of 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), choline, ethanol, propylbutyrate, and pyridine and low levels of sarcosine, 4-methylphenol, uracil, glucose, acetate, phenol, benzaldehyde, and methylacetate. The CF gut microbiota pattern revealed an enterophenotype intrinsically linked to disease, regardless of age, and with dysbiosis uninduced by reduced pancreatic function and only partially related to oral antibiotic administration or lung colonization/infection. Conclusions All together, the results obtained suggest that the gut microbiota enterophenotypes of CF, together with endogenous and bacterial CF biomarkers, are direct expression of functional alterations at the intestinal level. Hence, it’s possible to infer that CFTR impairment causes the gut ecosystem imbalance.This new understanding of CF host-gut microbiota interactions may be helpful to rationalize novel clinical interventions to improve the affected children’s nutritional status and intestinal function."
https://openalex.org/W2904347099,"Background French Guiana (FG) was the first country in South America to declare chikungunya virus infection (CHIKV). The outbreak affected about 16,000 persons between February 2014 and October 2015, with several atypical cases, but only two fatal cases. We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of patients hospitalized for CHIKV infection, to estimate and identify risk factors of unusual and severe forms in adult patients. Materials and methods A monocentric retrospective study was conducted in Cayenne hospital, the main city and the main hospital in FG, from March 1st 2014 to August 31st 2015. All patients admitted for at least one night with a biological diagnosis of CHIKV infection during the 2014/2015 outbreak were included, except pregnant women and children under 15 years. Results During the study period, 285 patients with a diagnosis of CHIKV infection were hospitalized in Cayenne hospital, among whom 96 nonpregnant adults were studied. Five were classified as severe forms (5.2%) and 23 as unusual forms (23.9%). The most frequent atypical and/or severe form was neurological (n = 20), followed by cardio-respiratory failure (acute respiratory failure n = 4, acute heart failure n = 2), digestive and hepatic disorders (acute hepatitis n = 3, acute pancreatitis n = 2), renal disorders (acute renal failure n = 5) and muscular impairment (rhabdomyolysis n = 3). Conclusion During the outbreak, hospitalizations were frequent, particularly for common forms, driven by algic clinical presentations and concerns due to the novelty of this infection. Despite atypical neurological and liver forms of CHIKV infection, case-fatality was low in French Guiana. No specific risk factor of atypical and/or severe forms was found in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2904247827,"Metabolite-protein interactions define the output of metabolic pathways and regulate many cellular processes. Although diseases are often characterized by distortions in metabolic processes, efficient means to discover and study such interactions directly in cells have been lacking. A stringent implementation of proteome-wide Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) was developed and applied to key cellular nucleotides, where previously experimentally confirmed protein-nucleotide interactions were well recaptured. Many predicted, but never experimentally confirmed, as well as novel protein-nucleotide interactions were discovered. Interactions included a range of different protein families where nucleotides serve as substrates, products, co-factors or regulators. In cells exposed to thymidine, a limiting precursor for DNA synthesis, both dose- and time-dependence of the intracellular binding events for sequentially generated thymidine metabolites were revealed. Interactions included known cancer targets in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism as well as novel interacting proteins. This stringent CETSA based strategy will be applicable for a wide range of metabolites and will therefore greatly facilitate the discovery and studies of interactions and specificities of the many metabolites in human cells that remain uncharacterized."
https://openalex.org/W2902357853,"Population stratification is a well-known confounding factor in both common and rare variant association analyses. Rare variants tend to be more geographically clustered than common variants, because of their more recent origin. However, it is not yet clear if population stratification at a very fine scale (neighboring administrative regions within a country) would lead to statistical bias in rare variant analyses. As the inclusion of convenience controls from external studies is indeed a common procedure, in order to increase the power to detect genetic associations, this problem is important. We studied through simulation the impact of a fine scale population structure on different rare variant association strategies, assessing type I error and power. We showed that principal component analysis (PCA) based methods of adjustment for population stratification adequately corrected type I error inflation at the largest geographical scales, but not at finest scales. We also showed in our simulations that adding controls obviously increased power, but at a considerably lower level when controls were drawn from another population."
https://openalex.org/W2977010698,"The parasitic mite, Varroa destructor, in combination with the viruses it vectors, is the main cause for global colony losses of the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. However, an isolated honeybee population established in 1999 on the Island of Gotland, Sweden has naturally acquired resistance to the mite, and has survived without mite control treatment for more than 18 years. A recent study has shown that this mite resistant (MR) population also appears to be resistant to Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Sacbrood virus (SBV) and tolerant to Deformed wing virus (DWV), relative to nearby mite susceptible (MS) honeybee populations. In this study, RNA sequencing was employed to corroborate these previous findings and identify other viral factors that may play a role in the enhanced survival of this mite resistant honeybee population. Two additional honeybee-infecting viruses, Apis rhabdovirus-1 (ARV-1) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV), were identified and near-complete genomes of these two viruses were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses of the assembled virus sequences revealed consistent separation between the MR and MS honeybee populations, although it is unclear whether this is due to pre-existing differences between the viruses in the two populations when they were established, and isolated, or due to virus genetic adaptation towards reduced virulence in the MR population, to promote colony survival. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) analyses show higher ARV and LSV titres in MS colonies compared to MR colonies, gradually increasing from summer to autumn 2009, and reaching maximum titres in the following spring 2010. While the DWV and BQCV titres in MR colonies increased between autumn 2009 and spring 2010, the SBV practically disappeared entirely by spring 2010. Possible explanations for the apparent virus tolerance or resistance in the Gotland mite-resistant honeybee population are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2904976900,"The intestinal epithelium plays an essential role in the balance between tolerant and protective immune responses to infectious agents. In vitro models do not typically consider the innate immune response and gut microbiome in detail, so these models do not fully mimic the physiologic aspects of the small intestine. We developed and characterized a long-term in vitro model containing enterocyte, goblet, and immune-like cells exposed to a synthetic microbial community representative of commensal inhabitants of the small intestine. This model showed differential responses toward a synthetic microbial community of commensal bacterial inhabitants of the small intestine in the absence or presence of LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4. Simultaneous exposure to LPS and microbiota induced impaired epithelial barrier function; increased production of IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16; and augmented differentiation and adhesion of macrophage-like cells and the overexpression of dual oxidase 2 and TLR-2 and -4 mRNA. In addition, the model demonstrated the ability to assess the adhesion of specific bacterial strains from the synthetic microbial community-more specifically, Veillonella parvula-to the simulated epithelium. This novel in vitro model may assist in overcoming sampling and retrieval difficulties when studying host-microbiome interactions in the small intestine.-Calatayud, M., Dezutter, O., Hernandez-Sanabria, E., Hidalgo-Martinez, S., Meysman, F.

https://openalex.org/W2902677664,"Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) existing in breast cancer are thought to be involved in initiation, progression, and relapse of tumors. In these processes, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proteases are crucial factors that also dependent on the tumor milieu, including hypoxic nutrient-deprived, as well as normoxic nutrient-rich, environments. Therefore, we investigated EMT and proteases in TICs and their response to different environments by means of a newly generated immortalized TIC (iTIC) line. With the use of primary CD24+CD90+CD45− TICs from the mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle T mouse breast cancer model, iTICs were generated by single cell-initiated sphere and subsequent 2-dimensional monolayer culture. Our data demonstrate the possibility to generate iTICs that are highly tumorigenic in culture and in mouse mammary fat pad. Contrasting environmental conditions provide these cells with a phenotypic and molecular plasticity that has a growth-promoting character in nutrient-rich normoxia and a motile character in nutrient-deprived hypoxia. Expression profiling revealed partial and dynamically changing EMT states, as well as a significantly up-regulated proteolytic signature, including many metalloproteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinase 14 (Mmp14). Inhibitor treatment of metalloproteinases, as well as short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Mmp14 strongly impacted TIC characteristics, including tumor initiation, cell growth, migration, and invasion, especially in starved environments. We conclude that metalloproteinases empower TICs to adapt to changing environments.—Hillebrand, L. E., Wickberg, S. M., Gomez-Auli, A., Folio, M., Maurer, J., Busch, H., Boerries, M., Reinheckel, T.

https://openalex.org/W2904639967,"The placenta plays a pivotal role in the development of the fetal brain and also influences maternal brain function, but our understanding of communication between the placenta and brain remains limited. Using a gene expression and network analysis approach, we provide evidence that the placenta transcriptome is tightly interconnected with the maternal brain and fetal brain in d 15 pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Activation of serotonergic synapse signaling and inhibition of neurotrophin signaling were identified as potential mediators of crosstalk between the placenta and maternal brain and fetal brain, respectively. Genes encoding specific receptors and ligands were predicted to affect functional interactions between the placenta and brain. Paralogous genes, such as sex comb on midleg homolog 1/scm-like with 4 mbt domains 2 and polycomb group ring finger (Pcgf) 2/Pcgf5, displayed antagonistic regulation between the placenta and brain. Additionally, conditional ablation of forkhead box a2 (Foxa2) in the glands of the uterus altered the transcriptome of the d 15 placenta, which provides novel evidence of crosstalk between the uterine glands and placenta. Furthermore, expression of cathepsin 6 and monocyte to macrophage differentiation associated 2 was significantly different in the fetal brain of Foxa2 conditional knockout mice compared with control mice. These findings provide a better understanding of the intricacies of uterus-placenta-brain interactions during pregnancy and provide a foundation and model system for their exploration.—Behura, S.

https://openalex.org/W2903985657,"Background Maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 have been associated with pre-eclampsia. Nevertheless, reported studies involve limited number of cases to reliably assess the nature of these associations. Our aim was to examine the relation of these three biomarkers with pre-eclampsia risk in a large Colombian population. Materials and methods Design: A case-control study. Setting: Cases of pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant controls were recruited at the time of delivery from eight different Colombian cities between 2000 and 2012. Population or Sample: 2978 cases and 4096 controls were studied. Maternal serum concentrations of folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 were determined in 1148 (43.6%) cases and 1300 (31.7%) controls. Also, self-reported folic acid supplementation was recorded for 2563 (84%) cases and 3155 (84%) controls. Analysis: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for pre-eclampsia were estimated for one standard deviation (1SD) increase in log-transformed biomarkers. Furthermore, we conducted analyses to compare women that reported taking folic acid supplementation for different periods during pregnancy. Main Outcomes Measures: Odds ratio for pre-eclampsia. Results After adjusting for potential confounders in logistic regression models, the OR for pre-eclampsia was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.90) for 1SD increase in log-folate, 1.16 (95%CI: 1.05, 1.27) for 1SD increase in log-homocysteine, and 1.10 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.22) for 1SD increase in log-vitamin B12. No interactions among the biomarkers were identified. Women who self-reported consumption of folic acid (1 mg/day) throughout their pregnancy had an adjusted OR for pre-eclampsia of 0.86 (95%CI: 0.67, 1.09) compared to women that reported no consumption of folic acid at any point during pregnancy. Conclusions Maternal serum concentrations of folate were associated as a protective factor for pre-eclampsia while concentrations of homocysteine were associated as a risk factor. No association between maternal vitamin B12 concentrations and preeclampsia was found."
https://openalex.org/W2904830649,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-mediated immunomodulation affects both innate and adaptive immune systems. These responses to environmental cues, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, damage-associated molecular patterns, or proinflammatory cytokines, are crucial for resolution of inflammation, as well as successful tissue healing and regeneration. We observed that intermittent, repeated exposure of MSCs to LPS induced stronger NF-κB activation than singular stimulation. A similar phenomenon, named innate immune memory or trained immunity, has been reported with macrophages. However, the potential regulation of “immune memory” in nonclassic immune cells, such as MSCs, has not been reported. In the current study, we chose IFN-γ plus TNF-α restimulation-induced iNOS expression as a model of MSC activation, because IFN-γ and TNF-α play crucial roles in MSC-mediated immunomodulation. The iNOS expression was enhanced in LPS-trained MSCs, 3 d after a washout period following primary stimulation. LPS-trained MSCs enhanced the anti-inflammatory (arginase 1 and CD206) marker expression, but decreased the proinflammatory marker (TNF-α, IL-lβ, iNOS, and IL-6) expression using an MSC-macrophage coculture model. In contrast, LPS-trained MSCs demonstrated a defective regulation on CD4 T-cell proliferation. Mechanistic studies suggested that histone methylation and the JNK pathway are involved in LPS-trained immunomodulation in MSCs. Our results demonstrate differential immunomodulatory effects of trained MSCs on macrophages and T cells. These immunomodulatory consequences are critical, because they will have a major impact on current MSC-based cell therapies.—Lin, T., Pajarinen, J., Kohno, Y., Huang, J.-F., Maruyama, M., Romero-Lopez, M., Nathan, K., Yao, Z., Goodman, S.

https://openalex.org/W2903917028,"Background/Objectives To analyse the relationship between caregiver burden and severity of patients’ cognitive impairment. Design Data were drawn from the cross-sectional 2015/2016 Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease-Specific Programme. Setting This research was multi-national and studied physicians and their consulting patients with cognitive impairment. Participants 1,201 caregivers completed self-assessment forms. Measurements Validated instruments of caregiver wellbeing and burden (EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, EQ-VAS, Zarit Burden Interview, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire) and number of caregiver hours were analysed by severity of patients’ cognitive impairment, categorised according to the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data were analysed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and ordinary least squares regression models, to compare outcomes between caregivers of patients with prodromal, mild, moderate, and severe dementia. Results The majority of caregivers were female (69.1%), lived with the patient they cared for (75.8%), and only approximately one third (28.3%) were in part- or full-time employment. There were statistically significant (p<0.001) increases in caregiver time (36.9 versus 108.6 hours per week for prodromal versus severe dementia, respectively) and measures of caregiver burden and health status (EQ-5D-3L, EQ-VAS, and Zarit Burden Interview) and increases in measures of work productivity and activity impairment with increasing severity of patients’ disease. Conclusion This study of real-world data confirmed an association between increased caregiver burden and severity of patients’ cognitive impairment by analysis of a wide range of validated measures of caregiver burden. These findings suggest that maintaining patients in the earliest stages of their disease for as long as possible may potentially help to protect caregiver wellbeing, although further research is required to confirm this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2904227151,"Extracellular vesicles contain various cellular components that are involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and immune escape. Extracellular vesicles are classified into 2 groups, namely, exosomes and microvesicles (MV). Although the formation and roles of exosomes have been studied, the exact functions of MVs and mechanisms underlying MV release are not fully understood. We found that epidermal growth factor accelerates the release of MVs from the plasma membrane by inducing NF-κB activation and CD133 expression. The amount and sizes of budding MVs were found to be dependent on the expression level of CD133, which regulates the activities of the small guanosine 5′-triphosphatases RhoA and Rac1. CD133-containing MVs released from KRAS mutant colon cancer cells delivered KRAS mutant to adjacent nontumorigenic cells and activated KRAS downstream signaling. CD133-containing MVs were found to promote the migration and invasion of adjacent cells. CD133-containing MVs induced the development of chemoresistance by abolishing the inhibitory effects of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs on cell proliferation and motility in colon cancer. These results suggest that CD133 acts as a novel modulator in MV release and in oncoprotein trafficking. CD133 can serve as a therapeutic target for treatment of anti-EGFR drug-resistant colon cancer.—Kang, M., Kim, S., Ko, J.

https://openalex.org/W2905213079,"Targeted insertion of transgenes in plants is still challenging and requires further technical innovation. In the present study, we chose the tomato DFR gene involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis as a landing pad for targeted transgene insertion using CRISPR-Cas9 in a two-step strategy. First, a 1013 bp was deleted in the endogenous DFR gene. Hypocotyls and callus of in vitro regenerated plantlets homozygous for the deletion were green instead of the usual anthocyanin produced purple colour. Next, standard Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to target transgene insertion at the DFR landing pad in the dfr deletion line. The single binary vector carried two sgRNAs, a donor template containing two homology arms of 400 bp, the previously deleted DFR sequence, and a NptII expression cassette. Regenerating plantlets were screened for a purple-colour phenotype indicating that DFR function had been restored. Targeted insertions were identified in 1.29% of the transformed explants. Thus, we established an efficient method for selecting HDR-mediated transgene insertion using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in tomato. The visual screen used here facilitates selection of these rare gene targeting events, does not necessitate the systematic PCR screening of all the regenerating material and can be potentially applied to other crops."
https://openalex.org/W2905381684,"This study aimed to characterize bone cancer pain (quantitative sensory testing (QST), stance asymmetry index, actimetry, scores of pain and quality of life (QoL)) in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma (OSA), and to evaluate a stepwise palliative analgesic treatment. The pain profile of thirteen client-owned dogs with OSA was compared with seven healthy dogs. Dogs with OSA were then enrolled in a prospective, open-label, clinical trial. Outcome measures included: primary and secondary mechanical thresholds (MT), conditioned pain modulation (CPM), stance asymmetry index, actimetry (most and least active periods), visual analog scales and QoL. After baseline assessments, stepwise treatment comprised orally administered cimicoxib (2 mg/kg q 24h), amitriptyline (1-1.5 mg/kg q 24h) and gabapentin (10 mg/kg q 8h); re-evaluations were performed after 14 (D14), 21 (D21) and 28 (D28) days, respectively. Statistics used mixed linear models (α = 5%; one-sided). Centralized nociceptive sensitivity (primary and secondary MT, and dynamic allodynia) was recorded in OSA dogs. Healthy dogs had responsive CPM, but CPM was deficient in OSA dogs. Construct validity was observed for the QST protocol. Asymmetry index was significantly present in OSA dogs. The CPM improved significantly at D14. When compared with baseline (log mean ± SD: 4.1 ± 0.04), most active actimetry significantly improved at D14 (4.3 ± 0.04), D21 and D28 (4.2 ± 0.04 for both). When compared with baseline, least active actimetry significantly decreased after treatment at all time-points indicating improvement in night-time restlessness. No other significant treatment effect was observed. Except for tactile threshold and actimetry, all outcomes worsened when gabapentin was added to cimicoxib-amitriptyline. Dogs with bone cancer are affected by widespread somatosensory sensitivity characterized by peripheral and central sensitization and have a deficient inhibitory system. This severe pain is mostly refractory to palliative analgesic treatment, and the latter was only detected by specific and sensitive outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2903971320,"We propose Pseudomonas coronafaciens sp. nov. as a new species in genus Pseudomonas, which is diverse from P. syringae. We also classified strains from onions which are responsible for yellow bud (YB) disease as P. coronafaciens. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoD, gltA and gap1 genes) for the P. syringae pv. coronafaciens strains along with other strains of P. syringae pathovars resulted in a distinct cluster separate from other P. syringae pathovars. Based on DNA-DNA relatedness, pathotype strain of P. syringae pv. coronafaciens (CFBP 2216PT) exhibited ≤35.5% similarity with the pathotype strains of P. syringae pv. syringae (CFBP 1392PT, 4702T) but exhibited ≥90.6% with the YB strains (YB 12–1, YB 12–4, YB 09–1). Also, the YB strains (YB 12–1, YB 12–4, YB 09–1) were able to infect only onion but not oat, rye and Italian ryegrass (common hosts for P. syrinage pv. coronafaciens). Contrastingly, P. syringae pv. coronafaciens strains (NCPPB 600PT, ATCC 19608, Pcf 83–300) produced typical halo blight symptoms on oat, rye and Italian rye grass but did not produce any symptoms on onion.

https://openalex.org/W2903835529,"The Tathmini GBV study was a cluster randomized trial to assess the impact of a comprehensive health facility- and community-based program delivered through the HIV/AIDS program platform on reduction in gender-based violence and improved care for survivors. Twelve health facilities and surrounding communities in the Mbeya Region of Tanzania were randomly assigned to intervention or control arms. Population-level effects were measured through two cross-sectional household surveys of women ages 15–49, at baseline (n = 1,299) and at 28 months following program scale-out (n = 1,250). Delivery of gender-based violence services was assessed through routine recording in health facility registers. Generalized linear mixed effects models and analysis of variance were used to test intervention effects on population and facility outcomes, respectively. At baseline, 52 percent of women reported experience of recent intimate partner violence. The odds of reporting experience of this violence decreased by 29 percent from baseline to follow-up in the absence of the intervention (time effect OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57–0.89). While the intervention contributed an additional 15 percent reduction, the effect was not statistically significant. The program, however, was found to contribute to positive, community-wide changes including less tolerance for certain forms of violence, more gender equitable norms, better knowledge about gender-based violence, and increased community actions to address violence. The program also led to increased utilization of gender-based violence services at health facilities. Nearly three times as many client visits for gender-based violence were recorded at intervention (N = 1,427) compared to control (N = 489) facilities over a 16-month period. These visits were more likely to include provision of an HIV test (55.3% vs. 19.6%, p = .002). The study demonstrated the feasibility and impact of integrating gender-based violence and HIV programming to combat both of these major public health problems. Further opportunities to scale out GBV prevention and response strategies within HIV/AIDS service delivery platforms should be pursued.

Little is known about whether and how space microgravity is able to direct the hepatogenic differentiation of BMSCs in the actual space microenvironment. In this study, we examined the effects of space microgravity on BMSC hepatogenic differentiation on board the SJ-10 Recoverable Scientific Satellite. Rat BMSCs were cultured and induced in hepatogenic induction medium for 3 and 10 d in custom-made space cell culture hardware. Cell growth was monitored periodically in orbit, and the fixed cells and collected supernatants were retrieved back to the Earth for further analyses. Data indicated that space microgravity improves the differentiating capability of the cells by up-regulating hepatocyte-specific albumin and cytokeratin 18. The resulting cells tended to be maturated, with an in-orbit period of up to 10 d. In space, mechanosensitive molecules of β1-integrin, β-actin, α-tubulin, and Ras homolog gene family member A presented enhanced expression, whereas those of cell-surface glycoprotein CD44, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, vinculin, cell division control protein 42 homolog, and Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase yielded reduced expression. Also observed in space were the depolymerization of actin filaments and the accumulation of microtubules and vimentin through the altered expression and location of focal adhesion complexes, Rho guanosine 5′-triphosphatases, as well as the enhanced exosome-mediated mRNA transfer.

https://openalex.org/W2903897932,"We examined the accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkyl PAHs, and toxic metals in soils by the roots of Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, in a 20-week greenhouse study and a 2-year field study. In the greenhouse study, inoculation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Rhizoglomus intraradices (N.C. Schenck & G.S. Sm.). increased the first order accumulation rates (k1) for PAHs by 10-fold, though had no effect on the bioaccumulation rates of toxic metals. In the greenhouse study, PAHs concentrations in soil increased over time with AMF inoculation, suggesting AMF promote ‘solvent depletion’ in soils by enhancing absorption of minerals and carbon by roots, concentrating the more hydrophobic PAHs in the residual soil. Under field conditions, contaminant concentrations in soils remained unchanged over the 2-year duration of the study. Despite this, all contaminants in E. purpurea roots increased significantly, as a result of a long term extraction of contaminants by plants from soil and a reduction in soil volume as a result of plant growth. First order accumulation rates by roots were inversely correlated to log Kow for the PAHs and alkyl PAHs, indicating that accumulation is inversely related to the compound’s hydrophobicity. This study is the first to our knowledge to assess the accumulation of alkyl PAHs by roots, with implications for soil bioremediation by plants because alkyl PAHs are a major source of petrogenic contamination in soils."
https://openalex.org/W2904000970,"Scrub typhus is a mites-borne rickettsiosis caused by the obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. The disease is potentially life threatening and is prevalent in tropical Asia, islands of the western Pacific Ocean and northern Australia where an estimated one million cases occur annually. Orientia tsutsugamushi is transmitted by the bite of larval mites in the genus Leptotrombidium. In the present study, the composition of the microbiome in larvae, deutonymphs and adult males and females from laboratory colonies of L. imphalum that were infected as well as uninfected with O. tsutsugamushi were investigated by high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Notably, the bacterial microbiomes of infected adult females were dominated by sequences of O. tsutsugamushi and an unidentified species of Amoebophilaceae, which together comprised 98.2% of bacterial sequences. To improve the taxonomic resolution of the Amoebophilaceae OTU a nearly full length sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified, cloned, and Sanger sequenced. Infected female mites had 89 to 92% nucleotide identity with the Amoebophilaceae family, indicating that the bacterium was likely to be a species of a novel genus. The species composition of bacterial communities varied between mite life stages regardless of their infection status. Uninfected adults exhibited greater species diversity than adults infected with O. tsutsugamushi. In the infected colony, the rate of filial infection with Orientia was less than 100%. Larval and male mites that were PCR-negative for Orientia contained low numbers of sequences of Amoebophilaceae (0.01 and 0.06%, respectively) in their taxonomic profiles, suggesting that a mutualistic relationship exists between the novel species of Amoebophilaceae and O. tsutsugamushi. Our study findings provide the basis for further research to determine the influence of the novel Amoebophilaceae species on the bacterial microbiome and on vector susceptibility to and transovarial transmission of O. tsutsugamushi."

The polyphenol-rich ethanolic extract obtained from the stem part of the plant C. scarabaeoides (EECs) was found to be efficient in killing the filarial nematode Setaria cervi in all the three developmental stages viz. oocytes, microfilariae (Mf) and adults with LD50 values of 2.5, 10 and 35 μg/ml, respectively. While studying the molecular mechanism of action, we found that induction of oxidative stress plays the key role in inducing the mortality in S. cervi. The redox imbalance finally results in activation of the nematode CED pathway that executes the death of the parasite. Intriguingly, EECs was found to be selectively active against the worm and absolutely non-toxic to the mammalian cells and tissues. Taken together, our experimental data demonstrate that C. scarabaeoides can be chosen as an affordable natural therapeutic for treating filarial infection in the future with high efficacy and less toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2904744732,"Helicoverpa armigera is a polyphagous pest sensitive to Cry1Ac protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). The susceptibility of the different larval instars of H. armigera to Cry1Ac protoxin showed a significant 45-fold reduction in late instars compared to early instars. A possible hypothesis is that gut surface proteins that bind to Cry1Ac differ in both instars, although higher Cry toxin degradation in late instars could also explain the observed differences in susceptibility. Here we compared the Cry1Ac-binding proteins from second and fifth instars by pull-down assays and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). The data show differential protein interaction patterns of Cry1Ac in the two instars analyzed. Alkaline phosphatase, and other membrane proteins, such as prohibitin and an anion selective channel protein were identified only in the second instar, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in the higher toxicity of Cry1Ac in early instars of H. armigera. Eleven Cry1Ac binindg proteins were identified exclusively in late instar larvae, like different proteases such as trypsin-like protease, azurocidin-like proteinase, and carboxypeptidase. Different aminopeptidase N isofroms were identified in both instar larvae. We compared the Cry1Ac protoxin degradation using midgut juice from late and early instars, showing that the midgut juice from late instars is more efficient to degrade Cry1Ac protoxin than that of early instars, suggesting that increased proteolytic activity on the toxin could also explain the low Cry1Ac toxicity in late instars."
https://openalex.org/W2904871299,"Crop residue retention on the soil surface in no-tillage system can intercept pre-emergent herbicides and reduce their efficacy. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of crop residue amount (0, 1, 2 and 4 t ha-1), moisture (wet versus dry), type (wheat, barley, canola, chickpea and lupin) and age (fresh or aged for one year) on the interception and subsequent leaching of prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone, and trifluralin from the residue into soil. Bioassays, using cucumber and annual ryegrass as indicator plants, were used to assess herbicide activity/availability in the soil and on the residue. Herbicide interception increased considerably as residue quantity increased from 2 to 4 t ha-1. After simulated rainfall, which washed herbicide into the soil, complete control of ryegrass occurred for trifluralin with 0 t ha-1 residue, for prosulfocarb with 0 and 1 t ha-1 residue, and for pyroxasulfone with all residue rates. Therefore, with rain or irrigation, pyroxasulfone was the herbicide least affected by high residue loads. Less chemical leached from the crop residue into the soil after rainfall, when prosulfocarb and trifluralin were applied to wet residue compared with dry residue, but the initial moisture condition had no effect on the leaching of pyroxasulfone from residue. If practically possible, farmers should minimise spraying prosulfocarb and trifluralin onto wet crop residue. Barley and wheat residues intercepted more herbicide than an equivalent mass of canola, chickpea or lupin residue, which was largely due to the increased ground cover with cereal residues. The effect of residue age on herbicide interception and leaching was relatively small and variable. Overall, more herbicide reached the soil when sprayed on one-year old residue than new residue, which was largely due to reduced ground cover with aged residue. A strong positive linear relationship existed between ground cover percentage and growth of bioassay species (r2 = 0.75). This means that there was little difference in the ability of residue to adsorb and retain herbicide between crop residue types and ages, such that farmers can simply use the ground cover of the crop residue to assess interception."
https://openalex.org/W2810036975,"Cooperation is one of the behavioral traits that define human beings, however we are still trying to understand why humans cooperate. Behavioral experiments have been largely conducted to shed light into the mechanisms behind cooperation and other behavioral traits. However, most of these experiments have been conducted in laboratories with highly controlled experimental protocols but with varied limitations which limits the reproducibility and the generalization of the results obtained. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, some experimental approaches have moved human behavior experimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur naturally, and have opened the participation to the general public within the citizen science framework. Given the open nature of these environments, it is critical to establish the appropriate protocols to maintain the same data quality that one can obtain in the laboratories. Here, we introduce Citizen Social Lab, a software platform designed to be used in the wild using citizen science practices. The platform allows researchers to collect data in a more realistic context while maintaining the scientific rigour, and it is structured in a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted for online or brick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science guidelines, the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into participation, but also to promote engaging and learning of the scientific research process. We also review the main results of the experiments performed using the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment includes. Finally, we evaluate some properties of the platform, such as the heterogeneity of the samples of the experiments and their satisfaction level, and the parameters that demonstrate the robustness of the platform and the quality of the data collected."
https://openalex.org/W2903680498,"Background Insomnia is one of the main symptoms of sleep disorders. Previous studies have suggested that alcohol intake is associated with several adverse health outcomes. The association between alcohol consumption and insomnia has been addressed in several studies with different results. However, whether gender may modify the association between alcohol consumption and insomnia is not clear. This study will focus on gender differences in the relationship between alcohol consumption and insomnia. Methods The final study includes 8081 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years from the Jidong cohort. The data on alcohol consumption is collected by questionnaires, and insomnia problems are assessed using the entire 8-item Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS-8). Logistic analysis is used to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and insomnia. Results Among the 8081 participants in this study, 2618 (32.4%) are alcohol drinkers, including 2424 males and 194 females. The prevalence of insomnia is 9.6% in the male and 10.6% in the female. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of mild-to-moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers for insomnia are 1.27 (1.02–1.58) and 1.02 (0.79–1.32), respectively. Heavy alcohol consumption is significantly correlated with insomnia in the female, after controlling for potential confounding factors (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.28–3.49, p for interaction = 0.002). Conclusion A significant association between alcohol consumption and insomnia is found in females, but not in males from the northern Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2904024165,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the Hedgehog (Gli, Patched-1, Shh, Smo) and Notch (Jag1, Notch2, Notch3) pathway members, in comparison to a panel of proteins (ER, PgR, HER2/neu, Ki67, p53, p16, PTEN and MMR) previously suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer, in association with clinical outcome and standard clinicopathological characteristics. A total of 204 patients with histological diagnosis of endometrial cancer treated from 2004 to 2013 were included. The evaluation of protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Univariate analysis showed that higher Ki67 labeling, expression of PTEN, p16, Notch2 and Notch3 proteins, as well as MMR proficiency were associated with increased relapse and mortality rate. Additionally, Patched-1 protein expression was associated with worse DFS, while p53 overexpression was associated with worse OS. In multivariate analyses, patients with MMR proficient tumors had more than double risk for death than patients with MMR deficient (MMRd) tumors (adjusted HR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.05-4.58, p = 0.036). Jag1 positivity conferred reduced mortality risk (HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.23-0.97, p = 0.042). However, as shown by hierarchical clustering, patients fared better when their tumors expressed high Jag1 protein in the absence of Notch2 and Notch3, while they fared worse when all three proteins were highly expressed. Patched-1 positivity conferred higher risk for relapse (HR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.05-3.96, p = 0.036). Aberrant expression of key components of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways, as well as MMRd may serve as independent prognostic factors for recurrence and survival in patients with endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2905010062,"Background Stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients on haemodialysis (HD) often present with dizziness and pre-syncopal events as a result of the combined effect of HD therapy and cardiovascular disease. The dysregulation of blood pressure (BP) during orthostasis may be implicated in the aetiology of falls in these patients. Therefore, we explored the relationship between baroreflex function, the haemodynamic responses to a passive orthostatic challenge, and falls in HD patients. Methods Seventy-six HD patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Participants were classified as “fallers” and “non-fallers” and completed a passive head up tilting to 60o (HUT-60°) test on an automated tilt table. ECG signals, continuous and oscillometric BP measurements and impedance cardiography were recorded. The following variables were derived from these measurements: heart rate (HR) stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), number of baroreceptor events, and baroreceptor effectiveness index (BEI). Results The forty-four participants who were classified as fallers (57.9%) had a lower number of baroreceptor events (6.5±8.5 vs 14±16.7, p = .027) and BEI (20.8±24.2% vs 33.4±23.3%, p = .025). In addition, fallers experienced a significantly larger drop in systolic (-6.4±10.9 vs -0.4±7.7 mmHg, p = .011) and diastolic (-2.7±7.3 vs 1.8±6 mmHg, p = .027) oscillometric BP from supine to HUT-60° compared with non-fallers. None of the variables taken for the analysis were significantly associated with falls in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions This cross-sectional comparison indicates that, at rest, HD patients with a positive history of falls present with a lower count of baroreceptor sequences and BEI. Short-term BP regulation warrants further investigation as BP drops during a passive orthostatic challenge may be implicated in the aetiology of falls in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2903593330,"Type 2 diabetes is often linked with impaired proximal insulin signaling. Hence, a therapeutic agent that enhances cellular glucose uptake without requiring proximal insulin signaling would be desirable for improving glycemic control. The E4orf1 peptide (E4) derived from human adenovirus 36 (Ad36) promotes cellular glucose uptake in vitro and in vivo, independent of insulin. E4 bypasses a part of insulin signaling to upregulate cellular glucose uptake. We tested the hypothesis that E4 requires the distal but not proximal insulin signaling to enhance cellular glucose disposal.3T3-L1 preadipocytes inducibly expressing E4 or a null vector (NV) were treated with inhibitor of insulin receptor (S961), inhibitor of insulin like growth factor-1receptor (IGF-1R) (Picropodophyllin, PPP), PPP+S961, or phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (Wortmannin, WM). We used PPP and S961 to block the proximal insulin signaling, or WM to block the distal insulin signaling. Cells were exposed to 0 or 100nM insulin.As expected, when the proximal or distal insulin signaling was blocked in NV cells, insulin could not enhance pAKT protein abundance, Glut4 translocation, or glucose uptake. Whereas, E4 cells significantly increased pAKT abundance, Glut4 translocation and glucose uptake independent of the presence of insulin or proximal insulin signaling. Enhanced glucose disposal in E4 cells was completely abrogated when the distal insulin signaling was blocked.E4 bypasses the proximal insulin signaling but uses the distal insulin signaling to activate pAkt and in turn Glut4 translocation to improve cellular glucose uptake. E4 offers a promising template to improve glycemic control when the proximal insulin signaling is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2904131571,"Understanding how turbulence impacts marine floc formation and breakup is key to predicting particulate carbon transport in the ocean. While floc formation and sinking rate has been studied in the laboratory and in-situ, the breakup response to turbulence has attracted less attention. To address this problem, the breakup response of bentonite clay particles flocculated in salt water was studied experimentally. Flocs were grown in a large aggregation tank under unmixed and mixed aggregation conditions and then subjected to turbulent pipe flow. Particle size was quantified using microscope imaging and in-situ measurements obtained from standard optical oceanographic instruments; a Sequoia Scientific LISST-100X and two WET Labs ac-9 spectrophotometers. The LISST instrument was found to capture the breakup response of flocs to turbulent energy, though the resulting particle size spectra appear to have underestimated the largest floc lengthscales in the flow while overestimating the abundance of primary particles. Floc breakup and the resulting shift towards smaller particles caused an increase in spectral slope of attenuation as measured by the ac-9 instruments. The Kolmogorov lengthscale was not found to have a limiting effect on floc size in these experiments. While the flocs were found to decrease in overall strength over the course of the two-month experimental time period, repeatable breakup responses to turbulence exposure were observed. Hydrodynamic conditions during floc formation were found to have a large influence on floc strength and breakup response. A non-constant strength exponent was observed for flocs formed with more energetic mixing. Increased turbulence from mixing during aggregation was found to increase floc fractal dimension and apparent density, resulting in a shift in the breakup relationships to higher turbulence dissipation rates. The results suggest that marine particle aggregation and vertical carbon transport concepts should include the turbulence energy responsible for aggregate formation and the resulting impact on floc strength, density, and the disruption potential."
https://openalex.org/W4248454370,"Prior work applied hierarchical clustering, coarsened exact matching (CEM), time series regressions with lagged variables as inputs, and microsimulation to data from three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a large German observational study (OS) to predict pregabalin pain reduction outcomes for patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Here, data were added from six RCTs to reduce covariate bias of the same OS and improve accuracy and/or increase the variety of patients for pain response prediction. Using hierarchical cluster analysis and CEM, a matched dataset was created from the OS (N = 2642) and nine total RCTs (N = 1320). Using a maximum likelihood method, we estimated weekly pain scores for pregabalin-treated patients for each cluster (matched dataset); the models were validated with RCT data that did not match with OS data. We predicted novel 'virtual' patient pain scores over time using simulations including instance-based machine learning techniques to assign novel patients to a cluster, then applying cluster-specific regressions to predict pain response trajectories. Six clusters were identified according to baseline variables (gender, age, insulin use, body mass index, depression history, pregabalin monotherapy, prior gabapentin, pain score, and pain-related sleep interference score). CEM yielded 1766 patients (matched dataset) having lower covariate imbalances. Regression models for pain performed well (adjusted R-squared 0.90-0.93; root mean square errors 0.41-0.48). Simulations showed positive predictive values for achieving >50% and >30% change-from-baseline pain score improvements (range 68.6-83.8% and 86.5-93.9%, respectively). Using more RCTs (nine vs. the earlier three) enabled matching of 46.7% more patients in the OS dataset, with substantially reduced global imbalance vs. not matching. This larger RCT pool covered 66.8% of possible patient characteristic combinations (vs. 25.0% with three original RCTs) and made prediction possible for a broader spectrum of patients.

https://openalex.org/W2902458155,"Background Dengue is the fastest spreading vector-borne viral disease, resulting in an estimated 390 million infections annually. Precise prediction of many attributes related to dengue is still a challenge due to the complex dynamics of the disease. Important attributes to predict include: the risk of and risk factors for an infection; infection severity; and the timing and magnitude of outbreaks. In this work, we build a model for predicting the risk of dengue transmission using high-resolution weather data. The level of dengue transmission risk depends on the vector density, hence we predict risk via vector prediction. Methods and findings We make use of surveillance data on Aedes aegypti larvae collected by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control as part of the national routine entomological surveillance of dengue, and weather data simulated using the IBM’s Containerized Forecasting Workflow, a high spatial- and temporal-resolution forecasting system. We propose a two stage risk prediction system for assessing dengue transmission via Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In stage one, we perform a logistic regression to determine whether larvae are present or absent at the locations of interest using weather attributes as the explanatory variables. The results are then aggregated to an administrative division, with presence in the division determined by a threshold percentage of larvae positive locations resulting from a bootstrap approach. In stage two, larvae counts are estimated for the predicted larvae positive divisions from stage one, using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. This model identifies the larvae positive locations with 71% accuracy and predicts the larvae numbers producing a coverage probability of 98% over 95% nominal prediction intervals. This two-stage model improves the overall accuracy of identifying larvae positive locations by 29%, and the mean squared error of predicted larvae numbers by 9.6%, against a single-stage approach which uses a zero-inflated binomial regression approach. Conclusions We demonstrate a risk prediction system using high resolution weather data can provide valuable insight to the distribution of risk over a geographical region. The work also shows that a two-stage approach is beneficial in predicting risk in non-homogeneous regions, where the risk is localised."
https://openalex.org/W2902459685,"Background Treatment as prevention approaches for HIV require optimal HIV testing strategies to reduce undiagnosed HIV infections. In most settings, HIV testing strategies still result in unacceptably high rates of missed and late diagnoses. This study aimed to identify clinical opportunities for targeted HIV testing in persons at risk to facilitate earlier HIV diagnosis in New South Wales, Australia; and to assess the duration between the diagnosis of specific conditions and HIV diagnosis. Methods The Australian National HIV registry was linked to cancer diagnoses, notifiable condition diagnoses, emergency department presentations and hospital admissions for all HIV diagnoses between 1993 and 2012 in NSW. Date of HIV acquisition was estimated from back-projection models and people with a likely duration from infection to diagnosis of less than 180 days were excluded. Risk factors associated with clinical opportunities for the earlier diagnosis of HIV were identified. Results Sexually transmitted infection diagnoses (particularly gonorrhoea and syphilis) and some hospital admissions (mental health and drug-related diagnoses, and non-infective digestive disorder diagnoses) were prominent among people estimated to be living with undiagnosed HIV. The length of time between a clinical opportunity for the earlier HIV diagnosis and actual HIV diagnosis was 13.3 months for notifiable conditions, and 15.2 months for hospital admissions. People with lower CD4+ cell count at diagnosis, and older people were significantly less likely to have a missed opportunity for earlier HIV diagnosis. Conclusions Additional targeted clinical HIV testing strategies are warranted for people with gonorrhoea and syphilis; and hospital presentations or admissions for mental health, drug-related and gastrointestinal diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W2904232761,"Since higher vertical stiffness is related to superior athletic performance, training has traditionally been aimed at augmenting this variable to enhance neuromuscular output. However, research has linked elevated stiffness with increased injury risk, therefore, this study examined the effect of a novel training intervention on vertical stiffness and athletic performance. Vertical stiffness, jump performance and athletic performance were assessed in two randomly allocated groups, prior to, and following, an eight-week period. One group was exposed to a training intervention involving aqua-based plyometrics (n = 11) over the 8 weeks while the other acted as a control group (n = 9). The training intervention involved hopping, jumping and bounding in water at a depth of 1.2m whilst control participants performed their normal training. There were no significant changes in vertical stiffness in either group. Countermovement jump height and peak power significantly increased within the aqua plyometric group (p < 0.05). Athletic performance markers improved in the aqua plyometric group as measured using an agility and a 5-bound test exhibiting superior values at the post-test (p < 0.05). The results suggest that an aqua plyometric training program can enhance athletic performance without elevating stiffness. The increase in athletic performance is likely due to a reduction in ground reaction forces created by the buoyancy of the water, causing a shorter amortization phase and a more rapid application of concentric force. The findings from this study can inform exercise professionals and medical staff regarding the ability to enhance neuromuscular performance without elevating vertical stiffness. This has implications for improving athletic performance while concurrently minimising injury risk."
https://openalex.org/W2902306964,"Protein tyrosine (Tyr) nitration, the covalent addition of a nitro group (•NO2) to Tyr residues, is emerging as a candidate mechanism of endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Tyr nitration is primarily induced by nitrosative stress, a process characterized by the production of reactive nitrogen species, especially peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−), which is considered a secondary product of NO in the presence of superoxide radicals (O2•−). However, the impact of nitrosative stress–induced Tyr nitration on endothelial dysfunction has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. We developed an endothelial dysfunction model, a process called “endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT),” and evaluated the production of NO, O2•−, and protein nitration during EndMT. The results showed that TGF-β1 stimulation induced EndMT and elevated endothelial NO and O2•− production as well as nitration of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase (PP)2A. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Tyr265 was the nitration site in the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase (PP)2A, and this Tyr nitration increased PP2A activity and disrupted endothelial integrity. To devise an endothelial-targeted anti-PP2Ac nitration strategy, a mimic peptide, tyrosine 265 wild type (Y265WT), conjugated with the cell-penetrating peptide HIV-1 TAT protein (TAT) was synthesized. PP2Ac nitration and PP2A activity were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with TAT-265WT, and the integrity of endothelial cells was maintained. Furthermore, injection of TAT-265WT attenuated renal nitration formation and caused anticapillary rarefaction in a unilateral urethral obstructive nephropathy model. Taken together, these results offer preclinical proof of concept for TAT-265WT as a tractable agent to protect against nitrosative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction in renal microvessels.—Deng, Y., Cai, Y., Liu, L., Lin, X., Lu, P., Guo, Y., Han, M., Xu, G.

A lack of comprehensive knowledge about maternal and newborn health (MNH) services costs impedes policy decisions to maximize the benefit from existing, as well as emerging, MNH interventions in Pakistan. We compared MNH service costs at different levels of care. A cross-sectional survey was conducted during January to March 2016 as part of a large economic evaluation in Sindh, Pakistan. Health providers and facilities were selected from a sampling frame, inclusive of public and private sectors. This study utilized a broad perspective (i.e. costs to the health system and patients/families). The unit costs of MNH services were determined through a simultaneous allocation method in the public facilities; and patient billing department in the private facilities. Descriptive analysis was performed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to compare overall mean costs both within and between health facilities. A total of 31 eligible health providers and facilities (n = 25 in private; n = 7 in public) were included in the final analysis. An ambulatory visit (AV) for routine antenatal care (ANC) costs $3.6 and $0.9 at secondary- and tertiary-level public facilities, respectively. In the private sector, the costs of an AV for ANC were slightly less ($2.8) at secondary-level and much higher ($6) at tertiary-level facilities compared to the public sector. Diagnostic test costs were much higher in private facilities. The average costs of inpatient admissions were $30.5 at general ward (GW), and $151 at the intensive care unit (ICU) in public facilities. In-patient admissions costs were lower such as $9.3 at GW and $36.5 at ICU in private facilities. Understanding cost is critical to guide decisions of resource allocation within the public sector; and risk mitigation for excessive OOP costs through third party payer for services in the private sector."
https://openalex.org/W2903511138,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) is the major risk population of HIV-1 infection in Taiwan, and its surveillance has become critical in HIV-1 prevention. We recruited MSM subjects from 17 high-risk venues and 4 community centers in northern and southern Taiwan for anonymous HIV-1 screening during 2013-2015. Blood samples were obtained for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis, and a questionnaire survey covering demographic variables and social behavior was conducted. In total, 4,675 subjects were enrolled, yielding a HIV-1 prevalence rate of 4.3% (201/4675). Eight risk factors including subjects who did not always use condoms (OR = 1.509, p = 0.0123), those who used oil-based lubricants (OR = 1.413, p = 0.0409), and those who used recreational drugs (OR = 2.182, p = < .0001) had a higher risk of HIV-1 infection. The annual prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 showed a downward trend from 2013 to 2015 (6.56%, 5.97 per 100 person-years in 2013; 4.53%, 3.97 per 100 person-years in 2014; 1.84%, 2.08 per 100 person-years in 2015). Factors such as always using condoms, water-based lubricant use, correct knowledge of lubricating substitutes, and recreational drug use were significantly associated with the trend of incidence. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the cross-regional and international interaction of the local MSM population may have facilitated transmission of HIV. This survey of high-risk venues showed decreased prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 infection in Taiwan from 2013 to 2015, and this may be related to changes in behavioral patterns. Moreover, cross-regional interaction and recreational drug use need to be considered in future surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2903912755,"Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is widely used in wildlife research to study animal movement and habitat use. In order to evaluate the quality and reliability of GPS data, the factors influencing the performance of these devices must be known, especially for semiaquatic species, because terrestrial and aquatic habitat might affect GPS performance differently. We evaluated the location error and fix success rate of three GPS receiver models in stationary tests and on a semi-aquatic mammal, the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber). The location error during stationary tests was on average 15.7 m, and increased with increasing canopy closure, slope, and horizontal dilution of precision, potentially leading to the erroneous classification of GPS positions when studying habitat use in animals. In addition, the position of the GPS antenna (flat versus 90° tilted) affected the location error, suggesting that animal behavior affects GPS performance. The fix success rate was significantly higher during stationary tests compared to when GPS units were deployed on beavers (94% versus 86%). Further, GPS receivers did not obtain any positions underwater and underground, the latter potentially allowing the estimation of activity periods in animals that use lodges or burrows as shelter. We discuss the possibilities for data screening, the use of buffer zones along the shoreline, and combination with other data loggers to avoid the erroneous classification of GPS positions when studying habitat use."

This RIA was used to analyze sera pertaining to a cohort of 711 subjects, comprising 368 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 140 with bipolar disorder, 58 individuals diagnosed of other mental disorders, and 118 healthy comparison subjects. We identified one patient whose serum tested positive although with very low levels (0.2 nM) for α7 AChR-specific antibodies by RIA. Three out of 711 sera contained antibodies against iodine 125-labelled α-bungarotoxin, because they precipitated with it in the absence of α7 AChR. This first evidence suggests that autoantibodies against α7 AChR are absent or very rare in these clinical groups."

In this work, we use synchrotron X-ray microtomography for non-invasive 3D imaging of fresh bagasse particles, which allows the visualization of intraparticle water. The sclerified fiber cells in the sheaths surrounding xylem vessels are often found full of water. We suggest this can be juice preserved from the native stalks as many sclerified fibers seem to keep their structural integrity despite the mechanical action during sugarcane crushing. The microtomograms of fresh bagasse also shows mineral particles adhered to biomass surfaces, with adhesion presumably favored by the presence of water. In summary, this work unveils the location of water in fresh bagasse, solving an old mystery of sugarcane technology."
https://openalex.org/W2899937029,"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a serious, preventable public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Research indicates that adults suffering from long term, disabling conditions are more likely to be victims of IPV due to the intersection of disease-associated stigma and discrimination. IPV in turn is known to worsen the overall health and wellbeing of those affected by it. Little research however explores the relationship between neglected tropical diseases such as podoconiosis and IPV. This study explores the relationship between IPV and podoconiosis in northern Ethiopia with the aim of identifying new avenues for limiting disability and promoting the wellbeing of people affected by this neglected tropical disease.The study was conducted in East and West Gojjam zones, located in the Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. Research participants were first screened using the domestic violence screening tool Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream (HITS). Data were collected by native speakers of the local language (Amharic) in the form of semi-structured interviews during January and February 2016. Thematic and content data analysis was carried out, using the Open Code 3.4 qualitative data analysis software for coding.A total of 15 women living with podoconiosis and experiencing IPV were interviewed (aged 31 to 75). Women experienced different forms of IPV, including beatings (with or without an object), insults, name calling, undermining, denial of equal rights over common assets, movement monitoring, cheating, abandonment, forced divorce, obstruction of health care access, inhibition of decision-making and sexual coercion. Podoconiosis increases the frequency and severity of IPV and in occasions shapes a change from physical to psychological and financial violence. In turn, frequent episodes of IPV worsen disease outcomes and contribute to disease persistence in the region, in that these impede women's ability to manage the disease and help perpetuate the conditions of poverty that influence disease onset.Women living with podoconiosis are victims of various, overlapping forms of IPV that negatively impact their health and wellbeing. Poverty, scarce IPV prevention services in the area together with a social acceptance of IPV and these women's decreased ability to work due to the debilitating effects of podoconiosis and childcare responsibilities frequently prompt these women to tolerate IPV and remain in abusive relationships. Tackling disease-associated taboo and stigma, developing accessible IPV interventions, working towards greater gender equality at the household and societal levels and developing sustainable strategies for improving the socio-economic assets of women affected by podoconiosis are all necessary to both prevent IPV and to improve disease outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2903619421,"As the big data science develops, efficient methods are demanded for various data analysis. Granger causality provides the prime model for quantifying causal interactions. However, this theoretic model does not meet the requirement for real-world data analysis, because real-world time series are diverse whose models are usually unknown. Therefore, model-free measures such as information transfer measures are strongly desired. Here, we propose the multi-scale extension of conditional mutual information measures using MORLET wavelet, which are named the WM and WPM. The proposed measures are computational efficient and interpret information transfer by multi-scales. We use both synthetic data and real-world examples to demonstrate the efficiency of the new methods. The results of the new methods are robust and reliable. Via the simulation studies, we found the new methods outperform the wavelet extension of transfer entropy (WTE) in both computational efficiency and accuracy. The features and properties of the proposed measures are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2903762040,"Objective To determine whether a tailored multifaceted implementation strategy improves the initial management of patients with suspected encephalitis. Design Pragmatic two arm cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Hospitals within the United Kingdom. Participants Twenty-four hospitals nested within 12 postgraduate deaneries. Patients were identified retrospectively by searching discharge, microbiology, radiology and pharmacy records and included if they met clinical criteria or had a recorded suspicion of encephalitis. Intervention An implementation strategy designed to overcome barriers to change, comprising local action planning, education and training, feedback on performance, a lumbar puncture pack and a range of optional components. Outcomes The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with suspected encephalitis undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture within 12 hours of admission and starting aciclovir treatment within six hours. Secondary outcomes included the proportions of adults and children who had a lumbar puncture, who had appropriate cerebrospinal fluid investigations, and who had appropriate radiological imaging within 24 hours of admission. Data were collected from patient records for 12 months before and 12 months during the intervention period, and analysed blind to allocation. Results 13 hospitals were randomised to intervention and 11 to control (no intervention), with 266 and 223 patients with suspected encephalitis identified respectively. There was no significant difference in primary outcome between intervention and control hospitals (13.5% and 14.8% respectively, p = 0.619; treatment effect -0.188, 95% confidence interval -0.927 to 0.552), but both had improved compared to pre-intervention (8.5%). Conclusion The improvement in both intervention and control arms may reflect overall progress in management of encephalitis through wider awareness and education. Trial registration Controlled Trials: ISRCTN06886935."
https://openalex.org/W2904961760,"In the current study, we performed a complete analysis, with four different methods, of all four HER family receptors, in a series of patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based regimens and evaluated their prognostic value. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 227 patients, considered to be HER2-positive when assessed at the local laboratories. We evaluated gene amplification, copy number variations (CNVs), mRNA and protein expression of all four HER family members. In addition, our analysis included the evaluation of several other factors by immunohistochemistry (IHC), such as pHER2Tyr1221/1222, pHER2Tyr877 and PTEN. Central review of HER2 status by IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that of the 227 patients, only 139 (61.2%) were truly HER2-positive. Regarding the 191 patients treated with trastuzumab as first-line therapy, median time to progression (TTP) was 15.3 and 10.4 months for HER2-positive and HER2-negative participants, respectively, whereas median survival was 50.4 and 38.1 months, respectively. In HER2-positive patients, high HER3 mRNA expression was of favorable prognostic significance for TTP and survival (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88, Wald's p = 0.022 and HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88, p = 0.021, respectively), while EGFR copy gain and EGFR protein expression were associated with higher risk for disease progression in HER2-negative patients (HR = 3.53, 95% CI 1.19-10.50, p = 0.023 and HR = 3.37, 95% CI 1.12-10.17, p = 0.031, respectively). Positive HER3 protein expression was a favorable factor for TTP in HER2-negative patients (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.84, p = 0.014). In the multivariate analysis, only EGFR copy gain retained its prognostic significance for TTP in the HER2-negative population (HR = 3.96, 95% CI 1.29-12.16, p = 0.016), while high HER3 mRNA expression retained its favorable prognostic significance for TTP in the HER2-positive subgroup (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.99, p = 0.048). The present study suggests that EGFR copy gain represents a negative prognostic factor for TTP in HER2-negative patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab. In addition, high HER3 mRNA expression appears to be of favorable prognostic significance for TTP in HER2-positive patients. Given the small number of patients included in the current analysis and the retrospective nature of the study, our findings should be validated in larger cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2903657806,"Introduction We still lack information about how changes in modifiable health risk behaviors influence the utilization of healthcare services. This study assesses the relationships between prospective patterns of modifiable health risk behaviors and the utilization of healthcare services. Material and methods This was a prospective study among men and women participants in the Health Workers Cohort Study, aged 18 years and older. The following data about modifiable health risk behaviors was collected in two waves of the study (2004–2006 and 2010–2012): 1) physical activity, b) consumption of fruit and vegetables, 3) alcohol, and 4) tobacco consumption, to determine the association between the utilization of healthcare services after 6 years of follow-up (period 2010–2012). Information was collected through self-administered questionnaires; clinical and anthropometric variables were measured following standard procedures. Analyses were conducted using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Results Participants with a pattern of consumption of < 3 portions of fruits and vegetables per day (p = 0.035) and did not meet recommended levels of PA (p = 0.013) during the two waves of the study had fewer preventative consultations; those who quit smoking reported a higher frequency of preventative consultations (p = 0.021) and more visits with a medical specialist (p = 0.048). Participants who reduced alcohol consumption to low or completely stopped its consumption reported fewer visits to the general physician (p = 0.031), p < 0.05. Conclusions Changes in prospective patterns of modifiable health risk behaviors influenced the use of healthcare services after 6 years of follow-up. Findings in this study could be useful to determine possible demands of healthcare services among populations with specific modifiable health risk behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2903840192,"Local anesthetics (LAs) are increasingly used as therapeutics due to their multiple molecular effects. They may be potential agents also in gynecology and reproductive medicine. The objective of this study was to investigate the contractility response of the perfused swine uterus to different concentrations of the LAs procaine, lidocaine, and ropivacaine.In an extracorporeal perfusion model with fresh swine uteri, effects of administered boli of these three LAs in concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL on uterine contractility and peristalsis were assessed using an intrauterine double-chip micro-catheter. A dose-dependent increase in intrauterine pressure (IUP) in the isthmus and corpus uteri was observed after the administration of the ester-LA procaine 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0%, which was not seen with lower concentrations, or buffer solution. An increase-decrease curve was found after increasing concentrations of the amide-LA lidocaine and ropivacaine, with an IUP plateau with 0.1 and 0.5%, and a decrease with 1% (p<0.01). All reactions were seen in both the isthmus and corpus uteri. The difference of the contractility pattern between ester- and amide-LA at 1% concentration was significant.LAs dose-dependently modulate contractility in non-pregnant swine uteri. The amid-LAs lidocaine and ropivacaine reduce contractility in higher concentrations and may be used as therapeutics in disorders with increased uterine contractility, as dysmenorrhoea, endometriosis, and infertility. The multiple molecular effects of LAs may explain these effects. This in-vitro pilot study in vitro provides initial data for designing further studies to transfer the results onto humans."
https://openalex.org/W2904126007,"Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an upper respiratory tract disease of chickens that is caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), an alphaherpesvirus. This disease causes significant economic loses in poultry industries worldwide. Despite widespread use of commercial live attenuated vaccines, many poultry industries continue to experience outbreaks of disease caused by ILTV. Efforts to improve the control of this disease have resulted in the generation of new vaccine candidates, including ILTV mutants deficient in virulence factors. A glycoprotein G deletion mutant vaccine strain of ILTV (ΔgG ILTV), recently licenced as Vaxsafe ILT (Bioproperties Pty Ltd), has been extensively characterised in vitro and in vivo, but the minimum effective dose required to protect inoculated animals has not been determined. This study performed a vaccination and challenge experiment to determine the minimum dose of ΔgG ILTV that, when delivered by eye-drop to seven-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens, would protect the birds from a robust challenge with a virulent field strain of virus (class 9 ILTV). A dose of 10(3.8) plaque forming units was the lowest dose capable of providing a high level of protection against challenge, as measured by clinical signs of disease, tracheal pathology and virus replication after challenge. This study has shown that the ΔgG ILTV vaccine strain is capable of inducing a high level of protection against a virulent field virus at a commercially feasible dose. These results lay the foundations upon which a commercial vaccine can be developed, thereby offering the potential to provide producers with another important tool to help control ILTV."
https://openalex.org/W2904546609,"Analytical similarity assessment of critical quality attributes (CQAs) serves as a foundation for the development of biosimilar products and facilitates an abbreviated subsequent clinical evaluation. In this study, we establish a statistical evaluation roadmap with statistical approaches for some selected CQAs from Tier 1, because they are most relevant to clinical outcomes and require the most rigorous statistical methods. In the roadmap, we incorporate 3 methods-ranking and tier assignment of quality attributes, the equivalence test, and the Mann-Whitney test for equivalence-that are important to determine analytical similarity between the reference and biosimilar products. For the equivalence test, we develop a power calculation formula based on the two one-sided tests procedure. Exact sample sizes can be numerically calculated. Then, we propose a flexible idea for selecting the number of reference lots (nR) and the number of biosimilar lots (nT) to adjust for serious unbalanced sample sizes. From results of extensive simulations under various parameter settings, we obtain a workable strategy to determine the optimum sample size combination (nT, nR) for the equivalence test of CQAs from Tier 1. R codes are provided to facilitate implementation of the roadmap and corresponding methods in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2904547580,"Research in perception and recognition demonstrates that a current decision (i) can be influenced by previous ones (i–j), meaning that subsequent responses are not always independent. Experiments 1 and 2 tested whether initial showup identification decisions impact choosing behavior for subsequent showup identification responses. Participants watched a mock crime film involving three perpetrators and later made three showup identification decisions, one showup for each perpetrator. Across both experiments, evidence for sequential dependencies for choosing behavior was not consistently predictable. In Experiment 1, responses on the third, target-present showup assimilated towards previous choosing. In Experiment 2, responses on the second showup contrasted previous choosing regardless of target-presence. Experiment 3 examined whether differences in number of test trials in the eyewitness (vs. basic recognition) paradigm could account for the absence of hypothesized ability to predict patterns of sequential dependencies in Experiments 1 and 2. Sequential dependencies were detected in recognition decisions over many trials, including recognition for faces: the probability of a yes response on the current trial increased if the previous response was also yes (vs. no). However, choosing behavior on previous trials did not predict individual recognition decisions on the current trial. Thus, while sequential dependencies did arise to some extent, results suggest that the integrity of identification and recognition decisions are not likely to be impacted by making multiple decisions in a row."
https://openalex.org/W2904179369,"When the full-bridge converter works under the light load condition, the power efficiency obtained by the theoretical model is much different from that of the actual converter. Facing with this situation, an improved power loss model based on the typical power loss model is proposed. In this paper, the typical power loss model is called typical model for short and the improved power loss model is called proposed model for short. Firstly, the antiparallel freewheeling diodes at the arms of full-bridge circuit are taken into account. Every barrier junction capacitance of Schottky diode in the rectifier circuit is neglected. Then, the turning-off loss of full-bridge and the core loss of inductive components (the transformer and the filter inductor) in the typical model are compensated and modified by combining the theoretical values with the measured input current under the minimum and the maximum output current. In addition, it also corrects the equivalent resistance related to the conduction loss of converter. Eventually, the proposed model is established. The rise time and fall time of the midpoint voltage of two arms, and the fluctuation degree of the reverse bias voltage related to the Schottky rectifier diodes are regarded as the local indexes. The conduction time of the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) in each switching period, and the power efficiency of converter are regarded as the global indexes. Based on the analyses, the local indexes are compared qualitatively, while the global indexes are compared quantitatively. It is found that the differences of the local indexes between the proposed model and the experiment are smaller than those between the typical model and the experiment. Meanwhile, the global indexes of the proposed model are closer to the experimental results. Therefore, it can be further demonstrated that the proposed model is more approximate to the actual converter than the typical model."
https://openalex.org/W2904208523,"We present a novel intensity-gradient based algorithm specifically designed for nanometer-segmentation of cell membrane contours obtained with high-resolution optical microscopy combined with high-velocity digital imaging. The algorithm relies on the image oversampling performance and computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs). Both, synthetic and experimental data are used to quantify the sub-pixel precision of the algorithm, whose analytic performance results comparatively higher than in previous methods. Results from the synthetic data indicate that the spatial precision of the presented algorithm is only limited by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the contour image. We emphasize on the application of the new algorithm to membrane fluctuations (flickering) in eukaryotic cells, bacteria and giant vesicle models. The method shows promising applicability in several fields of cellular biology and medical imaging for nanometer-precise boundary-determination and mechanical fingerprinting of cellular membranes in optical microscopy images. Our implementation of this high-precision flicker spectroscopy contour tracking algorithm (HiPFSTA) is provided as open-source at www.github.com/michaelmell/hipfsta."
