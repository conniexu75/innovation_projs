https://openalex.org/W1892152977,"The recording of oxidation-reduction-related fluorescence signals of oxidized flavoprotein (Fp) and reduced pyridine nucleotide (PN) from isolated mitochondria at temperatures below -80 degrees C can be accompanished with a high degree of accuracy and a wide dynamic range. The specific low temperature enhancement of the fluorescence signals due to increased quantum yield and to multiple scattering affords increased accuracy and less interference due to screening pigments such as hemoglobin and myoglobin. Since the metabolic processes are arrested and the recording speed can be greatly diminished, the technique can operate with a much smaller concentration of mitochondria than is needed at room temperature, and the method is suitable for localized oxidation-reduction measurements. The Fp and PN signals originate from the mitochondrial matrix space in which they represent the major fluorochromes. Since Fp and PN are near oxidation-reduction equilibrium, the ratio of the two fluorescence intensities, suitably normalized, approximates the oxidation-reduction ratio of oxidized flavoprotein/reduced pyridine nucleotide. Thus, this technique affords a foundation for the resolution of oxidation-reduction states in two and three dimensions."

https://openalex.org/W1580451106,"The glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus was selectively liberated from the virion membrane by the dialyzable nonionic detergent, beta-D-octylglucoside. The isolated viral glycoprotein could be rendered virtually free of phospholipid and detergent, under which conditions it formed tail-to-tail glycoprotein micelles in the form of rosettes. When mixtures of viral glycoprotein and egg lecithin were dialyzed free of octylglucoside, glycoprotein vesicles formed spontaneously with spikes protruding in the same external orientation as the VS virion membrane. The glycoprotein vesicles exhibited increased and uniform buoyant density, indicating relative homogeneity in the proportion of glycoprotein and phosphatidylcholine in each glycoprotein liposome. Evidence for similar insertion and orientation of VS viral glycoprotein in both phosphatidylcholine vesicles and virion membrane was substantiated by the finding that proteolytic digestion with thermolysin gave rise to hydrophobic glycoprotein tail fragments in vesicle or virion membranes that migrated identically in polyacrylamide gels."
https://openalex.org/W56871932,"A protein which can associate with the Ca”-dependent modulator protein resulting in the inhibition of the Ca’+-activatable cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase has been discovered recently and designated as modulator binding protein (Wang, J. H., and Desai, R. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252,4175-4183; Klee, C. B., and Krinks, M. H. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 120-126). This protein is purified from bovine brain to near homogeneity. The purification procedure is based mainly on the Ca’+dependent association of this protein with the highly acidic modulator protein. The purified modulator binding protein is shown to be a globular protein of molecular weight 85,000. It contains two distinct subunits, subunits A and B, of molecular weights about 60,000 and 14,500, respectively. The mass ratio of subunits A/ B is determined to be about 2.3 : 1. From these results, the subunit structure of modulator binding protein is suggested to be AB2. In the presence of 6 M urea, modulator binding protein dissociates into its constituent subunits, and subunits A and B can be separated on a G-100 Sephadex column. The isolated subunit A exhibits inhibitory activity against the Ca”-activatable cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Subunit B has no phosphodiesterase inhibiting activity, nor does it affect the activity of subunit A in the enzyme reaction. These results suggest that subunit A is responsible for the association of modulator binding protein to the modulator protein. The function of subunit B is not known at present."

The oligosaccharide contains 2 N-acetylglucosamine, 9 mannose, and 3 glucose residues. The N-acetylglucosamine residues are located at the reducing terminus. The 3 glucose residues are arranged in a linear order at one of the nonreducing termini in the sequence Glc 1,2--Glc 1,3--Glc--(Man)9 (GlcNAc)2. The structural analysis was made possible largely by the availability of glucosidase preparations of fungal anad microsomal origin which remove glucose residues from the oligosaccharide without releasing mannose residues."
https://openalex.org/W2343241053,"Two recombinant plasmids containing chick collagen DNA sequences have been used to characterize messenger RNAs for pro-alpha1 (type I) and pro-alpha2 collagen. Poly(A)-containing RNA from chick embryo calvaria and long bones, tissues which are very active in collagen synthesis, were electrophoresed on agarose gels containing methylmercuric hydroxide and transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper; these covalently bound RNAs were hybridized to 32P-labeled pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 collagen DNA sequences derived from the recombinant plasmids. The pro-alpha1 collagen probe identified two RNAs, a major species of 5000 bases and a minor species of 7100 bases; the pro-alpha2 collagen probe hybridized to a major species very similar in size to the pro-alpha1 mRNA, about 5200 bases, and a minor species of 5700 bases. It is possible that the 7100 and 5700 base RNAs represent precursors of pro-alpha1 and pro-alpha2 collagen mRNA, respectively. When similar hybridization experiments were performed with RNA from chick embryo fibroblasts, both the pro-alpha1 and pro-alpha2 collagen mRNAs were observed, as well as their corresponding larger species. With RNAs from fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, however, the levels of all RNA species which hybridized with the pro-alpha1 and pro-alpha2 collagen DNA probes were significantly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W202219468,"The radiolabeled β-adrenergic antagonists (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol binds to a single class of noncooperative sites on turkey erythrocyte membranes. These sites have previously been identified as the functional β-adrenergic receptors. Treatment of the membranes with the reducing agent dithiothreitol causes a decrease in the number of binding sites, without affecting the affinity of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol for the remaining sites. The binding activity is partially restored by extensive washing of the dithiothreitol-treated membranes. No restoration occurs when the wash buffer contains 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 10 mM reduced glutathione. The effect of dithiohreitol is mimicked by a hundredfold higher concentration of the monosulfydryl derivatives: reduced glutathione, cysteine, and mercaptoethanol. In contrast, treatment of the membranes with the metal chelators ethylenediamine tetraacetate and ethylene glycol bis(β-amino-ethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid (10 mM) does not affect (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Kinetic data indicate that dithiothreitol inactivates the β-receptors according to a bimolecular reaction mechanism, with a second order rate constant (k2) of approximately 1.27 M-1 x S-1 at 30°C. The data suggest that dithiothreitol inactivates the β-receptors by reducing one or more disulfide bonds. Both β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists cause an effective protection of the (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites against inactivation by dithiothreitol. The protection is dose-dependent, and linearly related to the fraction of receptor sites occupied by the tracer. The protection is stereospecific for both agonists (epinephrine) and antagonists (propranolol) and reflects, for the same concentration of agonists, the order of affinities for the receptor. The α-adrenergic agents clonidine (agonist) and phentolamine (antagonist), and the nonbioactive compound pyrocatechol do not confer an appreciable protection at concentrations as high as 100 μM. Receptor protection by β-adrenergic agonists and antagonists proceed by causing a conformational change of the receptors as to bury the disulfide bonds or by shielding bonds located near or at the binding site of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1527233066,"The soluble high Km form of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.4.1.17) was purified over 2000-fold from bovine brain homogenates principally using blue dextran-Sepharose chromatography. The purified protein has a specific enzymic activity of 167 units/mg and appears homogeneous when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 1.26 +/- 0.05 x 10(5) consisting of two apparently identical polypeptide chains. Kinetic measurements indicate that the substrates cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP each have a single Km value, 9 +/- 1 micron and 150 +/- 50 micron, respectively, that the two cyclic nucleotides compete for the same catalytic site, that the blue dye of blue dextran-Sepharose is a competitive inhibitor for the cyclic nucleotides, and that the Vmax with cyclic AMP as substrate is about an order of magnitude larger than that for cyclic GMP. Bovine brain calmodulin stimulates the catalytic rate of the purified enzyme in the presence of Ca2+ by increasing the Vmax associated with each cyclic nucleotide substrate."

Corticomedial amygdala neurons which projected to the capsule of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W1539871947,"A cyclic AMP-independent casein (phosvitin) kinase eluted from a phosphocellulose column with 0.35 M KCl also possesses glycogen synthase kinase activity. This kinase, designated synthase kinase 1, is separable from other cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases, which also contain glycogen synthase kinase activity, by chromatography on a phosphocellulose column. This kinase was purified 15,000-fold from the crude extract. Synthase kinase activity co-purifies with casein and phosvitin kinase activities. Heat inactivation of these three kinase activities follow similar kinetics. It is suggested that these three kinase activities reside in a single protein. This kinase has a molecular weight of approximately 34,000 as determined by glycerol density gradient centrifugation and by gel filtration. The Km values for the synthase kinase-catalyzed reaction are 0.12 mg/ml (0.35 micronM) for synthase, 12 micronM for ATP, and 0.15 mM for Mg2+. The phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by the kinase results in the incorporation of 4 mol of phosphate/85,000 subunit; however, only two of the phosphate sites predominantly determine the glucose-6-P dependency of the synthase. Synthase kinase activity is sensitive to inhibition by NaCl or KCl at concentrations encountered during purification. Synthase kinase activity is insensitive to the allosteric effector (glucose-6-P) or substrate (UDP-glucose) of glycogen synthase at concentrations usually found under physiological condition."

Binding by larval and adult liver and by kidney before larval stage XVII was low or nondetectable. Renal binding increased during metamorphic climax and in response to treatment with thyroid hormone. The emergence of renal binding of prolactin may signify a shift in the hormone's participation in the control of hydromineral homeostasis from the gill, which is resorbed, to the kidney. A renal action of prolactin during climax may facilitate metamorphosis."

https://openalex.org/W1582983825,"Chick cells infected with Rous sarcoma virus are characterized by a wide variety of changes known collectively as transformation. Among these are decreases in the level of procollagen biosynthesis and in the level of procollagen mRNA. In this communication, we examine the time course of the decrease in procollagen biosynthesis, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and collagenase assay, and compare it with the decrease in procollagen mRNA sequences measured by hybridization to a complementary DNA. Procollagen biosynthesis and procollagen mRNA sequences decrease simultaneously after infection. Even the initial decrease in procollagen biosynthesis, therefore, is due to a decline in the level of procollagen mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1507640494,"Abstract Two binuclear iron-sulfur clusters (designated S-1 and S-2) are present in succinate dehydrogenase in approximately equal concentration to that of flavin. The large difference in their midpoint potentials (0 and -400 mV, respectively, in the soluble enzyme) permits the acquisition of individual electron paramagnetic resonance spectra characterized by nearly identical rhombic g tensors (gz = 2.025, gy = 1.93, gx = 1.905). Spin-coupling between the two centers is manifested by broadening and splitting of spectra of reconstitutively active and inactive succinate dehydrogenase, respectively, as the temperature is lowered; relief of power saturation of Center S-1 spectra on reduction of Center S 2; and observation of half-field (delta ms = 2) signals in the dithionite-reduced enzyme. Saturation behavior of fully reduced dehydrogenase is consistent with the presence of S-1 and S-2 at equivalent concentrations/molecule. Simulation of the spin-coupled spectra, assuming dipolar interaction, provides information on molecular structure. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the enzyme in 80% dimethylsulfoxide are nearly identical to the characteristic binuclear spectra obtained with adrenodoxin. These data provide additional evidence for binuclear structure of both Center S-1 and S-2. The extremely fast relaxation of Center S-2 at low temperatures would imply either an anomalously small value of J or an alternative relaxation mechanism, possibly due to the coupling between S-1 and S-2."

https://openalex.org/W1520548658,"The influence of cyclic AMP on the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine, the major component of pulmonary surfactant was examined in a cell line (A549) with type 2 pneumonocyte characteristics. It was found that cyclic AMP increased both the total amount of phosphatidylcholine and disaturated phosphatidylcholine as well as the incorporation of [3H]choline into these fractions. The effect was specific for cyclic AMP since 5'-AMP, adenosine, and cyclic GMP did not alter phosphatidylcholine or disaturated phosphatidylcholine levels. Cyclic AMP had no effect on phosphatidylcholine and disaturated phosphatidylcholine metabolism in another non-type 2 human epithelial cell line (MA-160). Since the ability of various cyclic AMP analogs to increase phosphatidylcholine and disaturated phosphatidylcholine levels was correlated with their ability to activate protein kinase, it seems likely that a protein phosphorylation mechanism is involved in controlling phosphatidylcholine metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2134217220,"The calcium-sensitive phosphodiesterase-stimulating activity sometimes associated with parvalbumin preparations is due to contaminating (less than 0.1%) amounts of carp muscle CDR (calcium-dependent regulator)-like protein. This protein can be resolved from parvalbumins by Sephadex G-75 chromatography and has many characteristics of the CDR. Parvalbumin itself causes a nonspecific stimulation of phosphodiesterase at all calcium concentrations which, in the presence of CDR, can cause an apparent shift to a lower concentration of the calcium level required for half-maximal stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1507406803,"Abstract Li+, K+, and Rb+ are compared as activators of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate by beef brain (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. Previous experiments have established two classes of K+ binding that are involved in this reaction: sites have the higher affinity, their occupation is essential for catalytic activity, and they appear to correspond to the extracellular binding for active K+ transport; regulatory appear to have an allosteric function to unmask the catalytic sites. A separate set of Na+-binding regulatory bring about a similar unmasking of catalytic under phosphorylating conditions. Rb+ can activate p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis both in the presence and absence of Na+ and, thus, can interact effectively with both K+ regulatory and catalytic sites. Li+ does not activate p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis at 25 degrees C in the absence of other monovalent ligands. Li+ does activate when the catalytic are exposed by Na+ + ATP. Thus, K+ regulatory and catalytic differ in their cation selectivity. At temperatures less than 25 degrees C Li+ is able to activate the phosphatase reaction in the absence of other monovalent ligands: maximum activity occurs at 10-12 degrees C. A plot of the ratio, Li+ activation/K+ activation, as a function of temperature shows that the allosteric transition that unmasks catalytic occurs spontaneously with decreasing temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1534163737,"Initial rate kinetic studies with bovine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase were carried out in both directions of the reaction to determine the sequence of product release from the enzyme. Product inhibition by fructose-6-P was found to be S-linear, I-linear noncompetitive relative to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, whereas inorganic orthophosphate was determined to be linear competitive with respect to the substrate. The kinetics of the reverse reaction were studied by coupling the phosphatase reaction to the aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, and glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase reactions. The kinetic results were found to be in harmony with the Uni Bi ordered and random sequential mechanisms as well as a Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism. The nomenclature is that of Cleland (Cleland, W.W. (1963) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 67, 104-137). However, nonkinetic considerations, when taken together with the kinetic results, suggest that the steady state ordered Uni Bi mechanism is the most likely possibility. There is evidence that isomerization of the binary complex of enzyme and phosphate occurs in the kinetic mechanism. Although magnesium is required for the reverse reaction, there is no evidence to suggest that the enzyme discriminates between the magnesium-associated or divalent cation-free forms of the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1488005678,"The kinetics of complementation of ferric heme fragments and apofragments of horse heart cytochrome c have been investigated using stopped flow techniques. When changes in fluorescence are monitored, a single phase exhibiting second order kinetics is observed for all cases of productive complexes. The rate constants are independent of the presence of overlapping amino acid sequences in the apofragments but are strongly dependent on the amino acid sequences of the heme fragments. Thus for heme fragment (l-38)H, a rate constant of 2.1 X 10’ M-' s-l is obtained with apofragments (l-104), (23-104), and (56-104). For (l-53)H with (l-104) or (54-104), it is 1.5 X 10’ M-’ s-l. The complementation of (l-25)H with (l-104) or (23-104) results in a rate constant of 3.2 x 10’ M-’ s-l, which is greater by an order of magnitude than those for the other heme fragments. In the presence of 10 mM imidazole, the rate constants dramatically increase to 3.1 x 106, and 2.4 x lo6 M-’ s-l for heme fragments (l-38)H and (l-53)H, respectively, but only by approximately 2-fold for (l25)H. This result is attributed to a change in the axial coordination group of the heme iron atom in fragments (l-38)H and (l-53)H from histidine 33 (or 26) to an imidazole molecule, which in turn results in a major perturbation of the interactions between the heme moiety and its host peptide. When the complementation of the productive complexes is monitored by changes in the Soret absorbance, the data cannot be fit to either first order or second order kinetic equations. However, the results for a nonproductive complex ((l-25)H plus apofragment (39-104)) are identical in both absorbance and fluorescence modes. The data can be fit to an equilibrium process with a rate constant of formation of 1.3 x lo6 M-’ s-l and that of dissociation of 0.95 s-l. Thus, the formation of productive complexes appears to involve a second phase of the reaction which does not occur in the case of the nonproductive complex and which causes no additional fluorescence change but does result in further absorbance changes."

With the natural substrate orcinol, 4R chirality was maintained. In kinetic isotope experiments reported here, we demonstrate in fact that orcinol hydroxylase maintains 4R stereospecificity with respect to dihydronicotinamide oxidation with all three substrates, orcinol, resorcinol, and m-cresol. Deuterium and tritium kinetic isotope effects were detected under Vmax conditions with (4R)-[4-2H]-, and (4R)-[4-3H]NADH for all three substrates.

Solvent perturbation absorption difference spectra were measured using ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sucrose at concentrations between 0 and 30%. Cytochrome c appears to exhibit a somewhat greater extent of heme exposure than cytochrome c2 for both the oxidized and reduced states. These results suggest that the lower oxidation-reduction potential of cytochrome c may in part be due to a greater extent of exposure of the heme. The oxidized state of both proteins appears to exhibit a greater exposure than that of the reduced state which is consistent with a more favorable environment for the charge on the ferric heme coordination center."

Similar effects of spermine were observed on the enzyme at several stages of purification. Spermidine and putrescine were also inhibitory but higher concentrations were required. In the absence of Ca2+ and CDR, the enzyme exhibited two apparent Km values for cGMP (2.5 and 20 microM) which were unaltered by spermine. In the presence of Ca2+ and CDR (when spermine had no effect on activity), a single Km (3.5 microM) was observed. Enzyme purified by chromatography on CDR-Sepharose was rapidly inactivated during incubation at 30 degrees C in 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with EDTA and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Spermine (20 microM) partially stabilized enzyme activity under these conditions, although it was somewhat less effective than 2 mM MgCl2. The inhibitory effects of spermine (or other polyamines) on basal phosphodiesterase activity, which can be overcome by Ca2+ and CDR, could be important in the regulation of cellular cyclic nucleotide content."

The persistent visna infection is not preceded by an acute clinical phase or by rapid virus replication. This is puzzling because visna virus replicates rapidly in sheep cell cultures2,3. In an attempt to resolve this paradox we inoculated visna virus into sheep cell cultures maintained in fluids with 90% sheep serum but otherwise containing the same nutrients as control cultures maintained without serum. We found that viral growth was much slower in cultures with 90% serum than in control cultures. Further experiments showed that normal sheep sera inactivate visna virus rapidly at 37 °C. We conclude that sheep sera have a visna virus inhibiting factor (VIF) and hypothesise that VIF inhibits early spread of visna virus in inoculated sheep and may be involved in initiating the persistent infection."

https://openalex.org/W1581672687,"Subunit inequivalence in the photooxidation of human oxyhemoglobin was investigated by quantitative analysis of the fraction of alpha and beta chains oxidized after low intensity flash photolysis using white light in quartz cuvettes. This reaction was previously shown to generate methemoglobin and superoxide anion as photoproducts (Demma, L.S., and Salhany, J.M. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1226-1230). The present results indicate that superoxide anion photodissociates from the alpha chain about 3 to 4 times more extensively than from beta. This difference was observed in the presence of superoxide dismutase and catalase at both pH 7 and 9, suggesting that photolysis is directly responsible. The reaction of superoxide anion with oxyhemoglobin was also studied with the same analytical methods and no chain differences could be observed. If the electronic structure of the oxyheme complex is viewed as a spin equilibrium between a singlet ground state and a charge transfer configuration, our results may indicate that the uv component of white light perturbs this equilibrium to a greater extent in the oxygenated alpha chain, implying that the separation of energy levels may be smaller in that chain as compared with beta."

https://openalex.org/W1522676309,"The reaction of HCN with ferromyeloperoxidase involves the sequential formation of two monocyanide complexes. The first complex, which forms immediately on mixing, is characterized by a red shift in the Soret band of the ferroperoxidase, and a dissociation constant (measured as a Michaelis constant) of 0.67 mM. The second complex arises from the first via a first order process, whose maximal rate is 0.095 s-1 at 25 degrees C, pH 7.0. This more stable complex is characterized by a blue shift in the Soret and alpha bands and by an overall dissociation constant in the region of 4.5 microM. This gives a free energy difference between the two complexes of around 3.0 kcal mol-1 and a difference in optical absorption of 15 nm (Soret). The measured Arrhenius activation energy for the conversion of the high energy, long wavelength complex to the low energy, short wavelength complex is 16.3 kcal mol-1. A larger blue shift is observed on protein denaturation (34 nm), after which the two-step binding reaction is not observed. This, and the magnitude of the activation energy in the spontaneous complex interconversion process, shows that the latter is a conformational process. In addition, it can be concluded that the unknown structural feature of the heme site which is responsible for the anomalous red shift in the optical spectrum of native ferromyeloperoxidase, is also the link between the ligand state of the iron and the protein conformation."

The two-step protocols also resulted in the co-purification of a low molecular weight core protein from each virus. Recoveries of the viral proteins purified by this method, based on per cent contribution of individual polypeptides to total virion proteins, were 70% or greater. Radioimmunocompetition analysis of the purified murine mammary tumor virus major core protein as well as analysis of the RNA binding properties of purified low molecular weight type C virus proteins suggests that neither antigenic reactivity nor specific RNA binding characteristics are altered by the purification protocols. The availability of these procedures should aid studies on the possible function and immunochemical properties of the native murine oncornaviral phosphoproteins and may also be extended to the purification of other oncornaviral proteins."
