https://openalex.org/W2004679302,"Two genetically distinct clones of the asexual triploid fish Poeciliopsis 2 monacha-lucida inhabit the Rio del Fuerte of northwestern Mexico. Their coexistence apparently depends on feeding specializations that result in partitioning of the limited food resources in the desert streams. The findings suggest that these asexual organisms have sufficient clonal diversity to occupy a broad, heterogeneous, adaptive zone."
https://openalex.org/W1969024991,"Electrophoretic analyses of the (Z) and (E) pheromone-attracted males of Ostrinia nubilalis (HÃ¼bner), the European corn borer, in an area of coexistence indicate that these strains are not freely interbreeding. Although the populations are morphologically indistinguishable, studies of allozyme, pheromone, and hybridization suggest that the (Z) and (E) entities are genetically differentiated, perhaps to the status of semi- or sibling species."
https://openalex.org/W2106977539,"Alternating translucent and opaque bands on the roots of mammal teeth are used to determine the age and season of death. These structures are preserved in teeth from archeological sites. However, the standard sectioning technique, which includes decalcification, often destroys archeological specimens. A new, less destructive technique provides analyzable solid sections at costs comparable to decalcification."
https://openalex.org/W2067755655,"The first direct images of Io's sodium cloud are reported and analyzed. The observed cloud extends for more than 105 kilometers along Io's orbit and is a somewhat ""banana-shaped"" partial toroid. More sodium atoms precede Io than follow it. A model based on the escape of sodium from a specific localized area on Io provides a reasonable fit to the observed intensity distribution whereas isotropic escape does not."
https://openalex.org/W2044087035,"The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, a plausible regime for signals from extraterrestrial intelligences, is largely unexplored. With new technology, particularly in data processing and low-noise reception, surveys can be conducted over broad regions of frequency and space with existing antennas at flux densities plausible for interstellar signals. An all-sky, broad-band survey lasting perhaps 5 years can be structured so that even negative results would establish significant boundaries on the regime in which such signals may be found. The technology and techniques developed and much of the data acquired would be applicable to radio astronomy and deep-space communications."
https://openalex.org/W2046373371,"The paired fins of fishes were first used as props and supports for resting on the bottom; these were later used in a clumsy, walking manner, and this behavior perforce began first in the water, because the weak props could not support the animals without the water bouyancy; increased perfection of the mechanics of walking took place in the shallows; which was a refuge from the chief predators; the land was also attractive as a haven and as a source of food; the first vertebrate invaders of land probably had fins, and these became legs by enlargement of the fin base and loss of fin rays; these original limbs and girdles were weak and probably underwent a considerable period of evolution in swampy country; later they were perfected by further selection when it became necessary for early amphibians to move across dry land because of a failing local water supply. This syllogism conforms to the known behavior and capabilities of fishes and amphibians and to the general facts of zoology and paleontology. It suggests that common, continuous activities and stresses-escape from enemies and food getting-led to the origin of the tetrapod limb. This obviates the necessity for explaining how discontinuous and somewhat catastrophic events, such as the drying up of water bodies, could have led to the origin of limbs, which at the very outset had to be fairly strong. The general theory stated here is fairly clearly implied by Berry (8), who said, ""Those fishy pioneers with air-bladders -and paired fins-which, after ages of using their fins for pushing and paddling themselves over mud flats, gradually ventured onto drier and drier ground-where they avoided the competition for food-and the dangers of swarming hordes of ganoid pirates of the waters, were the ancestors of the amphibians."""
