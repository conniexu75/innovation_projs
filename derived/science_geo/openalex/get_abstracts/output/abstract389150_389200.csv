These disease-associated mutations are now shown to compromise TET2 catalytic activity: bone-marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations have low levels of 5-hmC in genomic DNA, and TET2 is required for normal haematopoietic differentiation. Measurement of genomic 5-hmC levels may prove valuable as a diagnostic tool in myeloid cancers. The TET family of enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. Mutations in the gene encoding TET2 are frequently observed in myeloid malignancies. Here it is shown that these disease-associated mutations compromise TET2 catalytic activity; bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations have low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA, and TET2 is required for normal haematopoietic differentiation. Measurement of genomic 5hmC levels may prove valuable as a diagnostic tool in myeloid cancers. TET2 is a close relative of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA1,2. The gene encoding TET2 resides at chromosome 4q24, in a region showing recurrent microdeletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies3. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and secondary AML (sAML)4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. We show here that TET2 mutations associated with myeloid malignancies compromise catalytic activity. Bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations displayed uniformly low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Moreover, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of Tet2 in mouse haematopoietic precursors skewed their differentiation towards monocyte/macrophage lineages in culture. There was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5hmC versus healthy controls, but samples from patients with low 5hmC showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites. Our results demonstrate that Tet2 is important for normal myelopoiesis, and suggest that disruption of TET2 enzymatic activity favours myeloid tumorigenesis. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1968972130,"George Daley and John Rinn and colleagues identify large intergenic non-coding RNAs that are upregulated during reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells, and they show a functional role for large intergenic non-coding RNA-RoR in induced pluripotent stem cell derivation. The conversion of lineage-committed cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming is accompanied by a global remodeling of the epigenome1,2,3,4,5, resulting in altered patterns of gene expression2,6,7,8,9. Here we characterize the transcriptional reorganization of large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs)10,11 that occurs upon derivation of human iPSCs and identify numerous lincRNAs whose expression is linked to pluripotency. Among these, we defined ten lincRNAs whose expression was elevated in iPSCs compared with embryonic stem cells, suggesting that their activation may promote the emergence of iPSCs. Supporting this, our results indicate that these lincRNAs are direct targets of key pluripotency transcription factors. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we found that one such lincRNA (lincRNA-RoR) modulates reprogramming, thus providing a first demonstration for critical functions of lincRNAs in the derivation of pluripotent stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W1984326475,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event in the progression toward cancer metastasis. The intermediate filament protein vimentin is an important marker of EMT and a requisite regulator of mesenchymal cell migration. However, it is not known how vimentin functionally contributes to cancer cell invasion. Here, we report that ectopic expression of oncogenic H-Ras-V12G and Slug induces vimentin expression and migration in pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Conversely, vimentin expression is necessary for Slug- or H-Ras-V12G-induced EMT-associated migration. Furthermore, silencing of vimentin in breast epithelial cells results in specific changes in invasiveness-related gene expression including upregulation of RAB25 (small GTPase Rab25) and downregulation of AXL (receptor tyrosine kinase Axl), PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase) and ITGB4 (integrin β4-subunit). Importantly, gene expression profiling analyses reveal that vimentin expression correlates positively/negatively with these genes also in multiple breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples. Focusing on the tyrosine kinase Axl, we show that induction of vimentin by EMT is associated with upregulation of Axl expression and that Axl enhances the migratory activity of pre-malignant breast epithelial cells. Using null and knock-down cells and overexpression models, we also show that regulation of breast cancer cell migration in two- and three-dimensional matrices by vimentin is Axl- dependent and that Axl functionally contributes to lung extravasation of breast cancer cells in mice. In conclusion, our data show that vimentin functionally contributes to EMT and is required for induction of Axl expression. Moreover, these results provide a molecular explanation for vimentin-dependent cancer cell migration during EMT by identifying Axl as a key proximal component in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2127654256,"Nanoparticles are under study for pulmonary drug delivery and are continually in contact with the lungs through air pollution. Choi et al. study the effects of size, charge and chemical composition on the behavior of nanoparticles in the rat lung. Nano-size particles show promise for pulmonary drug delivery, yet their behavior after deposition in the lung remains poorly understood. In this study, a series of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoparticles were systematically varied in chemical composition, shape, size and surface charge, and their biodistribution and elimination were quantified in rat models after lung instillation. We demonstrate that nanoparticles with hydrodynamic diameter (HD) less than ≈34 nm and a noncationic surface charge translocate rapidly from the lung to mediastinal lymph nodes. Nanoparticles of HD < 6 nm can traffic rapidly from the lungs to lymph nodes and the bloodstream, and then be subsequently cleared by the kidneys. We discuss the importance of these findings for drug delivery, air pollution and carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1998833977,"A hallmark of hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles is their association with host cell lipids, most notably lipoprotein components. It is thought that this property accounts for the low density of virus particles and their large heterogeneity. However, the composition of infectious virions and their biochemical and morphological properties are largely unknown. We developed a system in which the envelope glycoprotein E2 was N-terminally tagged with a FLAG epitope. This virus, designated Jc1E2FLAG, produced infectivity titers to wild type levels and allowed affinity purification of virus particles that were analyzed for their protein and lipid composition. By using mass spectrometry, we found the lipid composition of Jc1E2FLAG particles to resemble the one very low- and low density-lipoprotein with cholesteryl esters accounting for almost half of the total HCV lipids. Thus, HCV particles possess a unique lipid composition that is very distinct from all other viruses analyzed so far and from the human liver cells in which HCV was produced. By electron microscopy (EM), we found purified Jc1E2FLAG particles to be heterogeneous, mostly spherical structures, with an average diameter of about 73 nm.

Hepatology. 2002; 36: S35-S46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 3% of the world population is thought to be chronically infected with HCV, and these people have a high risk to develop serious liver diseases. As approved selective drugs are not available, chronic hepatitis C is treated with a combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. However, cure rates are not satisfactory, and treatment is associated with numerous side effects.HCV has been classified as the separate genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae to which the genera Pestivirus and Flavivirus belong. Viruses of this family possess a positive-strand RNA genome that in case of HCV is 9.6 kb long and encodes for a single polyprotein of ∼3,000 amino acids. It is cleaved co and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different products (2Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The N-terminally residing structural protein cores, envelope protein 1 (E1) and envelope protein 2 (E2), are thought to be the major constituents of infectious HCV particles. C-terminally of E2 resides p7, a small protein that forms oligomeric complexes acting as viroporin (3Griffin S.D. Harvey R. Clarke D.S. Barclay W.S. Harris M. Rowlands D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) that, together with p7, contributes to virus assembly (4Jones C.T. Murray C.L. Eastman D.K. Tassello J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8374-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 5Steinmann E. Penin F. Kallis S. Patel A.H. Bartenschlager R. Pietschmann T.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28546-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The other viral proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B most likely form the core of the HCV replicase that catalyzes the amplification of the viral RNA genome (2Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar).Although our knowledge about structure and (enzymatic) activities of viral proteins has increased tremendously (7Bartenschlager R. Frese M. Pietschmann T. Adv. Virus Res. 2004; 63: 71-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the biochemical and morphological features of HCV particles still remain elusive. This is mainly due to low virus titers in infected tissues and, until recently, the lack of culture systems producing sufficient amounts of infectious HCV particles. This hurdle has been overcome by the identification of a particular genotype 2a HCV isolate (designated JFH1) that replicates to very high levels in cell culture and supports infectious particle production (8Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 9Wakita T. Pietschmann T.

Moreover, highly efficient JFH1-derived chimeras have been generated. In some of them, the region encoding the JFH1 core to NS2 has been replaced by the corresponding region of other HCV isolates (10Gottwein J.M. Bukh J. Adv. Virus Res. 2008; 71: 51-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wölk B. Tellinghuisen T.L. Liu C.C. Maruyama T. Hynes R.O. Burton D.R. McKeating J.A.

Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Most efficient is the intragenotypic chimera Jc1 supporting virus titers in the range of 106 infectious units per ml, which is ∼1,000-fold higher as compared with JFH1 (12Pietschmann T. Kaul A. Koutsoudakis G. Shavinskaya A. Kallis S. Steinmann E. Abid K. Negro F. Dreux M. Cosset F.L. Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).Up to now, characterization of HCV particles is based on studies using partially purified virions from patient sera, experimentally inoculated chimpanzees, or rather low titer JFH1 particle preparations generated in cell cultures (9Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Kräusslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat.

Virol. 2006; 80: 2418-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is well established that infectious HCV particles have a low density (≤1.1 g/ml) that appears to be determined by the host cell, in which the virus is produced (18Lindenbach B.D. Meuleman P. Ploss A. Vanwolleghem T. Syder A.J. McKeating J.A. Lanford R.E. Feinstone S.M. Major M.E. Leroux-Roels G. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3805-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is probably due to the tight association of virions with host cell components, most notably lipoproteins (15Gastaminza P. Kapadia S.B. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11074-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16André P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Bréchot C.

Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The association appears to occur during assembly, because HCV formation and secretion depend on components of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion pathways, including apolipoprotein E (apoE) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (19Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 20Chang K.S. Jiang J. Cai Z. Luo G. J.

Whether apolipoprotein B (apoB) is also required for HCV assembly is discussed controversially (19Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Casali M. van Poll D. Wakita T. Chung R.T. Yarmush M.L. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ApoB-containing lipo-viro-particles have been identified in patients (16André P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Bréchot C. Paranhos-Baccalà G. Lotteau V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6919-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the HCV envelope glycoproteins in the human small intestinal cell line CaCo2 gives rise to apoB-48 containing E1/E2-positive triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles arguing for an intrinsic association of HCV envelope proteins with this apolipoprotein. However, Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells have proven deficient for this association, although they secrete apoB (25Icard V. Diaz O. Scholtes C. Perrin-Cocon L. Ramière C. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lotteau V. André P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Apart from its role in HCV particle morphogenesis, apoE seems to enhance HCV entry by interacting with low density lipoprotein receptor (26Owen D.M. Huang H. Ye J. Gale Jr., M. Virology. 2009; 394: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Likewise, apoB-containing lipoproteins (27Maillard P. Huby T. Andréo U. Moreau M. Chapman J. Budkowska A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) (28Voisset C. Callens N. Blanchard E. Op De Beeck A. Dubuisson J. Vu-Dac N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7793-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) appear to facilitate the interaction of HCV pseudoparticles or cell culture-grown HCV with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) (29Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The exchangeable apolipoprotein apoCI, which is predominantly present in HDL, seems to interact with HCV particles via hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) in the N terminus of E2 thus promoting interaction and fusion of the HCV envelope with cellular membranes (30Dreux M. Boson B. Ricard-Blum S. Molle J. Lavillette D. Bartosch B. Pécheur E.I. Cosset F.L. J. Biol.

Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Assembly of VLDL starts with the cotranslational lipidation of apoB-100 by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein delivering lipids from cytosolic lipid droplets into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (32Olofsson S.O. Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J. Borén J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Olofsson S.O. Borèn J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The resulting primordial lipoprotein is further lipidated into a triglyceride-poor form of VLDL that is released from the endoplasmic reticulum at distinct exit sites and transported to the Golgi apparatus. From there it can be secreted as such or is lipidated into a large triglyceride-rich form of VLDL, depending on triglyceride levels. Interestingly, apoE seems to be a key factor for the bulk addition of lipids to VLDL by regulating fusion with luminal lipid droplets in a distal compartment of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production is significantly reduced in apoE-deficient mice but normalized upon human apoE3 expression, whereas the secretion rate of apoB is not affected in either of these mouse strains (35Mensenkamp A.R. Jong M.C. van Goor H. van Luyn M.J. Bloks V. Havinga R. Voshol P.J. Hofker M.H. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Kuipers F. J. Biol.

Accordingly, the average size of secreted VLDL particles produced by apoE-deficient hepatocytes is significantly reduced compared with those of wild type mice concomitant with an accumulation of small lipid droplets that colocalize with apoE within the lumen of a membrane-bound compartment. These data thus suggest that triglyceride-rich VLDL results from an apoE-dependent fusion process of triglyceride-poor VLDL with luminal lipid droplets. ApoB and apoE are considered as the major proteins mediating VLDL and LDL endocytosis by binding to the LDL receptor or the apoE receptor (34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Lipoproteins have been shown to be of relevance for assembly and release of HCV particles (21Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W.

However, the nature of the interaction between these cellular components and viral particles as well as the lipid composition and morphology of HCV remain elusive. In this study, we developed a simple and highly efficient method to produce large amounts of purified infectious HCV particles, and we performed a comprehensive analysis of infectious HCV, including the determination of its morphology and lipid composition.

Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar).Although our knowledge about structure and (enzymatic) activities of viral proteins has increased tremendously (7Bartenschlager R. Frese M. Pietschmann T. Adv. Virus Res. 2004; 63: 71-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the biochemical and morphological features of HCV particles still remain elusive. This is mainly due to low virus titers in infected tissues and, until recently, the lack of culture systems producing sufficient amounts of infectious HCV particles. This hurdle has been overcome by the identification of a particular genotype 2a HCV isolate (designated JFH1) that replicates to very high levels in cell culture and supports infectious particle production (8Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 9Wakita T. Pietschmann T.

Moreover, highly efficient JFH1-derived chimeras have been generated. In some of them, the region encoding the JFH1 core to NS2 has been replaced by the corresponding region of other HCV isolates (10Gottwein J.M. Bukh J. Adv.

Most efficient is the intragenotypic chimera Jc1 supporting virus titers in the range of 106 infectious units per ml, which is ∼1,000-fold higher as compared with JFH1 (12Pietschmann T. Kaul A. Koutsoudakis G. Shavinskaya A. Kallis S. Steinmann E. Abid K. Negro F. Dreux M. Cosset F.L. Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2006; 80: 2418-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is well established that infectious HCV particles have a low density (≤1.1 g/ml) that appears to be determined by the host cell, in which the virus is produced (18Lindenbach B.D. Meuleman P. Ploss A. Vanwolleghem T. Syder A.J. McKeating J.A. Lanford R.E. Feinstone S.M. Major M.E. Leroux-Roels G. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3805-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is probably due to the tight association of virions with host cell components, most notably lipoproteins (15Gastaminza P. Kapadia S.B. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 11074-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16André P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Bréchot C.

Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The association appears to occur during assembly, because HCV formation and secretion depend on components of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion pathways, including apolipoprotein E (apoE) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (19Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 20Chang K.S. Jiang J. Cai Z. Luo G. J.

Whether apolipoprotein B (apoB) is also required for HCV assembly is discussed controversially (19Gastaminza P. Cheng G. Wieland S. Zhong J. Liao W. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2120-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 21Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Casali M. van Poll D. Wakita T. Chung R.T. Yarmush M.L. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). ApoB-containing lipo-viro-particles have been identified in patients (16André P. Komurian-Pradel F. Deforges S. Perret M. Berland J.L. Sodoyer M. Pol S. Bréchot C. Paranhos-Baccalà G. Lotteau V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6919-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the HCV envelope glycoproteins in the human small intestinal cell line CaCo2 gives rise to apoB-48 containing E1/E2-positive triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles arguing for an intrinsic association of HCV envelope proteins with this apolipoprotein. However, Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells have proven deficient for this association, although they secrete apoB (25Icard V. Diaz O. Scholtes C. Perrin-Cocon L. Ramière C. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lotteau V. André P. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Apart from its role in HCV particle morphogenesis, apoE seems to enhance HCV entry by interacting with low density lipoprotein receptor (26Owen D.M. Huang H. Ye J. Gale Jr., M. Virology. 2009; 394: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Likewise, apoB-containing lipoproteins (27Maillard P. Huby T. Andréo U. Moreau M. Chapman J. Budkowska A. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) (28Voisset C. Callens N. Blanchard E. Op De Beeck A. Dubuisson J. Vu-Dac N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7793-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) appear to facilitate the interaction of HCV pseudoparticles or cell culture-grown HCV with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) (29Scarselli E. Ansuini H. Cerino R. Roccasecca R.M. Acali S. Filocamo G. Traboni C. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Vitelli A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5017-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The exchangeable apolipoprotein apoCI, which is predominantly present in HDL, seems to interact with HCV particles via hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) in the N terminus of E2 thus promoting interaction and fusion of the HCV envelope with cellular membranes (30Dreux M. Boson B. Ricard-Blum S. Molle J. Lavillette D. Bartosch B. Pécheur E.I. Cosset F.L. J. Biol.

Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Assembly of VLDL starts with the cotranslational lipidation of apoB-100 by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein delivering lipids from cytosolic lipid droplets into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (32Olofsson S.O. Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J. Borén J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Olofsson S.O. Borèn J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The resulting primordial lipoprotein is further lipidated into a triglyceride-poor form of VLDL that is released from the endoplasmic reticulum at distinct exit sites and transported to the Golgi apparatus. From there it can be secreted as such or is lipidated into a large triglyceride-rich form of VLDL, depending on triglyceride levels. Interestingly, apoE seems to be a key factor for the bulk addition of lipids to VLDL by regulating fusion with luminal lipid droplets in a distal compartment of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production is significantly reduced in apoE-deficient mice but normalized upon human apoE3 expression, whereas the secretion rate of apoB is not affected in either of these mouse strains (35Mensenkamp A.R. Jong M.C. van Goor H. van Luyn M.J. Bloks V. Havinga R. Voshol P.J. Hofker M.H. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Kuipers F. J. Biol.

Accordingly, the average size of secreted VLDL particles produced by apoE-deficient hepatocytes is significantly reduced compared with those of wild type mice concomitant with an accumulation of small lipid droplets that colocalize with apoE within the lumen of a membrane-bound compartment. These data thus suggest that triglyceride-rich VLDL results from an apoE-dependent fusion process of triglyceride-poor VLDL with luminal lipid droplets. ApoB and apoE are considered as the major proteins mediating VLDL and LDL endocytosis by binding to the LDL receptor or the apoE receptor (34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Lipoproteins have been shown to be of relevance for assembly and release of HCV particles (21Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 37Miyanari Y. Atsuzawa K. Usuda N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Zayas M.

However, the nature of the interaction between these cellular components and viral particles as well as the lipid composition and morphology of HCV remain elusive. In this study, we developed a simple and highly efficient method to produce large amounts of purified infectious HCV particles, and we performed a comprehensive analysis of infectious HCV, including the determination of its morphology and lipid composition. Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 6The abbreviations used are: HCVhepatitis C virusapoapolipoproteinCerceramideCypAcyclophilin ADENVDengue virusHexCerhexosylceramidePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolPIphosphatidylinositolPSphosphatidylserineSMsphingomyelinSR-BIscavenger receptor BITAGtriacylglycerolqRTquantitative RT. is among the most frequent cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1Seeff L.B. Hepatology. 2002; 36: S35-S46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 3% of the world population is thought to be chronically infected with HCV, and these people have a high risk to develop serious liver diseases. As approved selective drugs are not available, chronic hepatitis C is treated with a combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. However, cure rates are not satisfactory, and treatment is associated with numerous side effects. hepatitis C virus apolipoprotein ceramide cyclophilin A Dengue virus hexosylceramide phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylserine sphingomyelin scavenger receptor BI triacylglycerol quantitative RT. HCV has been classified as the separate genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae to which the genera Pestivirus and Flavivirus belong. Viruses of this family possess a positive-strand RNA genome that in case of HCV is 9.6 kb long and encodes for a single polyprotein of ∼3,000 amino acids. It is cleaved co and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different products (2Moradpour D. Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The N-terminally residing structural protein cores, envelope protein 1 (E1) and envelope protein 2 (E2), are thought to be the major constituents of infectious HCV particles. C-terminally of E2 resides p7, a small protein that forms oligomeric complexes acting as viroporin (3Griffin S.D. Harvey R. Clarke D.S. Barclay W.S. Harris M. Rowlands D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) that, together with p7, contributes to virus assembly (4Jones C.T. Murray C.L. Eastman D.K.

Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Assembly of VLDL starts with the cotranslational lipidation of apoB-100 by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein delivering lipids from cytosolic lipid droplets into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (32Olofsson S.O. Boström P. Andersson L. Rutberg M. Perman J. Borén J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Olofsson S.O. Borèn J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The resulting primordial lipoprotein is further lipidated into a triglyceride-poor form of VLDL that is released from the endoplasmic reticulum at distinct exit sites and transported to the Golgi apparatus. From there it can be secreted as such or is lipidated into a large triglyceride-rich form of VLDL, depending on triglyceride levels. Interestingly, apoE seems to be a key factor for the bulk addition of lipids to VLDL by regulating fusion with luminal lipid droplets in a distal compartment of the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production is significantly reduced in apoE-deficient mice but normalized upon human apoE3 expression, whereas the secretion rate of apoB is not affected in either of these mouse strains (35Mensenkamp A.R. Jong M.C. van Goor H. van Luyn M.J. Bloks V. Havinga R. Voshol P.J. Hofker M.H. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Kuipers F. J. Biol.

Accordingly, the average size of secreted VLDL particles produced by apoE-deficient hepatocytes is significantly reduced compared with those of wild type mice concomitant with an accumulation of small lipid droplets that colocalize with apoE within the lumen of a membrane-bound compartment. These data thus suggest that triglyceride-rich VLDL results from an apoE-dependent fusion process of triglyceride-poor VLDL with luminal lipid droplets. ApoB and apoE are considered as the major proteins mediating VLDL and LDL endocytosis by binding to the LDL receptor or the apoE receptor (34Hui D.Y. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5646-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins have been shown to be of relevance for assembly and release of HCV particles (21Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W.

However, the nature of the interaction between these cellular components and viral particles as well as the lipid composition and morphology of HCV remain elusive. In this study, we developed a simple and highly efficient method to produce large amounts of purified infectious HCV particles, and we performed a comprehensive analysis of infectious HCV, including the determination of its morphology and lipid composition.

https://openalex.org/W2069588389,"Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) and highly effective antagonist to hormone-sensitive breast cancers following failure of previous tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor therapies. However, after prolonged fulvestrant therapy, acquired resistance eventually occurs in the majority of breast cancer patients, due to poorly understood mechanisms. To examine a possible role(s) of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in acquired fulvestrant resistance, we compared antiestrogen-resistant and -sensitive breast cancer cells, revealing the overexpression of miR-221/222 in the SERD-resistant cell lines. Fulvestrant treatment of estradiol (E2)- and fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7 cells resulted in increased expression of endogenous miR-221/222. Ectopic upregulation of miR-221/222 in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive cell lines counteracted the effects of E2 depletion or fulvestrant-induced cell death, thus also conferring hormone-independent growth and fulvestrant resistance. In cells with acquired resistance to fulvestrant, miR-221/222 expression was essential for cell growth and cell cycle progression. To identify possible miR-221/222 targets, miR-221- or miR-222- induced alterations in global gene expression profiles and target gene expression at distinct time points were determined, revealing that miR-221/222 overexpression resulted in deregulation of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways previously associated with drug resistance. Activation of β-catenin by miR-221/222 contributed to estrogen-independent growth and fulvestrant resistance, whereas TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition was repressed by the two miRNAs. This first in-depth investigation into the role of miR-221/222 in acquired fulvestrant resistance, a clinically important problem, demonstrates that these two 'oncomirs' may represent promising therapeutic targets for treating hormone-independent, SERD-resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031943423,"The transition from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant prostate cancer is a lethal event. N-cadherin seems to be a major cause underlying this transition, and targeting this adhesion molecule may have positive clinical benefit. The transition from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a lethal event of uncertain molecular etiology. Comparing gene expression in isogenic androgen-dependent and CRPC xenografts, we found a reproducible increase in N-cadherin expression, which was also elevated in primary and metastatic tumors of individuals with CRPC. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin–specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. These data indicate that N-cadherin is a major cause of both prostate cancer metastasis and castration resistance. Therapeutic targeting of this factor with monoclonal antibodies may have considerable clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2108203731,"Covert attention, the selective processing of visual information in the absence of eye movements, improves behavioral performance. We found that attention, both exogenous (involuntary) and endogenous (voluntary), can affect performance by contrast or response gain changes, depending on the stimulus size and the relative size of the attention field. These two variables were manipulated in a cueing task while stimulus contrast was varied. We observed a change in behavioral performance consonant with a change in contrast gain for small stimuli paired with spatial uncertainty and a change in response gain for large stimuli presented at one location (no uncertainty) and surrounded by irrelevant flanking distracters. A complementary neuroimaging experiment revealed that observers' attention fields were wider with than without spatial uncertainty. Our results support important predictions of the normalization model of attention and reconcile previous, seemingly contradictory findings on the effects of visual attention."

The existence of a process to package specific virulence factors into OMV may significantly alter our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The formation and trafficking of membrane vesicles are essential processes in eukaryotes. These structures are formed to store, traffic, or digest cellular components, and virtually all of the organelles of the eukaryotic cell, including mitochondria and chloroplasts, are able to form vesicles (1Andrade-Navarro M.A. Sanchez-Pulido L. McBride H.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Cocucci E. Racchetti G. Meldolesi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 43-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). In contrast, in prokaryotes, vesicles have historically been simply regarded as cell debris or microscopy artifacts (3Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has only relatively recently been acknowledged that the outer membrane vesicles (OMV) 2The abbreviations used are: OMV, outer membrane vesicle(s); OM, outer membrane. produced via blebbing of the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria possess multiple functional roles (4Mashburn-Warren L.M. Whiteley M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). OMV production is increased upon exposure of bacterial cells to harsh conditions, such as the addition of chemical stressors to medium or the host environment during infection (5Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 6McBroom A.J. Kuehn M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This has been shown in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, where an abundant amount of OMV accumulated during infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7Irazoqui J.E. Troemel E.R. Feinbaum R.L. Luhachack L.G. Cezairliyan B.O. Ausubel F.M. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000982Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). An increase in OMV production under stressful conditions is correlated with bacterial survival (5Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 6McBroom A.J. Kuehn M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OMV constitute protective environments for cargo proteins, which inside the OMV are not accessible to proteases produced by neighboring eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (8Aldick T.

Like extracellular eukaryotic vesicles, OMV can mediate cell-cell communication (4Mashburn-Warren L.M. Whiteley M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Mashburn L.M. Whiteley M. Nature. 2005; 437: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Incubation of purified P. aeruginosa OMV with eukaryotic cells lead to the fusion of the OMV with lipid rafts present in eukaryotic membranes, with the concomitant release of multiple virulence factors into the host cytosol (11Bomberger J.M. Maceachran D.P. Coutermarsh B.A. Ye S. O'Toole G.A. Stanton B.A. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000382Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In other cases, whole OMV were internalized and incorporated into the trafficking network of the host cells (9Kesty N.C. Mason K.M. Reedy M. Miller S.E. Kuehn M.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4538-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Furuta N. Tsuda K. Omori H. Yoshimori T. Yoshimura F. Amano A. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4187-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that OMV act as long distance toxin delivery devices (4Mashburn-Warren L.M. Whiteley M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Bomberger J.M. Maceachran D.P. Coutermarsh B.A. Ye S. O'Toole G.A. Stanton B.A. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000382Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether OMV result from a directed process or by passive disintegration of the OM. LPS is the main component of the outer leaflet of the bacterial OM and therefore also constitutes the outermost layer of OMV. LPS is composed of lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and a long polysaccharide chain named O antigen or O polysaccharide. The human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major causative agent of chronic periodontitis, produces two classes of LPS, carrying either neutral (O-LPS) (13Paramonov N. Bailey D. Rangarajan M. Hashim A. Kelly G. Curtis M.A. Hounsell E.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or negatively charged (A-LPS) O antigen chains (14Rangarajan M. Aduse-Opoku J. Paramonov N. Hashim A. Bostanci N. Fraser O.P. Tarelli E. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Paramonov N. Rangarajan M. Hashim A. Gallagher A. Aduse-Opoku J. Slaney J.M. Hounsell E. Curtis M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 847-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In other bacterial species containing both neutral and negatively charged O polysaccharides, only the latter has been found in the OMV. For this reason it has been suggested that an interaction between negatively charged O antigen chains contributes to OMV formation (16Kadurugamuwa J.L. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3998-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we establish that P. gingivalis has a mechanism to selectively sort OM proteins into OMV. This process results in the preferential packaging of gingipains, a group of proteases that constitute a major virulence factor of P. gingivalis, and in the exclusion of abundant OM proteins from the protein cargo. Furthermore we show that mutations affecting the LPS result in aberrant protein sorting into the OMV. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in supplemental Table S1. All of the P. gingivalis strains were grown either on blood agar plates containing 5% defibrinated horse blood or brain-heart infusion broth supplemented with hemein (5 μg ml−1) and meniadone (1 μg ml−1) in an anaerobic atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% H2, and 5% CO2. Clindamycin HCl was added to 5 μg ml−1 for selection of ermF in P. gingivalis. Tetracycline (1 μg ml−1) was added for the selection of the complemented strains. Escherichia coli strains were grown in LB. Construction and complementation of P. gingivalis mutants were performed as described previously (14Rangarajan M. Aduse-Opoku J. Paramonov N. Hashim A.

Immun. 2006; 74: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are detailed in the supplemental data (supplemental Fig. S1). LPS was prepared as described previously by Marolda et al. (18Marolda C.L. Lahiry P. Vinés E. Saldías S. Valvano M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 347: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar), and the details are given in the supplemental data. The LPS was run on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by the silver staining method described by Tsai and Frasch (19Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis LPS was also analyzed by Western blotting, using monoclonal mouse αA-LPS (MAb1B5) (20Curtis M.A. Thickett A. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Aduse-Opoku J. Shepherd P. Paramonov N. Hounsell E.F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3816-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with a secondary goat anti-mouse IRDye-800CW antibody (LI-COR Biosciences), the blots were scanned with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Cells corresponding to 10 OD600 units of overnight cultures of P. gingivalis wild type and mutant strains were removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 6,000 × g. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-μm-pore-size PVDF membrane (Millex GV, Millipore) to remove residual cells. OMV were recovered from the resulting filtrates by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C (Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge; Beckman Coulter) and resuspended in 150 μl of PBS (16Kadurugamuwa J.L. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3998-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 250 ml of 24-h cultures of P. gingivalis W50 (OD600 equal to 2.0) were centrifuged at 9000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-μm-pore-size filter. The filtrate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1.5 h (Sorvall Ultracentrifuge). The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was washed with sterile PBS, and the ultracentrifugation step was repeated. The vesicle pellet was resuspended in distilled water and freeze-dried. 14.5 mg of vesicles were obtained from 250 ml of culture. The cells of overnight cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were gently resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2 containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed by sonication. The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The OM were isolated by differential extraction with the same buffer and 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h. The OM fractions were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (21Veith P.D. Talbo G.H. Slakeski N. Reynolds E.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4748-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The previous protocol was modified for the preparation of OM in the absence of protease inhibitor. After the sonication step, half of the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation to recover the OM (OM t0 fraction), as described above. The other half was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, before continuing with the preparation (OM t2 h fraction). Purified OM and OMV were run on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or analyzed by Western blotting, using monoclonal antibody αRagB (mAb B15) (22Millar D.J. Scott E.E. Slaney J.M. U S. Benjamin P. Curtis M.A. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised from gels. This analysis was performed from at least three independent sample preparations to ensure reproducibility. The excised protein bands were in-gel digested using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). Peptide fragments were eluted from the gel piece, desalted using ZipTipC18 (Millipore) according to the supplier protocol, and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid. A hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Q-TOF Premier (Waters), equipped with a nanoACQUITY Ultra performance liquid chromatography system (Waters) was used for MS/MS analyses of the peptides, and the resulting mass spectrums were used for the identification of the proteins by the Mascot search engine using the NCBInr data base (50Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S2). Lipid A from vesicles was prepared in duplicate using 10 mg of vesicles for each preparation using the procedure of Yi and Hackett (24Yi E.C. Hackett M. Analyst. 2000; 125: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The lipid A was resuspended in 50 μl of water. MALDI-TOF MS was performed using a Bruker Microflex instrument fitted with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm using pulsed extraction in negative linear mode. Lipid A was analyzed using Norharmane (9-H-pyrido[3,4]indole) in methanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in methanol as the matrix. 0.5 μl of lipid A suspension together with 0.5 μl of matrix solution was applied to the MALDI plate and allowed to air dry. The instrument was calibrated using the peptides Des-Arg1 bradykinin (mass, 904.0), angiotensin 1 (mass, 1296.5), and neurotensin (mass, 1672.3), and average masses were used throughout. 3 μl of the OMV preparations were adsorbed onto carbon-coated copper grids (3 min). Liquid excess was discarded, and the samples were negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 3 min and evaluated in a Morgagni (FEI) transmission electron microscope. The cells of P. gingivalis W50 were strongly bound to the surface of glass slides coated with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Genorama, Asper Biotech, Tartu, Estonia) as described in the supplemental data. The AFM imaging was performed using a Molecular Force Probe 3D from Asylum Research (Santa Barbara, CA) controlled with IGOR PRO software (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). All of the AFM images were acquired in tapping mode to avoid the surface damage that usually accompanies contact mode imaging of soft samples as detailed in the supplemental data. Every set of AFM experiments was conducted with new tips. The O antigen repeating units are generally assembled onto undecaprenyl phosphate at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Completed subunits are translocated to the periplasm by a flippase. In this compartment, the subunits are polymerized and subsequently transferred to the lipid A core by the WaaL ligase (25Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a flippase-deficient strain would be useful to determine whether P. gingivalis O antigen chains contribute to OMV formation. The porR locus is involved in A-LPS biosynthesis (15Paramonov N. Rangarajan M. Hashim A. Gallagher A. Aduse-Opoku J. Slaney J.M. Hounsell E. Curtis M.A. Mol.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, not all of the genes in that locus have been characterized (supplemental Fig. S1). PorS is encoded in the porR locus and presents homology to members of the Wzx flippase family (27Gallagher A. Aduse-Opoku J. Rangarajan M. Slaney J.M. Curtis M.A. Curr. Protein Pept.

Flippases generally have relaxed specificities toward the translocated substrates (28Feldman M.F. Marolda C.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Parodi A.J. Valvano M.A. J. Biol.

Valvano M.A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 4095-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We confirmed a flippase function for PorS by demonstrating its ability to restore O antigen biosynthesis and Campylobacter jejuni protein N-glycosylation reconstituted in an E. coli flippase-deficient strain (the details are given in supplemental data and supplemental Fig. S2). We then generated a porS-deficient strain (porS−) and its corresponding complemented (porS+) strain. The effect of porS inactivation on LPS production was determined by comparing the LPS of wild type and mutant strains by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining and Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes A-LPS (Fig. 1). The silver-stained gel showed the characteristic ladder corresponding to smooth LPS in the wild type and porS+ strains (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). However, the inactivation of porS caused a dramatic loss of reactivity toward the monoclonal antibody α-A-LPS, although a residual amount of A-LPS was synthesized in this strain (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Other putative flippases present in P. gingivalis, for example the product of PG0117, could be responsible for the partial substitution of A-LPS biosynthesis in the porS− strain. The porS mutant continued to exhibit silver-stained bands corresponding to low molecular weight LPS molecules, not detected with α-A-LPS, which most likely represent O-LPS (Fig. 1A, lane 2). These experiments demonstrated that cells carrying a mutation in the porS flippase displayed a negligible amount of the anionic A-LPS compared with the wild type strain but still produced O-LPS. To analyze whether A-LPS was required for OMV formation, we also included in our experiments a strain carrying a mutation in the waaL gene, which encodes the O antigen ligase. This strain has been already characterized and lacks both O antigens and produces only core lipid A (14Rangarajan M. Aduse-Opoku J. Paramonov N. Hashim A. Bostanci N. Fraser O.P. Tarelli E.

OMV from the wild type, porS−, porS+, and waaL− strains were purified and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2A). All four strains were able to produce OMV of similar size, indicating that neither of the two P. gingivalis O antigens is required for OMV formation. Purified OMV were treated with protease K, and the LPS composition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and Western blot using a monoclonal antibody directed against A-LPS (Fig. 2B). A-LPS molecules were detected in purified wild type and porS+ OMV, but as observed in whole cell analysis, porS− OMV carried mainly O-LPS and only minor amounts of A-LPS. As expected, only lipid A core was found in waaL− purified OMV. Our results indicated that O antigens do not play any key role in vesicle formation in P. gingivalis. We subsequently analyzed the wild type OMV protein content. OMV proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. We found that only a limited subset of proteins was present in the wild type OMV (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3B, lane 1) relative to the numerous proteins found in the purified OM of the same strain (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A, lane 1). MS/MS analysis of the most abundant proteins in wild type OMV revealed that these bands (supplemental Fig. S3), with one exception, corresponded to different forms of the gingipains (Table 1 and supplemental Table S2). Interestingly, only OM and no periplasmic or cytosolic proteins were identified in the OMV. These results prompted us to postulate the existence of a mechanism enabling P. gingivalis to selectively pack certain OM proteins, mainly gingipains, into the OMV and to exclude other abundant OM proteins, such as PG0694 and PG0695, from the OMV (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the most abundant proteins identified by MS/MS in purified wild type OM and in purified OMV from wild type and mutant strainsMost abundant protein bands identified by MS/MSOM (wild type)VesiclesWild typeporS−porS+waaL−Kgp (K-gingipain)++++NDRgpA/B (R-gingipain)++++NDRagA (TonB-dependent OM receptor)+ND+ND+RagB (TonB-dependent OM binding protein)+ND+ND+PG1626 (possible OM-associated protein P58)+ND+ND+PG1414 (TonB-linked OM receptor PG47)+NDNDNDNDPG1028 (probable OM lipoprotein P61)+NDNDNDNDPG0694 (OmpA/Omp40)+NDNDNDNDPG0695 (OmpA/Omp41)+NDNDNDNDPG0027 (probable integral OM protein P40)ND++++ Open table in a new tab We then evaluated the possibility that modifications in the O antigen could affect OMV protein content. Unexpectedly, OMV of the porS− and the waaL− strains carried additional proteins (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively) that were not detected in the wild type or the porS+ OMV (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4, respectively and Table 1 and supplemental Table S2). Particularly prominent were two proteins, RagA and RagB (RagA/B) (Fig. 3, B and D). RagA/B are immunodominant surface proteins of P. gingivalis (22Millar D.J. Scott E.E. Slaney J.M. U S. Benjamin P.

Microbiol. 2007; 56: 1536-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RagA is an integral OM protein that exhibits all of the typical features of a TonB-linked OM receptor, whereas RagB is a lipoprotein (32Hanley S.A. Aduse-Opoku J. Curtis M.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1157-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins are thought to form a complex in the OM that is responsible for nutrient uptake (31Nagano K. Murakami Y. Nishikawa K. Sakakibara J. Shimozato K. Yoshimura F. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 56: 1536-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The exact function of these proteins has yet to be determined. Previously, Murakami et al. (33Murakami Y. Masuda T. Imai M. Iwami J. Nakamura H. Noguchi T. Yoshimura F. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have shown that RagA/B are not detected in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 OMV. The presence of additional proteins in the OMV of the mutant strains could be an indirect consequence of changes in the characteristics of the LPS. Although the mutations generated do not affect the LPS moieties in closest contact with the OM, loss of O antigen might alter the physicochemical properties of the OM or result in envelope stress. This could lead to misfolding and degradation of certain proteins in the OM or potentially to the overexpression of RagA/B in the mutant strains. To analyze this possibility, the protein composition of the OM of the four strains was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3A), and the major proteins were identified by MS/MS (supplemental Table S2). Except for the absence of the gingipains in the waaL mutant and the increase in the contents of OMP28 in the OM of both mutants, no significant differences were found, ruling out the possibility that O antigen loss leads to a generalized destabilization of the OM (Fig. 3A). The absence of gingipains in the OM of the waaL− mutant strain may be a consequence of a defect in gingipain OM anchoring mechanisms, as reported in a porR mutant (26Shoji M. Ratnayake D.B. Shi Y. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Yoshimura F. Akamine A. Curtis M.A. Nakayama K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the OM showed equivalent amounts of RagA/B in the four strains (Fig. 3, A and C), indicating that inclusion of RagA/B in the OMV of the A-LPS mutant strains may not be result of misfolding, degradation, or overexpression of these proteins induced by O antigen modification. Instead, our results support a model in which A-LPS integrity is required for proper protein sorting into the OMV. As mentioned above, gingipains were not detected in the OM or in the OMV of the waaL− strain (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4, and supplemental Table S2). Previously it has been reported that the porR locus is not only required for A-LPS formation but also for gingipain glycosylation and maturation: certain glycan moieties are common to these glycosylated proteases and to A-LPS (15Paramonov N.

Yamamoto K. Yoshimura F. Akamine A. Curtis M.A. Nakayama K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). If RagA/B were gingipain substrates, the presence of RagA/B in the OMV purified from porS− and the waaL− strains might simply reflect reduced gingipain activity in those strains rather than the absence of a specific sorting mechanism. To analyze this possibility, we purified wild type OM in the presence and absence of protease inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubating the OM preparation without protease inhibitors for 2 h at 37 °C, RagA/B were still present as confirmed by MS/MS and Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). Other protein bands disappeared when the OM were purified without protease inhibitors, demonstrating that the proteases were active during this procedure (supplemental Fig. S4A). The proteins susceptible to proteolysis were identified by MS/MS as PG1414, PG0694, and PG0695. This result demonstrated that RagA/B are not gingipain substrates, and therefore their presence in the OMV of the porS mutant strain cannot be attributed to a reduction of gingipain activity in the OMV. OMV protein cargo selection requires a certain degree of compartmentalization of the OM, which is necessary for the selective recruitment of proteins into the regions where the OMV will be formed. Our results indicated that A-LPS plays a crucial role in this sorting process. For this reason, we hypothesized that LPS from the OM and the OMV may have different composition. We purified and analyzed the LPS from P. gingivalis OM and OMV. Comparing the silver staining LPS bands, we observed that the low molecular weight LPS molecules from both preparations presented similar intensity (Fig. 4A). However, it became evident that LPS molecules carrying long polysaccharide chains were more abundant in OMV than in OM (Fig. 4A). By Western blot analysis, we showed that the long LPS molecules reacted with αA-LPS monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4B), which indicated that OMV are enriched in A-LPS. In addition, we examined the lipid A component of the LPS. Analysis of P. gingivalis lipid A extracted from whole cells by MALDI-TOF MS gave the expected clusters of peaks corresponding to bis-P-pentacyl, mono-P-penta-acyl, mono-P-tetra-acyl, non-P-penta-acyl, and non-P-tetra-acyl species (Fig. 4C). However, MALDI-TOF MS of lipid A isolated from the vesicle preparations from P. gingivalis W50 did not show the characteristic cluster of peaks (Fig. 4D). There were a few weak signals in the lower mass/charge (m/z) region of the spectrum that, on the basis of molecular weight, may correspond to bis-P-tri-acyl, mono-P-tri-acyl, and non-P-tri-acyl species (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the lipid A of OMV may undergo significant deacylation. We subsequently analyzed the surface of a single P. gingivalis wild type cell by AFM. A rough and heterogeneous surface and multiple structures compatible in shape and size with OMV were visualized (Fig. 5). It is tempting to speculate that some of the structures seen are OMV in formation, which could be visualized because of the existence of LPS patches of different lengths on the surface. OMV were detected at multiple sites throughout the surface of a single live bacterial cell. Interestingly, OMV appeared to be of comparable size regardless the location in which they were generated. Although vesicle production in Gram-negative bacteria was reported several decades ago, the mechanism(s) involved in their biogenesis remains unknown. Circumstantial evidence that virulence factors are enriched in the OMV of other Gram-negative bacteria has previously been reported (34Grenier D. Mayrand D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 111-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12489-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text"

Many ways to pluripotency.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1114-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ES, EC, and EG cells are capable of efficiently forming both teratomas and chimeras. However, although EpiSCs readily form teratomas, they rarely form chimeras (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). This feature suggests that EpiSCs may exhibit restricted pluripotency relative to other pluripotent stem cells despite similarities in gene expression and epigenetic profile (Chou et al., 2008Chou Y.F. Chen H.H. Eijpe M. Yabuuchi A. Chenoweth J.G. Tesar P. Lu J. McKay R.D. Geijsen N. The growth factor environment defines distinct pluripotent ground states in novel blastocyst-derived stem cells.Cell. 2008; 135: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, EpiSCs represent only one cell type exhibiting this restricted potency. This limited potency of EpiSCs may be inherent to the tissue of origin or newly arises from the different culture environment of EpiSCs compared with ES cells (ESCs). This latter possibility is corroborated by evidence indicating that mouse ESCs require LIF and BMP4 to maintain pluripotency (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), whereas EpiSCs require bFGF and Activin A (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The low potency of EpiSCs can also be explained by the inability of these cells to grow and survive as single cells when injected into a blastocyst, preventing them from incorporating into the ICM. Another possible explanation concerns the developmental stage gap of the cells involved—donor EpiSCs are of embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) to ∼E7.5, whereas recipient blastocysts are of E3.5. However, these possible explanations do not fully explain the distinct pluripotency of EpiSCs. A final explanation may be that EpiSCs are actually heterogeneous in nature and thus comprise at least two distinct subpopulations, one with higher developing potency and the other with lower potency, possibly accounting for the apparent discrepancy in the potency of EpiSCs observed with different in vivo development assays. ESCs have long been considered to represent a homogeneous population of cells; however, recent studies based on Stella (Dppa3) and Rex1 (Zfp42) expression have demonstrated that ESCs comprise a heterogeneous cell population (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K.

Shimosato D. Murakami K. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Identification and characterization of subpopulations in undifferentiated ES cell culture.Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Different cell subpopulations represent different in vivo developmental stages, with a dynamic interchange between cells of an ICM-like state and those of an epiblast- or primitive ectoderm-like state. Similarly, ESC expression levels of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1) have been shown to correlate with ESC pluripotency (Furusawa et al., 2004Furusawa T. Ohkoshi K. Honda C. Takahashi S. Tokunaga T. Embryonic stem cells expressing both platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 differentiate predominantly into epiblast cells in a chimeric embryo.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Strikingly, intermittent Nanog expression has been associated with distinct functional ESC phenotypes (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers I. Silva J. Colby D. Nichols J. Nijmeijer B. Robertson M. Vrana J. Jones K. Grotewold L. Smith A. Nanog safeguards pluripotency and mediates germline development.Nature. 2007; 450: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Thus, undifferentiated ESC cultures comprise cells of different pluripotency levels corresponding to different developmental stages in the embryo. To date, EpiSCs have been considered to represent a homogeneous pluripotent cell population due to their high methylation compared with ESCs. This epigenetic profile may result in reduced EpiSC plasticity, thus preventing cellular heterogeneity, as observed in ESCs (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, Toyooka et al., 2008Toyooka Y.

Primitive ectoderm (PrE) cells of developing epiblasts have been generally described to be incapable of contributing to chimera formation, although they still retain differentiation potential and can give rise to cells of all three germ layers (Gardner et al., 1985Gardner R.L. Lyon M.F. Evans E.P. Burtenshaw M.D. Clonal analysis of X-chromosome inactivation and the origin of the germ line in the mouse embryo.J. Embryol. Exp.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). However, Gardner et al. demonstrated that PrE cells from an early stage, such as E5, still have the capability for chimeric contribution, but they lose it within the next 24 hr (Gardner et al., 1985Gardner R.L. Lyon M.F. Evans E.P. Burtenshaw M.D. Clonal analysis of X-chromosome inactivation and the origin of the germ line in the mouse embryo.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 88: 349-363PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if we consider the developing potency of early-stage epiblasts and the heterogeneity of ESCs, we can surmise that EpiSCs may comprise a heterogeneous population, like ESCs, and that a minor or rare subpopulation of EpiSCs exists that contributes to chimera formation, with the major EpiSC subpopulation having no such developing potency, like late-stage epiblasts. In this study, we explored the distinct pluripotential state of EpiSCs by investigating the homogeneity of EpiSCs in culture. Based on the distinct expression of an Oct4-GFP transgene, we found that EpiSCs are not homogeneous but, rather, comprise two distinct cell subpopulations: an Oct4-GFP positive population and an Oct4-GFP negative population. These two subpopulations displayed clear differences in molecular characteristics and developmental potential, including capability for chimera formation. We show that these two subpopulations do not represent spontaneously converted ES-like cells but, rather, resemble cells of early- and late-stage postimplantation embryos. Therefore, our findings suggest that the observed discrepancy in a pluripotential capacity of EpiSCs (teratoma versus chimera formation) is due to the presence of two functionally distinct subpopulations of EpiSCs in culture. Epiblast stem cells were derived from GOF18 (genomic Oct4 fragment, 18 kb) mice containing a GFP transgene under the control of the entire regulatory region of the Oct4 gene (Yeom et al., 1996Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hübner K. Schöler H.R. Germline regulatory element of Oct-4 specific for the totipotent cycle of embryonal cells.Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of mouse EpiSCs is the preferential use of the proximal enhancer (PE) over the distal enhancer (DE) for Oct4 gene transcription (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Thus, both established EpiSCs from GOF18 mice and postimplantation epiblasts should theoretically express Oct4 and be Oct4-GFP positive. We first examined the expression of Oct4-GFP in both established EpiSCs (Figure 1A ) and postimplantation epiblasts (Figure 5E). Whereas the in vivo epiblast was Oct4-GFP positive, only a very low percentage of established GOF18 EpiSCs retained Oct4-GFP expression after a few passages (Figure 1A and Figure 2A ; see also Figure 5E).Figure 2Dynamic Expression of Oct4-GFP in GOF18 EpiSCsShow full caption(A) Percentage of Oct4-GFP positive cells in EpiSCs measured by FACS sorting.(B) Oct4-GFP positive and Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs were FACS sorted and cultured separately.

GOF18 EpiSCs exhibited a global gene expression profile very similar to that of an independently derived EpiSC line but distinct from that of ESCs, confirming that GOF18 cells are bona fide EpiSCs (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and 1C). Oct4 protein levels were similar in ESCs and EpiSCs, but Sox2 and Nanog protein levels were lower in EpiSCs (Figures 1D and 1E), consistent with published data (Silva et al., 2009Silva J. Nichols J. Theunissen T.W. Guo G. van Oosten A.L. Barrandon O. Wray J. Yamanaka S. Chambers I. Smith A. Nanog is the gateway to the pluripotent ground state.Cell. 2009; 138: 722-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of the Oct4-GFP transgene did not appear to correspond to that of the endogenous Oct4 gene in GOF18 EpiSCs, prompting us to speculate that this may be due to an adaptation of the in vivo epiblast to the in vitro culture conditions. Similarly, the ICM undergoes adaptive modifications during the establishment of ESCs, as previously described (Buehr and Smith, 2003Buehr M. Smith A. Genesis of embryonic stem cells.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 1397-1402, discussion 1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Rossant, 2001Rossant J. Stem cells from the Mammalian blastocyst.Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of the Oct4-GFP transgene might actually result from epigenetic modifications occurring in the in vitro culture—a change that may affect the GFP transgene, but not the endogenous Oct4 locus at the gene and protein levels. However, ∼0.5% of GOF18 EpiSCs remained Oct4-GFP positive after serial passages (Figure 2A). Next, we sought to investigate the characteristics of this Oct4-GFP positive population of EpiSCs. To this end, we sorted Oct4-GFP positive and negative cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and cultured them separately. Of interest, 48 hr after FACS sorting, Oct4-GFP positive cells started to lose GFP expression. On the other hand, some Oct4-GFP negative cells started to gain GFP expression (Figure 2B). After 1 week in culture, the percentage of Oct4-GFP positive cells in each culture was similar to that of the parental nonsorted EpiSCs. Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs gave rise to a small proportion of Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs (∼0.2% Oct4-GFP positive), whereas the majority of Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs converted to Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs (∼0.5% Oct4-GFP positive) (Figure 2C). To better characterize this conversion, we performed a clonal assay (Figure 2D). We then FACS sorted single Oct4-GFP positive and negative cells in 96-well plates (10 × 96-well plates with Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs and 5 × 96-well plates with Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs). Fifty-eight of 960 Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs and 30 of 480 Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs had survived after 1 day in culture. After 1 week in culture, five Oct4-GFP negative clonal lines showed partial reactivation of the Oct4-GFP transgene. Similarly, 12 Oct4-GFP positive single cell lines lost Oct4-GFP expression—either partially or entirely (Figure 2D). These results indicated that both Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs had the ability to interconvert, resulting in a state of dynamic equilibrium between Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs in culture. Next, we assessed whether the Oct4-GFP positive and negative subpopulations differ at the molecular level. The global gene expression profile of both FACS-sorted subpopulations was determined by microarray analysis. The global gene expression profile of Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs, which represented ∼99% of the entire GOF18 EpiSC culture, matched that of the parental nonsorted GOF18 EpiSCs (Figure 3A ). Moreover, the global expression profile of the Oct4-GFP positive fraction was very similar to that of the negative fraction, but both differed markedly from that of an ESC control transcriptome (Figures 3A and 3B). In other words, both EpiSC subpopulations indeed constitute EpiSCs and not, for example, spontaneously converted ES-like cells. ESC marker genes, such as Klf2, Klf4, Dnmt3l, Esrrb, Stella (Dppa3), Fbxo15, Rex1 (Zfp42), and Dppa5, were upregulated in the Oct4-GFP positive subpopulation compared with the Oct4-GFP negative fraction (Figure 3A and Figure S1 available online). Similarly, EpiSC markers, such as Fgf5 and Brachyury (T), were downregulated in GFP positive subpopulation compared with negative EpiSCs. Overall, these findings indicate that Oct4-GFP positive cells were still EpiSCs by identity, but they differed from the more abundant EpiSC subpopulation by the expression of several prominent marker genes.Figure S1Distinct Gene Expression Patterns in Oct4-GFP Positive and Negative EpiSCs, Related to Figure 3Show full captionReal-time PCR of genes reveals a distinct expression of Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs.

All data are normalized to β-actin expression and calibrated on ESCs. Data represent mean ± SEM of triplicates; n = 3. Recent reports have described that EpiSCs are capable of converting to an ES-like state under specific culture conditions (Bao et al., 2009Bao S. Tang F. Li X. Hayashi K. Gillich A. Lao K.

We therefore sought to further rule out the possibility that Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs represented EpiSCs that had converted to an ES-like state. As revealed by hierarchical clustering, Oct4-GFP positive as well as Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs clearly differed from ESCs and clustered with an independent EpiSC line (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, the Oct4-GFP positive EpiSC subpopulation did not represent EpiSC cells that had spontaneously converted to an ES-like state. We then asked whether at least some of the differences in gene expression between Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs (Figure 3A) could have resulted from differential epigenetic modifications. To this end, we determined the DNA methylation status of the endogenous and transgenic Oct4 loci in both Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs. Consistent with the gene expression profiling data (Figure 3A), the promoter regions of endogenous Oct4 were completely unmethylated in both subpopulations (Figure 3E). However, the Oct4-GFP transgene promoter was hypomethylated in Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs but highly methylated in Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs (Figure 3E). These data indicate that the mechanism regulating the dynamic Oct4-GFP fluctuations in EpiSC culture is related to the differential DNA methylation status of the Oct4-GFP promoter in Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs. Next, we assessed whether Oct4-GFP positive cells may represent early PGCs. To this end, we examined the promoter regions of the germ cell markers Stella (Dppa3), Vasa, and Fragilis (Iftm3) in ESCs, Oct4-GFP positive as well as negative EpiSCs, PGCs, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As expected, all promoter regions examined were fully methylated in MEFs but completely unmethylated in PGCs. All of these genes exhibited an imprinted methylation pattern in ESCs, which is due to the heterogeneous expression of many germ cell markers (Carter et al., 2008Carter M.G. Stagg C.A. Falco G. Yoshikawa T. Bassey U.C. Aiba K. Sharova L.V. Shaik N. Ko M.S. An in situ hybridization-based screen for heterogeneously expressed genes in mouse ES cells.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2008; 8: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, germ cell marker genes were fully methylated in Oct4-GFP negative as well as the positive EpiSCs, like in MEFs, but not in ESCs or PGCs (Figure 3F). Finally, parental nonsorted EpiSCs exhibited the same methylation pattern as Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs (data not shown). These data further support the notion that Oct4-GFP positive cells have an overall EpiSC identity that is neither ES-like nor PGC-like. In contrast, the methylation pattern of the Dppa5 promoter was similar in Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs and ESCs (Figure 3F). This is consistent with the gene expression profiling data, revealing increased Dppa5 expression in Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs compared with Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs (Figure 3A). These data suggest that Oct4-GFP positive cells differ from Oct4-GFP negative cells in the expression of some prominent ESC marker genes, as reflected by differential epigenetic regulation. These data further suggest that the dynamic interchange between the Oct4-GFP positive and negative subpopulations of EpiSCs appears to be regulated by a DNA methylation-dependent mechanism. Next, we asked whether these two EpiSC populations differ in function. EpiSCs can be converted to an ES-like state by switching to stringent ESC culture conditions, the so-called 2i+LIF medium (2i condition) (Greber et al., 2010Greber B. Wu G. Bernemann C. Joo J.Y. Han D.W. Ko K. Tapia N. Sabour D. Sterneckert J. Tesar P. Schöler H.R.

Love J. et al.Metastable pluripotent states in NOD-mouse-derived ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As Oct4-GFP positive cells exhibited upregulation of some prominent ESC markers, we speculated that Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs can be converted more easily than Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs. Under the 2i condition, the conversion efficiency of Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs was much higher compared with that of Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs, as determined by the number of colonies staining positive for alkaline phosphatase (Figures 4A and 4B ). Remarkably, conversion of Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs was noted only in the presence of 2i+LIF, and not in EpiSC medium. Consistent with a previous study (Bao et al., 2009Bao S. Tang F. Li X. Hayashi K. Gillich A. Lao K. Surani M.A. Epigenetic reversion of post-implantation epiblast to pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we also obtained converted ES-like cells in typical ESC medium (LIF alone). However, we were unable to maintain these converted cells with LIF alone (data not shown). Thus, although Oct4-GFP positive cells do not represent ES-like cells, they can be converted at substantially higher efficiency than Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs. Finally, to definitively rule out the possibility that Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs are actually spontaneously converted ES-like cells, we assessed the promoter methylation patterns of Stella, Fragilis, Vasa, and Dppa5 in the ES-like cells that had been converted from Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs. The Stella promoter is known to be differentially methylated in EpiSCs and ESCs (Bao et al., 2009Bao S. Tang F. Li X. Hayashi K. Gillich A. Lao K. Surani M.A. Epigenetic reversion of post-implantation epiblast to pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2009; 461: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 4C, the converted ES-like cells exhibited an imprinted DNA methylation pattern of the Stella promoter, like ESCs, but a clearly different pattern compared with Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs, from which they had been derived (Figure 3F). Similarly, the converted ES-like cells exhibited hypomethylation of the Rex1 promoter region, but both Oct4-GFP positive and negative EpiSCs showed high Rex1 promoter methylation (Figure S2). Moreover, the converted ES-like cells also showed reduced DNA promoter methylation of the germ cell markers Fragilis, Vasa, and Dppa5, like ESCs, whereas Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs exhibited hypermethylation of these germ cell marker genes (Figure 4C and Figure 3F). Therefore, the distinct DNA methylation pattern in Oct4-GFP positive EpiSCs and converted ES-like cells allows us to definitively rule out that the Oct4-GFP positive EpiSC subpopulation represents EpiSCs that had spontaneously converted to an ES-like state in EpiSC culture. Oct4-GFP positive and Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs exhibit differential expression of some ESC marker genes (Figure 3A), distinguishable Dppa5 methylation pattern (Figure 3F), and distinct ESC conversion efficiency (Figures 4A and 4B). Of interest, Dppa5, which was less methylated in Oct4-GFP positive than in Oct4-GFP negative EpiSCs (Figure 3F), is expressed in E5.5 epiblasts, but not in E6.5 epiblasts (Western et al., 2005Western P.

Glyoxalase-I (GLO-I) transgenic rats were used to explore whether overexpression of this MGO detoxifying enzyme reduces levels of AGEs and oxidative stress in a rat model of diabetes. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin, and after 12 weeks, plasma and multiple tissues were isolated for analysis of AGEs, carbonyl stress, and oxidative stress. GLO-I activity was significantly elevated in multiple tissues of all transgenic rats compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Streptozotocin treatment resulted in a 5-fold increase in blood glucose concentrations irrespective of GLO-I overexpression. Levels of MGO, glyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone, AGEs, and oxidative stress markers nitrotyrosine, malondialdehyde, and F2-isoprostane were elevated in the diabetic WT rats. In diabetic GLO-I rats, glyoxal and MGO composite scores were significantly decreased by 81%, and plasma AGEs and oxidative stress markers scores were significantly decreased by ∼50%. Hyperglycemia induced a decrease in protein levels of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex in the gastrocnemius muscle, which was accompanied by an increase in the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and this was counteracted by GLO-I overexpression. This study shows for the first time in an in vivo model of diabetes that GLO-I overexpression reduces hyperglycemia-induced levels of carbonyl stress, AGEs, and oxidative stress. The reduction of oxidative stress by GLO-I overexpression directly demonstrates the link between glycation and oxidative stress."

However, their roles in mammalian organogenesis are only beginning to be understood. Here we show that the microRNA-212/132 family (which comprises miR-212 and miR-132) is indispensable during the development of the mammary glands in mice, particularly for the regulation of the outgrowth of the epithelial ducts. Mammary transplantation experiments revealed that the function of the miR-212/132 family is required in the stroma but not in the epithelia. Both miR-212 and miR-132 are expressed exclusively in mammary stroma and directly target the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9. In glands that lack miR-212 and miR-132, MMP-9 expression increases and accumulates around the ducts. This may interfere with collagen deposition and lead to hyperactivation of the tumor growth factor-β signaling pathway, thereby impairing ductal outgrowth. Our results identify the miR-212/132 family as one of the main regulators of the epithelial-stromal interactions that are required for proper pubertal development of the mammary gland."

However, the effectiveness of this anti-angiogenic agent is limited by the presence of innate and acquired drug resistance. By screening a panel of candidate growth factors we identified fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) as a potent regulator of endothelial cell sensitivity to sunitinib. We show that FGF2 supports endothelial proliferation and de novo tubule formation in the presence of sunitinib and that FGF2 can suppress sunitinib-induced retraction of tubules. Importantly, these effects of FGF2 were ablated by PD173074, a small molecule inhibitor of FGF receptor signalling. We also show that FGF2 can stimulate pro-angiogenic signalling pathways in endothelial cells despite the presence of sunitinib. Finally, analysis of clinical renal-cancer samples demonstrates that a large proportion of renal cancers strongly express FGF2. We suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to simultaneously target both VEGF and FGF2 signalling may prove more efficacious than sunitinib in renal cancer patients whose tumours express FGF2."

https://openalex.org/W1973483964,"The telomere-capping complex shelterin protects functional telomeres and prevents the initiation of unwanted DNA-damage-response pathways. At the end of cellular replicative lifespan, uncapped telomeres lose this protective mechanism and DNA-damage signalling pathways are triggered that activate p53 and thereby induce replicative senescence. Here, we identify a signalling pathway involving p53, Siah1 (a p53-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase) and TRF2 (telomere repeat binding factor 2; a component of the shelterin complex). Endogenous Siah1 and TRF2 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during replicative senescence with activated p53. Experimental manipulation of p53 expression demonstrated that p53 induces Siah1 and represses TRF2 protein levels. The p53-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of TRF2 are attributed to the E3 ligase activity of Siah1. Knockdown of Siah1 stabilized TRF2 and delayed the onset of cellular replicative senescence, suggesting a role for Siah1 and TRF2 in p53-regulated senescence. This study reveals that p53, a downstream effector of telomere-initiated damage signalling, also functions upstream of the shelterin complex."

In this report we show that collagen can regulate the tumor suppressive let-7 family of microRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells. PDAC cells growing in 3D collagen gels repress mature let-7 without affecting the precursor form of let-7 in part through increased expression of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) and ERK1/2 activation. PDAC cells in collagen also demonstrate increased TGF-β1 signaling, and blocking TGF-β1 signaling attenuated collagen-induced MT1-MMP expression, ERK1/2 activation and repression of let-7 levels. Although MT1-MMP overexpression was not sufficient to inhibit let-7 on 2D tissue culture plastic, overexpression of MT1-MMP in PDAC cells embedded in 3D collagen gels or grown in vivo repressed let-7 levels. Importantly, MT1-MMP expression significantly correlated with decreased levels of let-7 in human PDAC tumor specimens. Overall, our study emphasizes the interplay between the key proteinase MT1-MMP and its substrate type I collagen in modulating microRNA expression, and identifies an additional mechanism by which fibrosis may contribute to PDAC progression."

Patients with many forms of cancer, including prostate, may develop autoantibodies that bind to the NH2-domain of GRP78 where α2M* binds (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Cuchacovich M. Llanos C. Urzua C.

These antibodies are receptor agonists linked to a poor outcome for patients with prostate cancer (16Gonzalez-Gronow M. Cuchacovich M. Llanos C. Urzua C. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V.

In the present study, we demonstrate that ligation of GRP78 on the surface of human prostate cancer cells causes increased production and secretion of PSA, which is functional and complexes with native α2M. These complexes bind to cell surface GRP78, triggering ERK and Akt activation and increased DNA and protein synthesis. We hypothesize that ligation of cell surface GRP78 on prostate cancer cells may drive an autoregulatory feedback loop wherein reaction of α2M with PSA generates more α2M*, thus further activating proproliferative/antiapoptotic signaling mechanisms. Receptor-recognized α2M* was produced by reaction of α2M with methylamine as described previously (11Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Hart J.P. Johnson C.E. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

In preliminary experiments, we used two prostate cancer cell lines, 1-LN and DU-145, which express GRP78 on their cell surface, and the PC-3 prostate cancer line, which does not express GRP78 on the cell surface (11Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.

The highly metastatic 1-LN cell line is derived from the less metastatic PC-3 line and was a kind gift of Dr. Phil Walther (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were grown in 6-well plates (500 × 103 cells/well) to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.5 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm insulin in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. At 90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, the monolayers were washed with ice-cold HHBSS, a fresh volume of medium was added, and the cells used for the experiments described below. In initial experiments, we determined the effect of varying concentrations of α2M·methylamine on PSA levels by Western blotting. 1-LN DU-145 and PC-3 cells grown to confluence were incubated in the RPM1640 medium used above in 6-well plates (3 × 106 cells/well). The cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of α2M·methylamine and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and leupeptin (20 μg/ml) over ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were scraped into new Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g at 4 °C, and protein contents of lysates were determined (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). To equal amounts of lysate protein, a volume of 4× sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% gel, transferred to PDVF membrane, and membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PSA antibodies. Protein bands on the immunoblot were visualized and quantified by ECF and phosphorimaging. The membrane was reprobed for actin as a protein loading control. Total RNA from 1-LN, DU145, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells treated with buffer or α2M* was extracted by a single method using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with 1 μg of RNA in a 20-μl reaction mixture, using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units) and oligo(dT) as primer for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting cDNA (5 μg) was used as a template, and a 225-bp segment of the PSA cDNA was amplified using a 20-mer upstream primer (5′-CCA ACA CCC GCT CTA CGA TA-3′) and a 22-mer downstream primer (5′-ACC TTC TGA CGG TGA ACT TGC G-3′). A 302-bp segment of mouse β-actin (constitutive internal control) cDNA was co-amplified using a set of PCR primers provided in an R&D Systems kit (Minneapolis, MN). Amplification was carried out in a Biometra T3 thermocycler for 28 cycles (one cycle: 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 70 °C for 45 s). PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose/ethidium bromide) gel. The gels were photographed, and the intensity of individual PSA and β-actin mRNA bands was quantified as PSA/β-actin ratios. To determine the requirement of cell surface GRP78 for α2M·methylamine-induced up-regulation of PSA, we silenced the expression of GRP78 by RNAi. In our earlier publications we have used two GRP78 targeting mRNA sequences for silencing its gene expression and found identical effects on GRP78 expression as well as downstream signaling (15Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13694-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We also found that transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA down-regulates both the total cellular GRP78 pool and cell surface-localized GRP78 (20Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2010; 9: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this investigation, we have used only one GRP78 targeting mRNA sequence for silencing the expression of GRP78. The chemical synthesis of dsRNA homologous in sequence to the target GRP78 370K1QQLVK376 mRNA sequence. 5′-AAA ATA CAG CAA TTA GTA AAG-3′ (Swiss Prot GRP primary sequence accession number P11021) were performed by Ambion (Austin, TX). For making GRP78 dsRNA, sense (5′-AAU ACA GCA AUU AGU AAA GTT-3′) and antisense (5′-CUU UAC UAA UUG CUG UAU UTT-3′) oligonucleotides were annealed by Ambion. Transfection of 1-LN, DU-145, and PC-3 cells with GRP78 dsRNA was done as described previously (15Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13694-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent 1-LN DU-145 and PC-3 cell monolayers (1.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates) were incubated as described above and transfected with 75 nm annealed GRP78 dsRNA and control cells were transfected with Lipofectamine as described previously (15Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13694-13707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the control cells were stimulated with either buffer or α2M·methylamine (50 pm for 20 min). Cells transfected with scrambled dsRNA and treated with α2M* were used as the control. The reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, and cells were lysed in lysis buffer A over ice for 15 min. Lysates were then transferred to tubes and centrifuged, and proteins in the supernatant were determined. Equal amounts of lysate protein were electrophoresed, transferred to membrane, and immunoblotted with PSA antibodies. Protein bands on the membrane were detected and quantified by ECF and phosphorimaging. The membrane was reprobed for protein loading control actin. Confluent 1-LN cells incubated in the RPMI 1640 medium described above in 6-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) were labeled with [35S]-Express S35S35 protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (250 μCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. The labeling was stopped by aspirating the medium; monolayers were washed four times with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3.5 mm NaHCO3 buffer; a volume of the RPMI medium was added; and cells were incubated at 37 °C for temperature equilibration. Cells in the wells were treated with anti-CTD antibody (2 μg/ml) or buffer for 1 h before adding α2M* (50 pm for 20 min), and the cells were incubated as above. The reactions were stopped by aspirating the medium; a volume of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and leupeptin (20 μg/ml) was added to each well; and cells were lysed for 15 min over ice. Cell lysates were scraped into respective tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g at 4 °C, and protein contents of lysates were determined (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PSA antibodies (1:50) in the presence of Protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C with rotation. PSA immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the above lysis buffer by centrifuging at 2500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Thirty μl of 4× sample buffer was added to each immunoprecipitate; samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 4 min; an equal volume of supernatant was electrophoresed (10% gel) and transferred onto PVDF membranes; and the membranes were autoradiographed in a PhosphorImager and quantified. 1-LN cells incubated overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in 6-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with either buffer or α2M* (50 pm) and incubated as described above. At 12 h of incubation, another dose of α2M* (50 pm) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 11 h. At this time 50 nm native α2M was added to the medium, and cells were incubated for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, medium from both groups was carefully collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The respective supernatants were pooled and concentrated to small volume by centrifugation in Amicon ultracentrifuge units (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) at 2500 rpm at 4 °C for the desired period of time. The concentrates were carefully removed, a volume of the above lysis buffer was added to each concentrate, and their protein contents were determined (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of concentrate proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PSA antibody (1:50) in the presence of Protein A-agarose overnight with 4 °C with gentle buffer. The PSA immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. A volume of Laemmli 2× sample buffer without DTT was added to each immunoprecipitate; each sample was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 4 min; and an equal volume of supernatant was electrophoresed (10% gel), transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-PSA antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The detection and quantitation of immunoblots were performed by ECF and phosphorimaging. The membranes were reprobed for α2M. The synthesis of human α2M·PSA complexes was performed according to Otto et al. (21Otto A. Bär J. Birkenmeier G. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). α2M was isolated and purified from human plasma as described previously (11Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Hart J.P. Johnson C.E. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42082-42087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Native α2M was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of PSA at 37 °C for 1 h in PBS. The α2M·PSA complex was isolated by chromatography on a HiPrep Sephacryl 16/60 S300 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The α2M·PSA complex, which eluted first, was collected, and fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Pierce (Rockford, IL) iCon® concentrator to a final concentration of 2–4 mg/ml. Eluates of unincorporated PSA, which eluted later, were also collected, pooled, and concentrated. The formation of α2M·PSA complex was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Two-μg samples of methylamine-activated α2M or α2M·PSA complex were loaded onto a 7% Tris-acetate gel and electrophoresed with TBE extended range (Bio-Rad) running buffer for 1.5 h. The protein bands were detected with Coomassie staining. In preliminary experiments, we determined the effect of incubating 1-LN cells with varying concentrations of α2M·methylamine and premade α2M·PSA on incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, as described previously (22Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Misra U.K. Mowery Y. Kaczowka S. Pizzo S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 1350-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After determining the optimal concentrations of α2M·methylamine and α2M·PSA required for maximal incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cells, we used this concentration to examine the modulation of α2M*-induced DNA synthesis. 1-LN cells (300 × 103 cells/well) in 48-well plates were grown in RPMI medium in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. At ∼90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, and a volume of RPMI was added, followed by the addition of either buffer, native α2M (50 pm), PSA (50 pm), cell-free medium, α2M·methylamine (50 pm), premade α2M·PSA (50 pm) or complex obtained by adding α2M (5 μg/ml) to 1-LN tumor cells in culture, anti-CTD antibody (2 μg/ml), anti-CTD antibody and then α2M·methylamine, anti-CTD antibody and then premade α2M·PSA, anti-CTD antibody and then α2M·PSA made in culture, actinomycin D and then premade α2M·PSA, actinomycin D (5 μg/1 ml) and then α2M·methylamine (50 pm), actinomycin D and then premade α2M·PSA, or actinomycin D and then α2M·PSA made in the medium as above. [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated overnight. The reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, and monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold 5% TCA, followed by three washings with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in a volume of 1 n NaOH (40 °C/2 h), lysate protein was estimated, and the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (14Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26278-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To further examine the requirement of cell surface GRP78 expression for cell-proliferative effects of α2M-NH2, we measured [3H]thymidine uptake in DU-145 cells, which express cell surface GRP78, and on PC-3 cells, which do not. DU-145 and PC-3 cells were grown in 48-well plates in RPMI medium as described above. At about ∼90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, and a volume of RPMI medium was added, followed by the addition of either buffer, native α2M (50 pm), α2M·methylamine (50 pm), premade α2M·PSA (50 pm) complex obtained by adding α2M (5 μg/ml) to 1-LN tumor cells in culture or anti-CTD antibody (2 μg/ml) added 1 h before adding α2M·methylamine, or α2M·PSA complexes as above. The effects of anti-CTD antibody alone were also studied. [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated overnight. The incubations were then processed as described for 1-LN cells. 1-LN cells (300 × 103 cells/well in 48-well plates were grown in RPMI medium in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. At ∼90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, and a volume of RPMI was added, followed by the addition of either buffer, native α2M (50 pm), PSA (50 pm), cell-free medium, α2M·methylamine (50 pm), α2M·PSA complexes as above, anti-CTD antibody (2 μg/ml), anti-CTD antibody and then α2M·methylamine (50 pm), anti-CTD antibody and then α2M·PSA as above, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) and then α2M·methylamine (50 pm), or actinomycin D and then α2M·PSA as above. To the wells was then added [3H]leucine (2 μCi/ml), and cells were incubated overnight as above. The reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, and monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold 5% TCA, followed by three washings with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in a volume of 1 n NaOH (40 °C/2 h), protein was estimated, and the lysates were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (14Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26278-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These prostate cancer cells (3 × 106 cells/well) in separate 6-well plates were grown in the RPMI medium used above in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. At ∼90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, and a volume of RPMI was added, followed by the addition of either buffer, native α2M (50 pm for 20 min), α2M·methylamine (50 pm for 20 min), premade α2M·PSA (50 pm for 20 min), or tumor tissue culture-derived α2M·PSA (α2M, 5 μg/ml for 20 min) in the respective wells. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium, and a volume of lysis buffer A was added. Cells were lysed over ice for 15 min and scraped into tubes, and tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, their protein contents were estimated, and equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed (10 or 12.5% gels). Protein bands were transferred to PVDF membrane and membrane-immunoblotted for PSA, GRP78, phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-AktThr-308, phospho-AktSer-473, and phospho-S6K with their specific antibodies. The respective immunoblots were probed for their protein loading control actin and respective unphosphorylated protein. Protein bands were detected by ECF and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Statistical significance of the data were determined by Student's t test. Treatment of 1-LN or DU-145 prostate cancer cells with varying concentrations of α2M·methylamine for 20 min caused a concentration-dependent increase in PSA protein, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). The maximum increase occurred at about 50 pm α2M·methylamine; therefore, we have used this concentration of α2M·methylamine in the experiments described below. This same treatment had no effect on PC-3 cells. Both 1-LN and DU145 cells express GRP78 on their cell surfaces, whereas PC-3 cells do not (12Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 1-LN prostate cancer cells are derived from the less metastatic PC-3 line. Treatment of 1-LN and DU145 prostate cancer cells with α2M·methylamine caused transcriptional up-regulation of PSA as determined by mRNA levels, which were about 2-fold higher compared with the buffer-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of 1-LN cells with anti-CTD antibody also inhibited α2M*-induced transcriptional up-regulation of PSA as judged by mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Likewise, α2M·methylamine treatment of 1-LN and DU145 cells also increased PSA levels as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of these cells with anti-CTD antibody significantly attenuated the expression of PSA protein (Fig. 2). Ligation of cell surface GRP78 in 1-LN human prostate cancer cells triggers the synthesis of GRP78 and cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis as a result of activating several antiapoptotic signaling pathways (10Wu S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2096391284,"Under conditions of reduced tissue oxygenation, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) controls many processes, including angiogenesis and cellular metabolism, and also influences cell proliferation and survival decisions. HIF is centrally involved in tumour growth in inherited diseases that give rise to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), such as Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. In this study, we examined whether HIF is involved in tumour formation of RCC in Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. For this, we analysed a Birt–Hogg–Dubé patient-derived renal tumour cell line (UOK257) that is devoid of the Birt–Hogg–Dubé protein (BHD) and observed high levels of HIF activity. Knockdown of BHD expression also caused a threefold activation of HIF, which was not as a consequence of more HIF1α or HIF2α protein. Transcription of HIF target genes VEGF, BNIP3 and CCND1 was also increased. We found nuclear localization of HIF1α and increased expression of VEGF, BNIP3 and GLUT1 in a chromophobe carcinoma from a Birt–Hogg–Dubé patient. Our data also reveal that UOK257 cells have high lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. We observed increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (a HIF gene target), which in turn leads to increased phosphorylation and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Together with increased protein levels of GLUT1, our data reveal that UOK257 cells favour glycolytic rather than lipid metabolism (a cancer phenomenon termed the ‘Warburg effect’). UOK257 cells also possessed a higher expression level of the L-lactate influx monocarboxylate transporter 1 and consequently utilized L-lactate as a metabolic fuel. As a result of their higher dependency on glycolysis, we were able to selectively inhibit the growth of these UOK257 cells by treatment with 2-deoxyglucose. This work suggests that targeting glycolytic metabolism may be used therapeutically to treat Birt–Hogg–Dubé-associated renal lesions."

https://openalex.org/W1983472367,"Protein secretion in bacteria is driven through the ubiquitous SecYEG complex by the ATPase SecA. The structure of SecYEG alone or as a complex with SecA in detergent reveal a monomeric heterotrimer enclosing a central protein channel, yet in membranes it is dimeric. We have addressed the functional significance of the oligomeric status of SecYEG in protein translocation using single molecule and ensemble methods. The results show that while monomers are sufficient for the SecA- and ATP-dependent association of SecYEG with pre-protein, active transport requires SecYEG dimers arranged in the back-to-back conformation. Molecular modeling of this dimeric structure, in conjunction with the new functional data, provides a rationale for the presence of both active and passive copies of SecYEG in the functional translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2160295920,"c-Met represents an important emerging therapeutic target in cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the mechanism by which c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibition inhibits tumor growth in a highly invasive Asian-prevalent head and neck cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; AM7 and c-Met TKI tool compound SU11274) downregulated c-Met phosphorylation, resulting in marked inhibition of NPC cell growth and invasion. Strikingly, inhibition of c-Met resulted in significant downregulation of T P53-induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator (TIGAR) and subsequent depletion of intracellular NADPH. Importantly, overexpression of TIGAR ameliorated the effects of c-Met kinase inhibition, confirming the importance of TIGAR downregulation in the growth inhibitory activity of c-Met TKI. The effects of c-Met inhibition on TIGAR and NADPH levels were observed with two different c-Met TKIs (AM7 and SU11274) and with multiple cell lines. As NADPH provides a crucial reducing power required for cell survival and proliferation, our findings reveal a novel mechanistic action of c-Met TKI, which may represent a key effect of c-Met kinase inhibition. Our data provide the first evidence linking c-Met, TIGAR and NADPH regulation in human cancer cells suggesting that inhibition of a tyrosine kinase/TIGAR/NADPH cascade may have therapeutic applicability in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007688287,"Although the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on angiogenesis and vascular function are well known, the effects of VEGF on tumor cell function remain to be elucidated. We studied phenotypic changes in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with homozygous deletion of VEGF alleles to determine the potential direct role of VEGF on tumor cell function. Loss of VEGF expression led to significantly decreased cell growth and increased spontaneous apoptosis in CRC cells (P<0.01). Loss of VEGF also increased the in vitro sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil, as shown by increased apoptosis (P<0.05). These effects were mediated via upregulation of the proapoptotic mediators caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax and downregulation of the pro-survival mediator survivin. Our findings suggest a novel and distinct function of VEGF in mediating autocrine/intracrine CRC cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2085312025,"Cadherins and neuroligins (NLs) represent two families of cell adhesion proteins that are essential for the establishment of synaptic connections in vitro; however, it remains unclear whether these proteins act in concert to regulate synapse density. Using a combination of overexpression and knockdown analyses in primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that NL1 and N-cadherin promote the formation of glutamatergic synapses through a common functional pathway. Analysis of the spatial relationship between N-cadherin and NL1 indicates that in 14-day in vitro cultures, almost half of glutamatergic synapses are associated with both proteins, whereas only a subset of these synapses are associated with N-cadherin or NL1 alone. This suggests that NL1 and N-cadherin are spatially distributed in a manner that enables cooperation at synapses. In young cultures, N-cadherin clustering and its association with synaptic markers precede the clustering of NL1. Overexpression of N-cadherin at this time point enhances NL1 clustering and increases synapse density. Although N-cadherin is not sufficient to enhance NL1 clustering and synapse density in more mature cultures, knockdown of N-cadherin at later time points significantly attenuates the density of NL1 clusters and synapses. N-cadherin overexpression can partially rescue synapse loss in NL1 knockdown cells, possibly due to the ability of N-cadherin to recruit NL2 to glutamatergic synapses in these cells. We demonstrate that cadherins and NLs can act in concert to regulate synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2026353278,"The nuclear distribution protein E (NudE) and nuclear distribution protein E-like (Nudel or Ndel1) interact with both lissencephaly 1 (Lis1) and dynein. These interactions are thought to be essential for dynein function. Previous studies have shown that the highly conserved N terminus of NudE/Nudel directly binds to Lis1, and such binding is critical for dynein activity. By contrast, although the C terminus of NudE/Nudel was reported to bind to dynein, the functional significance of this binding has remained unclear. Using the sperm-mediated spindle assembly assay in Xenopus egg extracts and extensive mutagenesis studies, we have identified a highly conserved dynein binding domain within the first 80 amino acids of Nudel. We further demonstrate that the dynein intermediate chain in the dynein complex is directly involved in this interaction. Importantly, we show that both the dynein and Lis1 binding domains of Nudel are required for spindle pole organization. Finally, we report that spindle defects caused by immuno-depletion of Nudel could be rescued by a 1-fold increase of Lis1 concentration in Xenopus egg extracts. This suggests that an important function of the N terminus of Nudel is to facilitate the interaction between Lis1 and dynein during spindle assembly.

Together, our findings open up new avenues to further decipher the mechanism of dynein regulation by Nudel and Lis1. The cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed microtubule-based motor that regulates many cellular functions in interphase and mitosis, including membrane trafficking, nuclear migration, mitotic spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. Dynein is a complex consisting of the catalytic dynein heavy chain and several non-catalytic subunits including dynein intermediate chain (DIC), 2The abbreviations used are: DICdynein intermediate chainDLICdynein light intermediate chainDLCdynein light chain. dynein light intermediate chain (DLIC), and dynein light chains (DLC). This complex is regulated by an array of proteins including dynactin, Bicaudal D, NudE/Nudel, and Lis1. These dynein regulators are critical to adapt dynein to membrane cargos or to other cellular components for transport along microtubules (1Kardon J.R. Vale R.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Among the dynein regulators, Lis1 is required for most aspects of dynein function. Lis1 binds to both the catalytic domain of the dynein heavy chain and several non-catalytic dynein subunits (2Faulkner N.E. Dujardin D.L. Tai C.Y. Vaughan K.T. O'Connell C.B. Wang Y. Vallee R.B. Nat.

The ability of Lis1 to regulate dynein is further controlled by its binding partner NudE/Nudel, which consists of a highly conserved N-terminal coiled-coil domain and an unstructured C terminus (5Feng Y.

Because the C terminus of NudE/Nudel mediates interactions with multiple proteins, this region could be critical to link dynein to various cellular functions. For example, in mitosis the interaction between Xenopus Nudel and lamin-B helps to recruits lamin-B to microtubules to facilitate assembly of the lamin-B spindle matrix (14Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Heidinger J.M. Shumaker D.K. Adam S.A. Goldman R.D. Zheng Y. Science. 2006; 311: 1887-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) in a dynein-dependent manner during spindle assembly (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, depletion of NudE and Nudel does not completely abolish lamin-B recruitment to microtubules (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional dynein regulators, such as Bicaudal D (15Hoogenraad C.C. Wulf P. Schiefermeier N. Stepanova T. Galjart N. Small J.V. Grosveld F. de Zeeuw C.I. Akhmanova A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6004-6015Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which can bind to lamin-B (16Stuurman N. Häner M. Sasse B. Hübner W. Suter B. Aebi U. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), could function redundantly with Nudel to recruit lamin-B to dynein. In addition, overexpressing the N-terminal coiled-coil region of the Aspergillus NUDE can rescue the NUDE null mutation (17Efimov V.P. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, the NudE/Nudel homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain the C-terminal region (18Li J. Lee W.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above findings are consistent with the idea that the C terminus of NudE/Nudel functions redundantly with other dynein regulators. The C-terminal dynein binding site on Nudel has also been proposed to be essential for dynein function (7Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Guo J. Yang Z. Song W. Chen Q. Wang F. Zhang Q. Zhu X. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2010; 141: 304-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). By interacting with Lis1 and dynein via its N and C termini, respectively, Nudel is thought to function as a bridge to bring dynein and Lis1 together (7Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Guo J. Yang Z. Song W. Chen Q. Wang F. Zhang Q. Zhu X. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2010; 141: 304-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, the nonessential function of the C terminus of NudE/Nudel homologous in fungi suggests that this C-terminal dynein binding site may not be essential for dynein regulation (17Efimov V.P. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The spindle assembly assay in Xenopus cytostatic factor-arrested egg extracts offers an opportunity to study dynein regulation in mitosis without the complication of indirect effects caused by dynein mis-regulation in the previous interphase. Dynein is critical for spindle pole organization in both tissue culture cells (21Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and Xenopus egg extracts (22Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that depletion of NudE and Nudel in Xenopus egg extracts also causes defects in spindle pole focusing, which can be fully rescued using purified Nudel (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggests that Nudel and most likely Lis1 regulate the function of dynein in spindle pole organization in mitosis. Using spindle pole focusing as an assay, we have identified an essential dynein binding domain within the N terminus of Nudel, right next to the previously identified Lis1 binding domain. We further demonstrate that both the dynein binding domain and the Lis1 binding domain of Nudel are required to regulate dynein function. The cDNAs encoding Xenopus Nudel (clone ID 6955255), dynein intermediate chain (clone ID 6861285), dynein light intermediate chain (clone ID 8074560), and dynein light chain 8 (clone ID 4057971) were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The PCR fragments corresponding to full-length or truncated open reading frames of the above proteins were subcloned into either pGEX6P2 or pET30a vectors at BamHI and NotI sites. Point mutations of Nudel were made using PCR site-directed mutagenesis method, and all point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. One-liter cultures with A600 of 0.5–0.7 were induced with 24 μg/ml isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (PTG) for either 4 h at 37 °C or overnight at 22 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of TNGT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.8 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Tween 20, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml of lysozyme). The re-suspended bacterial cells were frozen at −80 °C overnight. Affinity purification using either glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was carried out according to protocols provided by the manufacturers. The purified proteins were exchanged into XB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm EGTA) using PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to desired concentrations with Amicon Ultra 30K device (Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by comparing the purified proteins with BSA standard on the same SDS-PAGE, then converting into molar concentrations with the calculated molecular weight. The N terminus of Nudel is highly soluble and can be stored as 100–250 μm stocks at −80 °C. The His-tagged full-length Nudel was further purified by passing through Mono Q column and stored in XB buffer at 3.4 μm. His-Lis1 was expressed in Sf9 cells by infecting with the recombinant baculovirus stock provided by Dr. Andrea Musacchio (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and stored as 60 μm stocks at −80 °C. All purified Nudel and Lis1 proteins retain their biological activities (as assayed by spindle pole organization) for more than 6 months at −80 °C. 20 μg of various GST fusion proteins or control GST protein was added to 100 μl of egg extracts. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (bed volume) was added to the egg extracts and incubated for additional 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with XB buffer for DIC pulldown. The beads was washed twice with XB buffer supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 and twice with XB buffer for Lis1 pulldown. The beads were boiled in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 5 μl of samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. DIC was probed with monoclonal antibody 74.1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab23905, 1:1000 dilution), and Lis1 was probed with monoclonal antibody Lis1–338 (Sigma, catalog no. L7391, 1:2000 dilution). The cytostatic factor-arrested Xenopus egg extracts and sperms were prepared as previously described (24Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Spindle assembly was carried out in a 25-μl reaction in which 22 μl of Xenopus egg extract was mixed with 1 μl of 25X sperm mix and 2 μl of purified proteins. The 25X sperm mix contains sperm at ∼18,000 sperm/μl, 25X energy mix, and 1.5–2.0 mg/ml rhodamine-labeled tubulin. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 100–120 min. All quantifications shown were done using the same time point of reaction. Nudel antibody was generated as previously described (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Lis1 antibody was raised against purified GST-LisH domain (amino acids 1–99) of Xenopus Lis1 and was affinity-purified using His-LisH protein. Immuno-depletion was carried out by incubating 100 μl of egg extracts with 100 μg of Nudel antibody or Lis1 antibody coupled to 20 μl of Affi-prep protein A beads (bed volume) (Bio-Rad catalog no. 156-0005) at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating shaker. To ensure sufficient contact of the egg extract with antibody beads, a few air bubbles were intentionally introduced into the extract during incubation. The beads were removed from the extract by centrifuging at 800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Two rounds of immuno-depletion are needed to remove the majority of Lis1, whereas one round of immuno-depletion is sufficient to remove the majority of Nudel. Spindle pole focusing was quantified as dynein is required for the formation of focused bipolar spindles in Xenopus egg extracts. We have grouped assembled microtubule structures into four morphological categories, i.e. bipolar spindle, multi-polar spindle, partially focused spindle, and fence-like structure. Bipolar spindle is defined as structures with two focused poles and tightly aligned chromosomes near the equator of the spindle. Multipolar spindle is defined as structures with a narrowly aligned chromosome bar located near the equator, but microtubules are focused into more than two poles. Partially focused spindle includes structures with either one pole in focusing or neither pole in focusing. Loosely packed microtubules without pole focusing, but bent or tend to focus, are also included in this category. Fence is defined as microtubules aligning perpendicularly to the chromosome bar. These microtubules are usually straight and parallel with each other, and the chromosome bar is located in the middle of the microtubules. Each set of experiments was repeated with at least three different extracts prepared on separate days. 100–150 spindles were quantified in each sample. S.E. was calculated as S.D. divided by the square root of the number of experiments (n). We reasoned that the ability to study spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts using immuno-depletion and add-back could allow us to isolate one aspect of Nudel function in spindle pole organization. This may help us to gain a better understanding of how Nudel interacts with dynein and regulates dynein activity in the presence of a full complement of dynein regulators. We have shown previously that Nudel antibody immunodepletes both NudE and Nudel in Xenopus egg extracts (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To further characterize Nudel function, we immuno-depleted NudE/Nudel from Xenopus egg extracts (Fig. 1A). Spindle assembly was induced using Xenopus sperm chromatin. As expected, whereas in mock-depleted egg extracts most spindles assembled are focused bipolar structures, depleting NudE/Nudel resulted in spindles having mostly unfocused poles with microtubules aligning perpendicularly to the sperm chromatin appearing as “picket fences” (Fence in Fig. 1, B and C). The addition of purified His-Nudel at the concentration equivalent to the endogenous Nudel/NudE (0.05–0.1 μm) (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) rescued the defects in spindle pole focusing (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1A). To study whether Lis1 also functions to regulate spindle pole organization, we immuno-depleted Lis1 and found that Lis1 depletion pheno-copied NudE/Nudel depletion (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). Whereas the addition of purified His-Lis1 to the endogenous Lis1 concentration (∼1 μm, see supplemental Fig. S1) rescued the spindle pole defects, the addition of 1 μm Nudel failed to do so (Fig. 1D). This shows that similar to Nudel, Lis1 is required for spindle pole organization. Moreover, the purified His-Lis1 can replace the function of endogenous Lis1. To test whether Lis1 can replace NudE/Nudel function, we immuno-depleted NudE/Nudel and added an increasing concentration of Lis1 to egg extracts. We found that the addition of His-Lis1 to 0.8 μm (the endogenous Lis1 concentration is ∼1 μm; see supplemental Fig. S1) is sufficient to rescue spindle pole defects (Fig. 1E). This shows that increasing Lis1 concentration by ∼1-fold is sufficient to fully compensate for the defects caused by immuno-depletion of NudE/Nudel in spindle pole organization. Multiple functions have been assigned to the C terminus of NudE/Nudel in vertebrates, suggesting that this part of NudE/Nudel is important for its function. However, the C terminus of NudE/Nudel homologs in fungi are either nonessential (23Efimov V.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or largely missing from the protein (18Li J. Lee W.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In Aspergillus, overexpressing the N-terminal coiled-coil region of NUDE is sufficient to rescue NUDE null phenotypes (23Efimov V.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, strongly overexpressing the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Nudel causes dominant negative effects on dynein function in both mammalian tissue culture cells (6Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 2004; 44: 279-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 7Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and Xenopus egg extracts (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to further examine the function of the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Nudel. We have shown that the addition of Nudel N-terminal 1–201 amino acids as a His-tagged protein (His-Nudel1–201) (Fig. 2A) at ∼50-fold molar excess of the endogenous NudE/Nudel disrupts formation of spindle-like structures stimulated by Aurora-A beads in egg extracts (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether the addition of a less amount of His-Nudel1–201 could rescue NudE/Nudel depletion, as what was observed in Aspergillus, we immuno-depleted NudE/Nudel from egg extracts and added an increasing amount of His-Nudel1–201 up to a 2–4-fold molar excess of the endogenous NudE/Nudel (10Ma L. Tsai M.Y. Wang S. Lu B. Chen R. Iii JR. Zhu X. Zheng Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified full-length Nudel (His-Nudel FL) was used as controls. As expected, the addition of 0.05–0.1 μm of the full-length Nudel rescued spindle pole focusing (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we found that the addition of His-Nudel1–201 at a 2–4-fold molar excess of endogenous NudE/Nudel also rescued spindle pole focusing defects caused by NudE/Nudel depletion (Fig. 2C). The same concentration of GST-tagged-Nudel1–201 could also rescue spindle pole focusing (data not shown). This demonstrates that the N-terminal coiled-coil region of Nudel, when present at more than a 2-fold molar excess can compensate for the spindle pole defects caused by the reduction of NudE/Nudel. Previous studies have suggested that Lis1 binding is important for NudE/Nudel to regulate dynein. The Lis1 binding domain has been mapped to within the N-terminal 100–153 amino acids of NudE/Nudel. To further define the spindle pole focusing activity present in the N-terminal coiled-coil region of Nudel, we created two GST fusion fragments of Nudel that either contain or lack the Lis1 binding domain (Fig. 2A). We found that none of these fragments was able to rescue the spindle pole focusing defects caused by NudE/Nudel depletion (Fig. 2, D and E). This suggests that some activities in addition to Lis1 binding are required for the N terminus of Nudel to regulate spindle pole organization. Because the interaction between NudE/Nudel and dynein has been suggested to be important for dynein regulation, we suspected that there could be a dynein binding domain within the N-terminal coiled-coil region of Nudel. To examine this, we first carried out deletion analyses from either the N or C terminus of GST-Nudel1–201 (Fig. 3A). A total of 11 GST-tagged fragments was expressed and purified from bacteria (see the Coomassie Blue-stained gel at the bottom of Fig. 3B). Each of these fragments was individually added to egg extracts to test their ability to bind to dynein and Lis1 using protein pulldown assays. Using antibodies to Lis1 and DIC, we found a dynein binding domain localized within the first 80 amino acids of Nudel (Fig. 3B). Whereas this dynein binding domain does not mediate Lis1 binding, fragments containing the previous mapped Lis1 binding domain (amino acids 100–153) all bind to Lis1 but not to dynein as expected (Fig. 3B). To further characterize this newly identified dynein binding domain, we aligned this region using Nudel sequences from evolutionarily divergent organisms (Fig. 4A). We individually replaced nine highly conserved amino acids in this region with alanine to create GST-Nudel1–201 fusion proteins carrying point mutations. We also created point mutations in the Lis1 binding domain that are known to affect Lis1 binding in GST-Nudel1–201 (Fig. 4B). Using protein pulldown assays, we found that the conserved amino acids Glu-36, Glu-39, Phe-40, Glu-46, Glu-48, and Glu-52 within a highly conserved region of Nudel are required for dynein binding, whereas amino acids Lys-27, Arg-63, and Glu-75 outside of this region do not play a significant role (Fig. 4B). The single point mutations E119A and R130A exhibit a great reduction in Lis1 binding, whereas GST-Nudel1–201 containing the double E119A/R130A mutations has no detectable Lis1 binding under the same conditions (Fig. 4B). To further determine whether one of the dynein non-catalytic subunits might directly bind to this region of Nudel, we expressed and purified the Xenopus DIC, DLIC2, and DLC8 from bacteria (Fig. 4C). We found that purified Nudel only interacted with the purified DIC but not DLIC2 or DLC8 (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the His-Nudel1–201E48A mutant known to not pull down dynein in Xenopus egg extracts also failed to bind to DIC (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the N terminus of Nudel binds to dynein through DIC. Using the spindle assembly assay, we found that the point mutation in Nudel that abolishes dynein binding also abolishes the ability of GST- Nudel1–201 to rescue spindle pole defects due to NudE/Nudel depletion (Fig. 5A). This demonstrates that the dynein binding domain in the first 80 amino acids of Nudel is essential for spindle pole organization. As expected, point mutations in Lis1 binding domain abolished the ability of GST-Nudel1–201 to fully rescue spindle pole organization (Fig. 5B). Therefore, both the dynein binding and the Lis1 binding domains of Nudel are required for spindle pole assembly. Together the above findings suggest that Nudel functions to facilitate the interaction between Lis1 and dynein (Fig. 5C). The spindle assembly assay in Xenopus egg extracts offers an opportunity to study dynein function in the presence of a full complement of regulators. By assaying for the pole morphology of spindles induced by Xenopus sperm DNA, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 1–201 amino acids of Nudel, consisting of the newly identified dynein binding domain and the previously defined Lis1-binding domain, is sufficient to regulate dynein function in spindle pole focusing when present at 2–4-fold higher molar concentrations than the endogenous Nudel. The C terminus of Nudel has been found to bind to a number of proteins including dynein and lamin-B. In the absence of the C terminus of Nudel, some of these proteins, such as lamin-B, could be recruited to dynein by other dynein adaptors such as Bicaudal D (16Stuurman N. Häner M. Sasse B. Hübner W. Suter B. Aebi U. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to facilitate spindle matrix assembly. Because the only known dynein binding site in Nudel was mapped to the C terminus of Nudel, it has been hypothesized that this C-terminal dynein binding site works with the N-terminal Lis1 binding domain to facilitate Lis1 and dynein interaction. However, we have defined a new dynein binding domain within the first 80 amino acids of Nudel right next to the previously defined Lis1-binding domain. Previous studies suggested that NudE interacts with the intact dynein through DIC and DLC8 (7Stehman S.A. Chen Y. McKenney R.J. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that the N terminus of Nudel binds directly to DIC but not to DLC and DLIC. More importantly, we demonstrate that both the N-terminal dynein binding domain and the Lis1 binding domain are essential to mediate spindle pole organization. This shows that Nudel and NudE use their N terminus coiled-coil regions to facilitate the interaction between dynein and Lis1. Our findings strongly suggest that Nudel functions as a bridge to bring dynein and Lis1 into close proximity, which would facilitate Lis1 to bind to dynein to regulate dynein activity (Fig. 5C). We found that depletion of Nudel could be rescued by simply increasing Lis1 concentration in the egg extracts. An elevated Lis1 concentration would enhance Lis1 and dynein interaction, consequently circumventing Nudel deficiency (Fig. 5C and see more below). These findings provide important new insights that should allow proper modeling of how Nudel can hold Lis1 in the close proximity of dynein to facilitate dynein function (20McKenney R.J. Vershinin M. Kunwar A. Vallee R.B. Gross S.P. Cell. 2010; 141: 304-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We showed that spindle pole defects caused by a >90% reduction of Nudel/NudE levels can be rescued by an approximately 1-fold increase of Lis1 protein concentration. Therefore, in the context of spindle pole assembly, increasing Lis1 concentration is sufficient to allow Lis1 to bind to dynein in a correct configuration for function. However, Nudel has been shown to silence dynein by inhibiting Lis1-stimulated binding of dynein to microtubules in vitro (20McKenney R.J. Vershinin M. Kunwar A. Vallee R.B. Gross S.P. Cell. 2010; 141: 304-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that either the residual Nudel/NudE or additional dynein regulators in the egg extract might fulfill such a function if Lis1 concentration is increased. Considering that Lis1 overexpression in Aspergillus can rescue the NUDE null mutant, we favor the later possibility. Further in vitro studies using purified dynein, Nudel1–201, and Lis1 will be needed to reveal how the N-terminal DIC binding domain of Nudel facilitates Lis1 and dynein interaction and dynein force production on microtubules assembled in vitro. We thank Dr. Li Ma for the GST-Nudel and His-Nudel constructs, Dr. Andrea Musacchio (European Institute of Oncology) for the baculovirus that expresses His-Lis1, and the members of the Zheng laboratory for critical comments.

PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cardiac sarcomeric proteins has been the subject of intense investigations. Yet, the identity, composition, and function of PKA complexes at the sarcomeres have remained elusive. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel sarcomeric AKAP (A-kinase anchoring protein), cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Using yeast two-hybrid technology in screening two adult human heart cDNA libraries, we identified the regulatory subunit of PKA as interacting with human cTnT bait. Immunoprecipitation studies show that cTnT is a dual specificity AKAP, interacting with both PKA-regulatory subunits type I and II. The disruptor peptide Ht31, but not Ht31P (control), abolished cTnT/PKA-R association. Truncations and point mutations identified an amphipathic helix domain in cTnT as the PKA binding site. This was confirmed by a peptide SPOT assay in the presence of Ht31 or Ht31P (control). Gelsolin-dependent removal of thin filament proteins also reduced myofilament-bound PKA-type II. Using a cTn exchange procedure that substitutes the endogenous cTn complex with a recombinant cTn complex we show that PKA-type II is troponin-bound in the myofilament lattice. Displacement of PKA-cTnT complexes correlates with a significant decrease in myofibrillar PKA activity. Taken together, our data propose a novel role for cTnT as a dual-specificity sarcomeric AKAP."
https://openalex.org/W2076182087,"Cannabinoids, the active ingredients in marijuana, have dramatic effects on various organ systems. They exert their effects through two receptor types: CB1, primarily located in the brain, and CB2, primarily located in the immune system. Vertebrates also produce their own cannabinoid-like substances called endocannabinoids, including anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglyceral. Interestingly, some effects of endocannabinoids could not be explained by the signals through either CB1 or CB2. Recently, the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) was proposed to be an atypical cannabinoid receptor. In this issue of Oncogene, two groups demonstrated that GPR55 is expressed in various cancer types in an aggressiveness-related manner, suggesting a novel cancer biomarker and a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1998458666,"Characterization of the direct effects of DNA-damaging agents shows how DNA lesions lead to specific mutations. Yet, serum from Hiroshima survivors, Chernobyl liquidators and radiotherapy patients can induce a clastogenic effect on naive cells, showing indirect induction of genomic instability that persists years after exposure. Such indirect effects are not restricted to ionizing radiation, as chemical genotoxins also induce heritable and transmissible genomic instability phenotypes. Although such indirect induction of genomic instability is well described, the underlying mechanism has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to γ-radiation bear the effects of the insult for weeks. Specifically, conditioned media from the progeny of exposed cells can induce DNA damage and homologous recombination in naive cells. Notably, cells exposed to conditioned media also elicit a genome-destabilizing effect on their neighbouring cells, thus demonstrating transmission of genomic instability. Moreover, we show that the underlying basis for the memory of an insult is completely dependent on two of the major DNA cytosine methyltransferases, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a. Targeted disruption of these genes in exposed cells completely eliminates transmission of genomic instability. Furthermore, transient inactivation of Dnmt1, using a tet-suppressible allele, clears the memory of the insult, thus protecting neighbouring cells from indirect induction of genomic instability. We have thus demonstrated that a single exposure can lead to long-term, genome-destabilizing effects that spread from cell to cell, and we provide a specific molecular mechanism for these persistent bystander effects. Collectively, our results impact the current understanding of risks from toxin exposures and suggest modes of intervention for suppressing genomic instability in people exposed to carcinogenic genotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2059872299,"The most common translocation in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) involves the LMO2 locus, resulting in ectopic expression of the LMO2 gene in human thymocytes. The LMO2 gene was also activated in patients with X-linked Severe Combined Immune Deficiency treated with gene therapy because of retroviral insertion in the LMO2 locus. The LMO2 insertions predisposed these children to T-ALL, yet how LMO2 contributes to T cell transformation remains unclear. The LIM (Lin 11, Isl-1, Mec-3) domain containing LMO2 protein regulates erythropoiesis as part of a large transcriptional complex consisting of LMO2, TAL1, E47, GATA1 and LDB1 that recognizes bipartite E-box-GATA1 sites on target genes. Similarly, a TAL1/E47/LMO2/LDB1 complex is observed in human T-ALL and Tal1 and Lmo2 expression in mice results in disease acceleration. To address the mechanism(s) of Tal1/Lmo2 synergy in leukemia, we generated Lmo2 transgenic mice and mated them with mice that express wild-type Tal1 or a DNA-binding mutant of TAL1. Tal1/Lmo2 and MutTAL1/Lmo2 bitransgenic mice exhibit perturbations in thymocyte development due to reduced E47/HEB transcriptional activity and develop leukemia with identical kinetics. These data demonstrate that the DNA-binding activity of Tal1 is not required to cooperate with Lmo2 to cause leukemia in mice and suggest that Lmo2 may cooperate with Tal1 to interfere with E47/HEB function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1985540942,"This spectroscopic study examined the steady-state and kinetic parameters governing the cross-bridge effect on the increased Ca2+ affinity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-cardiac troponin C (HCM-cTnC) mutants. Previously, we found that incorporation of the A8V and D145E HCM-cTnC mutants, but not E134D into thin filaments (TFs), increased the apparent Ca2+ affinity relative to TFs containing the WT protein. Here, we show that the addition of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) to TFs reconstituted with these mutants in the absence of MgATP2−, the condition conducive to rigor cross-bridge formation, further increased the apparent Ca2+ affinity. Stopped-flow fluorescence techniques were used to determine the kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation (koff) from the cTnC mutants in the presence of TFs and S1. At a high level of complexity (i.e. TF + S1), an increase in the Ca2+ affinity and decrease in koff was achieved for the A8V and D145E mutants when compared with WT. Therefore, it appears that the cTnC Ca2+ off-rate is most likely to be affected rather than the Ca2+ on rate. At all levels of TF complexity, the results obtained with the E134D mutant reproduced those seen with the WT protein. We conclude that strong cross-bridges potentiate the Ca2+-sensitizing effect of HCM-cTnC mutants on the myofilament.

https://openalex.org/W2058117282,"Actin requires the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT), a hexadecameric ATPase essential for cell viability in eukaryotes, to fold to its native state. Following binding of unfolded actin to CCT, the cavity of the chaperone closes and actin is folded and released in an ATP-dependent folding cycle. In yeast, CCT forms a ternary complex with the phosducin-like protein PLP2p to fold actin, and together they can return nascent or chemically denatured actin to its native state in a pure in vitro folding assay. The complexity of the CCT-actin system makes the study of the actin folding mechanism technically challenging. We have established a novel spectroscopic assay through selectively labeling the C terminus of yeast actin with acrylodan and observe significant changes in the acrylodan fluorescence emission spectrum as actin is chemically unfolded and then refolded by the chaperonin. The variation in the polarity of the environment surrounding the fluorescent probe during the unfolding/folding processes has allowed us to monitor actin as it folds on CCT. The rate of actin folding at a range of temperatures and ATP concentrations has been determined for both wild type CCT and a mutant CCT, CCT4anc2, defective in folding actin in vivo. Binding of the non-hydrolysable ATP analog adenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate to the ternary complex leads to 3-fold faster release of actin from CCT following addition of ATP, suggesting a two-step folding process with a conformational change occurring upon closure of the cavity and a subsequent final folding step involving packing of the C terminus to the native-like state."
https://openalex.org/W2044338260,"Excessive proliferation and stabilization of the microtubule (MT) array in cardiac myocytes can accompany pathological cardiac hypertrophy, but the molecular control of these changes remains poorly characterized. In this study, we examined MT stabilization in two independent murine models of heart failure and revealed increases in the levels of post-translationally modified stable MTs, which were closely associated with STAT3 activation. To explore the molecular signaling events contributing to control of the cardiac MT network, we stimulated cardiac myocytes with an α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE), and observed increased tubulin content without changes in detyrosinated (glu-tubulin) stable MTs. In contrast, the hypertrophic interleukin-6 (IL6) family cytokines increased both the glu-tubulin content and glu-MT density. When we examined a role for ERK in regulating cardiac MTs, we showed that the MEK/ERK-inhibitor U0126 increased glu-MT density in either control cardiac myocytes or following exposure to hypertrophic agents. Conversely, expression of an activated MEK1 mutant reduced glu-tubulin levels. Thus, ERK signaling antagonizes stabilization of the cardiac MT array. In contrast, inhibiting either JAK2 with AG490, or STAT3 signaling with Stattic or siRNA knockdown, blocked cytokine-stimulated increases in glu-MT density. Furthermore, the expression of a constitutively active STAT3 mutant triggered increased glu-MT density in the absence of hypertrophic stimulation. Thus, STAT3 activation contributes substantially to cytokine-stimulated glu-MT changes.

MT organization changes between phases of assembly/disassembly with either fast (dynamic) or slow (stable) kinetics. MT stability can be regulated through direct association and regulation by numerous proteins such as MT-associated proteins (MAPs), plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) and tubulin-sequestering negative regulators of MT assembly (e.g. stathmins) (1Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2Cassimeris L. Curr.

Sci. 1998; 23: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In turn, these direct modulators of MT stability are regulated by multisite phosphorylation by various kinases thus linking changes in MT dynamics with extracellular stimuli (2Cassimeris L. Curr.

Sci. 1998; 23: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, once assembled, tubulin polymers are modified by the addition of acetyl groups on Lys-40 (acetyl-tubulin) and the reversible removal of tyrosine from the α-tubulin C terminus (named glu-tubulin for the penultimate glutamate revealed) (4Webster D.R. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 57-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Webster D.R. Gundersen G.G. Bulinski J.C. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Post-translational modification of tubulin occurs as a direct function of the time a tubulin heterodimer spends in the polymerized state and therefore reports on MT age. Although not directly contributing to the stabilization of MTs per se, these modifications are markers of stabilized MTs that turnover slowly. In neurons, protein kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinases and microtubule affinity-regulating kinases have been shown to be key mediators of the MT network (6Chang L. Jones Y. Ellisman M.H.

In addition to well-established roles under physiological conditions, MT reorganization accompanies the development of cardiac disease (8Cooper 4th, G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1003-H1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Increased MT numbers correlated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload (9Tsutsui H. Ishihara K.

Toxicol. 2002; 2: 75-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significant increases in MT density and number, as well as increases in MT stabilization have been reported during heart failure (12Belmadani S. Poüs C. Ventura-Clapier R. Fischmeister R. Méry P.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 237: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A causal link between MT densification/stabilization and cardiac dysfunction was strengthened by observations that MT-targeting drugs that enhance MT disassembly could normalize defects in myocardial contractility in pressure overload hypertrophy (13Koide M.

Importantly, MT changes alone were shown to be sufficient to precipitate a reduction in cardiac function (14Cheng G. Zile M.R. Takahashi M. Baicu C.F. Bonnema D.D. Cabral F. Menick D.R. Cooper 4th, G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 294: H2231-H2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, aberrant MT growth and stabilization can directly contribute to cardiac disease and promote dysfunction in the hypertrophic and failing heart. Despite the important contribution of MTs to cardiac disease, the specific upstream signaling events that impact on MT regulatory proteins are not fully defined. Here we report the actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and a member of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, STAT3, in regulating the cardiac myocyte MT array. The ERK family is activated by a highly conserved signaling cascade and phosphorylates several nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates. ERKs have been implicated in the regulation of hypertrophy (15Bogoyevitch M.A. Sugden P.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, in transgenic mice, constitutive cardiac ERK activation is sufficient to trigger compensated hypertrophy (16Bueno O.F.

Sherwood M.C. Tarnavski O. Zhang L. Dorfman A.L. Shioi T. Izumo S. Circulation. 2004; 109: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Aortic-banded mice were subdivided into 2 groups: (i) compensated hypertrophy (ii) decompensated hypertrophy and heart failure. The delineation of these groups was based on differences in cardiac function as previously described in detail (25McMullen J.R. Sherwood M.C. Tarnavski O. Zhang L. Dorfman A.L. Shioi T. Izumo S. Circulation. 2004; 109: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In brief, the mice with decompensated hypertrophy and heart failure had been exposed to a greater load (aortic pressure gradient) that was associated with a significant reduction in systolic function compared with mice with compensated hypertrophy, as published previously (Ref. 25McMullen J.R. Sherwood M.C. Tarnavski O. Zhang L. Dorfman A.L. Shioi T. Izumo S. Circulation. 2004; 109: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar; functional and morphological data presented in supplemental Table S1). All experiments involving animals were approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committees under direction from the Australian Bureau of Animal Welfare and conform with the United States NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Primary normal cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (26Grounds H.R. Ng D.C. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and then preplated to deplete non-myocyte cells. Cardiac myocytes were then plated on gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Medium 199 (4:1 v/v) containing 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). The serum was removed after 18 h, and cells starved for 24 h prior to experimental treatment. Cardiac myocytes were then plated on collagen-coated dishes or laminin-coated glass coverslips in serum-containing media. The serum was removed after 18 h, and cells starved for 24 h prior to experimental treatment and immunoblot/immunofluorescence analysis. Protein lysates from cultured cardiac myocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) NaF, and 100 μm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After lysis, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Whole heart protein extracts were prepared by lysing heart tissue in solubilizing buffer (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% sulfobetaine 3–10, 40 mm Tris, 65 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm tributyl phosphine) and insoluble material cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Bradford assay and lysates diluted with Laemmli sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as previously described (21Ng D.C. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). MTs in cardiac myocytes were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to α-tubulin and post-translationally modified tubulin. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips overnight in serum-containing medium. Following experimental treatments, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS. Cells were then stained with primary antibodies diluted (1:250) in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and detected with Cy2-/Cy3- conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS). Following mounting, stained cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope and laser unit). Images were compiled and analyzed with Leica Confocal Software v2.61 (Leica, Germany) and Metamorph® analysis software (Molecular Devices). Microtubule densities (pixels/μm2) were determined by defining cell borders using phalloidin-stained actin filaments as a template. Phalloidin-TRITC staining of contractile filaments was also used to exclude non-myocytes, which typically exhibit faint, non-striated linear stress fibers with actin staining (27Ng D.C. Gebski B.L. Grounds M.D. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The defined regions were then transferred to tubulin co-stained images and pixel intensity and cell area (μm2) measured (supplemental Fig. S1). A minimum of 100 cells was measured from 10 randomly selected fields. Microtubule densities (pixels/μm2) representative of three independent experiments (n = 3) were expressed as an average ± S.E. STAT3 Stealth RNAi Duplexes were obtained from Invitrogen. The double stranded oligoribonucleotide sequences targeting STAT3 were target 1: 5′-AAGAGGUUAUGAAACACCAGAGUGG-3′ and 5′-CCACUCUGGUGUUUCAUAACCUCUU-3′, target 2: 5′-UUAGGCAUCUGACAGAUGUUGGAGA-3′ and 5′-UCUCCAACAUCUGUCAGAUGCCUAA-3′, and target 3: 5′-AUAUUGUCUAGCCAGACCCAGAACG-3′, and 5′-CGUUCUGGGUCUGGCUAGACAAUAU-3′. Stealth RNAi negative control Low GC Duplex (Invitrogen) was used as a control. RNAi were transfected into cardiac myocytes using LipofectamineTM 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The AdMEK-EE virus was generously gifted by J. Molkentin (University of Cincinnatti). A constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3-C) mutant, in which the SH2 domain alanine 661 and asparagine 663 were substituted with cysteine residues (28Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange® Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The adenoviral construct expressing constitutively active STAT3-C (pAd-STAT3C) was generated using the AdEasy system following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and used to infect primary cardiac myocytes. STAT3-C was subcloned into the pAdtrack-CMV shuttle vector that expresses GFP from a cis-promoter. This was recombined with pAdEasy-1 in electro-competent BJ5183 cells. AdMEK-EE, AdSTAT3C, and control adenoviruses were generated by transfection of recombined adenoviral constructs into Ad293 cells. Viral particles were expanded, isolated and purified on cesium chloride gradients followed by dialysis into 3% (w/v) sucrose in PBS. Titers of purified virus were then determined by colony formation assays before transduction of cardiac myocytes using a multiplicity of infection of 50:1. Positive viral transduction of cardiac myocytes was estimated to be 99% by the cis-promoter driven expression of GFP from the adenoviral construct. The statistical significance of observed differences in immunoblotting (α-tubulin, glu-tubulin, or ace-tubulin) or immunostaining (glu-tubulin) results was determined by unpaired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We began by evaluating markers of MT stability in a mouse model of pressure overload hypertrophy. We had previously shown that depending on the severity of the pressure overload, mice exhibited either compensated cardiac hypertrophy (maintained systolic function) or had progressed to decompensated hypertrophy and failure with depressed contractile function (30% reduction in systolic function and dilation of ventricular chambers (supplemental Table S1) subsequent to aortic banding (25McMullen J.R. Sherwood M.C. Tarnavski O. Zhang L. Dorfman A.L. Shioi T. Izumo S. Circulation. 2004; 109: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The levels of α-tubulin were increased in pressure overloaded hearts when compared with control group (sham) (Fig. 1A) indicating an expansion of the MT network during pressure overload. We then demonstrated that the levels of acetyl- and glu-tubulin, that mark stable MTs, were also substantially elevated in aortic banded mice during both compensated (PO Comp) and decompensated stages (PO Decomp) (Fig. 1A). Densitometric analysis of acetyl- and glu-tubulin bands, normalized against changes in α-tubulin expression, indicated a significant 3-fold and 2-fold increase, respectively, in pressure overloaded animals compared with controls (Fig. 1, B and C). The levels of post-translationally modified tubulin were not statistically different between the compensated or decompensated hypertrophy groups. These results confirm stabilization of cardiac MTs during pressure overload. To investigate signaling mechanisms that could contribute to MT stabilization, we immunoblotted for phosphorylated STAT3 and ERK as an indicator of JAK/STAT and ERK MAPK pathway activation. In response to pressure overload, cardiac STAT3 phosphorylation was substantially increased in mice with compensated or decompensated hypertrophy (Fig. 1A) and correlated well with the elevated levels of post-translationally modified tubulin. STAT3 protein levels were also elevated in compensated or decompensated hypertrophy groups (Fig. 1A). This latter observation is consistent with a sustained time course of STAT3 activation acting in a positive feedback loop to increase its own transcription (29Ichiba M. Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Kiuchi N. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6132-6138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were normalized against total STAT3, we found a significant increase in mice with pressure overload hypertrophy (Fig. 1D). A single sham operated animal (lane 3) exhibited a modest increase in phosphorylated STAT3, which correlated with a small increase in glu-tubulin levels. The reason for this is unclear as the animals in the sham group were morphologically and functionally indistinguishable and there was no overlap between sham and PO groups (data not shown). ERK was also found to be activated in pressure-overloaded mice (Fig. 1A). However, unlike phosphorylated STAT3, the levels of phosphorylated ERK between individual mice with pressure overload varied widely and did not closely match the increases in acetyl and glu-tubulin (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the contribution of STAT3 without the complication of ERK activation, we next looked at MT stabilization in a double mutation (TnI-203/MHC-403) murine model of cardiomyopathy that recapitulates a rapid progression to heart failure observed in human patients (24Tsoutsman T. Kelly M. Ng D.C. Tan J.E. Tu E. Lam L. Bogoyevitch M.A. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Semsarian C. Circulation. 2008; 117: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A striking feature of this model was an initial robust activation of cardiac STAT3, first observed in 10-day-old mice, prior to the onset of heart failure (24Tsoutsman T. Kelly M. Ng D.C. Tan J.E. Tu E. Lam L. Bogoyevitch M.A. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Semsarian C. Circulation. 2008; 117: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Importantly, ERK activation was not found in this mouse model of heart failure (24Tsoutsman T. Kelly M. Ng D.C. Tan J.E. Tu E. Lam L. Bogoyevitch M.A. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Semsarian C. Circulation. 2008; 117: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We first evaluated the levels of α-tubulin, glu-, and acetyl-tubulin in the TnI-203/MHC-403 mice alongside three control groups: nontransgenic littermates (NTG) and single-mutant mice (TnI-203 or MHC-403 alone) that did not rapidly develop cardiac failure. When hearts from 5-day-old mice were examined, immunoblotting for total α-tubulin, glu-tubulin, and acetyl-tubulin revealed no substantial differences between TnI-203/MHC-403 mice and the control groups (Fig. 2A). In contrast, glu-tubulin and acetyl-tubulin were markedly elevated in the failing hearts from 18 day old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice when compared with age-matched non-failing hearts from the single mutant and NTG control animals (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, in the failing hearts, total levels of α-tubulin levels were not markedly different from the levels in all control groups (Fig. 2, A and B). A more detailed temporal analysis demonstrated glu-tubulin levels were significantly increased in 10, 14, and 18-day-old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice, compared with the NTG control group of the same age (Fig. 2, C and D). This coincided with significant increases in Tyr-705 phosphorylated STAT3 in 10-, 14-, and 18-day-old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice (Fig. 2, E and F). In addition, the levels of α-tubulin and STAT3 expression were not substantially different between NTG and TnI-203/MHC-403 groups at any of the time-points studied (Fig. 2, C and E). A closer kinetic analysis indicated a substantial increase of phosphorylated STAT3 in 10 day old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice (supplemental Fig. S2). The levels of phosphorylated STAT3 increased further in 14- and 18-day-old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice (supplemental Fig. S2). Similarly, an increase in glu-tubulin levels was evident in 10-day-old TnI-203/MHC-403 mice, with considerably elevated glu-tubulin levels observed in 14- and 18-day-old animals (supplemental Fig. S2). In comparison, the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and glu-tubulin were not increased greatly by the age of 18 days in the NTG group (supplemental Fig. S2). These results from two independent models of heart failure show a striking enhancement of markers of the stabilized MT network. In addition, the close correlation of these changes with enhanced STAT3 signaling raises the question of the signaling events and the contribution of STAT3 to the increases in the stable MT subset. In subsequent experiments to address the molecular events that trigger cardiac MT changes, we used primary cardiac myocytes stimulated with pro-hypertrophic agonists. We have previously shown that hypertrophy of these cells is accompanied by an enhanced MT network (27Ng D.C. Gebski B.L. Grounds M.D. Bogoyevitch M.A. Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 2008; 65: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated tubulin changes in cardiac myoyctes following 24 h exposure to the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) or the IL6 family cytokines, LIF or OSM. The increases in the size of hypertrophic cardiac myocytes (μm2) were not substantially different between the agonists investigated (supplemental Fig. S3). We then confirmed by immunoblotting the increase of α-tubulin in cardiac myocytes following 24 h exposure to PE, LIF, or OSM (Fig. 3A). Comparable increases in β-tubulin were also observed (results not shown). To assess the stable MT population, we next examined glu-tubulin and acetyl-tubulin and showed elevated levels following 24-h exposure to LIF or OSM (Fig. 3A). After normalizing for α-tubulin changes, LIF- and OSM-stimulated a significant increase in glu-tubulin levels compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). However, acetyl-tubulin was not significantly different to control myocytes (Fig. 3C). In contrast to cytokine stimulated effects, the levels of post-translationally modified tubulins were not enhanced by PE treatment despite increases in total α-tubulin levels (Fig. 3A). Rather, glu-tubulin and acetyl-tubulin levels adjusted for α-tubulin changes were significantly decreased compared with control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, glu-tubulin levels were not markedly elevated during short-term treatment (0–8 h) with PE, LIF or OSM (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). These results suggest that elevated stable MT markers observed in IL-6 cytokine-treated myocytes may be the result of longer term molecular events that actively enhance MT stabilization in addition to a general increase in α-tubulin expression. Our observations also indicated that the levels of glu- and acetyl-tubulin are not correlated to α-tubulin levels in all cases. Immunofluorescence staining of myocytes confirmed an increase in the glu-MT subset following 24 h treatment with LIF or OSM but not PE (Fig. 3D, upper panels). Co-staining for actin filaments confirmed the reorganization of the sarcomeres, a hallmark of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 3D, lower panels). Thus, increases in stable MTs were only in response to the IL6-family cytokines, further emphasizing stimulus-specific differences in cardiac MT organization. We confirmed the stability of the cardiac MT network directly by exposing control or LIF-treated cardiac myocytes to a low dose of a MT-depolymerizing drug, nocodazole (NZ, 2 μm, 1 h). We showed a substantial number of MTs remained after NZ treatment of LIF-stimulated myocytes when compared with the low MT numbers observable in NZ-treated control myocytes (Fig. 3E). In addition, nocodazole-resistant MTs in LIF-treated myocytes were substantially longer when compared with short fragments in the controls (Fig. 3E). In contrast, a similar analysis in PE-stimulated myocytes treated with NZ revealed short MT fragments which were more abundant but comparable in length with MTs in NZ-treated control cells (supplemental Fig. S5). This indicated that MT proliferation"

Four ELC mutants containing a single cysteine residue at different positions in the C-terminal half of the protein (ELC-127, ELC-142, ELC-160, and ELC-180) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin, and introduced into permeabilized rabbit psoas fibers. Binding to the myosin heavy chain was associated with a large conformational change in the ELC. When the fibers were moved from relaxation to rigor, the fluorescence lifetime increased for all label positions. However, when 1% stretch was applied to the rigor fibers, the lifetime decreased for ELC-127 and ELC-180 but did not change for ELC-142 and ELC-160. The differential change of fluorescence lifetime demonstrates the shift in position of the C-terminal domain of ELC with respect to the heavy chain and reveals specific locations in the lever arm region sensitive to the mechanical strain propagating from the actin-binding site to the lever arm.

The function of striated muscles is brought about by the relative sliding of actin and myosin filaments. Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein, assembled from two heavy chains, each bearing a regulatory and an essential light chain (RLC 3The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chainELCessential light chainFLIMfluorescence lifetime imaging microscopyIDCC7-diethylamino-3-((((2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin5IATRtetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodideTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. and ELC, respectively). The heavy chains consist of a long tail region responsible for the formation of a filament structure and a globular head containing the catalytic domain and the lever arm, which binds the light chains. The interaction of the globular head with actin filament facilitates the release of ATP hydrolysis products from myosin. The accompanying structural changes result in rotation of the lever arm (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

The molecular details of the change in position of the lever arm with respect to the catalytic domain were revealed by crystallographic studies of myosin head in the presence of nucleotide analogues in the ATPase pocket (2Dominguez R.

However, the angular changes were substantially different from those expected by crystallography. This discrepancy could be due to the crystal packing or the use of a truncated form of myosin head, which lacked most of the lever arm. In addition, the fluorescence polarization studies were focused on the distal part of the lever arm, which is remote from the catalytic domain. Therefore, the proximal part of the lever arm, which forms an interface with the catalytic domain, is of particular interest. The fluorescence polarization study of this region (9Borejdo J. Ushakov D.S. Moreland R. Akopova I. Reshetnyak Y. Saraswat L.D. Kamm K. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3796-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed its reorientation when muscle fibers were moved from relaxation to rigor. However, only a single labeling site was used, and the details of this reorientation are still not clear. The aim of this work is to investigate the response of cross-bridges to the chemo-mechanical transitions in muscle fibers by probing the microenvironment of the interface region of the myosin lever arm domain. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a method specifically measuring changes in local environment of a probe while also providing spatial information. Although local environmental changes can be detected by other methods, particularly fluorescence polarization, their interpretation is often complicated by other contributing factors, such as changes in orientation and protein mobility. For this purpose, we utilized the fluorescence lifetime of coumarin covalently bound to the interface. Coumarin is known to be particularly sensitive to the microenvironmental changes, and it was previously used as a phosphate and ADP probe in muscle fibers (10He Z.H. Chillingworth R.K. Brune M.

Dependence of the fluorescence lifetime of coumarin-labeled ATP analogue on the location in the sarcomere was shown (12García D.I. Lanigan P. Webb M. West T.G. Requejo-Isidro J. Auksorius E. Dunsby C. Neil M. French P. Ferenczi M.A. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2091-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The interface region of the lever arm is occupied by the ELC, a calmodulin family protein consisting of two halves, each comprised of two helix-loop-helix motifs (EF-hands). The C-terminal half adopts a semi-open conformation, with the pairs of EF-hands relatively separated from each other when bound to the heavy chain (13Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This half is nearest to the catalytic domain. To investigate it, we prepared a number of mutants of recombinant ELC, each containing a single cysteine residue in a different position. The mutation sites were placed in the loops connecting helices of the C-terminal domain so that the conformational changes caused by the interhelical movements could be detected. The cysteines were covalently bonded with coumarin, and the labeled ELC mutants were exchanged with the native ELC in muscle fibers. We investigated the fluorescence lifetime properties of these fibers in relaxed and rigor conditions and following a short stretch of rigor fibers. The results showed a response of the C terminus of the ELC to the stretch, with the amplitude of response depending on location of the probe. 7-Diethylamino-3-((((2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin (IDCC) and tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide dihydroiodide (5IATR) dyes were obtained from Invitrogen.

First, a cysteine-free sequence was produced in which the Cys-180 was mutated to alanine. Using this sequence, three constructs were obtained by mutating Thr-127, Gly-142, and Glu-160 to cysteines. The ELC was then overexpressed in M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli cells and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen) (9Borejdo J. Ushakov D.S. Moreland R. Akopova I. Reshetnyak Y. Saraswat L.D. Kamm K. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3796-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Troponin C was a gift from Dr. Yin-Biao Sun (King's College, London). Each mutant ELC was labeled with IDCC. The protein was mixed with the fluorophore at 1:3 molar ratio in solution containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.1, and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate. The protein and the unreacted dye were separated on a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the exchange solution without trifluoperazine and stored at −80 °C freeze-dried or in solution. The labeling efficiency was determined by spectrophotometry using the extinction coefficient of coumarin E430 = 50 000 m−1 and calculating the protein concentration as CELC = A280 − A430/R, where R = 4.13 is the experimentally determined ratio of coumarin absorption at 430 and 280 nm. Typically, 60–80% of the ELC was labeled. The reactive cysteine SH1 of myosin in muscle fibers was labeled by incubating the fibers in relaxing solution with 100 μm 5IATR at 15 °C for 20 min. Fluorescence spectra were acquired using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc.). Single permeabilized fibers, prepared as described previously from psoas muscle of adult rabbits (15Thirlwell H. Corrie J.E. Reid G.P. Trentham D.R. Ferenczi M.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Goldman Y.E. Simmons R.M. J. Physiol. 1984; 350: 497-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were suspended via aluminum T-clips at the fiber ends on two hooks in a trough, with one of the fiber ends attached to a force transducer (AE801 Sensor One Technologies) and the other end attached to a micrometer drive (Mitutoyo). The sarcomere size was adjusted to 2.4 μm using a diffraction pattern generated by a 532 nm He-Ne laser shone through the fiber. The exchange solution containing 2 mg/ml labeled ELC was injected into the trough, and the temperature was raised to 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, the temperature was lowered to 15 °C, and the fiber was extensively washed with relaxing solution and further incubated for 30 min at 15 °C in relaxing solution containing 1 mg/ml troponin C. The fibers used in FLIM experiments were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and their protein composition was analyzed on 8% gels to estimate the level of the ELC exchange. The gels were scanned on an Ettan DIGE imager 1.0 (GE Healthcare) using the Cy2 filter set for coumarin fluorescence, stained with Coomassie Blue, and scanned again using the Cy5 filter set to estimate the staining signal. The temperature jump method was used to measure the isometric force. The fibers were suspended via T-clips at 2.4-μm sarcomere length on a home-built rotating stage in a trough containing relaxing solution at 0 °C, with one fiber end attached to the force transducer. The fibers were moved to activating solution at 0 °C, where no force was developed during 2-s observation period. The temperature was raised by a jump to 20 °C to initiate force development. After 3 s, the fibers were moved back to relaxing solution. Following the exchange with coumarin-labeled ELC, the setup was placed under the upright Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Fig. 1) equipped with an SPC-830 time-correlated single photon counting module (Becker & Hickl GmbH). Fluorescence lifetime images were acquired at 21 °C in a time-domain mode using two-photon excitation at 850 nm by a picosecond Mai Tai laser (Spectra-Physics Inc.) pulsing at 80 MHz rate. A Leica HCS APO L63/0.9 U-V-I lens was used to acquire 256 × 256-pixel images at the zoom 4 setting with 64 time bins during 3-min periods. This provided several thousand photon counts per pixel with at least 100 photons in the peak of the fluorescence decays in the A-band regions. No photobleaching was observed during the acquisition period. In the case of stretched fibers, the acquisition was initiated 10–20 s after the application of stretch. Confocal images were acquired on the same microscope as two-photon, except that the image resolution was increased to 512 × 512 pixels. Fluorescence lifetime measurements in solution were done either using the same microscope or in a cuvette system as described previously (17Manning H.B. Kennedy G.T. Owen D.M. Grant D.M. Magee A.I. Neil M.A. Itoh Y. Dunsby C. French P.M. J. Biophotonics. 2008; 1: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in relaxing solution at 21 °C. No effect on the lifetime was detected when relaxing or rigor solutions were used. Fluorescence decay in each pixel of an image was fitted with a single exponential function using the SPCImage software (Becker & Hickl GmbH) to obtain a fluorescence lifetime image. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to extract the fitted lifetime values from the A-band regions. First, a threshold was applied to an intensity image, and a selection mask was created that included all A-bands in the image. The mask was applied to a fluorescence lifetime image, and a profile of lifetime values distribution in the mask with 5-ps bins was generated. The lifetime distributions were fitted with a Gaussian function in SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.) to obtain the mean lifetime and the half-maximal width of the distribution. Several images were acquired in each condition (relaxation, rigor, and stretch in rigor) applied to the fibers. The data in the results section represent the measurements from 5–6 fibers with standard errors for each mutant ELC. A one-tailed paired Student's t test analysis was used to assess the significance of the lifetime differences. To investigate the interface region of the lever arm, we developed a protocol to substitute the native ELC with a fluorescent recombinant ELC in isolated skeletal muscle fibers. Human LC1 isoform of the ELC was used, which is identical to the rabbit LC1, except for two extra amino acid residues in the N-terminal half. The LC1 isoform is prevalent in rabbit psoas muscle; thereby the replacement of the endogenous ELC with the recombinant protein did not drastically alter the fiber isoform composition. To estimate the efficiency of ELC exchange, the fiber protein composition was analyzed using 8% SDS-PAGE. First, from an isolated labeled ELC used for exchange, a ratio of fluorescence and Coomassie Blue staining signals was found (supplemental Fig. 1A). Then from the band corresponding to the ELC in the treated muscle fiber, the proportion of the exchanged ELC was found as the difference between the isolated ELC and the treated fiber staining ratios. Based on these calculations, 66 ± 7% (n = 3) of the native ELC was exchanged with recombinant protein. Because the recombinant ELC was fluorescently labeled to 80%, the degree of ELC labeling in fibers was about 50%. This level of labeling produced a sufficiently high number of photons for FLIM, and as the fluorescence lifetime value is independent of fluorophore concentration, the partial labeling did not affect the measurements. The functional integrity of the fibers following exchange was confirmed by their unimpaired ability to undergo transitions from relaxed to rigor states and by development of 144 ± 51 kilonewtons/m2 (n = 21) force caused by a 1% stretch when in rigor. The fibers were also able to develop and maintain the isometric force in the presence of calcium and ATP, although it was reduced in comparison with untreated fibers (Fig. 2). The fibers carrying ELC-142, ELC-160, and ELC-180 produced 65 ± 13, 55 ± 12, and 71 ± 3% isometric force, whereas the force development after ELC-127 exchange was reduced to 41 ± 5%. Importantly, all fibers were able to relax to the initial level. The ability of fibers to undergo transition from relaxation to rigor and from rigor to relaxation was monitored immediately before and/or after the fluorescence lifetime data acquisition. All fibers used in FLIM experiments were able to switch between relax and rigor, as well as to develop force after activation when these measurements were carried out. Although the ELC binds specifically to the heavy chain in solution, nonspecific binding could occur during exchange in muscle fibers. To check the specificity of exchange, we conducted a fluorescence microscopy study. Confinement of the labeled ELC to the A-band is confirmed by colocalization imaging. In this experiment, the reactive myosin cysteine SH1 was labeled with 5IATR in a muscle fiber following coumarin-ELC exchange. The confocal microscopy analysis showed a complete overlap of the rhodamine and coumarin fluorescence signals (supplemental Fig. 1B), thus confirming that the ELC binds only in the region containing myosin heads. Moreover, when the fibers were stretched to a sarcomere length of 3 μm or more in relaxation condition, all label remained in the A-band. The point mutations introduced in the ELC did not affect the exchange specificity. To obtain a detailed view of the ELC conformation, we prepared by site-directed mutagenesis four mutants of the ELC, each bearing a single cysteine residue: ELC-127, ELC-142, ELC-160, and ELC-180, respectively (Fig. 3). Three of the locations were in the loops connecting helices E, F, G, and H in the C-terminal half of the protein, with the fourth (ELC-127) in the linker between the N- and C-terminal halves. The cysteines were labeled with a thiol-reactive coumarin fluorophore IDCC. The sensitivity of coumarin to location on the protein can be immediately seen from the emission spectra of free coumarin dye and labeled ELC mutants (supplemental Fig. 2). The fluorescence emission peak shifted from 476 nm for the free IDCC to 466 nm for ELC-142, 464 nm for ELC-127 and ELC-160, and 463 nm for ELC-180. Fluorescence lifetime is a suitable parameter to characterize the microenvironment of a fluorophore (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2006: 9-12Google Scholar, 19Dowling K. Dayel M.J. Lever M.J. French P.M. Hares J.D. Dymoke-Bradshaw A.K. Opt. Lett. 1998; 23: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is believed to be modified by interaction with the solvent and by the flexibility and conformation of the fluorophore-bearing region. To assess the differences between coumarin-labeled ELC mutants in greater detail, their fluorescence lifetimes were measured in solution using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The fluorescence decays in each pixel of an image were fitted with a single exponential function, and a Gaussian distribution of fluorescence lifetime was found in the A-bands (Fig. 4). Analysis of the mean fluorescence lifetimes showed that ELC-142 had a shorter lifetime at 1674 ± 1 ps (n = 3), consistent with location of the label in a highly exposed loop between helices E and F (Fig. 3). ELC-127 had a significantly longer fluorescence lifetime at 1831 ± 1 ps (n = 3). The N and C-terminal halves of the ELC are likely to interact in solution, forming a compact globule and thus protecting the linker region, where the Cys-127 is located, from the solvent, which can be related to the longer fluorescence lifetime of the probe attached to this residue. ELC-160, located in a relatively exposed loop between helices F and G, displayed a fluorescence lifetime in between the values of ELC-127 and ELC-142, namely 1777 ± 4 ps (n = 3). The ELC-180, located in a loop between helices G and H, which is likely to be shielded from the solvent, had the longest lifetime at 1936 ± 9 ps (n = 3). Thus, it can be concluded that the fluorescence lifetime of coumarin-labeled ELC is strongly affected by the location of the probe. To study ELC conformation in situ, we applied FLIM to map the microenvironment of the ELC mutants, initially in relaxed muscle fibers. An example fit to a single pixel decay is shown in supplemental Fig. 3. The mean fluorescence lifetimes obtained from the fluorescence lifetime histograms for ELC-127, ELC-142, ELC-160, and ELC-180 (Fig. 5A) were 1643 ± 21 (n = 17), 1442 ± 46 (n = 12), 1728 ± 52 (n = 16), and 1836 ± 19 ps (n = 16), respectively. Comparing the mean lifetimes of the ELC mutants in muscle fibers with the mean lifetimes obtained in solution (Fig. 5B), a change in the microenvironments of the fluorophores is inferred. In both solution and fibers, the ELC-142 exhibited the shortest fluorescence lifetime. In the case of all mutants, there is a 50–230-ps decrease in fluorescence lifetime in fibers when compared with values in solution, which can be attributed to a conformational change in the C-terminal half of the ELC upon binding to the heavy chain. ELC-127, where coumarin is attached in the linker connecting the N- and C-terminal halves of the ELC, and ELC-142 show a strikingly greater change in lifetime (Fig. 5B). These residues located at the opposite ends of the helix E could be more affected as a result of the extended binding of ELC along the heavy chain. When the muscle fibers were moved from relaxing solution to the rigor state, the fluorescence lifetime increased by 78 ± 16 (n = 13), 91 ± 28 (n = 14), 84 ± 22 (n = 14), and 58 ± 13 ps (n = 16) for ELC-127, ELC-142, ELC-160, and ELC-180, respectively (Fig. 6A). This uniform increase suggests a gross conformational shift in the myosin cross-bridge following its attachment to the actin filament and could result both from the change in the microenvironment and from the lower mobility of the probe-bearing region, which was previously shown for rhodamine-labeled ELC (8Knowles A.C. Ferguson R.E. Brandmeier B.D. Sun Y.B. Trentham D.R. Irving M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 3882-3891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Borejdo J. Ushakov D.S. Moreland R. Akopova I. Reshetnyak Y. Saraswat L.D. Kamm K. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3796-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because the transition from relaxation to rigor was done at a full overlap of thick and thin filaments (2.4-μm sarcomere length), a more complex distribution of cross-bridges can be expected if the fiber is stretched to partial overlap before the application of strain. Accordingly, relaxed fibers bearing ELC-180 were stretched to 2.6 μm and then moved to rigor. The fluorescence lifetime profile of sarcomeres was measured. The half-sarcomere profiles (Fig. 6B) show that although in relaxed fibers the profile is uniform through the A-band, in rigor two populations can be distinguished. The observation of two populations can be explained by the presence of unattached cross-bridges at the center of the A-band, in the non-overlap H-zone. To test the relation between the actin-binding site and the lever arm of cross-bridges, rigor fibers were stretched by 1% of the fiber length. This length change is comparable with the movement of each myosin head during contraction achieved by tilting of the lever arm while remaining attached to actin. As shown in Fig. 7A, the length changes were followed by a left-hand shift in the fluorescence lifetime histogram of the ELC-180. When a series of stretches and releases was applied to fibers with ELC-180, the fluorescence lifetime followed the mechanical movements (Fig. 7B). It is notable, however, that the amplitude of stretch response decreased after several stretch-release cycles. Because the fluorescence lifetime value in the released state does not change significantly after each cycle, these results suggest that stretch releases return the fiber to the state prior to stretch and that the process is reversible (Fig. 7B). However, the rigor fibers tend to pull out of the T-clips, so the amplitude of the effective stretch gradually decreases after each cycle, resulting in loss of fluorescence lifetime difference. The detailed analysis of the ELC mutants (Fig. 7C) showed that the short stretch applied to rigor fibers induced a decrease in fluorescence lifetime by about 32 ± 13 ps (n = 18) for ELC-127 and 37 ± 11 ps (n = 19) for ELC-180. No significant change was observed for ELC-142 (4 ± 2 ps, n = 12) and ELC-160 (17 ± 8 ps, n = 19). These data indicate a partial reversal of the lifetime in comparison with the change induced by the relaxation to rigor transition. Moreover, a lack of change in cases of ELC-142 and ELC-160 lifetimes suggests a variable response in different parts of the protein. Another parameter that could be affected by the perturbations of muscle fibers is the width of the lifetime distribution. However, as evident from Fig. 7D, there is no significant change in the width between ELC mutants in relaxation, rigor, and after stretch, suggesting that the lifetime changes in response to chemical or mechanical perturbation affect the whole light chain population. Although fluorescence lifetime profiles shift uniformly between different experimental conditions, a mean fluorescence lifetime is likely to represent a set of subpopulations of myosin conformations and the determined mean lifetime reports about a dominant state. Within each image pixel, it is likely that the fluorophores will exist in a range of different populations, where each population has a slightly different local environment. This will result in a complex multi-exponential fluorescence decay. However, the relatively low number of photons acquired in each image pixel means that it is not feasible to carry out multi-exponential decay analysis on the data presented here. However, in the future, a more sophisticated global-fitting FLIM analysis could allow the distribution and relative concentration of multiple fluorophore populations to be studied in more detail. The ELC binds to a specific IQ sequence of the myosin heavy chain, as demonstrated by crystallographic studies of myosin light chain-binding region (13Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ability of the ELC to dissociate and rebind to the myosin heavy chain in vitro is well known (20Wagner P.D. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 455-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We used this property to exchange the native ELC with a recombinant fluorescently labeled protein. Characterization of the protocol by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence microscopy confirmed the high efficiency and specificity of the exchange, whereas"
https://openalex.org/W1986972337,"The PML protein is best known for its role as a tumor suppressor for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Both PML and the key Wnt signaling regulator AXIN regulate p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. However, how the two major tumor suppressors coordinate with each other is unknown, and the molecular components orchestrating the PML-induced apoptosis remain enigmatic. Here we show that AXIN interacts with PML in vivo, and further that AXIN, PML and p53 form a ternary complex. Exposure to genotoxic signals including UV and doxorubicin induces AXIN to enter into the nucleus where it colocalizes with PML in the nuclear bodies. Domain-mapping experiments revealed that the C-terminal region (aa 597-832) of AXIN is responsible for its interaction with PML. AXIN fails to activate p53 in PML(-/-) cells, and conversely, PML is unable to activate p53 in AXIN-null SNU475 cells. Consistently, knockdown with respective siRNAs revealed that AXIN and PML depend on each other to elevate p53-Ser-46 phosphorylation and to induce apoptosis after treatment with genotoxins. Moreover, we found that dominant-negative mutants of PML blocked AXIN-induced p53 activation, and that AXIN promotes PML sumoylation, a modification necessary for PML functions. Our finding has thus provided a new avenue for understanding the mechanism by which PML activates p53 and exerts its role as a tumor suppressor."

Dendritic spines are the post-synaptic component of most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and exhibit a large degree of structural plasticity (1Alvarez V.A. Sabatini B.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton is highly enriched within spines, acting both as a structural support and driver of morphological change (2Cingolani L.A. Goda Y. Nat. Rev.

DAG is a lipid second messenger produced at cell membranes from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by members of the phospholipase C (PLC) family in response to a wide variety of stimuli.

It is becoming clear that the SH2 domain is central to the regulation of α2- and β2-chimaerin activity, as under unstimulated conditions it folds over and occludes the C1 and GAP domains, auto-inhibiting the whole molecule (17Sosa M.S.

Because accurate control of Rac activation is essential for maintaining normal neuronal structure, we hypothesized that other mechanisms would also exist to finely regulate α1-chimaerin within these cells. We show here that the abundance of α1-chimaerin in neurons is actively controlled by proteasomal degradation and selective stabilization following DAG signaling, suggesting a novel means by which α1-chimaerin activity may be regulated. Unless otherwise noted, all general reagents were obtained from Sigma; cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen, and drugs were from Merck.

Broder A. Mason C.A. Scheiffele P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This antibody produces a background band when used for Western blotting; for clarity this is not shown in the figures. Other antibodies were from commercial sources as follows: rat monoclonal anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Applied Science); mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin AC-15 (Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin P4D1-A11 (Millipore); mouse monoclonal anti-HA 16B12 (Covance); rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Invitrogen); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP 3E6 (Invitrogen), and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (Ser-152/156) (Cell Signaling Technology). MG132 and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were dissolved in DMSO and used at 10 μm; cycloheximide was dissolved in ethanol and used at 200 μg/ml; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was dissolved in DMSO and used at 2 μm; and Ro 31-8220 was dissolved in DMSO and used at 2 μm. Solvent-only controls were used wherever appropriate, and the total DMSO concentration in culture medium never exceeded 0.2%. 293 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were generated using a protocol based on previously described techniques (20Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Hippocampal tissue from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (Charles River) at day 18 of gestation was collected in Hanks' buffered saline solution (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) and then digested in 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C followed by gentle trituration using a fire-polished glass pipette. This produced a single cell suspension that was diluted into warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and an additional 0.8% glucose and then plated at a density of 1 × 105 viable cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) coated with 250 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (30–70 kDa, Sigma). The cultures were incubated for 4 h to allow cell attachment, and then the medium was changed to Neurobasal supplemented with 2% B27 and 1% GlutaMAX. Unused spaces within the plates were filled with sterile water to minimize evaporation, and 50% of the medium was changed every 7 days to promote long term cell survival. All neuronal cultures were grown for 18–22 days in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with a humidified 7% CO2/air atmosphere before being used in experiments. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and an equal mass of DNA was used in each transfection condition. EGFP was expressed from pEGFPN1 (Clontech). Plasmids encoding Rac1 wild type, Q61L, and T17N, all tagged at their N-terminal with EGFP, were a gift from M. R. Philips (New York University School of Medicine), and their construction has been described before (21Michaelson D. Abidi W. Guardavaccaro D. Zhou M. Ahearn I. Pagano M. Philips M.R. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). HA3-tagged constructs were made using the pCAGGS/ES backbone (23Storm E.E. Rubenstein J.L. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1757-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar), which contains a chicken β-actin promoter to drive transcription and an expanded multiple cloning site. Annealed oligonucleotides encoding a triple repeat of the HA antigen (YPYDVPDYA) followed by a stop codon were inserted between the KpnI and SacI sites at the 3′ end of the pCAGGS/ES multiple cloning site to create pCHA3. Full-length (FL) and N-terminally truncated (ΔN58) α1-chimaerin were isolated as PCR products amplified from IMAGE Clone ID 7315609 (25Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), which contains full-length Rattus norvegicus α1-chimaerin. The primers introduced a Kozak consensus sequence and also NotI- and XhoI-cloning sites. Products were inserted between these sites in pCHA3 to create C-terminal fusions with HA3. Point mutations P91A and C114A were made using a QuikChange Lightning kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions, with the original IMAGE clone as a template. The resulting point mutants were propagated and sequenced, and clones carrying the appropriate mutations were used as templates for subcloning into pCHA3 as above. The N-terminal region (N58) of α1-chimaerin was isolated by PCR from the original IMAGE clone. The primers introduced a Kozak consensus sequence, and BamHI and HindIII cloning sites, and the product was inserted into pEGFPN1 using these sites to create a C-terminal fusion with EGFP. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm their identity. Full details of inserted oligonucleotides and primers used to create these plasmids are available upon request. Cells were lysed on ice in chilled RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with MiniComplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and also 1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4 if protein phosphorylation was being examined. Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and for examination of total protein, the whole cell lysates were sonicated using a Soniprep 150 (MSE) to reduce sample viscosity. Samples were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 10 min in reducing LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), separated by electrophoresis using a BisTris-based SDS-PAGE system (26Graham D.R. Garnham C.P. Fu Q. Robbins J. Van Eyk J.E. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and then transferred to Hybond P PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Proteins were detected by Western blotting, and antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus substrate and Hyperfilm ECL (both from GE Healthcare). Films were scanned on a flatbed scanner with image gamma set to 1.0 (linear response), and bands were quantified using the Gel Analyzer module of ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). 293 cells were transfected with pCHA3-α1-chimaerin and treated the following day with 10 μm MG132 for 2 h. Cells were lysed on ice in chilled RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit deubiquitination. After centrifugation of the lysate to remove insoluble material, 50 μg of protein was diluted with lysis buffer (containing inhibitors as above) to 1 ml and pre-cleared with nProtein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by incubation with 0.5 μg of rat monoclonal anti-HA for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by antibody capture with nProtein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. The beads were thoroughly washed with cold RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted and denatured by heating in reducing LDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Hippocampal neurons were grown on nitric acid-washed coverslips for 17–21 days, transfected as described in the text, and fixed 1–2 days later with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 1 h, incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in 2% donkey serum/PBST, and then thoroughly washed in PBST. Primary antibody binding was detected by incubation for 30 min with Alexa-488- or Alexa-594-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted in 2% donkey serum/PBST. Coverslips were then washed again in PBST and mounted on slides with FluorSave (Calbiochem). Images were acquired on a Leica DM6000 B wide field fluorescence microscope equipped with a Leica DFC350FX camera, using a 63× 1.40–0.60 NA (set at 1.0 NA) plan apochromatic oil immersion objective. Image acquisition settings were kept constant between imaging sessions to allow direct comparison of data. At least 20 images were taken of stained neurons from two coverslips per condition for each experimental repeat, and data from three repeats were combined for presentation and analysis. ImageJ was used to quantify the images by manually tracing the outline of each cell body and then using the program to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity for the appropriate channel within the traced area. Data are presented as mean values ± S.E., unless otherwise stated. Selected differences between conditions were compared using two-tailed unpaired t tests. Protein half-lives were calculated by nonlinear regression with a one-component exponential decay model in Prism (GraphPad Software), using span = 1, K > 0, and plateau = 0 as constraints. Cells can actively regulate protein expression levels by targeted degradation. To explore whether α1-chimaerin might be regulated by this type of mechanism, we transfected 293 cells with α1-chimaerin tagged at its C terminus with an HA3 tag (α1-chimaerin-HA3), and we measured the half-life of the protein by blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) to reveal the rate of degradation. The amount of α1-chimaerin-HA3 remaining at several time points was assessed by Western blotting, and we found that α1-chimaerin-HA3 was rapidly lost, with a half-life of 36 min (95% CI, 33–41 min) (Fig. 1A). The proteasome is a major site of cytosolic protein degradation in healthy cells. We tested whether it mediates α1-chimaerin degradation by transfecting 293 cells with α1-chimaerin-HA3 and inhibiting proteasome activity using MG132 or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone. Both drugs caused an accumulation of α1-chimaerin-HA3 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the proteasome is involved in its degradation. However, an alternative possibility is that the proteasome degrades an intermediate stabilizing factor that prevents α1-chimaerin from being broken down by a nonproteasomal route. We therefore examined whether α1-chimaerin could become polyubiquitinated, a common modification of proteasome substrates. 293 cells were transfected with α1-chimaerin-HA3, and proteasomal degradation was inhibited with MG132 to promote accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. α1-Chimaerin-HA3 was immunoprecipitated from the cellular lysate and analyzed by Western blotting. We found that polyubiquitinated proteins were present at high molecular weights in the precipitated material from transfected cells and that this signal increased with MG132 treatment (Fig. 1C). This suggests that α1-chimaerin can be polyubiquitinated and targeted directly for degradation by the proteasome. To investigate whether endogenous α1-chimaerin undergoes the same process, we used cultured mature hippocampal neurons, as the protein is expressed in these cells in vivo. The half-life of α1-chimaerin was again measured by blocking protein synthesis with CHX to reveal the rate of degradation by Western blotting. We observed that α1-chimaerin was rapidly lost, with a half-life of 19 min (95% CI, 16–25 min), suggesting that rapid degradation is a common feature of both overexpressed and endogenous α1-chimaerin (Fig. 2A). To test whether the proteasome is also responsible for α1-chimaerin degradation in neurons, we inhibited proteasome activity with MG132. In treated cultures, α1-chimaerin was stabilized against degradation, with its half-life increasing to 214 min (95% CI, 137–492 min) (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, inhibition of proteasomal degradation in the absence of CHX caused an accumulation of endogenous α1-chimaerin in neurons (Fig. 2B). The α-chimaerins differ at their N termini, with α1-chimaerin containing a short and apparently unstructured N-terminal region (NTR), whereas α2-chimaerin contains a functional SH2 domain. To investigate whether the unique α1-chimaerin sequence regulates its degradation, we constructed a truncated mutant lacking the α1-chimaerin-specific NTR (ΔN58), tagged at its C terminus with an HA3 tag to avoid interfering with any functional sequences at the N terminus. Neurons were co-transfected with either the FL or ΔN58 α1-chimaerin-HA3 and a second plasmid expressing EGFP so that transfected cells could later be identified using an unbiased marker. The relative stabilities of FL and ΔN58 α1-chimaerin were measured by examining abundance of the HA3 tag by quantitative immunofluorescence in transfected neurons across several time points after blocking protein synthesis with CHX. As expected, FL α1-chimaerin was rapidly lost, with a half-life of 33 min (95% CI, 26–44 min), whereas the truncated mutant was more stable with a half-life of 117 min (95% CI, 90–168 min), representing a 3.5-fold increase (Fig. 3A). This finding suggests that the unique α1-chimaerin NTR contributes to the rapid degradation of the protein, although other regions are also likely to be involved, because the truncated mutant still underwent a slow degradation when compared with α1-chimaerin in MG132 treated neurons (Fig. 2A). We then tested whether the NTR is sufficient to direct the proteasomal degradation of a heterologous protein by using EGFP modified to carry the α1-chimaerin NTR at its N terminus (N58-EGFP). We expressed both EGFP and N58-EGFP in 293 cells and assessed the half-life of each protein by blocking protein synthesis with CHX. Western blotting showed that unmodified EGFP appeared to be extremely stable with a half-life of 1.5 days, whereas the complete N58-EGFP protein was rapidly degraded, with a half-life of 77 min (95% CI, 69–86 min) (Fig. 3B). The N58-EGFP appeared to be expressed in three forms with different molecular weights, most likely due to alternative translation from start sites downstream of the correct initiation codon. By using an antibody that recognizes first 14 residues of α1-chimaerin, we confirmed that the higher molecular weight band represented the complete fusion protein. Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly blocked the degradation of the full-length fusion protein N58-EGFP (Fig. 3C), suggesting the α1-chimaerin NTR contains a sequence that specifically targets the protein for proteasomal degradation. The targeted nature of α1-chimaerin degradation suggested it might be a regulated process, forming a mechanism for actively controlling abundance of the protein. Because all chimaerin isoforms contain a DAG-binding C1 domain, we tested whether application of the artificial C1 domain ligand PMA could influence the degradation rate of α1-chimaerin. The protein half-life was tested as above, by blocking protein synthesis and measuring protein loss by Western blotting. We found that treatment of cultured neurons with PMA slowed the loss of α1-chimaerin in the presence of CHX, with a significant increase in half-life from 23 min (95% CI, 21–25 min) to 168 min (95% CI, 108–382 min) (Fig. 4A). This result shows a DAG-signaling mimetic causes α1-chimaerin to be stabilized against proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this finding, we observed that treatment of neurons for 2 h with PMA alone caused a robust and significant accumulation of the protein, whereas the inactive phorbol ester isomer 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate failed to produce any change (Fig. 4B). PMA is not only bound by α1-chimaerin but also by many other proteins that contain C1 domains, including members of the PKC family. This raises the possibility that PMA could be acting via PKC. We therefore assessed the effect of PKC inhibition on α1-chimaerin stabilization by PMA, using the pan-PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220. This inhibitor caused no change in α1-chimaerin accumulation following PMA exposure, but it blocked phosphorylation of the known PKC target myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (27Arbuzova A. Schmitz A.A. Vergères G. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), confirming its effectiveness (Fig. 4C). This shows that the stabilizing effect of PMA does not require PKC activity. To investigate whether PMA was instead acting directly on α1-chimaerin, we used versions carrying different point mutations within the C1 domain that are known to cause loss of phorbol ester binding. We have previously observed that α1-chimaerin bearing a C114A mutation fails to translocate in neurons following PMA application (6Buttery P. Beg A.A. Chih B. Broder A. Mason C.A. Scheiffele P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and mutations of this residue have also been shown to prevent phorbol ester binding in biochemical assays (28Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, this mutation causes loss of binding by disrupting Zn2+ chelation within the C1 domain and is therefore likely to prevent correct folding of the tertiary structure of the domain; this may trigger the entire protein to be constitutively degraded by mechanisms that remove damaged and misfolded proteins. We therefore also created a version containing a P91A mutation, which strongly reduces the affinity of the C1 domain for phorbol esters (28Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and prevents translocation in response to PMA, while avoiding disruption to the overall domain structure (18Colón-González F. Leskow F.C. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35247-35257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ability of PMA to stabilize these C1 domain point mutants was tested in neurons by co-transfecting them as HA3-tagged constructs in combination with EGFP as a transfection marker. After stimulation with PMA, the cells were analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence for the HA epitope. The wild type protein accumulated as expected, whereas the P91A and C114A point mutants displayed significantly less accumulation following PMA stimulation (Fig. 5). This effect shows that stabilization of α1-chimaerin by PMA requires direct binding to the C1 domain. Moreover, lack of stabilization was more pronounced in the C114A mutant compared with the P91A mutant, consistent with data showing that the loss of phorbol ester affinity is greater for C114A than P91A (28Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because both mutants were expressed from a plasmid backbone identical to that of the wild type, the differences were most likely caused by impaired PMA-mediated stabilization. As PMA mimics DAG signaling, we next asked whether α1-chimaerin could be stabilized by endogenous DAG. We used Rac1 to generate a DAG signal, because Rac1 activation can trigger a downstream increase in PLC-β2 and PLC-γ2 activity (29Harden T.K. Hicks S.N. Sondek J. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S243-S248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test whether activated Rac1 has a stabilizing effect on α1-chimaerin, we transfected neurons with α1-chimaerin-HA3 in combination with EGFP-tagged Rac1 wild type or Rac1 containing T17N (dominant negative) or Q61L (constitutively active) mutations. Analysis of transfected cells as described above showed that co-expression of constitutively active Rac1 caused a 2.2-fold accumulation of tagged α1-chimaerin in comparison with EGFP alone, suggesting that activation of Rac1 could indeed stabilize α1-chimaerin (Fig. 6A). Importantly, the effect appeared to be specific to the activated form of Rac1, with neither wild type nor dominant negative Rac1 showing a significant change, matching the known activation dependence of Rac-PLC coupling. Because our antibodies were not specific enough to pick up the endogenous protein by immunofluorescence, we were unable to determine whether the same effect occurred with endogenously expressed α1-chimaerin. To determine whether the stabilizing effect of active Rac1 was mediated by increased activity in the DAG signaling pathway, we used the PLC inhibitor U73122. In neuro"

Hence, 2B7 is likely the relevant UGT that detoxifies 4-OHE2 and 4-OHE1 in estrogen-responsive tissues and not 1A10 isozyme, which converts E1, E2, and their metabolites at robust rates (8Basu N.K.

Owens I.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Despite our confirmation that 2B7 requires Src-supported phosphorylation in COS-1 cells, unexpectedly we demonstrate that phosphorylation of 2B7 in Src-free (SYF−/−) cells enhanced metabolism of 4-OHE1 10-fold over that in Src-containing COS-1 cells. Moreover, barely detectable E2 metabolism in COS-1 cells was increased 16-fold in SYF−/− cells. Although Src phosphorylation of 2B7 expressed in COS-1 cells is required, its overall rate of 4-OHE1 glucuronidation is greatly inferior to that in SYF−/− cells, with barely detectable turnover of E2. This finding indicates that UGT2B7 substrate selection is not fixed but is differentially controlled by TKs phosphorylation similar to our observations that differential PKCϵ phosphorylation of sites in UGT1A7 controlled its substrate selections (22Basu N.K. Kovarova M. Garza A. Kubota S. Saha T. Mitra P.S. Banerjee R. Rivera J. Owens I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6285-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). COS-1, SYF−/− (Src, Yes, and Fyn), and SYF+/− cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA); serum was from Intergen Company (Purchase, NY). BCA protein assay kit was from Pierce.

[33P]Orthophosphate and UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide kit, UGTs acceptor substrates, and anti-β-actin were from Sigma. COS-1 and mouse SYF fibroblast cells were grown in DMEM with 4 and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Antibodies against 2B7 were as follows: anti-UGT-1168 (25Mackenzie P.I. Hjelmeland L.M.

Anti-Fgr was from Cell Signaling Technology. The reagents used in cell culture were solubilized in fresh Me2SO to allow 0.5% final concentration. The viability of cells treated with curcumin was monitored with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Because 2B7 contains three PKC and two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, each site was changed independently and in various combinations as already described (24Mitra P.S. Basu N.K. Owens I.S.

Reactions contained the common donor substrate UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid (1.40 mm, 1.4 μCi/μmol), 200 μm unlabeled acceptor substrate, 4-OHE1 or E2 with 150 μg of cellular homogenate in 40 mm phosphate (pH 6.4) or triethanolamine (pH 7.6) buffer as previously described (2Basu N.K.

Homogenates were treated with 0.5 mg of CHAPS/mg of protein before addition to a reaction, which incubated at 25 °C for 16 h or at 37 °C for 2 h. Following standardization of the exposure process, radioactivity contained in [14C]glucuronides resolved in TLC plates was stored in phosphor-based film over 1–2 h in preparation for transferring the same to the PerkinElmer Cyclone Storage Phosphor Imager for quantitation. Phosphorylated Tyr-438 peptide (CKRVINDPSY(P03)KENV) derived from 2B7 was used to generate rabbit antibody (SynPeP), which was preabsorbed against nonphosphorylated peptide and then positively purified over phosphorylated peptide-containing resin. Anti-UGT-1168 was generated against highly purified mouse Ugt2b5 as described (25Mackenzie P.I. Hjelmeland L.M. Owens I.S. Arch. Biochem.

Anti-Tyr(P)-438–2B7, anti-UGT-1168, anti-v-Src, and anti-β-actin were used as needed with different blots. Sixty hours after transfection with UGT2B7 or its mutants, the cells were processed and treated with [33P]orthophosphate to establish incorporation of immunoprecipitable label into specific protein as previously demonstrated (22Basu N.K.

The resolved gel was exposed to film for autoradiography, and parallel nonradiolabeled samples were Western blotted with anti-Tyr(P)-438 and anti-UGT-1168. Thirty-four hours after 2B7 transfection, SYF−/− and COS-1 cells were subjected to conditioning in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (8Basu N.K.

For analysis of in cellulo 17β[14C]E2 glucuronide formed during exposure to 17β[14C]E2, 500 μl of medium were utilized in triplicate and diluted 1:2 with cold ethanol before centrifugation to remove protein. Recovered supernatant was spun dry and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. One-half of each sample was treated with buffer or buffer containing 50 units of β-glucuronidase in 50 μm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 4 h at 37°C.

To assess DNA damage in COS-1 cells following exposure to 4-OHE1 versus protection by 2B7 transfection, we measured damaged DNA by the comet assay (26Olive P.L. Banáth J.P. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). 4-OHE1-damaged DNAs are presented as short strands that migrate rapidly in an electrophoretic field and ultimately resemble a comet tail after staining. A visual representation of 4-OHE1-damaged DNA analyzed by the comet assay is shown in the appropriate figure below. To evaluate DNA damage accurately by the comet assay in this study, control vector- or 2B7-transfected COS-1 cells were grown for 48 h before replacing the medium with 4% charcoal-stripped FCS for 12 h. Finally, the medium was replaced with 4% charcoal-stripped FCS containing DMEM with 100 μm 4-OHE1 for 6 h. Cells washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS were placed on ice and harvested with the same ice-cold buffer by scraping with a rubber policeman. Harvested cells were subjected to the comet assay using a kit (Trevigen) with modification as described (26Olive P.L. Banáth J.P. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2006791546,"SRPK2 belongs to a family of serine/arginine (SR) protein-specific kinases (SRPKs), which phosphorylate SR domain-containing proteins in the nuclear speckles and mediate the pre-mRNA splicing. Previous studies have shown that SRPK2 plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, how SRPK2 is regulated during the apoptosis is unclear. Here, we show that SRPK2 is cleaved by caspases at Asp-139 and -403 residues. Its N terminus cleaved product translocates into the nucleus and promotes VP16-induced apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 prevents its apoptotic cleavage by caspases. 14-3-3β, the binding partner of Akt-phosphorylated SRPK2, further protects it from degradation. Hence, our results suggest that the N-terminal domain of SRPK2 cleaved by caspases translocates into the nucleus, where it promotes chromatin condensation and apoptotic cell death. SRPK2 belongs to a family of serine/arginine (SR) protein-specific kinases (SRPKs), which phosphorylate SR domain-containing proteins in the nuclear speckles and mediate the pre-mRNA splicing. Previous studies have shown that SRPK2 plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, how SRPK2 is regulated during the apoptosis is unclear. Here, we show that SRPK2 is cleaved by caspases at Asp-139 and -403 residues. Its N terminus cleaved product translocates into the nucleus and promotes VP16-induced apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 prevents its apoptotic cleavage by caspases. 14-3-3β, the binding partner of Akt-phosphorylated SRPK2, further protects it from degradation. Hence, our results suggest that the N-terminal domain of SRPK2 cleaved by caspases translocates into the nucleus, where it promotes chromatin condensation and apoptotic cell death. Serine/arginine (SR) 2The abbreviations used are: SRserine/arginineSRPKSR protein-specific kinaseKDkinase-dead. proteins are a family of RNA-binding proteins that contain a marker SR domain enriched with serine/arginine repeats. Several prototypical SR proteins are essential splicing factors, but the majority of SR domain-containing factors are implicated in altering splice site selection in vitro or in transfected cells. SR proteins and the related proteins are generally believed to modulate splice site selection via RNA recognition motif (RRM)-mediated binding to exonic splicing enhancers and SR domain-mediated protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions during spliceosome assembly (1Lin S. Fu X.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 623: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). RNA-binding SR proteins play critical roles in multiple steps in gene expression, from transcriptional elongation, mRNA splicing, RNA export to translation. The integration of these activities by single SR proteins may constitute the requirement of SR proteins for cell viability and proliferation. Recent findings also suggest some unexpected roles of SR proteins in organizing gene networks in the nucleus, maintaining genome stability, and facilitating cell-cycle progression (2Zhong X.Y. Wang P. Han J. Rosenfeld M.G. Fu X.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Presumably, all SR domain-containing proteins are post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, and reversible phosphorylation has been shown to play an important role in splicing. serine/arginine SR protein-specific kinase kinase-dead. Two families of kinases, SR protein-specific kinase (SRPK), and Clk/Sty, have been identified to phosphorylate SR domain-containing splicing factors. SRPKs, a family of cell cycle-regulated protein kinases, phosphorylate SR domain-containing proteins in the nuclear speckles and mediate the pre-mRNA splicing. SRPK1 and SRPK2 are highly specific kinases for the SR family of splicing factors. SRPK1 is predominantly expressed in pancreas, whereas SRPK2 is highly expressed in brain, although both are coexpressed in other human tissues and in many experimental cell lines (3Wang H.Y. Arden K.C. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Viars C.S. Lin W. Boyer A.D. Fu X.D. Genomics. 1999; 57: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The SRPK family of kinases, containing bipartite kinase domains separated by a unique spacer, is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, which is critical for nuclear import of SR proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Removal of the spacer in SRPK1 has little effect on the kinase activity, but triggers the nuclear translocation of kinases and consequently induces aggregation of splicing factors in the nucleus (4Ding J.H.

Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) identify and clone human SRPK1 in the pursuit of an activity that mediates splicing factor redistribution in the cell cycle. SRPK2 that is discovered based on its sequence similarity to SRPK1. A series of biochemical experiments demonstrate that SRPK1 and -2 are very similar with respect to their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. Both kinases promote specific protein-protein interactions between SR domain-containing splicing factors and their overexpression induced the redistribution of splicing factors from the nuclear speckles to the nucleoplasm, indicating that both kinases may be involved in the regulation of spliceosome assembly in vivo (6Wang H.Y.

In addition to phosphorylating SR proteins and regulating pre-mRNA splicing, SRPKs also play an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. For instance, SRPK1 overexpression is associated with tumorigenic imbalance in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in breast, colonic, and pancreatic carcinomas (7Hayes G.M. Carrigan P.E. Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Kamachi et al., report that SRPK1 is associated with the U1-snRNP autoantigen complex in healthy and apoptotic cells. SRPK1 is activated early during apoptosis, followed by caspase-mediated proteolytic inactivation at later time points. SRPKs are cleaved in Jurkat cells after multiple apoptotic stimuli, and the cleavage can be inhibited by overexpression of bcl-2 and bcl-x(L), and by exposure to soluble peptide caspase inhibitors. Incubation of recombinant caspases with in vitro-translated SRPKs demonstrates that they are in vitro substrates for caspases-8 and -9 (8Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that SRPK2 triggers cell cycle progression in post-mitotic neurons and induces apoptosis through up-regulation of nuclear cyclin D1 (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M.

Ablation of SRPK2 abrogates cyclin A1 expression in leukemia cells and arrest cells at G1 phase. Knocking down of SRPK2 induces caspase-3 activation in cortical neurons (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H.

SRPK2 overexpression increases leukemia cell proliferation and elicits primary cortical neuronal cell death (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol.

Too much or too little may tilt the balance, leading to programmed cell death. The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding molecules that control the functions of a wide array of cellular proteins and promote cell survival. 14-3-3 binds the client proteins through an amphipathic binding cleft that preferentially recognizes the phosphorylated motifs: RSXpSXP or RXXXpSXP (11Yaffe M.B.

Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), which share a common region in the consensus Akt phosphorylation elements preserved in numerous Akt substrates. Our previous study has shown that Akt phosphorylates SRPK2 on Thr-492 and promotes its nuclear translocation leading to cyclin D1 up-regulation, cell cycle re-entry and neuronal apoptosis. However, overexpression of 14-3-3β prevents this event and promotes neuronal survival (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Caspases (cysteine proteases with aspartate specificity) are a family of proteases specifically recognizes an Asp residue at the substrate P1 site (12Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes. Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Based on their substrate preferences, three caspases subgroups were identified. The first subgroup (caspases-1, -4, and -5) prefers bulky hydrophobic residues in the P4 site and has the optimal substrate cleavage sequence WEXD. The second subgroup (caspases-2, -3, -7, and CED-3) favors an Asp in P4 and preferentially cleaves targets C-terminal to a DEXD motif. The third subgroup (caspases-6, -8, and -9) are less discriminating in their P4 preferences; their optimal substrate cleavage sequence is (L/V)EXD (12Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes. Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that SRPK2 is cleaved in vitro by recombinant caspase-3. Asp-139 and Asp-403 residues are two major cutting sites. Apoptotically cleaved SRPK2 promotes VP16-induced apoptosis. Caspase cleavage of SRPK2 releases its N-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus and further promotes apoptotic cell death. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mg/ml glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Anti-Myc, anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, and anti-p473AKT antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-tubulin antibody, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and Etoposide (VP16) were from Sigma. Anti-acinus and anti-SRPK2 antibodies were from BD Bioscience. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was supplied by Pharmacia Biotech. The purified active caspase-3 and Akt proteins were purchased from Strategene. Full-length, truncated, and site-mutated SRPK2 were inserted into pEGFP-C2 between BglII and SalI cutting sites, or into pEGX-4T-2 between SalI and NotI cutting sites. 14-3-3β-wt and K50E were inserted into pEGFP-C2 between BglII and EcoR I cutting sites. The site mutations were constructed using overlap elongation PCR. The procedures were performed as described previously (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellets of 293 cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mm PMSF, supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were broken by passing 15 times through a G22 needle. After centrifugation 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C., the supernatants were further centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resulting supernatants were used for in vitro apoptotic assay. Cytochrome c and dATP were added into S-100 extract to initiate caspase cascade. SRPK2 was subcloned into TNT vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and in vitro transcripted and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The reaction components T7 Quick Master Mix (16 ml), [35S]methionine (1 μl), PCR enhancer (1 μl), and plasmid DNA template (1 μg) were assembled in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 90 min. To conduct in vitro apoptotic cleavage, 2 μl of translation product was incubated with 200 μg (60 μl in volume) inactive or active S-100 at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and then the gel was dried and exposed to the film. GST- or GFP-tagged SRPK2 and its mutants were immunoprecipitated with glutathione beads or anti-GFP antibody. After extensive washing, the precipitants were employed in the kinase assay. The precipitated SRPK2 were incubated with 2 μg of acinus in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 with 10 mm MgCl2) containing 20 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 5× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The sample was separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiographed. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated VP16 for another 16 h. Morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by staining with DAPI. Normal nuclei and apoptotic nuclei (condensed new moon-type or fragmented chromatin) were easily distinguished. A minimum of 300 cells from 3–5 different microscopic fields were counted to obtain reliable estimates of cell apoptosis. GFP-positive cells were counted, and the percentage of apoptosis was quantified. TUNEL staining was performed with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with various SRPK2 mutants for 24 h and then treated with 50μm VP16 for another 16 h. Then, the adherent and non-adherent cells were collected, mounted onto the slides, and stained with the TUNEL reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were also counterstained with DAPI, and the ratio of TUNEL/DAPI was calculated as apoptotic rate (%). A minimum of 300 cells from 3–5 different microscopic fields was counted. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. In our previous study, we show that SRPK2 promotes cell cycle progression and cell death in neurons (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, SRPKs have been implicated in apoptosis (8Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether SRPK2 is cleaved during apoptotic cells death and to study the molecular mechanism of its proteolytic cleavage, we performed a cell-free apoptotic assay. [35S]methionine-labeled SRPK2 was incubated with the activated cell-free apoptotic solution (S-100), prepared from cytosolic fraction of HEK293 cells, in the presence or absence of caspase-3/7 inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1A, SRPK2 was cleaved in the activated S-100, which was mostly abolished in the presence of caspase-3/7 inhibitor AC-DEVD-CHO. To further study the cleavage of SRPK2 in the intact cells, HEK293 cells were transfected with the Myc-tagged SRPK2, and treated with VP16 (50 μm) in the presence or absence of caspase-3/7 or pan-caspase inhibitor. Immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody demonstrated that VP16 treatment induced the cleavage of SRPK2 in intact cells. The two major fragmented bands were ∼60 and 30 kDa in size and were partially blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK and caspase-3/7 inhibitor AC-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1B), fitting with the observation in Fig. 1A. These data indicate that caspase 3 and 7 might be the major enzymes that contribute to its degradation. These results suggest that SRPK2 can be cleaved during apoptotic cell death in caspase-dependent manner, and SRPK2 may be the substrate of caspases. The slightly different cleavage patterns between in vitro cleavage assay and VP16-induced apoptosis might be due to different detection approaches. In the in vitro cleavage assay, SRPK2 was labeled with 35S, while in the apoptotic cells treated with VP16, SRPK2 was detected with the Myc antibody that recognizes the N-terminal fragment of SRPK2. To locate the caspase cleavage sites in SRPK2, we examined the amino acid sequence of SRPK2, and identified six putative caspase cleavage sites (DXXD, Fig. 2A). According to the distribution of these potential cutting sites, various SRPK2 fragments were constructed into pGEX4T2 vector. GST-SRPK2 recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria and analyzed in the cell-free apoptotic cleavage assay (Fig. 2B). The wild-type SRPK2 full-length, and fragments SRPK2 (amino acids 83–383) and SRPK2 (amino acids 383–438) were cleaved in the active S-100, whereas the fragment SRPK2-(1–83) was not (Fig. 2C). Based on the molecular weight of the fragments and the putative caspase cleavage sites, we prepared numerous single point mutants. GST-tagged SRPK2 fragments with D62A, D139A, D403A, or D407A mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were incubated with or without active caspase-3 at 37 °C for 2 h. While the mutants of 1–307-D62A and 1–307-D407A were markedly cleaved by caspase-3, the mutants 1–307-D139A and 384–688-D403A were not (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Asp-139 and Asp-403 residues might be the major caspase cleavage sites in SRPK2. Therefore, we constructed D139A, D403A, and D139/403A mutants in the full-length of SRPK2. Upon VP16 treatment, wide-type SRPK2 showed two distinct bands with a molecular mass of about 60∼70 and 37 kDa, with the latter much stronger than the former, suggesting that the latter might be the predominant cutting product. However, mutants D139A and D403A only gave one band at 60∼70 and 37 kDa, respectively, indicating that Asp-139 might be the major cutting site. The apoptotic cleavage of SRPK2 was predominantly abolished in double mutant D139A/D403A (Fig. 2E). Therefore, Asp-139 and Asp-403 residues are the main cutting sites by the caspases, with Asp-139 residue the most principal cleavage position. Our previous study showed that Akt phosphorylates SRPK2 at Thr-492 (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To explore whether Akt phosphorylation can protect SRPK2 from proteolytic cleavage, we labeled SRPK2 with [35S]methionine, followed by incubation with active Akt prior to the in vitro caspase cleavage assay. We observed that SRPK2 incubation with active Akt decreased its degradation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Akt phosphorylation may protect SRPK2 from caspase cleavage. To further explore the notion that Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 might prevent it from apoptotic cleavage, we transfected Myc-SRPK2 into HEK293 cells, which were transfected with Myr-Akt, a plasma membrane resident constitutively active Akt, and siRNA of Akt, respectively. The transfected cells were treated with vehicle control or VP16 (50 mm) overnight. In the vehicle control-treated cells, knocking down of Akt elicited spontaneous SRPK2 apoptotic degradation, which was not detected in control or active Akt-transfected cells. On the other hand, VP16 treatment triggered SRPK2 apoptotic cleavage in both control and si-RNA Akt-treated cells, which was evidently inhibited in active Akt-expressed cells. Hence, down-regulation of Akt with it si-RNA promoted SRPK2 cleavage even in the absence of VP16, whereas the constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) inhibited SRPK2 cleavage upon VP16 treatment (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the effect of Akt phosphorylation on SRPK2 cleavage, we employed two mutants, T492D and T492A, which mimic the constitutively phosphorylated state and non-phosphorylated state of SRPK2 by Akt, respectively. The transfected cells were subjected to VP16 treatment overnight. As shown in Fig. 3C, spontaneous degradation occurred in wild-type SRPK2 even in the absence of VP16 stimulation. The fragmentation of wild-type SRPK2 was further enhanced by VP16. By contrast, T492D robustly prevented SRPK2 from cleavage. SRPK2 T492A exhibited evident fragmentation regardless of VP16 treatment. These results indicate that Akt phosphorylation plays a protective role in SRPK2 cleavage. Accumulative evidence demonstrates that 14-3-3 proteins bind to numerous Akt substrates and prevent their apoptotic cleavage. Our previous study showed that Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 facilitates its binding to 14-3-3β (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We wonder whether 14-3-3β binding to SRPK2 would affect its proteolytic cleavage. To test this possibility, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with Myc-tagged SRPK2 WT, T492A, or T492D in a combination with empty vector, 14-3-3β-WT or 14-3-3β-K50E for 24 h, and then the cell lysates were incubated in vitro with active caspase-3 at 37 °C for 2 h. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that wild-type SRPK2 was cleaved by caspase-3, and the apoptotic cleavage was substantially elevated in SRPK2 T492A; in contrast, no fragmentation occurred in SRPK2 T492D (Fig. 4A). As expected, wild-type 14-3-3β, which strongly binds wild type and T492D SRPK2, inhibited SRPK2 cleavage; however, T492A mutant was markedly cut, fitting with its incapability of interacting with 14-3-3 (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, 14-3-3β-K50E, which weakly binds SRPK2, was unable to protect wild-type SRPK2 from cleavage in vitro (Fig. 4B). To examine whether these observations also occur in the intact cells, we cotransfected SRPK2 and 14-3-3β wild-type or K50E into HEK293 cells and treated the transfected cells with VP16. In consistent with the in vitro experiment, 14-3-3β-WT but not K50E inhibited the fragmentation of SRPK-WT, and T492D did not show apparent cleavage bands under any circumstances. On the contrary, T492A was significantly cleaved in 14-3-3β-WT or K50E-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Because D139A and D403A mutants prevented SRPK2 cleavage during apoptosis, we wondered whether they would affect its interaction with 14-3-3. The binding assay showed that the single point mutation decreased the interaction between 14-3-3β and SRPK2. Interestingly, the double mutant (D139A, D403A) possessed partial binding affinity to 14-3-3. The remnant binding activity might result from the conformational change by the double mutation. Nonetheless, the mutation did not substantially alter SRPK2 phosphorylation by the endogenous Akt (Fig. 4D). Previous study shows that apoptotic cleavage of SRPK1 and SRPK2 abrogates their in vitro kinase activity on ASF/SF2 in Fas-treated Jurkat cells (8Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that SRPK2 phosphorylates acinus on Ser-422 and triggers its redistribution from the nuclear speckles to the nucleoplasm (10Jang S.W. Yang S.J. Ehlén A. Dong S. Khoury H. Chen J. Persson J.L. Ye K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4559-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Next, we sought to determine whether SRPK2 kinase activity was affected during apoptotic cell death by VP16. We transfected HEK293 cells with GST-tagged SRPK2-WT or SRPK2-KD, a kinase-dead mutant with K110A, and then treated the cells with DMSO or VP16 for another 16 h. The cell lysates were subjected to GST pull-down. After extensive wash of the precipitates, in vitro kinase assay was conducted using bacterial expressed acinus as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. In DMSO-treated cells, wild-type SRPK2 robustly phosphorylated acinus, and SRPK2-KD weakly phosphorylated acinus. VP16 treatment evidently triggered the proteolytic cleavage of SRPK2 wild-type and KD (Fig. 5A, lower panel), and down-regulated SRPK2 kinase activity on acinus (Fig. 5A, upper panel). To ensure that SRPK2 kinase activity was indeed reduced in the apoptotic cells, we monitored acinus S422 phosphorylation in the cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that acinus phosphorylation was substantially diminished upon VP16 treatment. The p-acinus in SRPK2-KD-transfected cells was decreased more than SRPK2 wild-type-transfected cells (Fig. 5B, 3rd panel). In VP16-treated cells, acinus was cleaved with slightly more apoptotic degradation occurred in the cells transfected with SRPK2 KD than SRPK2 wild-type (Fig. 5B, 4th panel). VP16 treatment elevated PARP fragmentation in all cells, but SRPK2 wild-type transfected cells revealed stronger PARP cleavage (Fig. 5B, 1st and 2nd panel). This finding fits with our previous report that overexpression of SRPK2 wild-type but not KD triggers spontaneous neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To study whether the point mutation of D139A and D403A would influence the kinase activity of SRPK2, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with acinus and found that the mutation did not affect the kinase activity of SRPK2 (Fig. 5C). Caspases-mediated proteolytic cleavage may exert different impacts on different proteins. Some proteins, such as PARP, are inactivated after cleavage; however, others, like pro-caspases, are activated and further magnify the apoptotic signal. To clarify the consequence of SRPK2 cleavage, we constructed five SRPK2 truncations that reflect the cleaved products (Fig. 6A). While the fragment SRPK2-(1–139) showed a prominent nuclear localization, other fragments acted like the full-length SRPK2 by residing in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). The cytoplasmic residency of GFP-SRPK2-(139–688) indicates that this fragment might bind to other cellular partners that tether SRPK2 in the cytoplasm. To investigate each fragments role in provoking apoptosis, we transfected HEK293 cells with different GFP-tagged SRPK2 fragments. In the vehicle control treated cells, no any significant apoptosis was triggered by any of the fragments. VP16 induced marked apoptosis in GFP-transfected control cells, and overexpression of SRPK2 full-length and a few of the fragments further elevated the programmed cell death. The most prominent apoptosis occurred in the N-terminal fragment SRPK2-(1–139)-transfected cells. By contrast, the C-terminal fragment GFP-SRPK2-(403–688) or the N-terminal 1–139-deleted fragment (GFP-SRPK2-(139–688)) did not escalate apoptotic cell death as compared with GFP control (Fig. 6C). This finding suggests that the N-terminal 1–139 fragment is indispensable for SRPK2 to increase apoptosis. To study whether the 1–139 fragment possesses any kinase activity that contributes to the pro-apoptotic effect, we constructed SRPK2-(1–139)K110A. However, neither SRPK2-(1–139) nor SRPK2-(1–139)KD showed any substantial kinase activity, and they both display similar pro-apoptotic effects in VP16-treated cells (Fig. 6, D and E). Because D139A/D403A double mutation reduces the proteolytic cleavage of SRPK2, we wondered whether this mutation could inhibit the pro-apoptotic effect of SRPK2. To test this possibility, we transfected HEK293 cells with various GFP-tagged SRPK2 constructs and examined their subcellular localization and apoptosis upon VP16 treatment. The cells were stained with anti-SRPK2 to show the C terminus of SRPK2. GFP-tagged SRPK2-WT, -KD, D139A, D403A, and D139A/D403A all distributed in the cytoplasm before stimulation. Except for D139A and D139A/D403A double mutant, other constructs displayed nuclear residency upon VP16 treatment as visualized by GFP fluorescent. However, anti-SRPK2 staining revealed the cytoplasmic localization for these constructs, indicating that VP16 treatment provoked the cleavage of SRPK2 in the N terminus and elicited the nuclear translocation of GFP-tagged N-terminal fragment (Fig. 7A). These results demonstrate that inhibition of Asp-139 cleavage prevents SRPK2 nuclear translocation. Presumably, the nuclear translocation observed in GFP-SRPK2 WT, KD, and D403A cells reflects the cleaved N-terminal GFP-SRPK2-(1–139) fragment. Apoptotic analysis with TUNEL staining showed that both SRPK2 WT and T492D enhanced VP16-triggered programmed cell death, while D139A and D139A/D403A significantly blocked VP16 provoked apoptosis, underscoring that apoptotic cleavage of SRPK2 might be required for its pro-apoptotic actions (Fig. 7B). Hence, prevention of D139 cleavage decreases the pro-apoptotic effect of SRPK2. In the present study, we show that SRPK2 is cleaved both in vitro and in vivo in a caspase-dependent manner. The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK and the caspase-3/7 inhibitor AC-DEVD-CHO both partially inhibit SRPK2 cleavage in apoptotic cells. Presumably, higher concentration of pan-caspase inhibitor is needed to completely block the apoptotic cleavage of SRPK2. We also show the direct evidence that SRPK2 is cleaved in vitro by recombinant caspase-3. These results imply that SRPK2 is the substrate of caspase-3, and other caspases may also be involved in the apoptotic cleavage of SRPK2. Consistent with our finding, Kamachi et al. (8Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggests that SRPK1 and SRPK2 are cleaved during apoptotic cell death and are in vitro substrates for caspase-8 and -9, respectively. Further, in the present study, we identified the caspase-cleavage sites within SRPK2 as Asp-139 and -403 residues. Double mutant of D139A/D403A evidently abolished SRPK2 cleavage in vivo. In alignment with the observation that SRPK2 is a substrate of caspases, we found that Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 strongly protects it from apoptotic cleavage. Binding to 14-3-3 proteins by SRPK2 further protects it from proteolytic cleavage by the active caspases. Recently, we show that SRPK2 wild-type but not KD elicits spontaneous apoptosis in the primary neurons, indicating that the kinase catalytic activity is implicated in this event. This finding is further supported by the observation that SRPK2 T492D, a kinase hyperactive SRPK2 mutant, substantially elevates VP16-provoked apoptosis (Fig. 7). Although Akt phosphorylates SRPK2 and escalates its kinase activity, 14-3-3 proteins associate with the phosphorylated SRPK2 and anchor it from translocation into the nucleus. Because SRPK2 triggers apoptosis dependent on its catalytic activity, indicating some of its kinase substrates can provoke apoptosis in the nucleus. Among the numerous SRPK2 substrates, one of the major SR proteins that implicate in apoptosis is acinus. Acinus, predominantly located in the nucleus, induces apoptotic chromatin condensation after cleavage by caspases (14Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Acinus resides in the nuclear speckles and is cleaved by caspases on both its N and C termini, producing a p17 active form (amino acids 987–1093), which triggers chromatin condensation in the absence of caspase-3. Acinus contains a region similar to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of Drosophila splicing regulator Sxl, suggesting that it is implicated in RNA metabolism. Indeed, acinus is a component of functional splicesomes (15Rappsilber J. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1231-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). It consists of three SR dipeptide repeat domains in the C terminus. Moreover, different acinus isoforms are found in the apoptosis-associated and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex (17Schwerk C. Prasad J. Degenhardt K. Erdjument-Bromage H. White E. Tempst P. Kidd V.J. Manley J.L. Lahti J.M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Conceivably, nuclear translocated SRPK2 phosphorylates acinus, and promotes its degradation, leading to generation of an active form p17 and elevation of chromatin condensation and apoptosis. One of the major functions proposed for SRPKs is to phosphorylate SR proteins, which in turn regulates alternative splice site selection of a subset of mRNA molecules, including the apoptosis regulatory protein Ich-1 (18Cáceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 19Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over 30 different mRNAs have been identified that exist as two or more different splice variants, each with opposing apoptotic functions (20Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SR proteins such as ASF/SF2 alter splice site selection of several RNAs, including Ich-1, and this correlates with resetting of the apoptotic threshold of transfected cells (19Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that alternative splicing may play a critical role in the sensing phase of cellular stress including VP16. Thus, mRNA splicing may represent an unrecognized and unexplored post-transcriptional modification that determines cell fate in response to extracellular stimuli. Conceivably, SRPKs such as SRPK2 are activated at the initial stage of cell stress, resulting in alternative splicing of mRNAs such that anti-apoptotic isoforms such as bcl-xL and Ich1-α. Caspase-mediated cleavage of SRPKs at the later stage of cell stress would diminish their kinase activity, and ensure that the apoptotic program is faithfully executed in condemned cells (8Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein kinases are critical regulators for most of the cellular processes in a kinase-dependent manner. For example, inhibition of Akt kinase activity with a small molecule inhibitor results in suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human cancer cells that harbor constitutively activated Akt due to overexpression of Akt or other genetic alterations such as PTEN mutation (21Yang L. Dan H.C. Sun M. Liu Q. Sun X.M. Feldman R.I. Hamilton A.D. Polokoff M. Nicosia S.V. Herlyn M. Sebti S.M. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4394-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that SRPK2 provoked neuronal apoptosis through up-regulating cyclin D1/Cdk4, which was abolished in SRPK2-KD-transduced neuronal cells (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we show that abrogation of SRPK2 kinase activity inhibited its pro-apoptotic effect in HEK293 cells. These results indicate that SRPK2 kinase activity is responsible for the pro-apoptotic effect of SRPK2. However, the underlying mechanism how SRPK2 kinase activity regulates the programmed cell death needs further investigation. Regulating the balance between survival and apoptotic signaling is a key aspect of cell fate decisions and 14-3-3 proteins contribute to this process in multiple ways. The binding of 14-3-3 has often been found to enhance the activity of proteins with proliferative or survival functions, while antagonize the activity of proteins that promote cell death and senescence (22Morrison D.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrates that Akt phosphorylation of SRPK2 facilitates its binding with 14-3-3, which in turn prevents the pro-apoptotic effect of SRPK2 in primary neurons (9Jang S.W. Liu X. Fu H. Rees H. Yepes M. Levey A. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24512-24525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our previous study shows that 14-3-3β-WT binds to SRPK2, while the mutant K50E impairs its binding ability. Also, SRPK2T492D strongly binds to 14-3-3β, where T492A inhibits the interaction between SRPK2 and 14-3-3β. The present study shows that T492A is robustly cleaved despite the presence of 14-3-3β, whereas T492D is not cut under any circumstances. The fragmentation of SRPK2-WT is inhibited when 14-3-3β-WT is overexpressed, and the cleavage is up-regulated in the presence of K50E. Collectively, we provide further evidence that 14-3-3 interaction with SRPK2 suppresses its cleavage by caspases, and inhibits the release of the N-terminal pro-apoptotic fragment of SRPK2 (Fig. 4). Therefore, these findings suggest a new cue that how 14-3-3 proteins regulate cell death and survival. Some of the SR proteins can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. They are the substrates of SRPKs. Once exported to the cytoplasm, SR proteins are reimported to the nucleus by interacting with the import receptor hMtr10/Transportin-SR in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (23Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.Y. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Tarn W.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10154-10159Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA. 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Yun C.Y. Velazquez-Dones A.L. Lyman S.K. Fu X.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18050-18055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that phosphorylation of shuttling SR proteins in the cytoplasm may act as a switch between mRNA unloading and SR protein reimport (28Gilbert W. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). SRPK family members share highly conserved kinase domains, which are separated by a unique spacer sequence in individual family members, indicating that specific SRPKs may be uniquely regulated by the spacer sequence. Previous studies show that the spacer in SRPK1 is able to modulate the interaction of the kinase with SR protein substrates. The spacer sequence may also interact with specific cellular proteins to anchor the kinase to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, we found that caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage of SRPK2 released its N-terminal fragment that translocated into the nucleus and further potentiated the apoptosis. We showed the nuclear localization of N-terminal fragment SRPK2-(1–139) and the translocation of SRPK2 upon VP16 treatment, which implies that the N-terminal fragment of SRPK2 may be cleaved and translocate into the nucleus to promote VP16-induced apoptosis. However, SRPK2 D139A mutant still remained in the cytoplasm and exhibited anti-apoptotic effect, suggesting that the nuclear translocation of SRPK2 N-terminal fragment plays an essential role in promoting VP16-induced apoptosis. Though D139A or D403A mutation did not markedly alter SRPK2 Thr-492 phosphorylation capability by Akt, the mutation affected SRPK2 binding affinity to 14-3-3 (Fig. 4), indicating that these two residues might be critical for the conformation of SRPK2. Therefore, these data indicate that the site Asp-139 plays an important role in SRPK2 function during VP16-induced apoptosis. This result may unravel the molecular mechanism how SRPK2 regulates apoptotic cell death. It remains unknown how the N-terminal 139 residues escalate VP16-provoked apoptosis. Its binding partners in the nucleus are elusive. Nonetheless, the findings described in this report pave the way for the further investigation in this interesting event. Taken together, our studies show that SRPK2 is cleaved by caspase at both Asp-139 and Asp-403 residues during apoptotic cell death. Caspase cleavage of SRPK2 produces a small N-terminal fragment that translocates into nucleus and promotes VP16-induced apoptosis. This study suggests two pathways are involved in SRPK2 associated apoptotic cell death: first, the active SRPK2 can trigger apoptosis which depends on its kinase activity; second, SRPK2 is also a substrate of caspases whose action releases an N-terminal fragment from the kinase. This released fragment can also enhance apoptotic signals. 14-3-3β regulates both of these two pathways. We thank Dr. Haian Fu (Pharmacology Dept., Emory University) for the 14-3-3β-WT plasmid."

They also function in the cytoplasm to regulate Golgi fissioning; their inhibition can consequently cause a Golgi-dependent checkpoint in G(2). We have recently identified a novel role of CtBPs in the maintenance of mitotic fidelity; inhibition of CtBP synthesis resulting in reduced association of aurora B with mitotic chromatin and aberrant segregation of chromosomes. Here, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of CtBPs with transcriptional regulators and/or chromatin-modifying enzymes in the cell nucleus, rather than their role in Golgi fission, which is critical for the maintenance of mitotic fidelity."
