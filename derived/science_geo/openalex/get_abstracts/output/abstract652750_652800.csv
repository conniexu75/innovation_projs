Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3011134208,"There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection."

Publicly available data show that Germany has been particularly successful in minimizing death rates. Dehning et al. quantified three governmental interventions introduced to control the outbreak. The authors predicted that the third governmental intervention—a strict contact ban since 22 March—switched incidence from growth to decay. They emphasize that relaxation of controls must be done carefully, not only because there is a 2-week lag between a measure being enacted and the effect on case reports but also because the three measures used in Germany only just kept virus spread below the growth threshold.

https://openalex.org/W3025713031,"Swelling of the brain or spinal cord (CNS edema) affects millions of people every year. All potential pharmacological interventions have failed in clinical trials, meaning that symptom management is the only treatment option. The water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is expressed in astrocytes and mediates water flux across the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers. Here we show that AQP4 cell-surface abundance increases in response to hypoxia-induced cell swelling in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Calmodulin directly binds the AQP4 carboxyl terminus, causing a specific conformational change and driving AQP4 cell-surface localization. Inhibition of calmodulin in a rat spinal cord injury model with the licensed drug trifluoperazine inhibited AQP4 localization to the blood-spinal cord barrier, ablated CNS edema, and led to accelerated functional recovery compared with untreated animals. We propose that targeting the mechanism of calmodulin-mediated cell-surface localization of AQP4 is a viable strategy for development of CNS edema therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3025482455,"A visual cortical prosthesis (VCP) has long been proposed as a strategy for restoring useful vision to the blind, under the assumption that visual percepts of small spots of light produced with electrical stimulation of visual cortex (phosphenes) will combine into coherent percepts of visual forms, like pixels on a video screen. We tested an alternative strategy in which shapes were traced on the surface of visual cortex by stimulating electrodes in dynamic sequence. In both sighted and blind participants, dynamic stimulation enabled accurate recognition of letter shapes predicted by the brain's spatial map of the visual world. Forms were presented and recognized rapidly by blind participants, up to 86 forms per minute. These findings demonstrate that a brain prosthetic can produce coherent percepts of visual forms."

https://openalex.org/W3024282827,"Abstract Human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is an independent tumour type with regard to cellular, biological, and clinical features. The use of non-invasive biomarkers such as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) may be relevant in early diagnosis and eventually improve the outcomes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Genome-wide discovery using RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing yielded 21 candidates for methylation-targeted genes. A verification study (252 HNSCC patients) using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) identified 10 genes ( ATP2A1 , CALML5 , DNAJC5G , GNMT , GPT , LY6D , LYNX1 , MAL , MGC16275 , and MRGPRF ) that showed a significant increase recurrence in methylation groups with OPC. Further study on ctDNA using Q-MSP in HPV-associated OPC showed that three genes ( CALML5 , DNAJC5G , and LY6D ) had a high predictive ability as emerging biomarkers for a validation set, each capable of discriminating between the plasma of the patients from healthy individuals. Among the 42 ctDNA samples, methylated CALML5 , DNAJC5G , and LY6D were observed in 31 (73.8%), 19 (45.2%), and 19 (45.2%) samples, respectively. Among pre-treatment ctDNA samples, methylated CALML5 , DNAJC5G , and LY6D were observed in 8/8 (100%), 7/8 (87.5%), and 7/8 (87.5%) samples, respectively. Methylated CALML5 , DNAJC5G , and LY6D were found in 2/8 (25.0%), 0/8 (0%), and 1/8 (12.5%) of the final samples in the series, respectively. Here, we present the relationship between the methylation status of three specific genes and cancer recurrence for risk classification of HPV-associated OPC cases. In conclusion, ctDNA analysis has the potential to aid in determining patient prognosis and real-time surveillance for disease recurrences and serves as an alternative method of screening for HPV-associated OPC."

Mitochondria regulate cell metabolism and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. We and others have shown that AML cells and stem cells have unique mitochondrial characteristics with an increasing reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (Lagadinou et al., 2013Lagadinou E.D. Sach A.

Wang X. et al.AML cells have low spare reserve capacity in their respiratory chain that renders them susceptible to oxidative metabolic stress.Blood. 2015; 125: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As such, targeting mitochondrial pathways such as mitochondrial protein synthesis and mitochondrial protein degradation preferentially kills AML cells over normal hematopoietic cells. For example, the mitochondrial protease ClpP is overexpressed in 45% of AML patients. This protease degrades damaged and misfolded respiratory chain complex proteins and thereby maintains the integrity of the respiratory chain. Inhibiting ClpP leads to impaired respiratory chain function and decreased oxidative phosphorylation and preferentially kills AML cells and stem cells in vitro and in vivo (Cole et al., 2015Cole A. Wang Z. Coyaud E. Voisin V. Gronda M. Jitkova Y. Mattson R. Hurren R. Babovic S. Maclean N. et al.Inhibition of the mitochondrial protease ClpP as a therapeutic strategy for human acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2015; 27: 864-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mitochondria counterbalance the degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins by importing new proteins. Of the approximately 1,300 mitochondrial proteins, all but 13 are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated in the cytoplasm and imported into the mitochondria (Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Mitochondrial machineries for protein import and assembly.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Precursor proteins synthesized in the cytosol traverse the outer mitochondrial membrane through the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) complex. Once imported, mitochondrial proteins are routed to the membranes, intermembrane space (IMS) or matrix on the basis of their localizing sequences and interaction with translocases such as TIM23 and TIM22 (Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Mitochondrial machineries for protein import and assembly.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A subset of cysteine-rich proteins destined for the mitochondrial IMS are oxidized and folded by the mitochondrial IMS assembly (MIA) pathway (Chacinska et al., 2004Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuán Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N.

Acta. 2008; 1783: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Key molecules of the MIA pathway are MIA40 and ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) (Mordas and Tokatlidis, 2015Mordas A. Tokatlidis K. The MIA pathway: a key regulator of mitochondrial oxidative protein folding and biogenesis.Acc. Chem. Res. 2015; 48: 2191-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ALR is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-linked sulfhydryl oxidase that acts in concert with MIA40 and uses oxygen and cytochrome c as final acceptor of electrons (Nalesnik et al., 2017Nalesnik M.A. Gandhi C.R. Starzl T.E. Augmenter of liver regeneration: a fundamental life protein.Hepatology. 2017; 66: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the effects of inhibiting folding of newly imported proteins in the mitochondrial IMS. Specifically, we focused on targeting ALR in AML and evaluated the role of ALR on AML stem cells and differentiation. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that ALR is necessary to maintain AML stem cell function. Inhibiting ALR led to reductions in its substrate, COX17. COX17 is a copper metal chaperone, and inhibiting ALR or COX17 increased mitochondrial copper. By controlling levels of mitochondrial copper, ALR and COX17 regulate levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility, thereby affecting the viability of AML cells and stem cells. Thus, we describe a mechanism by which mitochondria regulate epigenetics, gene expression, and differentiation of malignant cells. We began our investigation of the MIA pathway by studying the expression of MIA40/ALR substrates in leukemic stem cell (LSC+) versus bulk cell (LSC−) fraction of AML cells using a published database (Ng et al., 2016Ng S.W.K. Mitchell A. Kennedy J.A. Chen W.C. McLeod J. Ibrahimova N. Arruda A. Popescu A. Gupta V. Schimmer A.D. et al.A 17-gene stemness score for rapid determination of risk in acute leukaemia.Nature. 2016; 540: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). MIA40/ALR substrates were enriched in LSCs compared with bulk AML cells (Figures S1A–S1C), MIA40 protein levels were increased in AML compared with normal hematopoietic cells (Figure S1E), and levels of ALR (GFER) protein and mRNA were similar (Figures S1C and S1E). By interrogating the published BloodSpot database (Bagger et al., 2019Bagger F.O. Kinalis S. Rapin N. BloodSpot: a database of healthy and malignant haematopoiesis updated with purified and single cell mRNA sequencing profiles.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D881-D885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) ALR expression was higher in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells compared with more differentiated cells (Figure S1D). No gain-of-function mutations for MIA40 and ALR were reported in AML samples (Ley et al., 2013Ley T.J. Miller C. Ding L. Raphael B.J. Mungall A.J. Robertson A. Hoadley K. Triche Jr., T.J. Laird P.W. Baty J.D. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkGenomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J.

Abel M. et al.Functional genomic landscape of acute myeloid leukaemia.Nature. 2018; 562: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Next, we evaluated the importance of the MIA pathway in AML and LSCs by targeting the sulfhydryl oxidase ALR. We knocked down ALR in OCI-AML2, NB4, and TEX AML cells. ALR knockdown reduced the growth and viability of these cells (Figure 1A). As leukemia-initiating stem cells are implicated in disease relapse (Pollyea and Jordan, 2017Pollyea D.A. Jordan C.T. Therapeutic targeting of acute myeloid leukemia stem cells.Blood. 2017; 129: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Kreso and Dick, 2014Kreso A. Dick J.E. Evolution of the cancer stem cell model.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 275-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), we explored the importance of ALR in TEX cells that are arranged in a hierarchy of stem and bulk cells (Warner et al., 2005Warner J.K. Wang J.C.Y. Takenaka K. Doulatov S. McKenzie J.L. Harrington L. Dick J.E. Direct evidence for cooperating genetic events in the leukemic transformation of normal human hematopoietic cells.Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1794-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After transduction with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting ALR, but prior to the onset of cell death, equal numbers of TEX cells were injected into the femur of sub-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID-GF mice. Six weeks later, the percentage of human AML cells was quantified in the non-injected femur by flow cytometry. Knockdown of ALR targeted the leukemia-initiating cells, as demonstrated by reduced engraftment of TEX cells (Figure 1B). Moreover, mice engrafted with ALR-deficient TEX cells survived longer than mice engrafted with wild-type TEX cells (Figure 1B). To further evaluate the effects of ALR inhibition in AML, we used the selective ALR inhibitor MitoBloCK-6 (mitochondrial protein import blocker) (Dabir et al., 2013Dabir D.V. Hasson S.A. Setoguchi K. Johnson M.E. Wongkongkathep P. Douglas C.J. Zimmerman J. Damoiseaux R. Teitell M.A. Koehler C.M. A small molecule inhibitor of redox-regulated protein translocation into mitochondria.Dev. Cell. 2013; 25: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Quirós et al., 2017Quirós P.M. Prado M.A. Zamboni N. D’Amico D. Williams R.W. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Auwerx J. Multi-omics analysis identifies ATF4 as a key regulator of the mitochondrial stress response in mammals.J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216: 2027-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Similar to genetic knockdown of ALR, MitoBloCK-6 was cytotoxic to OCI-AML2, NB4, TEX, and Jurkat leukemia cells as measured by MTS assay (Figure 1C), CellTiter-Fluor (Figure S1G), and propidium iodide staining (Figure S1G). MitoBloCK-6 reduced the clonogenic growth of AML cells preferentially over normal hematopoietic cells (Figure 1D). ALR inhibition also preferentially reduced the frequency of AML stem/progenitor cells over normal hematopoietic stem cells, as measured by long-term culture-limiting dilution assays (Figure 1E). Moreover, inhibition of ALR with MitoBloCK-6 increased the differentiation of OCI-AML2 and NB4 cells, as measured by increased surface expression of the myeloid markers CD11b and CD14 (Figures 1F and 1G). Thus, the mitochondrial oxidase ALR regulates differentiation and stem cell-like properties of AML cells. Next, we assessed the efficacy and toxicity of targeting ALR in mouse models of leukemia. Mice engrafted with OCI-AML2 cells after ALR knockdown had decreased rates of tumor growth and longer survival compared with mice xenografted with wild-type cells (Figures 2A and S2A). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of ALR in vivo. Mice xenografted with OCI-AML2 cells were treated with MitoBloCK-6 (80 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.] 5 of 7 days/twice daily) or vehicle control. MitoBloCK-6 reduced tumor growth (Figures 2B and S2C) without evidence of toxicity, as measured by body weight (Figure S2B), serum chemistry, and gross and histologic examination of the organs at the end of the experiment (Figures S2D and S2E). We also evaluated the effects of ALR inhibition on primary AML cells in vivo. Primary AML cells were injected intra-femorally into sub-lethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Ten days after injection, mice were treated with MitoBloCK-6 or vehicle control (80 mg/kg twice daily). MitoBloCK-6 reduced the engraftment of AML cells into the mouse marrow (Figure 2C). Using serial transplants of AML cells harvested from the marrow of primary recipients into untreated secondary recipients, we showed that inhibiting ALR targeted LSCs (Figure 2D). In contrast, systemic treatment with MitoBloCK-6 did not reduce the engraftment of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting preferential activity toward AML over normal hematopoietic cells (Figures 2E and S2F). The mitochondrial copper chaperone COX17 is a substrate of the MIA pathway and is folded into its mature form in the mitochondrial IMS by ALR and MIA40. When the folding of COX17 in the IMS is impaired, it exits the mitochondria and is degraded in the cytoplasm (Bragoszewski et al., 2015Bragoszewski P. Wasilewski M. Sakowska P. Gornicka A. Böttinger L. Qiu J. Wiedemann N. Chacinska A. Retro-translocation of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 7713-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of ALR inhibition on levels of COX17. Genetic or chemical inhibition of ALR reduced levels of COX17 in the mitochondria (Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast, few or no reductions were observed in other substrates of the MIA pathway, including TIMM23, TIMM22, TIM9, SOD1 (CCS), and TIMM10 (Figures 3A and 3B). We confirmed reductions in COX17 after ALR inhibition by confocal microscopy. Under basal untreated conditions, COX17 localized to the mitochondria as expected (Figure S3A). Upon inhibition of ALR, mitochondrial COX17 decreased, and cytoplasmic levels were slightly increased (Figure S3A), likely reflecting the degradation of misfolded proteins not retained in the IMS. We measured the expression of COX17 protein in primary AML and normal hematopoietic cells using immunoblotting. COX17 was higher in AML samples compared with normal hematopoietic cells (Figure S1E). COX17 gene expression was also higher in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells compared with more differentiated hematopoietic cells (Figure S1F). As inhibiting ALR led to a preferential reduction in COX17, we tested whether loss of COX17 phenocopied ALR depletion. Knockdown of COX17 reduced the growth and viability of OCI-AML2 cells (Figure 3C) and decreased the engraftment of TEX cells into the marrow of NOD/SCID-GF mice (Figure 3D). In addition, knockdown of COX17 in primary AML cells reduced their ability to engraft the marrow of immune-deficient mice (Figure 3E). Moreover, knockdown of COX17 increased AML differentiation, as evidenced by increased CD11b surface expression (Figure 3F). Thus, knockdown of COX17 mimics the effects of ALR inhibition. COX17 is essential for loading copper onto the respiratory chain IV complex subunit, cytochrome c oxidase (Culotta et al., 1997Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. The copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23473Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, Glerum et al., 1996Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. Characterization of COX17, a yeast gene involved in copper metabolism and assembly of cytochrome oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the effects of COX17 and ALR inhibition on mitochondrial and respiratory chain function. We observed a slight but significant reduction in respiratory chain complex II and IV activity after knockdown of COX17, but the activities of the other respiratory chain complexes were not affected by COX17 or ALR inhibition (Figure S3E). However, this mild reduction in the activity of respiratory complexes did not result in functional inhibition of mitochondrial activity, as evidenced by unaltered basal oxygen consumption, unchanged intracellular ATP levels, and no increase in ROS production (Figures S4A–S4C and S4E). Inhibiting COX17 and ALR also did not change levels of Drp1, suggesting normal mitochondrial fission (Figure S4D). As COX17 and ALR inhibition did not significantly impair oxidative phosphorylation, we searched for other mechanisms by which inhibiting these targets would affect AML differentiation and stem cell function. COX17 is a metallochaperone and loads copper onto cytochrome c oxidase (Cobine et al., 2006Cobine P.A. Pierrel F. Winge D.R.

Acta. 2006; 1763: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2002Takahashi Y. Kako K. Kashiwabara S.-I. Takehara A. Inada Y. Arai H. Nakada K. Kodama H. Hayashi J.-I.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7614-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured changes in mitochondrial copper using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Inhibiting COX17 and ALR increased mitochondrial copper 7- and 2.5-fold, respectively (Figure 4A). Copper binds and negatively regulates the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), a cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzyme involved in the preservation of the SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio in cells (Medici et al., 2013Medici V. Shibata N.M. Kharbanda K.K. LaSalle J.M. Woods R. Liu S. Engelberg J.A. Devaraj S. Török N.J. Jiang J.X. et al.Wilson’s disease: changes in methionine metabolism and inflammation affect global DNA methylation in early liver disease.Hepatology. 2013; 57: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SAM and SAH are metabolites that are important in the epigenetic regulation of stemness and differentiation (Fernández-Arroyo et al., 2016Fernández-Arroyo S. Cuyàs E. Bosch-Barrera J. Alarcón T. Joven J. Menendez J.A.

Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolism: cancer mistunes methylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ALR inhibition would affect SAHH enzymatic activity and discovered that ALR inhibition with MitoBloCK-6 decreased the intracellular enzymatic activity of SAHH (Figure 4C). In addition, inhibiting COX17 and ALR decreased intracellular levels of SAM (Figures 4D and S6J), a universal methyl donor that regulates DNA methylation (Robertson, 2005Robertson K.D. DNA methylation and human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effects of COX17 and ALR inhibition on DNA methylation and determined that inhibiting COX17 and ALR decreased global DNA methylation (Figure 4E). In contrast, levels of histone H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 methylation were not reduced (Figure S6D). Of note, basal levels of copper trended higher in the CD34+ fraction of 8,227 cells compared with the bulk fraction (Figure S3B). Intracellular iron also increased after ALR inhibition (Figure S3C). However, this change did not seem functionally important as chelation of intracellular iron with deferiprone did not abrogate the effects of ALR inhibition (Figure S3D). Inhibition of COX17 and ALR produced structural changes in the mitochondria with enlarged and disrupted cristae as well as vacuoles in the matrix (Figures 4B and S4F). These changes in mitochondrial morphology are similar to those reported in the copper overload syndrome Wilson disease (Zischka et al., 2011Zischka H. Lichtmannegger J. Schmitt S. Jägemann N. Schulz S. Wartini D. Jennen L. Rust C. Larochette N. Galluzzi L. et al.Liver mitochondrial membrane crosslinking and destruction in a rat model of Wilson disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To understand the importance of changing SAM levels in AML, we knocked down SAHH in AML cells and observed reductions in levels of SAM, DNA methylation, and growth and viability (Figures S5A–S5D). Knockdown of SAHH also decreased engraftment of TEX cells into mouse marrow (Figure S5E). Thus, SAHH knockdown produces effects similar to inhibition of ALR and COX17. Next, we measured changes in gene expression after ALR inhibition by RNA sequencing. We compared changes in gene expression after ALR inhibition with published genetic signatures of leukemic and normal stem and bulk cells (van Galen et al., 2019van Galen P. Hovestadt V.

Inhibition of ALR shifted gene expression away from a stem cell signature and toward a differentiated myeloid-like signature (Figures 5A and S6C). Pathways associated with myeloid differentiation, including immune response, interferon signaling, and cytokine stimulus (Figure 5C), were enriched after ALR inhibition, and similar pathways were enriched in the published datasets of bulk (LSC−) cells. As global DNA methylation (Figure 4E) decreased after ALR inhibition, we sought to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by performing DNA methylation sequencing after ALR inhibition. Control and MitoBloCK-6 treated samples separated in CpG methylation clustering (Figure S6H). Consistent with our findings above, the number of hypomethylated regions increased (18,452 new regions) after ALR inhibition (Figure S6I). Hypomethylated regions were enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with differentiation, heterochromatin assembly, and heterochromatin organization (Figure 5E). Considering the effect of ALR inhibition in differentiation, we determined if this also translated into changes in global chromatin accessibility (Cedar and Bergman, 2009Cedar H. Bergman Y.

Therefore, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) after ALR inhibition. Inhibition of ALR reduced chromatin accessibility (Figures 5B, S6A, and S6B). Genes that were less accessible after ALR inhibition were enriched in the LSC+ signature genes (Figure 5D). Genes that were less accessible after ALR inhibition were distributed equally across all chromosomes (Figure S6G). These findings are in keeping with our observation that ALR inhibition promotes differentiation and decreases stem cell properties and prior studies showing stem cells have more accessible chromatin (Frey et al., 2017Frey W.D.

Daunorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent that intercalates into DNA, increasing damage (Rabbani et al., 2005Rabbani A. Finn R.M. Ausió J. The anthracycline antibiotics: antitumor drugs that alter chromatin structure.BioEssays. 2005; 27: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reduced chromatin accessibility after ALR inhibition, the combination of daunorubicin and MitoBloCK-6 was antagonistic (Figure S6E). We also tested the combination of MitoBloCK-6 and the hypomethylating agents azacytidine and demonstrated additive reductions in cell growth and viability (Figure S6F). Penicillamine is a copper chelator that forms an inactivating complex with Cu(II) ions (Peisach and Blumberg, 1969Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. A mechanism for the action treatment of penicillamine disease in the of Wilson’s disease.Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 200-209PubMed Google Scholar). Co-treatment of AML cells with penicillamine abrogated the effects of inhibiting COX17 and ALR and restored levels of SAM and SAHH activity toward basal levels (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, co-treatment with penicillamine prevented the upregulation of CD11b and CD14 (cell surface markers associated with differentiation), prevented the shift in gene expression toward myeloid differentiation, and rescued alterations in chromatin accessibility (Figures 5A, 5B, 6A–6C , S6A, and S6B). The effects of ALR inhibition were not reversible, as the addition of penicillamine after treatment with MitoBloCK-6 did not reverse the effects of ALR inhibition on growth and viability (Figure S6K). Finally, co-treatment with penicillamine rescued the reductions in growth and viability seen after COX17 and ALR inhibition (Figures 6D and 6E). The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated in the cytoplasm and imported into the mitochondria. Precursor proteins with specific import signals are imported into the sub-compartments of mitochondria through different protein channels and chaperones. Proteins traverse the mitochondrial outer membrane through the TOM complex. Once through the outer membrane, proteins destined for the inner mitochondrial membrane pass through the TIM22 complex, while proteins localized to the mitochondrial matrix use the TIM23 channel (Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Mitochondrial machineries for protein import and assembly.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A subset of cysteine-rich peptides are folded into their mature forms and retained in the IMS through a process of oxidation and disulfide bond formation via the MIA/ALR pathway (Chacinska et al., 2004Chacinska A.

Here, we showed that modulation of MIA pathway by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ALR promoted differentiation and decreased stem-like properties of AML cells through epigenetic changes caused by the redistribution of mitochondrial copper.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a lead example of a malignancy where a molecular targeted therapy revolutionized treatment but has rarely led to cures (Druker et al., 1996Druker B.J. Tamura S.

The identification of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncoprotein and its constitutive tyrosine kinase (TK) activity as key drivers in CML and the subsequent development of ABL1 TK inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate (IM) revolutionized treatment for early-stage leukemia patients (Druker et al., 2001Druker B.J.

However, it has long been known that the CML clone is sustained by a rare subset of cells with many properties shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and these “leukemic stem cells” (LSCs) do not depend on BCR-ABL1 kinase activity for their survival (Corbin et al., 2011Corbin A.S. Agarwal A. Loriaux M. Cortes J. Deininger M.W. Druker B.J. Human chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells are insensitive to imatinib despite inhibition of BCR-ABL activity.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 396-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). This explains why LSCs are not effectively eliminated by TKI monotherapies and thus are responsible for rapid recurrence of the disease when TKI treatment is stopped or can lead at any time to TKI resistance and relapse (Bhatia et al., 2003Bhatia R.

Chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells possess multiple unique features of resistance to BCR-ABL targeted therapies.Leukemia. 2007; 21: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that the LSCs in CML patients possess an altered metabolic state that is less flexible to perturbation than it is the case for normal HSCs and hence might constitute a targetable vulnerability (Alvarez-Calderon et al., 2015Alvarez-Calderon F.

However, CML LSCs, like normal HSCs, reside in the bone marrow (BM) and may occupy a similar niche environment that may affect their treatment responses. Indeed, this idea is strongly supported by the finding that the sensitivity of CML LSCs to TKIs is significantly reduced when these cells are treated in cultures where they are in contact with supportive stromal cells (Jin et al., 2008Jin L. Tabe Y. Konoplev S. Xu Y. Leysath C.E. Lu H. Kimura S. Ohsaka A. Rios M.B.

The development of therapies that can overcome this resistance and restore the TKI sensitivity of their more differentiated progeny has thus become a major goal in the field. Here, we identify integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as a promising candidate target for achieving such a response. ILK is a multifunctional protein and serine/threonine kinase most abundantly localized, together with PINCH1/2 and α/β/γ-PARVINs, in focal adhesions that serve as intracellular scaffolds and sensory structures (Hannigan et al., 2005Hannigan G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). ILK specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domains of β-integrins to establish physical interactions within cells to integrate and propagate reciprocal signaling between intra- and extracellular environments to modulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration activities (Hannigan et al., 1996Hannigan G.E.

Several studies have shown that the expression and activity of ILK is low in healthy cells but increases in many types of malignant cells, including those present in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Dai et al., 2003Dai D.L. Makretsov N. Campos E.I. Huang C. Zhou Y. Huntsman D. Martinka M. Li G. Increased expression of integrin-linked kinase is correlated with melanoma progression and poor patient survival..Clin.

Hematol. 2009; 37: 450-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the role of ILK in LSCs was unknown. We show here that the expression of ILK is highly upregulated in CD34+ CML cells, as compared to their normal counterparts, particularly in TKI nonresponders, in whom inhibition of ILK expression and activity significantly impairs the persistence of CML patient cells in preclinical patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) models and reverses the TKI resistance of cells from TKI nonresponders even when in contact with otherwise protective stromal cells. We also demonstrate that inhibition of the kinase activity of ILK targets human, quiescent LSCs from patients with TKI-resistant disease, but not normal HSCs, associated with effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together, these findings implicate both a critical and targetable role of ILK in supporting the survival and TKI resistance of CML LSCs that could form the basis of a more attractive therapeutic strategy for this disease. To identify differentially expressed genes that might constitute targets within CML patient cells when they are associated with BM niche cells, we first looked for potential differences in all known intracellular components of focal adhesions (Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007Zaidel-Bar R. Itzkovitz S. Ma’ayan A. Iyengar R. Geiger B. Functional atlas of the integrin adhesome.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) evident in a comparison of the transcriptomes of CD34+ cells obtained from six chronic-phase CML patients at diagnosis and prior to TKI therapy (Table S1) and three normal healthy donor BM samples. This comparison revealed ILK and its associated binding partners PINCH1 and PARVB (the gene encoding β-PARVIN) to be among the most differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p < 0.05; Figures 1A and 1B ). Quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR measurements of the same transcripts in extracts of CD34+ cells from 26 additional untreated CML patients (Table S1) and 15 additional normal BM samples confirmed ILK, PINCH1, and PARVB mRNA levels were higher in CD34+ CML cells (2- to 17-fold, p ≤ 0.0023; Figures 1C and S1A). Interestingly, ILK, PINCH1, and PARVB transcripts were more highly elevated in the diagnostic samples obtained from CML patients that were clinically subsequently found to be TKI nonresponders in comparison to those later classified as TKI responders (p ≤ 0.0023; Figures 1C and S1A). Western blotting confirmed higher ILK, PINCH1, and β-PARVIN protein expressions in CD34+ cells from CML patients (n = 6), particularly in TKI nonresponders (n = 3), versus CD34+ cells from three normal BM samples (1.75- to 10.4-fold; Figure 1D). Strikingly, ILK, PINCH1, and PARVB transcripts and ILK protein levels were more elevated in the CD38− stem-cell-enriched subset of the CD34+ CML populations than in the more mature CD38+ subset or terminally differentiated CD34− cells, particularly in the samples from TKI nonresponders (p ≤ 0.0122; Figures 1E, 1F, and S1B). Noticeably, ILK expression increased significantly further when CD34+ CML cells were incubated in direct contact with stromal cells or IM treatment, but not in transwell inserts above stromal cells (p ≤ 0.0054, Figures 1G and S1C–S1E). To investigate the biological effects of inhibiting ILK activity in CML cells, the cell outputs in 7-day suspension cultures of CD34+ CML cells from nonresponders, responders, and cell lines (K562 and BV173 cells) that had been lentivirally transduced with ILK small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs to knock down (KD) ILK expression (ILKKD1, KD2 or KD3), or a control shRNA vector, were compared (Figures 2 and S2). The extent of ILK suppression was high with ILKKD1 and ILKKD3 but less with ILKKD2, as demonstrated by western blotting or flow cytometry and qRT-PCR analysis (Figures 2A, 2B, S2B–S2D, S2G, S2H, and S2K). Molecularly, suppression of ILK led to a decrease in β-Parvin and PINCH1 protein expression as expected (Figures 2C, S2C, and S2G). Growth monitoring of the transduced cells illustrated a significant decrease in proliferation that correlated with the level of ILK protein suppression both in cultures of patient cells (p ≤ 0.0170, Figures 2A, 2E, S2K, and S2M) and in K562 (Figures S2B and S2E) and BV173 cells (Figures S2G and S2I). Similarly, there was a significant reduction of viable cells and an increase in apoptosis (p < 0.015; Figure 2D) that was not rescued by co-culturing the CML cells with stromal cells (Figures S3A and S3B) (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang B. Li M. McDonald T. Holyoake T.L. Moon R.T. Campana D. Shultz L. Bhatia R. Microenvironmental protection of CML stem and progenitor cells from tyrosine kinase inhibitors through N-cadherin and Wnt-β-catenin signaling.Blood. 2013; 121: 1824-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Detrimental effects of ILK KD on CML cell survival, particularly in TKI nonresponders, were also apparent when transduced CD34+ CML cells were evaluated in short- and long-term growth assays (Figure 2F, 2G, S2N, and S2O). Treatment with IM or dasatinib (DA, a more potent TKI) (Shah et al., 2004Shah N.P. Tran C. Lee F.Y. Chen P. Norris D. Sawyers C.L. Overriding imatinib resistance with a novel ABL kinase inhibitor.Science. 2004; 305: 399-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) in ILK KD TKI-nonresponder cells completely abolished short-term colony formation in these experiments (p < 0.017; Figure 2F) and also strongly inhibited the growth of more primitive cells detected by their colony-forming cell (CFC) outputs in 6-week long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays (p < 0.036; Figure 2G). In comparison, CFC and LTC-IC CFC outputs of CML responder cells were less reduced by ILK KD alone but also showed additional inhibitory effects with simultaneous TKI treatment (Figures S2N and S2O). Importantly, ILK KD was well tolerated by adult, normal CD34+ BM cells in similar assays (Figures S3F–S3J). Hence, these findings indicate that ILK is vital to the survival of all stages of primitive CML cells, particularly in TKI-nonresponder patients, and can restore or enhance responses to TKIs that are not mediated by BCR-ABL1 mutations. To examine whether ILK is critical for the long-term survival and self-maintenance of LSCs in vivo, we injected control- or shILK-transduced CD34+ CML cells from three TKI nonresponders into sublethally irradiated immunocompromised NOD-Rag1−/−IL2Rγc−/− (NRG) mice or NRG mice producing human interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and Steel factor constitutively (NRG-3GS mice), as these have been found to promote better expansion of human AML cells (Figure 3A–3D and S4D–S4F) (Wunderlich et al., 2010Wunderlich M. Chou F.S. Link K.A. Mizukawa B. Perry R.L. Carroll M. Mulloy J.C. AML xenograft efficiency is significantly improved in NOD/SCID-IL2RG mice constitutively expressing human SCF, GM-CSF and IL-3.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Serial BM aspirations and peripheral blood (PB) analyses revealed a significant and sustained reduction of the levels of human ILKKD1/3 cells relative to controls from 3 to 25 weeks post-transplant in both strains of mice despite normal homing capabilities of ILK KD cells (p ≤ 0.027; Figures 3C, 3D, S3C, S4A, S4B, and S4D–S4F), with an average 10-fold decrease in chimerism at 25 weeks that was most evident in the more mature granulopoietic (CD33+/15+) subsets in both strains (p ≤ 0.024; Figures 3E and S4G). This effect was also prominent in the regenerated CD34+ and CD34+CD38− stem-cell-enriched subpopulations in the NRG mice (p ≤ 0.032; Figure 3E) but to a lesser extent in the NRG-3GS mice in which chimerism decreased over time, even in the recipients of control cells (Figures S4D and S4G). In contrast, no decrease in engraftment or specifically the stem cell compartment was observed long-term when normal, adult BM cells with ILK KD were injected into NRG mice, despite successful ILK suppression (Figures S3K–S3M). To investigate the impact of ILK suppression on LSC maintenance in vivo, we harvested human CD45+ cells from primary NRG and NRG-3GS mice and injected these cells into secondary sublethally irradiated recipients, respectively (Figures 3A, 3F, S4E, and S4H). While secondary NRG-3GS mice did not support engraftment of control or ILKKD1/3 cells (Figure S4H), BM chimerism analyses of the secondary NRG mice revealed that the ILKKD1/3 cells, in contrast to the control cells, failed to regenerate detectable human cells in the secondary NRG hosts for up to 40 weeks post-transplantation (Figures 3F, 3G, and S4C), demonstrating that ILK KD suppressed the self-renewal ability of the input CML LSCs. Assessment of the human CD45+ cells retrieved from the BM of the primary mice for their CFC ability in semi-solid cultures also showed a significant reduction of clonogenic outputs regenerated from the ILKKD1/3 cells as compared to controls (p < 0.0001), and qRT-PCR analysis of these clones confirmed the continued suppression of ILK in these cells that were all BCR-ABL1+ (Figure 3H). Together, these results demonstrate that ILK is necessary for the survival and self-renewal properties of CML LSCs in vivo. To consider the clinical potential of these findings, we designed experiments to test the ability of a specific kinase inhibitor of ILK, QLT0267 (Hannigan et al., 2005Hannigan G. Troussard A.A.

When either total CD34+ or the CD34+CD38− subset of TKI nonresponder cells or CD34+ TKI responder cells, K562 or BV173 cell lines were treated with IM or DA in combination with QLT0267 in vitro, cell viability was reduced and apoptosis significantly increased compared to controls or cells treated with any single agent alone or the two TKIs in combination (p < 0.05; Figures 4A, 4B, S5A, S5D, and S5H). Moreover, the same sensitizing effect of QLT0267 to TKI exposure was obtained when this treatment was carried out in co-cultures containing stromal cells, despite the expected decreased effect of IM or DA alone (p < 0.018; Figures 4A and 4B) (Jin et al., 2008Jin L. Tabe Y. Konoplev S. Xu Y. Leysath C.E. Lu H. Kimura S. Ohsaka A. Rios M.B.

CFC assays showed that a combination of QLT0267 with IM or DA had a pronounced effect on inhibiting colony formation, in particular of myeloid clones (CFU-GM), in CD34+ TKI nonresponder cells (>80% inhibition) at concentrations where either or both TKIs had little effect (p < 0.01; Figures 4C and S5G). As expected, colony formation of TKI responder cells was more effectively inhibited by TKIs alone (∼70% inhibition), and this effect was slightly increased by a combination of QLT0267 plus a TKI (Figure S5I). Furthermore, LTC-IC assays also demonstrated a selective inhibition of TKI nonresponder LSC growth in vitro (p ≤ 0.031; Figure 4D). Interestingly, drug interaction analysis (Chou, 2010Chou T.C. Drug combination studies and their synergy quantification using the Chou-Talalay method.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar) indicated strong synergy between QLT0267 and IM on CD34+ CML cells (combination index [CI] value ≤0.3) as well as for QLT0267 and DA combinations (CI value ≤ 0.35; Figure 4E). Molecularly, we demonstrated a significant reduction of known ILK kinase substrates such as p-GSK3β (S9) and p-AKT (S473) levels in response to QLT0267 treatment, respectively (Figure 4F). Most interestingly, QLT0267 strongly reduced p-STAT3 (Y705) levels, which was not achieved by TKIs alone (Figures 4F and 4G). Importantly, QLT0267 alone or in combination with a TKI did not have any inhibitory effect on the functional activity of either CFCs or LTC-ICs obtained from normal BM samples in vitro (Figures 4C and 4D). These results demonstrate that targeting the kinase activity of ILK by QLT0267 sensitizes primitive CML cells to TKIs, with a strong synergistic effect when these cells are exposed to both agents, and such treatments show no adverse effects on primitive, normal human BM cells. To determine whether the dual combination of QLT0267 and TKI is also effective in vivo and against more advanced stages of CML, we assessed the effect of this combined regimen on mice engrafted with BV173 cells, which produce a lethal leukemia that disseminates into all hematopoietic organs (Chen et al., 2013Chen M. Gallipoli P. DeGeer D. Sloma I. Forrest D.L. Chan M. Lai D. Jorgensen H. Ringrose A. Wang H.M. et al.Targeting primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells by effective inhibition of a new AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 complex.J. Natl.

Selective JAK2/ABL dual inhibition therapy effectively eliminates TKI-insensitive CML stem/progenitor cells.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 8637-8650Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first injected 2.5 × 106 BV173 cells carrying a luciferase reporter and a YFP marker (BV173YFP/Luc) intravenously into sublethally irradiated non-obese diabetic (NOD)/ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) interleukin-2Rγc (IL-2Rγc) null (NSG) mice, which produced a strong bioluminescence signal in all mice 14 days later (Figures 5A and 5B ). QLT0267 at 25 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg, DA at 15 mg/kg, or both together or a vehicle control treatment was given daily by oral gavage for the next 14 days. Bioluminescent imaging of the same mice undertaken immediately at the end of the various treatment regimens showed that the vehicle-treated mice had already developed disseminated leukemia in all hematopoietic organs, which was also evident but less pronounced in the mice given single agents (Figure 5B). In sharp contrast, in the mice given the combination of either dose of QLT0267 plus DA, evidence of leukemia had decreased to an undetectable level (Figure 5B). Subsequent monitoring showed a rapid progression of the leukemia in the DA-treated mice with transient persistence of no signal in the mice given QLT0267 plus DA that eventually recurred a month later (Figures 5G and S6C). Phenotypic and molecular analyses of hematopoietic organs of surviving mice euthanized concurrently at 3.5 weeks and again at 5 weeks post-treatment confirmed the near-absence of leukemic cells at that time in the BM, PB, spleen, and liver of mice treated with QLT0267 and DA in contrast to the mice treated with vehicle or single drugs (Figures 5C, 5D, S6A, S6D, and S6G). qRT-PCR and western blot assessments of BCR-ABL1, p-BCR-ABL1, and BCR-ABL1 confirmed the bioluminescence and flow cytometry results (Figures 5E, 5F, S6B, S6E, and S6F). These data demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of ILK and BCR-ABL1 can dramatically target established populations of aggressive human BCR-ABL1+ leukemic cells in vivo. To extend our findings of the combination treatment approach to primary CML patient samples in vivo, we utilized a well-established PDX model (Chen et al., 2013Chen M. Gallipoli P. DeGeer D. Sloma I. Forrest D.L. Chan M. Lai D. Jorgensen H. Ringrose A. Wang H.M. et al.Targeting primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells by effective inhibition of a new AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 complex.J. Natl.

Scott M.T. et al.Dual targeting of p53 and c-MYC selectively eliminates leukaemic stem cells.Nature. 2016; 534: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although primary CML cells cannot generate a CML-like disease in mice, engraftment levels of pretreated LSCs and their progenitor cells can be reliably evaluated long-term in this model. Accordingly, CD34+ cells from TKI nonresponders (n = 2) were first cultured for 24 h with QLT0267 or DA or a combination of these two drugs and then injected into irradiated NRG mice (Figure 6A). Interestingly, analyses of the human CD45+ cells present in the mice 6 and 16 weeks later revealed the levels of chimerism were markedly and consistently lower in the recipients of CML cells that had been exposed to QLT0267 in combination with DA in comparison to recipients of control cells or cells cultured with a single agent (p ≤ 0.0162; Figures 6B and 6C). Moreover, the mice transplanted with CML cells cultured with both ILK and BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors showed a near elimination of the number of human CD34+CD38− stem cells, including Ki67− quiescent LSCs, compared to controls (p ≤ 0.0328; Figures 6D and 6E). Importantly, when the same transplant experiment was performed with normal, adult CD34+ BM cells (n = 2 donors), none of the single or combination treatments led to a significant reduction in levels of regenerated human CD45+ o"
https://openalex.org/W3026098747,"For more than 60 years, it has been known that people report higher (lower) subjective values for items after having selected (rejected) them during a choice task. This phenomenon is coined ""choice-induced preference change"" or CIPC, and its established interpretation is that of ""cognitive dissonance"" theory. In brief, if people feel uneasy about their choice, they later convince themselves, albeit not always consciously, that the chosen (rejected) item was actually better (worse) than they had originally estimated. While this might make sense from an intuitive psychological standpoint, it is challenging from a theoretical evolutionary perspective. This is because such a cognitive mechanism might yield irrational biases, whose adaptive fitness would be unclear. In this work, we consider an alternative possibility, namely that CIPC is -at least partially- due to the refinement of option value representations that occurs while people are pondering about choice options. For example, contemplating competing possibilities during a choice may highlight aspects of the alternative options that were not considered before. In the context of difficult decisions, this would enable people to reassess option values until they reach a satisfactory level of confidence. This makes CIPC the epiphenomenal outcome of a cognitive process that is instrumental to the decision. Critically, our hypothesis implies novel predictions about how observed CIPC should relate to two specific meta-cognitive processes, namely: choice confidence and subjective certainty regarding pre-choice value judgments. We test these predictions in a behavioral experiment where participants rate the subjective value of food items both before and after choosing between equally valued items; we augment this traditional design with both reports of choice confidence and subjective certainty about value judgments. The results confirm our predictions and provide evidence that many quantitative features of CIPC (in particular: its relationship with metacognitive judgments) may be explained without ever invoking post-choice cognitive dissonance reduction explanation. We then discuss the relevance of our work in the context of the existing debate regarding the putative cognitive mechanisms underlying CIPC."

In the current study, we isolated 11 novel cyclotides and 1 known cyclotide (cycloviolacin O2) from H. enneaspermus and used tandem MS to determine their amino acid sequences. We found that among these cyclotides, hyen C comprises a unique sequence in loops 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 compared with known cyclotides. The most abundant cyclotide in this plant, hyen D, had anticancer activity comparable to that of cycloviolacin O2, one of the most cytotoxic known cyclotides. We also provide mechanistic insights into how these novel cyclotides interact with and permeabilize cell membranes. Results from surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that hyen D, E, L, and M and cycloviolacin O2 preferentially interact with model lipid membranes that contain phospholipids with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine headgroups. The results of a lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated that exposure to these cyclotides compromises cell membrane integrity. Using live-cell imaging, we show that hyen D induces rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis. Cyclotide–membrane interactions correlated with the observed cytotoxicity, suggesting that membrane permeabilization and disintegration underpin cyclotide cytotoxicity.

In this study, we sequenced 12 cyclotides in plant material from H. enneaspermus for structural and activity characterization, of which 11 were novel. Five of the novel cyclotides demonstrated potent cytotoxicity, which correlated with their affinity for lipid membrane bilayers. This work demonstrates that the medicinal plant H. enneaspermus is a rich source of cyclotides with cytotoxic activity. A total of 12 cyclotides were isolated from the leaves, stems, and seeds of H. enneaspermus. Each cyclotide showed a mass increment of 348 Da after reduction and S-alkylation with iodoacetamide, suggesting the existence of three disulfide bonds, and had a mass increment of 18 Da after digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C, indicative of a cyclic backbone. They were fully sequenced using tandem MS (Table 1). Eleven of these cyclotides have novel sequences and were named hyen (Hybanthus enneaspermus) according to a previously reported nomenclature system (40Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Ireland D.C.

One of these peptides has an identical sequence to the previously characterized cyclotide cyO2. Hyen A and hyen B are two partial mRNA transcripts reported earlier from the same plant (40Simonsen S.M. Sando L. Ireland D.C. Colgrave M.L. Bharathi R. Göransson U. Craik D.J.

Hyen C was the only Möbius cyclotide isolated from H. enneaspermus.

To investigate the functional contributions of these three regions, we compared the chaperone activities of various constructs of human αB-crystallin (HSPB5) and heat-shock 27-kDa protein (Hsp27, HSPB1) during amyloid formation by α-synuclein and apolipoprotein C-II. Using an array of approaches, including thioflavin T fluorescence assays and sedimentation analysis, we found that the N-terminal region of Hsp27 and the terminal regions of αB-crystallin are important for delaying amyloid fibril nucleation and for disaggregating mature apolipoprotein C-II fibrils. We further show that the terminal regions are required for stable fibril binding by both sHSPs and for mediating lateral fibril–fibril association, which sequesters preformed fibrils into large aggregates and is believed to have a cytoprotective function. We conclude that although the isolated α-crystallin domain retains some chaperone activity against amyloid formation, the flanking domains contribute additional and important chaperone activities, both in delaying amyloid formation and in mediating interactions of sHSPs with amyloid aggregates. Both these chaperone activities have significant implications for the pathogenesis and progression of diseases associated with amyloid deposition, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.

Small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are a major family of heat-shock proteins, present in all kingdoms of life, that have a low monomeric molecular mass, ranging from 15 to 40 kDa. sHSPs generally comprise a central, ∼90-residue α-crystallin domain (ACD) and variable-length N- and C-terminal regions (NTRs and CTRs, respectively). Despite their small monomeric size, metazoan sHSPs are structurally diverse, often existing as a heterogenous array of oligomeric states. The isolated ACD typically forms a stable dimer (1Baranova E.V. Beelen S. Gusev N.B. Strelkov S.V.

Mutations in genes encoding sHSPs are associated with the pathology of a variety of diseases such as neuropathies (18Evgrafov O.V. Mersiyanova I. Irobi J. Van Den Bosch L. Dierick I. Leung C.L.

There is growing evidence that Hsp27 and αB-C are involved in the cellular response to protein aggregation in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. A pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease, is the intra- or extracellular aggregation of specific proteins to form amyloid fibrils. α-Synuclein (α-syn) and apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) are two examples of proteins that form amyloid fibrils both in vitro and in vivo. apoC-II is a serum protein found associated with very low-density lipoprotein particles where it regulates blood triglycerides. Very low-density lipoprotein–bound apoC-II is comprised of amphipathic α helices (21MacRaild C.A. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. The structure and interactions of human apolipoprotein C-II in dodecyl phosphocholine.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15209504): 8084-809310.1021/bi049817lCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, lipid-free apoC-II is unstable and prone to aggregation. Amyloid formation by apoC-II in vitro is well-characterized (22Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J.

The biological roles of α-syn are not well-understood; however, it is highly expressed in multiple regions of the brain and is thought to play a role in vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter release (27Burre J. The synaptic function of α-synuclein.J. Parkinsons Dis. 2015; 5 (26407041): 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Like apoC-II, the N-terminal region of α-syn adopts an amphipathic α-helical conformation upon binding to membranes or lipid-containing vesicles (28Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M.

However, α-syn aggregates to form amyloid fibrils that are the principle proteinaceous components of Lewy bodies found in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of PD patients (29Baba M.

Furthermore, serine phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of Hsp27 and αB-C has the dual effect of regulating both the extent to which the sHSP oligomers dissociate into smaller species, including dimers, and their chaperone activity (44Aquilina J.A.

Interestingly, the dimeric, isolated ACD of αB-C was found to inhibit both amorphous and fibrillar protein aggregation (5Hochberg G.K.A. Ecroyd H. Liu C. Cox D. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Collier M.P.

To determine the importance of the regions outside the conserved ACD for the ability of Hsp27 and αB-C to inhibit amyloid fibril formation, we directly compared the chaperone activities of WT Hsp27 and αB-C with their ACD-only counterparts against the amyloid formation of two well-characterized proteins: α-syn and apoC-II. Additionally, we investigated the chaperone activities of a full-length Hsp27 construct with three serine-to-aspartate mutations designed to mimic the triply phosphorylated, dimeric form of Hsp27 (Hsp27-3D), as well as a truncated form of this construct lacking the CTR (Hsp27-3DΔCTR). Using in vitro aggregation assays, we show that constructs containing both the NTR and ACD more effectively delay amyloid fibril nucleation and/or reduce the rate of fibril elongation than ACD-only constructs. Additionally, the binding of Hsp27 to preformed fibrils and the disaggregation of apoC-II fibrils were found to be conferred by primarily the NTR. Similarly, the ACD-only construct of αB-C was insufficient for mediating fibril binding and apoC-II fibril disaggregation. Full-length sHSPs also induced the tangling of preformed fibrils into larger aggregates. ACD-only constructs did not display this activity, and a construct containing only the NTR and ACD displayed a reduced ability to tangle preformed fibrils relative to its full-length counterpart. Thus, although the ACD retains some chaperone activity in vitro, the N- and C-terminal regions confer distinct and important chaperone functions against amyloid fibril formation. The chaperone activities of full-length and truncated sHSPs were investigated using well-established in vitro apoC-II and α-syn amyloid formation assays. Spontaneous fibril formation by α-syn was induced by incubating the protein at 200 μm, 37 °C, with constant agitation. All sHSP variants delayed amyloid formation of α-syn by various degrees, with the exception of Hsp27 ACD (Fig. 1, A–F, and Fig. S1). We did not observe a time-dependent increase in ThT fluorescence when sHSPs were incubated alone, and BSA did not inhibit the amyloid formation of unseeded α-syn fibril formation (Fig. S2). By fitting the raw data to a four-parameter Boltzmann curve (Fig. S1), we derived the duration of the lag phase (Tlag) and the time to half-maximal ThT fluorescence (T50) (Fig. 1, G and H, respectively). Differences in the Tlag and T50 observed across the samples were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test. The full-length constructs (WT αB-C, WT Hsp27, and Hsp27-3D) and Hsp27-3DΔCTR significantly increased the Tlag relative to α-syn incubated alone (p < 0.01), suggesting that these constructs delay fibril nucleation. Conversely, ACD-only constructs of αB-C and Hsp27 did not significantly increase the Tlag. All sHSP constructs except Hsp27 ACD significantly increased the T50 (Fig. 1H), suggesting that the rate of α-syn fibril elongation was reduced relative to α-syn incubated alone. Table S1 shows statistical analysis of differences in Tlag and T50 between the different sHSP constructs. This analysis shows that the chaperone activity of Hsp27-3DΔCTR was more similar to that of WT Hsp27 and Hsp27-3D than to Hsp27 ACD. These findings demonstrate that the NTR of Hsp27 and the terminal regions of αB-C are important for delaying amyloid fibril formation by α-syn in vitro during both the nucleation phase and the elongation phase. Across all samples, large differences in the final ThT plateaus were observed (Fig. 1, A–F). ThT fluorescence can be influenced by nonfibrillar structures, changes in sample viscosity, and the morphology of amyloid fibrils (49Biancalana M. Koide S. Molecular mechanism of thioflavin-T binding to amyloid fibrils.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804 (20399286): 1405-141210.1016/j.bbapap.2010.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 50Gade Malmos K. Blancas-Mejia L.M. Weber B. Buchner J. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Naiki H.

To determine whether the final ThT fluorescence readings correlated with the fraction of aggregated α-syn, we used pelleting assays (38Binger K.J. Ecroyd H. Yang S. Carver J.A. Howlett G.J. Griffin M.D. Avoiding the oligomeric state: αB-crystallin inhibits fragmentation and induces dissociation of apolipoprotein C-II amyloid fibrils.FASEB J. 2013; 27 (23159935): 1214-122210.1096/fj.12-220657Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In these assays amyloid fibrils were pelleted through a 20% (w/v) sucrose layer such that small, soluble proteins remained in the supernatant fraction, whereas large oligomers such as those formed by WT Hsp27 and αB-C entered and remained in the sucrose layer. Thus, we were able to separate fibrils, large oligomers, and small species (e.g. dimers and monomers) in these assays. The supernatant, sucrose, and pellet layers as well as a sample prior to centrifugation (total) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We observed that the portion of soluble α-syn remaining at the end of the assays appeared to be unaffected by the presence of sHSPs (Fig. 1I). Thus, the observed differences between the total ThT fluorescence yields for α-syn fibrils formed alone and those formed in the presence of the sHSPs (Fig. 1) were not due to a difference in the fraction of aggregated α-syn. Furthermore, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to confirm that the ThT-reactive species formed in the presence of all sHSP constructs were fibrillar (Fig. S3).

https://openalex.org/W3024923446,"An important challenge for silvicultural practices is the conservation of tree diversity while fulfilling the traditional objectives of forest management, most notably timber harvesting. The purpose of this study was to compare the tree diversity before and after the application of silvicultural treatments in a temperate forest in northern Mexico. Fifteen experimental plots, each measuring 2500 m2, were established to evaluate the immediate effect of four silvicultural treatments. These treatments were identified by their levels of management: intensive (clearcut, removal 100%), semi-intensive (removal of 59–61% of basal area), conservative (removal of 29–31% of basal area), and a control group. New forest guidelines, in contrast to conventional approaches, were applied to the semi-intensive and conservative treatments based on health and diversity conditions. Basal area, canopy cover, tree and total volume were measured in each plot. The Importance Value Index, alpha diversity, and evenness were estimated before and after treatments. Eighteen species belonging to five genera and five families were found in the study area. The species with the highest ecological values were Pinus durangensis, P. teocote, Quercus sideroxyla, and Quercus convallata with IVI numbers between 13.6 and 24.5%. Alpha diversity was intermediate (Margalef: 2.9 to 3.8), while dominance and evenness were above average compared to other studies (Simpson: 0.69 to 0.77; Shannon-Wiener: 1.44 to 1.6; Pielou: 0.76 to 0.85). The species evenness index in the conservative treatment was high (Sorensen, Jaccard, quantitative Sorensen and Morisita-Horn; 88 to 99%), although abundance decreased. Overall, there were no significant differences in IVI values and diversity indicators before and after treatments, with the exception of the clearcut treatment. When associating the diversity indices with stand variables, only the Pielou’s evenness index showed a significant relationship between them. We concluded that both the conservative and semi-intensive treatments did not generate significant changes in tree diversity, but the former had slightly higher alpha diversity indices. These results can provide a better insight on silvicultural practices and their effects on species composition."
https://openalex.org/W3026747336,"Introduction This study aims to determine the association between temperature and preeclampsia and whether it is affected by seasonality and rural/urban lifestyle. Methods This cohort study included women who delivered at our medical center from 2004 to 2013 (31,101 women, 64,566 deliveries). Temperature values were obtained from a spatiotemporally resolved estimation model performing predictions at a 1×1km spatial resolution. In “Warm” pregnancies >50% of gestation occurred during the spring-summer period. In cold pregnancies >50% of gestation occurred during the fall and winter. Generalized estimating equation multivariable models were used to estimate the association between temperature and incidence of preeclampsia. Results 1) The incidence of preeclampsia in at least one pregnancy was 7% (2173/64,566); 2) during “warm” pregnancies, an elevation of one IQR of the average temperature in the 1st or the 3rd trimesters was associated with an increased risk to develop preeclampsia [patients with Jewish ethnicity: 1st trimester: relative risk (RR) of 2.38(95%CI 1.50; 3.80), 3rd trimester 1.94(95%CI 1.34;2.81); Bedouins: 1st trimester: RR = 2.91(95%CI 1.98;4.28), 3rd trimester: RR = 2.37(95%CI 1.75;3.20)]; 3) In “cold” pregnancies, an elevation of one IQR of average temperature was associated with a lower risk to develop preeclampsia among patients with Bedouin-Arab ethnicity RR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.49–0.94) for 1st trimester and RR = 0.62 (95% CI 0.44–0.87) for 3rd trimester. Conclusions 1) Elevated averaged temperature during the 1st or 3rd trimesters in “warm” pregnancies confer an increased risk for the development of preeclampsia, especially in nomadic patients; 2) Of interest, during cold pregnancies, elevated averaged temperature was associated with a lower risk to develop preeclampsia for nomadic patients. 3) These findings suggest temperature might be associated with perturbations in maternal heat homeostasis resulting in reallocation of energy resources and their availability to the fetus that may increase the risk for preeclampsia. This observation is especially relevant in the context of global warming and its effects on maternal/fetal reproductive health."
https://openalex.org/W3026786986,"Although burnout syndrome has been investigated in depth, studies specifically focused on palliative home care are still limited. Moreover, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the interplay between emotional flexibility and sensitivity to context in preventing burnout in home care settings. For these reasons, the aims of this study were to examine burnout symptoms among practitioners specializing in palliative home care and to investigate the role of regulatory flexibility and sensitivity to context in understanding burnout. An exploratory cross-sectional design was adopted. A convenience sample (n = 65) of Italian specialist palliative care practitioners participated in this study. Participants were recruited between February and April 2019 from two palliative home care services that predominantly cared for end-of-life cancer patients. The Italian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Flexible Regulation of Emotional Expression (FREE) scale (a measure of emotional flexibility), and the Context Sensitivity Index (CSI) (a measure of sensitivity to context) were administered. Analyses of variance were conducted using the three MBI factors as dependent variables and profession as an independent variable. Subsequently, three identical analyses of covariance were conducted with age, work experience, flexibility and sensitivity to context as covariates. The results showed a low burnout risk for all three of the MBI factors, and there were no gender differences. An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of profession type and age on the emotional exhaustion factor of the MBI, and an ANCOVA indicated that these effects persisted after covariates were accounted for. The results also showed a significant effect of the FREE score on emotional exhaustion. These findings can help explain the differential contributions of profession type and age to the burnout symptoms investigated. In addition, the emotional flexibility component, as an aspect of resilience, represents a significant and specific factor of emotional exhaustion. Interventions to prevent burnout must consider these relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3027960481,"Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binds short antigenic peptides with the help of Peptide Loading Complex (PLC), and presents them to T-cell Receptors (TCRs) of cytotoxic T-cells and Killer-cell Immunglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs) of Natural Killer (NK) cells. With more than 10000 alleles, human MHC (Human Leukocyte Antigen, HLA) is the most polymorphic protein in humans. This allelic diversity provides a wide coverage of peptide sequence space, yet does not affect the three-dimensional structure of the complex. Moreover, TCRs mostly interact with HLA in a common diagonal binding mode, and KIR-HLA interaction is allele-dependent. With the aim of establishing a framework for understanding the relationships between polymorphism (sequence), structure (conserved fold) and function (protein interactions) of the human MHC, we performed here a local frustration analysis on pMHC homology models covering 1436 HLA I alleles. An analysis of local frustration profiles indicated that (1) variations in MHC fold are unlikely due to minimally-frustrated and relatively conserved residues within the HLA peptide-binding groove, (2) high frustration patches on HLA helices are either involved in or near interaction sites of MHC with the TCR, KIR, or tapasin of the PLC, and (3) peptide ligands mainly stabilize the F-pocket of HLA binding groove."

We drew from the Socio-ecological Model to examine the influence of factors at the individual and family level on recreational drug use among adolescents and young adults.This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and March 2018 among a final sample of 784 male and female university students selected using stratified random sampling. Binary logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of ever use and current use of drugs.Our analyses showed that 24.5% of students had ever used drugs for recreational purposes, and 17.5% are current users. The median drug use frequency over the past month was six days among current users (n = 137). In the multivariable analyses, living in the same household as one's mother (AOR 0.28 95% CI 0.16-0.49), adequate family support (AOR 0.48 95% CI 0.26-0.89) and frequent attendance of religious fellowships (AOR 0.13 95% CI 0.07-0.25) were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of recreational drug use. However, male sex (AOR 1.52 95% CI 1.05-2.21) was associated with higher odds of recreational drug use.The family should be considered as an important unit to sensitize young people on the harmful effects of drug use. It is also vital that religious leaders speak against drug use in their various fellowships. There is a need to address recreational drug use on Nigerian campuses by educating students about its adverse impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3027168998,"Aim To identify potential predictors of community integration in individuals after stroke using a residential setting-based strategy. Method A prospective cohort of post-stroke individuals was recruited from the Stroke Unit of the Roberto Santos General Hospital (UAVC-HGRS). All included individuals were aged over 18 years, received a diagnosis of ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging and resided in the city of Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). Following discharge from the stroke unit, the individuals themselves, or their responsible parties, were contacted by telephone to schedule a home visit no less than three months after discharge. All subjects were examined in their homes, at which time the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) was also applied. A robust linear regression model was used to assess community reintegration using CIQ score as the outcome variable. Results A total of 124 individuals effectively fulfilled the eligibility criteria: 51.6% were females, the median (IQR) age was 63(53–69) years, 82.3% were non-white, 53.2% were married, the median (IQR) of years of schooling was 6 (4–12) and family income averaged two minimum monthly wages. Investigated individuals presented a median (IQR) NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 7 (4–12). Multivariate linear regression identified the following independent predictors of community integration: age (β = -0.095; 95% CI = -0.165 to -0.025; p = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (β = -2.348; 95% CI = -4.125 to -0.571; p = 0.010), smoking habit (β = -2.951; 95% CI = -5.081 to -0.821; p = 0.007), functional capacity upon hospital discharge (β = 0.168; 95% CI = 0.093 to 0.242; p = <0.001) and stroke severity (β = -0.163; CI = -0.318 to -0.009); p = 0.038). Conclusions Regardless of length of time since stroke, individuals present restrictions that compromise their reintegration into their respective communities. The demographic, clinical and functional factors identified herein as potential predictors should be considered when conducting regular follow-up, as well as in the rehabilitation of individuals after stroke with the purpose to identify the interventions necessary to optimize their reintegration into the community."
https://openalex.org/W3027739784,"Introduction Knowledge of within-patient dynamics of resistance plasmids during outbreaks is important for understanding the persistence and transmission of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. During an outbreak of a Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing (KPC) K. pneumoniae, the plasmid and chromosomal dynamics of K. pneumoniae within-patients were investigated. Methods During the outbreak, all K. pneumoniae isolates of colonized or infected patients were collected, regardless of their susceptibility pattern. A selection of isolates was short-read and long-read sequenced. A hybrid assembly of the short-and long-read sequence data was performed. Plasmid contigs were extracted from the hybrid assembly, annotated, and within patient plasmid comparisons were performed. Results Fifteen K. pneumoniae isolates of six patients were short-read whole-genome sequenced. Whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing revealed a maximum of 4 allele differences between the sequenced isolates. Within patients 1 and 2 the resistance gene- and plasmid replicon-content did differ between the isolates sequenced. Long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly of 4 isolates revealed loss of the entire KPC-gene containing plasmid in the isolates of patient 2 and a recombination event between the plasmids in the isolates of patient 1. This resulted in two different KPC-gene containing plasmids being simultaneously present during the outbreak. Conclusion During a hospital outbreak of a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolate, plasmid loss of the KPC-gene carrying plasmid and plasmid recombination was detected within the isolates from two patients. When investigating outbreaks, one should be aware that plasmid transmission can occur and the possibility of within- and between-patient plasmid variation needs to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3024811760,"Introduction Levosimendan is approved for acute heart failure. Within this context, pulmonary hypertension represents a frequent co-morbidity. Hence, the effects of levosimendan on segmental pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are relevant. So far, this issue has been not studied. Beyond that the relaxant effects of levosimendan in human pulmonary vessel are unknown. We addressed these topics in rats’ isolated perfused lungs (IPL) and human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Material and methods In IPL, levosimendan (10 μM) was perfused in untreated and endothelin-1 pre-contracted lungs. The pulmonary arterial pressure (PPA) was continuously recorded and the capillary pressure (Pcap) was determined by the double-occlusion method. Thereafter, segmental PVR, expressed as precapillary (Rpre) and postcapillary resistance (Rpost) and PVR were calculated. Human PCLS were prepared from patients undergoing lobectomy. Levosimendan-induced relaxation was studied in naïve and endothelin-1 pre-contracted PAs and PVs. In endothelin-1 pre-contracted PAs, the role of K+-channels was studied by inhibition of KATP-channels (glibenclamide), BKCa2+-channels (iberiotoxin) and Kv-channels (4-aminopyridine). All changes of the vascular tone were measured by videomicroscopy. In addition, the increase of cAMP/GMP due to levosimendan was measured by ELISA. Results Levosimendan did not relax untreated lungs or naïve PAs and PVs. In IPL, levosimendan attenuated the endothelin-1 induced increase of PPA, PVR, Rpre and Rpost. In human PCLS, levosimendan relaxed pre-contracted PAs or PVs to 137% or 127%, respectively. In pre-contracted PAs, the relaxant effect of levosimendan was reduced, if KATP- and Kv-channels were inhibited. Further, levosimendan increased cGMP in PAs/PVs, but cAMP only in PVs. Discussion Levosimendan reduces rats’ segmental PVR and relaxes human PAs or PVs, if the pulmonary vascular tone is enhanced by endothelin-1. Regarding levosimendan-induced relaxation, the activation of KATP- and Kv-channels is of impact, as well as the formation of cAMP and cGMP. In conclusion, our results suggest that levosimendan improves pulmonary haemodynamics, if PVR is increased as it is the case in pulmonary hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3026216542,"Maternal diet significantly influences the proper development of offspring in utero. Modifications of diet composition may lead to metabolic and mental disorders that may predispose offspring to a substance use disorder. We assessed the impact of a maternal high-sugar diet (HSD, rich in sucrose) consumed during pregnancy and lactation on the offspring phenotype in the context of the rewarding and motivational effects of cocaine and changes within the central melanocortin (MC) system. Using an intravenous cocaine self-administration model, we showed that maternal HSD leads to increased relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior in male offspring. In addition, we demonstrated that cocaine induces changes in the level of MC-4 receptors in the offspring brain, and these changes depend on maternal diet. These studies also reveal that an MC-4 receptor antagonist reduces the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, and offspring exposed to maternal HSD are more sensitive to its effects than offspring exposed to the maternal control diet. Taken together, the results suggest that a maternal HSD and MC-4 receptors play an important role in cocaine relapse."

We have used B. papyrifera, a species closely associated to humans, as a proxy to understand the human settlement of the Pacific Islands. We report the first genetic analysis of paper mulberry textiles from historical and archaeological contexts (200 to 50 years before present) and compare our results with genetic data obtained from contemporary and herbarium paper mulberry samples. Following stringent ancient DNA protocols, we extracted DNA from 13 barkcloth textiles. We confirmed that the fiber source is paper mulberry in nine of the 13 textiles studied using the nuclear ITS-1 marker and by statistical estimates. We detected high genetic diversity in historical Pacific paper mulberry barkcloth with a set of ten microsatellites, showing new alleles and specific genetic patterns. These genetic signatures allow tracing connections to plants from the Asian homeland, Near and Remote Oceania, establishing links not observed previously (using the same genetic tools) in extant plants or herbaria samples. These results show that historic barkcloth textiles are cultural materials amenable to genetic analysis to reveal human history and that these artifacts may harbor evidence of greater genetic diversity in Pacific B. papyrifera in the past."
https://openalex.org/W3025476698,"Background and objectives Incidence rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) depend upon infection control policy and practices, and the effectiveness of the implementation of antibiotic stewardship. Amongst intensive care unit (ICU) patients with HAIs, a substantial number of pathogens were reported to be multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB). However, impacts of ICU HAIs due to MDRB (MDRB-HAIs) remain understudied. Our study aimed to evaluate the negative impacts of MRDB-HAIs versus HAIs due to non-MDRB (non-MRDB-HAIs). Methods Among 60,317 adult patients admitted at ICUs of a 2680-bed medical centre in Taiwan between January 2010 and December 2017, 279 pairs of propensity-score matched MRDB-HAI and non-MRDB-HAI were analyzed. Principal findings Between the MDRB-HAI group and the non-MDRB-HAI group, significant differences were found in overall hospital costs, costs of medical and nursing services, medication, and rooms/beds, and in ICU length-of-stay (LOS). As compared with the non-MDRB-HAI group, the mean of the overall hospital costs of patients in the MDRB-HAI group was increased by 26%; for categorized expenditures, the mean of costs of medical and nursing services of patients in the MDRB-HAI group was increased by 8%, of medication by 26.9%, of rooms/beds by 10.3%. The mean ICU LOS in the MDRB-HAI group was increased by 13%. Mortality rates in both groups did not significantly differ. Conclusions These data clearly demonstrate more negative impacts of MDRB-HAIs in ICUs. The quantified financial burdens will be helpful for hospital/government policymakers in allocating resources to mitigate MDRB-HAIs in ICUs; in case of need for clarification/verification of the medico-economic burdens of MDRB-HAIs in different healthcare systems, this study provides a model to facilitate the evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W3027184265,"We investigated the global structure of intrinsic cross-frequency dynamics by systematically examining power-based temporal associations among a broad range of oscillation frequencies both within and across EEG-based current sources (sites). We focused on power-based associations that could reveal unique timescale dependence independently of interacting frequencies. Large spectral-power fluctuations across all sites occurred at two characteristic timescales, sub-second and seconds, yielding distinct patterns of cross-frequency associations. On the fast sub-second timescale, within-site (local) associations were consistently between pairs of β—γ frequencies differing by a constant Δf (particularly Δf ~ 10 Hz at posterior sites and Δf ~ 16 Hz at lateral sites) suggesting that higher-frequency oscillations are organized into Δf amplitude-modulated packets, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were all within-frequency (particularly in the >30 Hz and 6–12 Hz ranges, suggestive of feedforward and feedback interactions). On the slower seconds timescale, within-site (local) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies selectively associated with ~10 Hz at posterior sites and associations among higher (>20 Hz) frequencies at lateral sites, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies at posterior sites selectively associated with ~10 Hz at other sites, associations among higher (>20 Hz) frequencies among lateral and anterior sites, and prevalent associations at ~10 Hz. Regardless of timescale, within-site (local) cross-frequency associations were weak at anterior sites indicative of frequency-specific operations. Overall, these results suggest that the fast sub-second-timescale coordination of spectral power is limited to local amplitude modulation and insulated within-frequency long-distance interactions (likely feedforward and feedback interactions), while characteristic patterns of cross-frequency interactions emerge on the slower seconds timescale. The results also suggest that the occipital α oscillations play a role in organizing higher-frequency oscillations into ~10 Hz amplitude-modulated packets to communicate with other regions. Functional implications of these timescale-dependent cross-frequency associations await future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3027314056,"This study aimed to verify if a significant difference exists between parameters in the early evaluation of normal and near-normal hip joints, to evaluate the influence of age and breed on the parameters, and to clarify the usefulness of a total score for differentiating between Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) grade A and B hips.A total of 231 dogs were classified according to whether they had FCI A or B hips at adulthood, with measurements obtained at 14-28 weeks of age. The total score was calculated by the summation of the following quantitative parameters: angle of subluxation (AS), angle of reduction (AR), laxity index (LI), and dorsal acetabular rim slope (DARS). Logistic regression analysis was performed to establish the probability of the study population to develop an FCI B hip based on the total score. This was repeated for the highest score in combination with the worst-rated hip and once more for breeds.No correlation between age and the parameters was found in the cohort, or for FCI A and B. The values of all the parameters were significantly lower in the FCI A group than in the FCI B group (AR: 4.42° ± 6.0° vs 7.62° ± 7.2°; AS: 0.45° ± 1.9° vs 1.55° ± 3.8°; LI: 0.32 ± 0.1 vs 0.36 ± 0.1; DARS: 3.30° ± 1.8° vs 3.77° ± 1.9°; TS: 11.47 ± 8.3 vs 16.65 ± 10.9). Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers showed significant differences between parameters for both FCI grades. The range, where FCI A and B hips can be predicted on the basis of the total score, was different when assessed for the entire cohort, Labrador Retrievers, and Golden Retrievers.Our results show that even in normal and near-normal hips, the parameters significantly differed in the early evaluation. Moreover, cutoff values should be set for different breeds in the prediction of the FCI grade during early evaluation for a better breeding selection regarding canine hip dysplasia, one of the most common orthopedic diseases among large and giant breed dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3027534051,"Background As the Japanese population ages, the number of cancer patients will likely increase. Therefore, qualified cancer health care providers should be recruited and retained. Nurse job satisfaction is influenced by numerous factors and may affect staff turnover and patient outcomes. Objectives To evaluate the job satisfaction of certified nurses and nurse specialists in Japanese cancer care and elucidate factors associated with job satisfaction. Methods Participants in this cross-sectional study comprised 200 certified nurse specialists and 1,472 certified nurses working in Japanese cancer care. A chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were conducted to identify job satisfaction factors. Results Job satisfaction was present in 38.45% and 49.00% of certified nurses and nurse specialists, respectively. Certified nurses associated job satisfaction with cross-departmental activities (OR 2.24, p<0.001), positive evaluation from senior stuff (OR 4.58, p<0.001), appropriate staff allocation (OR 1.75, p<0.001), more than five years certified nurse experience (OR 1.91, p<0.001), and positive evaluation of the development of certified nurses (OR 2.13, p<0.01) and nurse specialists (OR 1.37, p<0.05). Low job satisfaction was associated with working on a ward (OR 0.51, p<0.001) and a capacity of more than 200 beds (OR 0.33, p = 0.00). Certified nurse specialists associated job satisfaction with palliative care team participation (OR 2.64, p<0.05), cross–sectional activities (OR 7.06, p<0.01), positive evaluation from senior stuff (OR 13.15, p<0.001), presence of certified nurses in radiation therapy (OR 2.91, p<0.05), positive certified nurse specialist development evaluation (OR 7.35, p<0.001), medical service fees (OR 3.78, p<0.01), and independent activities (OR 11.34, p<0.01). Conclusions We identified factors related to activities, facilities, and the cancer care team associated with job satisfaction of certified nurses and nurse specialists in Japanese cancer care. Suggestions are provided to enhance job satisfaction through Japan’s Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control, which may help hospital administrators retain nursing staff."
https://openalex.org/W3025924799,"Purpose To investigate whether the position of the central vascular trunk, as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC) shift, is associated with the initial hemisphere of visual field defect in myopic high-tension glaucoma (HTG) eyes. Methods The deviation of the central vascular trunk was measured from the center of the Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO), which was delineated by OCT imaging. The angular deviation was measured with the horizontal nasal midline as 0° and the superior location as a positive value. The initial hemisphere developing visual field defect was defined as three connected abnormal points (having a P value with less than 0.5% probability of being normal) appearing in only one hemisphere in pattern deviation plots. If those points were observed in both hemispheres initially, the eye was classified as bi-hemispheric visual field defect. Results Initially, 36 eyes (44%) had superior visual field defects, 27 (33%) inferior visual field defects, and 18 (22%) bi-hemispheric visual field defects. After a mean follow-up of 5 years, the number of bi-hemispheric visual field defects had increased to 34 (42%). A logistic regression analysis revealed that inferior deviation of vascular trunk was the only factor associated with initial inferior visual field defect (P = 0.001), while initial bi-hemispheric visual field defects were associated with worse mean deviation at initial visits (P<0.001). A conditional inference tree analysis showed that both the angular deviation (P<0.001) and initial mean deviation (P = 0.025) determined the initial hemispheres developing visual field defect. Conclusions Although both hemispheres were involved as glaucoma progression, the axons on the side counter to the vascular trunk deviation were damaged earlier in HTG. This finding implies the LC shift could add additional stress to axons exposed to high intraocular pressure."
https://openalex.org/W3026977838,"Lentinula edodes, commonly known as shiitake, is an edible mushroom that is cultivated and consumed around the globe, especially in Asia. Monitoring mycelial growth inside a woody substrate is difficult, but it is essential for effective management of mushroom cultivation. Mycelial biomass also affects the rate of wood decomposition under natural conditions and must be known to determine the metabolic quotient, an important ecophysiological parameter of fungal growth. Therefore, developing a method to measure it inside a substrate would be very useful. In this study, as the first step in understanding species-specific rates of fungal decomposition of wood, we developed species-specific primers and qPCR procedures for L. edodes. We tested primer specificity using strains of L. edodes from Japan and Southeast Asia, as well as related species of fungi and plant species for cultivation of L. edodes, and generated a calibration curve for quantification of mycelial biomass in wood dust inoculated with L. edodes. The qPCR procedure we developed can specifically detect L. edodes and allowed us to quantify the increase in L. edodes biomass in wood dust substrate and calculate the metabolic quotient based on the mycelial biomass and respiration rate. Development of a species-specific method for biomass quantification will be useful for both estimation of mycelial biomass and determining the kinetics of fungal growth in decomposition processes."

The assessments were done i) before, ii) immediately-after training session and iii) at 10-month follow-up for subset of health-workers of implementation facilities as defined by the trial. We used a self-administered questionnaire and Objective Structures Clinical Examinations to assess three skill sets: Active Management of Third Stage of Labour, removal of retained placenta and management of severe postpartum haemorrhage. We computed summary statistics and used the paired t-test to assess change of knowledge and skills immediately post-training and at 10-month follow-up. Linear regression was done to assess association of scores and health worker characteristics.Of the 636 health workers included, 606 (96.7%) and 591 (91.4%) completed the knowledge and skills assessments, respectively. Majority of the participants (68%) were nurse-midwives. Knowledge scores increased by 15 percentage-points from 77.5% to 93% (95% CI 14.3, 16.3, p-value <0.000), and skills scores by 47 percentage-points (95% CI 46.5, 49.2, p-value <0.000) from 37.5% to 83%. There was a 4.0% decline of skills at 10-month follow-up. The decline was higher in auxiliary staff (-11.8%) and least in nurse-midwives (-2.1%) p-value <0.001. Health workers who assisted less than 5 deliveries in the last month, those who never attended postpartum haemorrhage in-service training and profession experience >8 years were associated with lower mean skill change immediately post-training.Our study supports the potential of the Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding after Birth training to increase knowledge and skills of postpartum haemorrhage among all professional groups. Auxiliary staff benefited most from the training but also showed higher skill decline at 10-month.

A non-specific immune response is the first line of host defense mechanism against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). There is limited data on associations between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involving innate immunity and the risk and clinical manifestation of cCMV infection. The aim of the study was to investigate association between selected SNPs in genes encoding cytokines and cytokine receptors, and predisposition to cCMV infection including symptomatic course of disease and symptoms. A panel of eight SNPs: IL1B rs16944, IL12B rs3212227, IL28B rs12979860, CCL2 rs1024611, DC-SIGN rs735240, TLR2 rs5743708, TLR4 rs4986791, TLR9 rs352140 was analyzed in 233 infants (92 cCMV-infected and 141 healthy controls). Associations between genotyped SNPs and predisposition to cCMV infection and symptoms were analyzed. The association analysis was performed using SNPStats software. No statistically significant association was found between any genotyped SNPs and predisposition to cCMV infection and symptomatic course of disease. In relation to particular symptoms, polymorphism of IL12B rs3212227 was linked to decreased risk of prematurity (OR = 0.37;95%CI,0.14-0.98;p = 0.025), while polymorphism of IL1B rs16944 was linked to reduced risk of splenomegaly (OR = 0.36;95%CI,0.14-0.98; p = 0.034) in infants with cCMV infection. An increased risk of thrombocytopenia was associated with IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism (OR = 2.55;95%CI,1.03-6.32;p = 0.042), while hepatitis was associated with SNP of TLR4rs4986791 (OR = 7.80;95%CI,1.49-40,81; p = 0.024). This is the first study to demonstrate four new associations between SNPs in selected genes (IL1B, IL12B, IL28B, TLR4) and particular symptoms in cCMV disease. Further studies on the role of SNPs in the pathogenesis of cCMV infection and incorporation of selected SNPs in the clinical practice might be considered in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3027142906,"Improving the digestive efficiency of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) could reduce organic waste, increase the use of alternative feed not used for human consumption and reduce the impact of feed in production costs. By selecting chicken lines divergently for their digestive efficiency, we showed previously that digestive efficiency is under genetic control and that the two resulting divergent lines, D+ (high digestive efficiency or ""digestibility +"") and D- (low digestive efficiency or ""digestibility -""), also differ for the abundance of specific bacteria in their caeca. Here we perform a more extensive census of the bacteria present in the digestive microbiota of 60 chickens selected for their low apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn-) or high (AMEn+) digestive efficiency in a [D+ x D-] F8 progeny of 200 individuals. We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes of the ileal, jejunal and caecal microbiotas, and compared the compositions and predicted functions of microbiotas from the different intestinal segments for 20 AMEn+ and 19 AMEn- birds. The intestinal segment of origin was the main factor structuring the samples. The caecal microbiota was the most impacted by the differences in digestive efficiency, with 41 bacterial species with abundances differing between highly and poorly efficient birds. Furthermore, we predicted that the caecal microbiota of efficient birds might be enriched in genes contributing to the degradation of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) from non-starch polysaccharides. These results confirm the impact of the genetic selection led on digestibility on the caecal microbiota taxonomic composition. They open the way toward the identification of specific, causal genes of the host controlling variations in the abundances of bacterial taxons."
https://openalex.org/W3027573062,"Day length is a determinant of flowering time in rice. Phytochromes participate in flowering regulation by measuring the number of daylight hours to which the plant is exposed. Here we describe G123, a rice mutant generated by irradiation, which displays insensitivity to the photoperiod and early flowering under both long day and short day conditions. To detect the mutation responsible for the early flowering phenotype exhibited by G123, we generated an F2 population, derived from crossing with the wild-type, and used a pipeline to detect genomic structural variation, initially developed for human genomes. We detected a deletion in the G123 genome that affects the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY13 (SE13) gene, which encodes a phytochromobilin synthase, an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. The transcriptomic analysis, performed by RNA-seq, in the G123 plants indicated an alteration in photosynthesis and other processes related to response to light. The expression patterns of the main flowering regulatory genes, such as Ghd7, Ghd8 and PRR37, were altered in the plants grown under both long day and short day conditions. These findings indicate that phytochromes are also involved in the regulation of these genes under short day conditions, and extend the role of phytochromes in flowering regulation in rice."
https://openalex.org/W3027886214,"Disease transmission and epidemic prevention are top conservation concerns for wildlife managers, especially for small, isolated populations. Previous studies have shown that the course of an epidemic within a heterogeneous host population is strongly influenced by whether pathogens are introduced to regions of relatively high or low host densities. This raises the question of how disease monitoring and vaccination programs are influenced by spatial heterogeneity in host distributions. We addressed this question by modeling vaccination and monitoring strategies for the Channel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis), which has a history of substantial population decline due to introduced disease. We simulated various strategies to detect and prevent epidemics of rabies and canine distemper using a spatially explicit model, which was parameterized from field studies. Increasing sentinel monitoring frequency, and to a lesser degree, the number of monitored sentinels from 50 to 150 radio collared animals, reduced the time to epidemic detection and percentage of the fox population infected at the time of detection for both pathogens. Fox density at the location of pathogen introduction had little influence on the time to detection, but a large influence on how many foxes had become infected by the detection day, especially when sentinels were monitored relatively infrequently. The efficacy of different vaccination strategies was heavily influenced by local host density at the site of pathogen entry. Generally, creating a vaccine firewall far away from the site of pathogen entry was the least effective strategy. A firewall close to the site of pathogen entry was generally more effective than a random distribution of vaccinated animals when pathogens entered regions of high host density, but not when pathogens entered regions of low host density. These results highlight the importance of considering host densities at likely locations of pathogen invasion when designing disease management plans."
https://openalex.org/W3027647838,"Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are invaluable sources for drug screening and toxicity tests because of their differentiation potential and proliferative capacity. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homologous recombination system has enabled reporter knock-ins at desired loci in hiPSCs, and here, we generated a hiPSC reporter line expressing mCherry-tagged cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), which can be utilized to screen for the modulators of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in live cells. CYP1A1-mCherry hiPSCs exhibited typical characteristics of pluripotent stem cells such as marker expression, differentiation potential, and normal karyotype. After differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), CYP1A1-mCherry fusion protein was expressed and localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, and induced by AHR agonists. We obtained 23 hits modulating CYP1A1 expression from high-content screening with 241 hepatotoxicity chemicals and nuclear receptor ligands, and identified three upregulating chemicals and two downregulating compounds. Responses of hiPSC-HLCs against an AHR agonist were more similar to human primary hepatocytes than of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This platform has the advantages of live-cell screening without sacrificing cells (unlike previously available CYP1A1 reporter cell lines), as well as an indefinite supply of cells, and can be utilized in a wide range of screening related to AHR- and CYP1A1-associated diseases in desired cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3024429096,"Cervical cancer associated with high risk-human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is becoming the one of the most common female cancer in many sub-Saharan African countries. First-generation immigrant African women living in Europe are at-risk for cervical cancer, in a context of social vulnerability, with frequent lack of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination.Our objective was to address immunologically the issue of catch-up prophylactic HPV vaccination in first-generation African immigrant women living in France.IgG immune responses and cross-reactivities to α7 (HPV-18, -45 and -68) and α9 (HPV-16, -31, -33, -35, -52 and -58) HPV types, including 7 HR-HPV targeted by the Gardasil-9® prophylactic vaccine, were evaluated in paired serum and cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) by HPV L1-virus-like particles-based ELISA. Genital HPV were detected by multiplex real time PCR (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea).Fifty-one immigrant women (mean age, 41.7 years; 72.5% HIV-infected) were prospectively included. More than two-third (68.6%) of them carried genital HPV (group I) while 31.4% were negative (group II). The majority (90.2%) exhibited serum IgG to at least one α7/α9 HR-HPV. Serum HPV-specific IgG were more frequently detected in group I than group II (100% versus 68.7%; P = 0.002). The distribution of serum and genital HPV-specific IgG was similar, but mean number of IgG reactivities to α7/α9 HR-HPV was higher in serum than CVS (5.6 IgG per woman in serum versus 3.2 in CVS; P<0.001). Rates of IgG cross-reactivities against HPV different from detected cervicovaginal HPV were higher in serum and CVS in group I than group II. Finally, the majority of groups I and II women (68.6% and 68.7%, respectively) exhibited serum or cervicovaginal IgG to Gardasil-9® HR-HPV, with higher mean rates in group I than group II (6.1 Gardasil-9® HR-HPV per woman versus 1.4; P<0.01). One-third (31.2%) of group II women did not show any serum and genital HPV-specific IgG.Around two-third of first-generation African immigrant women living in France showed frequent ongoing genital HPV infection and high rates of circulating and genital IgG to α7/α9 HPV, generally cross-reacting, avoiding the possibility of catch-up vaccination. Nevertheless, about one-third of women had no evidence of previous HPV infection, or showed only low levels of genital and circulating HR-HPV-specific IgG and could therefore be eligible for catch-up vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3025581257,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important global public health concern. Several studies reported a higher HEV prevalence in patients undergoing regular hemodialysis (HD). In Lebanon, the epidemiology of HEV among HD patients has never been investigated previously. In this study, we examine the seroprevalence of HEV infection among 171 HD patients recruited from three hospital dialysis units in Tripoli, North Lebanon. Prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was evaluated in participant’s sera using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The association of socio-demographic and clinical parameters with HEV infection in patients was also evaluated. Overall, 96 women and 75 men were enrolled in this study. Anti-HEV IgG antibodies were found positive in 37/171 HD patients showing a positivity rate of 21.63%. Among all examined variables, only the age of patients was significantly associated with seropositivity (P = 0.001). This first epidemiological study reveals a high seroprevalence of HEV infection among Lebanese HD patients. However, further evaluations that enroll larger samples and include control groups are required to identify exact causative factors of the important seropositivity rate in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3026905840,"It is vital to share details of concrete experiences of conducting a nationwide disease survey. By doing so, the global health community could adapt previous experiences to expand geographic mapping programs, eventually contributing to the development of disease control and elimination strategies. A nationwide survey of schistosomiasis and intestinal helminthiases was conducted from December 2016 to March 2017 in Sudan. We aimed to describe details of the key activities and cost components required for the nationwide survey. We investigated which activities were necessary to prepare and conduct a nationwide survey of schistosomiasis and intestinal helminthiases, and the types and amounts of transportation, personnel, survey equipment, and consumables that were required. In addition, we estimated financial and economic costs from the perspectives of the donor and the Ministry of Health. Cash expenditures incurred to implement the survey were defined as financial costs. For economic costs, we considered the true value for society as a whole, and this category therefore accounted for the costs of all goods and services used for the project, including those that were not sold in the market and therefore had no market price (e.g., time spent by head teachers and teachers). We organized costs into capital and recurrent items. We ran one-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses using Monte-Carlo methods with 10,000 draws to examine the robustness of the primary analysis results. A total of USD 1,465,902 and USD 1,516,238 was incurred for the financial and economic costs, respectively. The key cost drivers of the nationwide survey were personnel and transportation, for both financial and economic costs. Personnel and transportation accounted for around 64% and 18% of financial costs, respectively. If a government finds a way to mobilize existing government officials with no additional payments using the health system already in place, the cost of a nationwide survey could be remarkably reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3026400947,"We retrospectively evaluated single-level compression fractures (T12-L3) scheduled for a short-segment POS (posterior-only stabilization) using polyaxial screws. Patients averaged 55.7 years (range, 19-65). Patients received either POS or, concomitantly, BK (balloon kyphoplasty) of the fractured vertebrae as well. Primary endpoint was the radiological outcome at the last radiographic follow-up prior to implant removal. POS together with BK of the fractured vertebrae resulted in a significant improvement of the local kyphosis angle and vertebral body compression rates immediately post-OP. During the further course of FU, a considerable loss of correction was observed post-OP in both groups. (Local KA: pre-OP/ post-OP/ FU: 12.6±4.8/ 3.35±4.8/ 11.6±6.0; anterior vertebral body compression%: pre-OP/post-OP/ FU: 71.94±12.3/ 94.78±19.95/ 78.17±14.74). VAS was significantly improved from 7.2±1.3 pre-OP to 2.7±1.3 (P<0.001) at FU. We found a significant restoration of the vertebral body height by BK. Nevertheless, follow-up revealed a noticeable loss of reduction. Given the fact that BK used together with polyaxial screws did not maintain intra-operative reduction, our data do not support this additional maneuver when used together with bi-segmental polyaxial pedicle screw fixation."
https://openalex.org/W3027719254,"Retinal oximetry is an important screening tool for early detection of retinal pathologies due to changes in the vasculature and also serves as a useful indicator of human-body-wide vascular abnormalities. We present an automatic technique for the measurement of oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules using dual-wavelength retinal oximetry images. The technique is based on segmenting an optic-disc-centered ring-shaped region of interest and subsequent analysis of the oxygen saturation levels. We show that the two dominant peaks in the histogram of the oxygen saturation levels correspond to arteriolar and venular oxygen saturations from which the arterio-venous saturation difference (AVSD) can be calculated. For evaluation, we use a normative database of Asian Indian eyes containing 44 dual-wavelength retinal oximetry images. Validations against expert manual annotations of arterioles and venules show that the proposed technique results in an average arteriolar oxygen saturation (SatO2) of 87.48%, venular SatO2 of 57.41%, and AVSD of 30.07% in comparison with the expert ground-truth average arteriolar SatO2 of 89.41%, venular SatO2 of 56.32%, and AVSD of 33.09%, respectively. The results exhibit high consistency across the dataset indicating that the automated technique is an accurate alternative to the manual procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2924713629,"Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has focused mostly on two extremes: either on small improvements in narrow AI domains, or on universal theoretical frameworks which are often uncomputable, or lack practical implementations. In this paper we attempt to follow a big picture view while also providing a particular theory and its implementation to present a novel, purposely simple, and interpretable hierarchical architecture. This architecture incorporates the unsupervised learning of a model of the environment, learning the influence of one’s own actions, model-based reinforcement learning, hierarchical planning, and symbolic/sub-symbolic integration in general. The learned model is stored in the form of hierarchical representations which are increasingly more abstract, but can retain details when needed. We demonstrate the universality of the architecture by testing it on a series of diverse environments ranging from audio/visual compression to discrete and continuous action spaces, to learning disentangled representations."
https://openalex.org/W3027556101,"End-binding proteins (EBs) associate with the growing microtubule plus ends to regulate microtubule dynamics as well as the interaction with intracellular structures. EB3 contributes to pathological vascular leakage through interacting with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 3 (IP3R3), a calcium channel located at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The C-terminal domain of EB3 (residues 200-281) is functionally important for this interaction because it contains the effector binding sites, a prerequisite for EB3 activity and specificity. Structural data for this domain is limited. Here, we report the backbone chemical shift assignments for the human EB3 C-terminal domain and computationally explore its EB3 conformations. Backbone assignments, along with computational models, will allow future investigation of EB3 structural dynamics, interactions with effectors, and will facilitate the development of novel EB3 inhibitors."
