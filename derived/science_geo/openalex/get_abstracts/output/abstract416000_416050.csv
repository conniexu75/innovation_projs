https://openalex.org/W2117925179,"A major challenge of biology is understanding the relationship between molecular genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits, including fitness. This relationship determines our ability to predict phenotypes from genotypes and to understand how evolutionary forces shape variation within and between species. Previous efforts to dissect the genotype–phenotype map were based on incomplete genotypic information. Here, we describe the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a community resource for analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits. The DGRP consists of fully sequenced inbred lines derived from a natural population. Population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism in centromeric autosomal regions and the X chromosome, evidence for positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. Many variants in novel genes, most at low frequency, are associated with quantitative traits and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance. The DGRP facilitates genotype–phenotype mapping using the power of Drosophila genetics. A new resource for the analysis of population genomics and quantitative traits, the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel is presented. The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a community resource charting the molecular and phenotypic variation in 168 fully sequenced fruitfly strains derived from a single outbred natural population. The first set of analyses of DGRP data provides insights into the genomic landscape of genetic variation, positive and negative selection, and rapid evolution of the X chromosome. The results also reveal many low frequency variants in novel loci that are associated with quantitative traits, and explain a large fraction of the phenotypic variance."
https://openalex.org/W2172170289,"Cancer immunoediting, the process by which the immune system controls tumour outgrowth and shapes tumour immunogenicity, is comprised of three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. Although many immune components that participate in this process are known, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. A central tenet of cancer immunoediting is that T-cell recognition of tumour antigens drives the immunological destruction or sculpting of a developing cancer. However, our current understanding of tumour antigens comes largely from analyses of cancers that develop in immunocompetent hosts and thus may have already been edited. Little is known about the antigens expressed in nascent tumour cells, whether they are sufficient to induce protective antitumour immune responses or whether their expression is modulated by the immune system. Here, using massively parallel sequencing, we characterize expressed mutations in highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived from immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mice that phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells. Using class I prediction algorithms, we identify mutant spectrin-β2 as a potential rejection antigen of the d42m1 sarcoma and validate this prediction by conventional antigen expression cloning and detection. We also demonstrate that cancer immunoediting of d42m1 occurs via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process that promotes outgrowth of pre-existing tumour cell clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-β2 and other potential strong antigens. These results demonstrate that the strong immunogenicity of an unedited tumour can be ascribed to expression of highly antigenic mutant proteins and show that outgrowth of tumour cells that lack these strong antigens via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism of cancer immunoediting."

https://openalex.org/W2150914203,"Selective impairment of peripheral regulatory T-cell differentiation is found to result in spontaneous allergic TH2-type inflammation in the intestine and lungs, demonstrating the functional heterogeneity of regulatory T cells generated in the thymus and extrathymically in controlling immune mediated inflammation and disease. Regulatory T (Treg) cells generated in the periphery are shown to have a distinct non-redundant function compared with Treg cells that differentiate in the thymus. Selective impairment of peripheral Treg differentiation results in spontaneous allergic TH2 type inflammation in the intestine and lungs. This study in mice delineates the functional heterogeneity of Treg cells in controlling systemic mucosal inflammation and disease. A balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms at mucosal interfaces, which are sites of constitutive exposure to microbes and non-microbial foreign substances, allows for efficient protection against pathogens yet prevents adverse inflammatory responses associated with allergy, asthma and intestinal inflammation1. Regulatory T (Treg) cells prevent systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity and inflammatory lesions at mucosal interfaces. These cells are generated in the thymus (tTreg cells) and in the periphery (induced (i)Treg cells), and their dual origin implies a division of labour between tTreg and iTreg cells in immune homeostasis. Here we show that a highly selective blockage in differentiation of iTreg cells in mice did not lead to unprovoked multi-organ autoimmunity, exacerbation of induced tissue-specific autoimmune pathology, or increased pro-inflammatory responses of T helper 1 (TH1) and TH17 cells. However, mice deficient in iTreg cells spontaneously developed pronounced TH2-type pathologies at mucosal sites—in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs—with hallmarks of allergic inflammation and asthma. Furthermore, iTreg-cell deficiency altered gut microbial communities. These results suggest that whereas Treg cells generated in the thymus appear sufficient for control of systemic and tissue-specific autoimmunity, extrathymic differentiation of Treg cells affects commensal microbiota composition and serves a distinct, essential function in restraint of allergic-type inflammation at mucosal interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2136563665,"The generation of coherent radiation in nanostructures has attracted considerable interest in recent years owing both to the quantum electrodynamical effects that emerge in small volumes, and to their potential for future applications. The progress towards exploring this size regime, however, has been hindered by the lack of a systematic approach to scaling down the mode as the structures shrink in size and by the high threshold power required for lasing in small cavities. Here we present a new family of metamaterial-like nano-cavities consisting of metallic coaxial nanostructures that solves both of these problems. The proposed nanoscale coaxial cavities can operate as thresholdless lasers, and their size is not restricted by the mode cut-off. Using these new nano-cavities we have succeeded to demonstrate for the first time thresholdless lasing in a broadband gain medium, and the smallest room temperature, continuous wave, telecom laser to date. The nanoscale coaxial cavities are the first systematic step towards unveiling the potentials of ultra small quantum electrodynamical objects in which atom-field interactions generate new functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W2041134571,"Since the discovery and isolation of α-synuclein (α-syn) from human brains, it has been widely accepted that it exists as an intrinsically disordered monomeric protein. Two recent studies suggested that α-syn produced in Escherichia coli or isolated from mammalian cells and red blood cells exists predominantly as a tetramer that is rich in α-helical structure (Bartels, T., Choi, J. G., and Selkoe, D. J. (2011) Nature 477, 107–110; Wang, W., Perovic, I., Chittuluru, J., Kaganovich, A., Nguyen, L. T. T., Liao, J., Auclair, J. R., Johnson, D., Landeru, A., Simorellis, A.

However, it remains unknown whether or not this putative tetramer is the main physiological form of α-syn in the brain. In this study, we investigated the oligomeric state of α-syn in mouse, rat, and human brains. To assess the conformational and oligomeric state of native α-syn in complex mixtures, we generated α-syn standards of known quaternary structure and conformational properties and compared the behavior of endogenously expressed α-syn to these standards using native and denaturing gel electrophoresis techniques, size-exclusion chromatography, and an oligomer-specific ELISA. Our findings demonstrate that both human and rodent α-syn expressed in the central nervous system exist predominantly as an unfolded monomer. Similar results were observed when human α-syn was expressed in mouse and rat brains as well as mammalian cell lines (HEK293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y). Furthermore, we show that α-syn expressed in E. coli and purified under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions, whether as a free protein or as a fusion construct with GST, is monomeric and adopts a disordered conformation after GST removal. These results do not rule out the possibility that α-syn becomes structured upon interaction with other proteins and/or biological membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2107079238,"This paper illustrates that immunosurveillance and immunoediting can occur in an oncogene-driven endogenous tumour model provided that the tumours carry strong neoantigens not present in the host. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature use contrasting approaches to come to many of the same conclusions about the process of cancer immunoediting, in which an individual is protected from cancer though the elimination and immunogenic modification of cancerous cells. Matsushita et al. use whole-exon sequencing of mouse sarcomas induced by chemical carcinogens to obtain evidence for T-cell-mediated immuno-selection as a mechanism of immune editing. DuPage et al. demonstrate that immunosurveillance and immunoediting can occur in an oncogene-driven endogenous tumour model provided that the tumours carry strong neoantigens that are not present in the host. Cancer immunoediting is a process by which immune cells, particularly lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system, protect the host from the development of cancer and alter tumour progression by driving the outgrowth of tumour cells with decreased sensitivity to immune attack1,2. Carcinogen-induced mouse models of cancer have shown that primary tumour susceptibility is thereby enhanced in immune-compromised mice, whereas the capacity for such tumours to grow after transplantation into wild-type mice is reduced2,3. However, many questions about the process of cancer immunoediting remain unanswered, in part because of the known antigenic complexity and heterogeneity of carcinogen-induced tumours4. Here we adapted a genetically engineered, autochthonous mouse model of sarcomagenesis to investigate the process of cancer immunoediting. This system allows us to monitor the onset and growth of immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumours induced in situ that harbour identical genetic and histopathological characteristics. By comparing the development of such tumours in immune-competent mice with their development in mice with broad immunodeficiency or specific antigenic tolerance, we show that recognition of tumour-specific antigens by lymphocytes is critical for immunoediting against sarcomas. Furthermore, primary sarcomas were edited to become less immunogenic through the selective outgrowth of cells that were able to escape T lymphocyte attack. Loss of tumour antigen expression or presentation on major histocompatibility complex I was necessary and sufficient for this immunoediting process to occur. These results highlight the importance of tumour-specific-antigen expression in immune surveillance, and potentially, immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2085513070,"Tumorigenesis is a clonal evolution process that is initiated from single cells within otherwise histologically normal tissue. It is unclear how single, sporadic mutant cells that have sustained oncogenic alterations evolve within a tightly regulated tissue environment. Here we investigated the effects of inducing oncogene expression in single cells in organotypic mammary acini as a model to elucidate the processes by which oncogenic alterations initiate clonal progression from organized epithelial environments. Sporadic cells induced to overexpress oncogenes that specifically perturb cell-cycle checkpoints (for example, E7 from human papilloma virus 16, and cyclin D1), deregulate Myc transcription or activate AKT signalling remained quiescent within growth-arrested acini. By contrast, single cells that overexpress ERBB2 initiated a cellular cascade involving cell translocation from the epithelial layer, as well as luminal outgrowth that is characteristic of neoplastic progression in early-stage epithelial tumours. In addition, ERBB2-mediated cell translocation to the lumen was found to depend on extracellular-regulated kinase and matrix metalloproteinase activities, and genetic alterations that perturb local cell-matrix adhesion drove cell translocation. We also provide evidence that luminal cell translocation may drive clonal selection by promoting either the death or the expansion of quiescent oncogene-expressing cells, depending on whether the pre-existing alterations allow anchorage-independent survival and growth. Our data show that the initial outgrowth of single oncogene-expressing cells from organized epithelial structures is a highly regulated process, and we propose that a cell translocation mechanism allows sporadic mutant cells to evade suppressive micro-environments and elicits clonal selection for survival and proliferative expansion outside the native niches of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2135168617,"Recent work has identified a new subset of CD4+ T cells named as Tfh cells that are localized in germinal centers and critical in germinal center formation. Tfh cell differentiation is regulated by IL-6 and IL-21, possibly via STAT3 factor, and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) is specifically expressed in Tfh cells and required for their lineage specification. In the current study, we characterized the role of STAT5 in Tfh cell development. We found that a constitutively active form of STAT5 effectively inhibited Tfh differentiation by suppressing the expression of Tfh-associated factors (CXC motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5), musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-Maf), Bcl6, basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (Batf), and IL-21, and STAT5 deficiency greatly enhanced Tfh gene expression. Importantly, STAT5 regulated the expression of Tfh cell suppressor factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1); STAT5 deficiency impaired Blimp-1 expression and resulted in elevated expression of Tfh-specific genes. Similarly, inhibition of IL-2 potentiated Tfh generation, associated with dampened Blimp-1 expression; Blimp-1 overexpression inhibited Tfh gene expression in Stat5-deficient T cells, suggesting that the IL-2/STAT5 axis functions to regulate Blimp-1 expression. In vivo, deletion of STAT5 in CD4+ T cells resulted in enhanced development of Tfh cells and germinal center B cells and led to an impairment of B cell tolerance in a well defined mouse tolerance model.

Rosa-26-YFP (YFP) mice were generously provided by F. Costantini (Columbia University, New York, NY). CD4Cre transgenic mice were purchased from Taconic. Mx1Cre (C57BL/6), IgHEL (C57BL/6, MD4), and sHEL (C57BL/6, ML5) transgenic mice, and B6.SJL (CD45.1) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed in the SPF animal facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin, National Jewish Health, and the animal experiments were performed at the age of 2–3 months using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Naive CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo T cells from OT-II mice were FACS-sorted and activated with Ova peptide and irradiated with wild-type splenic antigen-presenting cells under neutral (anti-IFNγ, anti-IL-4, and anti-TGFβ) conditions in the presence or absence of IL-6. Twenty-four hours after activation, cells were infected by retroviruses expressing constitutively active STAT5 or control empty vector (containing IRES-GFP). Four days after infection, FACS-sorted GFP+ cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 for 4 h, and gene expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. In Fig. 1B, naive CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo T cells from Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− mice were infected with a GFP-containing bicistronic retrovirus expressing Cre or a vector control virus and activated in the presence of the indicated cytokines.

In Fig. 1D, naive CD4+ T cells from Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− mice coinfected with two bicistronic retroviruses expressing Cre-GFP or GFP vector and Blimp-1-hCD2 or hCD2 were further activated under neutral conditions (anti-IL-4, anti-IFNγ, and anti-TGFβ) in the presence or absence of IL-6. GFP+hCD2+ cells were sorted and restimulated for 4 h with anti-CD3 for real-time RT-PCR analysis. Poly(I:C) was administrated into Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− Mx1Cre/YFP mice two times at 2-day intervals. Three weeks after the last injection, mice were sacrificed, and YFP+CD4+ (CD45.2) cells were FACS-sorted for adoptive transfer into B6.SJL (CD45.1+) mice (3 × 106 cells/mouse) (two groups; three mice per group). Two groups of recipient mice were immunized subcutaneously with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Seven days after the immunization, experimental mice were sacrificed, and splenic YFP+CD45.2+CD4+ T cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CXCR5 mAb followed by allophycocyanin-labeled streptavidin and Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) mAbs (BD Biosciences). Germinal center B cells were detected by staining with FITC-labeled anti-GL7 mAbs, PE-labeled anti-Fas mAbs, and Peridin-chlorophyll-protein-labeled anti-B220 mAb (BD Biosciences). Sera from immunized mice were collected, and antigen-specific IgM, IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies were measured by using ELISA. Briefly, serum samples were added in a 3-fold serial dilution onto plates precoated with 10 μg/ml KLH protein. Antigen-specific antibodies were detected with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1, and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates). In addition, FACS-sorted CD45.2+CD4+CD44+YFP+ T cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 for 4 h, and gene expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared from T cells using TRIzol regent (Invitrogen). cDNA were synthesized using the SuperScript reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen), and gene expression was examined with a Bio-Rad iCycler optical system using a iQTM SYBR Green real-time PCR kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The data were normalized to β-actin reference. The following primer pair for c-Maf was used: forward, GCAGAGACACGTCCTGGAGTCG, and reverse, CGAGCTTGGCCCTGCAACTAGC. The primers for IL-21, CXCR5, Bcl6, Batf, c-Maf, Blimp-1, and β-actin were previously described (8Nurieva R.I. Chung Y. Martinez G.J. Yang X.O. Tanaka S. Matskevitch T.D. Wang Y.H. Dong C.

The AP-1 transcription factor Batf controls Th17 differentiation.Nature. 2009; 460: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We first examined the role of STAT5 in Tfh generation in vitro. Previously, we have shown that T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-6 or IL-21 but without TGFβ, IL-4, and IFN-γ signaling preferentially acquire Tfh gene expression and function to promote humoral immunity in vivo (6Nurieva R.I. Chung Y. Hwang D. Yang X.O. Kang H.S. Ma L. Wang Y.H. Watowich S.S. Jetten A.M. Tian Q. Dong C. Generation of T follicular helper cells is mediated by interleukin-21 but independent of T helper 1, 2, or 17 cell lineages.Immunity. 2008; 29: 138-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). To determine the role of STAT5 in Tfh generation, naive CD4+ T cells from OT-II mice activated with Ova peptide and irradiated antigen-presenting cells under neutral (anti-TGFβ, anti-IL-4, and anti-IFN-γ) or IL-6 treatment (IL-6, anti-TGFβ, anti-IL-4, and anti-IFN-γ) conditions were infected with a constitutively active form of STAT5 or a vector control retrovirus that contains an IRES-GFP. Four days after infection, we sorted the retrovirus-transduced cells based on GFP expression and analyzed for their gene expression by real-time RT-PCR. Expression of constitutively active STAT5 dramatically decreased the expression of Tfh-specific genes, such as CXCR5, Bcl6, c-Maf, Batf, and IL-21 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we found that the expression of transcription factor Blimp-1 (encoded by Prdm1) was strongly enhanced by constitutively active STAT5 under IL-6 treatment condition. This finding correlates with the previously published observation that IL-2Rαhi cells exhibit strong Blimp-1 expression, which represses Bcl6 (16Choi Y.S. Kageyama R. Eto D. Escobar T.C. Johnston R.J. Monticelli L. Lao C. Crotty S. ICOS receptor instructs T follicular helper cell versus effector cell differentiation via induction of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6.Immunity. 2011; 34: 932-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Thus, constitutively active STAT5 inhibits Tfh differentiation that is sufficient to suppress most of the Tfh-specific genes through induction of Blimp-1. Our data indicated a potential role of STAT5 in regulation of Tfh development. We further examined the role of STAT5 in Tfh development by using Stat5-deficient CD4+ T cells. C57BL/6 Stat5-deficient mice with deletion of the entire Stat5A/5B locus (Stat5−/−) and mice with the entire Stat5A/5B locus gene flanked with loxP sites (Stat5fl/fl) were previously described (17Dai X. Chen Y. Di L. Podd A. Li G. Bunting K.D. Hennighausen L. Wen R. Wang D. Stat5 is essential for early B cell development but not for B cell maturation and function.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1068-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Stat5fl/− mice were generated by breeding Stat5+/− and Stat5fl/+ mice. We used a GFP-containing bicistronic retrovirus expressing Cre to delete STAT5 in CD4+ T cells derived from Stat5fl/− mice in vitro. Naive CD4+ T cells from Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− mice were differentiated in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, infected on day 2, and subsequently further differentiated under IL-6 treatment, Th17 (IL-6 and TGFβ), and regulatory T cell (TGFβ) conditions. Four days after infection, GFP-positive cells were analyzed for their gene expression by real-time RT-PCR. Deletion of STAT5 under IL-6 treatment condition significantly increased the expression of most Tfh-specific genes (CXCR5, Bcl6, c-Maf, and Batf) except IL-21, which were strongly inhibited by exogenous TGFβ (Fig. 1B). In addition, in the absence of STAT5, we detected enhanced mRNA expression of Batf, but not CXCR5 and Bcl6, under Th17 condition, when we administrated TGFβ together with IL-6 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, deletion of Stat5 in IL-6-treated cells dramatically decreased the mRNA level of Bcl6 repressor, Blimp-1 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that STAT5 controls Tfh development through Blimp-1. Because IL-2 is important for Blimp-1 expression (16Choi Y.S. Kageyama R. Eto D. Escobar T.C. Johnston R.J. Monticelli L. Lao C. Crotty S. ICOS receptor instructs T follicular helper cell versus effector cell differentiation via induction of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6.Immunity. 2011; 34: 932-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and largely functions through STAT5, we next activated naive CD4+ T cells under neutral or IL-6/IL-21 treatment conditions in the presence or absence of IL-2-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1C). Activation of cells under IL-6/IL-21 treatment condition significantly increased the mRNA expression of Tfh-specific genes and up-regulated CXCR5 and Bcl6 protein expression (Fig. 1C), which were further enhanced by blocking of IL-2. In addition, blockade of IL-2 resulted in suppression of Blimp-1 expression. Thus, our data indicate that IL-2 signaling controls Blimp-1 expression and Tfh differentiation. To further determine whether STAT5 negatively regulates Tfh differentiation through Blimp-1, we overexpressed Blimp-1 in Stat5-deficient CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1D). Naive CD4+ T cells from Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− mice were differentiated in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, infected on day 2 with two viruses expressing Cre-GFP or GFP vector and Blimp-1-hCD2 or hCD2 vector, and subsequently further differentiated under neutral or IL-6 treatment conditions. Four days after infection, we sorted GFP+hCD2+ T cells and analyzed for their gene expression by real-time RT-PCR. Under IL-6 treatment condition, Blimp-1 overexpression significantly decreased the expression of Tfh-associated genes such as CXCR5, Bcl6, c-Maf, Batf, and IL-21 in the presence of STAT5 or even in the absence of STAT5 (Fig. 1D). Thus, altogether our in vitro data suggest that STAT5-mediated Blimp-1 expression is sufficient to antagonize Tfh program. Next, we examined the effect of STAT5 deficiency on Tfh generation and function in vivo. Stat5fl/+ and Stat5fl/− Mx1Cre/YFP mice were treated with poly(I:C), which can induce Cre expression, resulting in deletion of a “floxed” transcriptional stop cassette preceding YFP cDNA at the rosa26 locus and subsequent YFP expression to track floxed Stat5 deletion (19Fu G. Chen Y. Yu M. Podd A. Schuman J. He Y. Di L. Yassai M. Haribhai D. North P.E. Gorski J. Williams C.B. Wang D. Wen R. Phospholipase Cγ1 is essential for T cell development, activation, and tolerance.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Three weeks after treatment, YFP+CD4+ (CD45.2) cells were FACS-sorted and then adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 (CD45.1+) mice (3 × 106 cells/mouse) (two groups; three mice per group) followed by immunization with KLH protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Seven days following immunization, the expression of CXCR5 and BTLA on CD45.2+CD4+YFP+ T cells was examined. CXCR5 and B and T lymphocyte attenuator expression was greatly increased on CD45.2+CD4+YFP+ T cells derived from CD45.1 recipients that received T cells from Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5fl/+ Mx1Cre/YFP mice (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, there were approximately two times more GL7+Fas+ host germinal center B cells in recipients that received T cells from Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5fl/+ Mx1Cre/YFP mice (Fig. 2A). The transferred Stat5-deficient cells also enhanced KLH-specific antibody production (Fig. 2B). In addition, analysis of sorted CD4+YFP+CD44hi cells revealed that STAT5 deficiency in T cells resulted in increased expression of Tfh-related genes (CXCR5, IL-21R, Batf, c-Maf, and IL-21) and suppression of Blimp-1, an antagonistic regulator of Tfh development (Fig. 2C). Based on the above data, we conclude that STAT5 expression in T cells is required to control development of Tfh cells and the germinal center reaction. To further determine the role of STAT5 in the development of Tfh cells in vivo, we examined Tfh cells in Stat5+/+ and Stat5fl/− CD4Cre/YFP mice. In these mice, CD4Cre-mediated Stat5 deletion starts at the thymic double-positive stage, and Cre-mediated YFP expression can track floxed Stat5 deletion (19Fu G. Chen Y. Yu M. Podd A. Schuman J.

A critical role for Dnmt1 and DNA methylation in T cell development, function, and survival.Immunity. 2001; 15: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). STAT5 proteins were absent in YFP+, but not YFP−, splenic T cells from Stat5fl/− CD4Cre/YFP mice (data not shown). Importantly, the population of CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells within CD4+YFP+ splenic T cells was markedly increased in naive Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5+/+ CD4Cre/YFP mice (Fig. 3A, upper). In contrast, the population of CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells within CD4+YFP− splenic T cells was comparable between naive Stat5fl/− and Stat5+/+ CD4Cre/YFP mice (Fig. 3A, middle). In addition, the population of germinal center B cells (Fas+GL7+) was greatly increased in Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5+/+ CD4Cre/YFP mice (Fig. 3A, lower). Therefore, STAT5 deficiency intrinsically results in an increase of Tfh cells in vivo, leading to an increase of germinal center B cells. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Stat5 deficiency-induced elevation of Tfh cells on B cell tolerance. Stat5fl/− CD4Cre/YFP mice were crossed with IgHELsHEL transgenic mice, which bear rearranged heavy (H) and Igκ L chain genes encoding a B cell receptor specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and express soluble HEL (sHEL). Due to self-antigen-induced B cell tolerance, there is little production of HEL-specific IgM in wild-type IgHELsHEL mice (21Goodnow C.C. Crosbie J. Adelstein S. Lavoie T.B. Smith-Gill S.J. Brink R.A.

Altered immunoglobulin expression and functional silencing of self-reactive B lymphocytes in transgenic mice.Nature. 1988; 334: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). As in nontransgenic mice (Fig. 3A), the population of CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells within CD4+YFP+, but not CD4+YFP−, splenic T cells was markedly increased in Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5fl/+ CD4Cre/YFP/IgHELsHEL mice (Fig. 3B, upper and middle). The population of Fas+GL7+ germinal center B cells was also greatly increased in Stat5fl/− relative to Stat5fl/+ CD4Cre/YFP/IgHELsHEL mice (Fig. 3B, lower). Importantly, serum levels of HEL-specific IgM were markedly increased in Stat5fl/− relative to control CD4Cre/YFP/IgHELsHEL mice (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that STAT5 deficiency in CD4+ T cells causes an increase of Tfh cells and germinal center B cells in IgHELsHEL transgenic mice, resulting in an impairment of B cell tolerance. Significant advances in the understanding of Tfh cell differentiation and involvement in immune responses have been made over the past few years. However, the signaling events required for commitment of CD4+ Th cells to the Tfh subset are only beginning to be elucidated. IL-21/IL-6, STAT3, and Bcl6 are required for Tfh cell generation, although the precise mechanisms controlling the expression of these major Tfh factors have yet to be resolved. We have analyzed the role of STAT5 in developmental regulation of Tfh cells. We found that STAT5, which is known as a critical regulator of regulatory T cell and Th17 reciprocal development, also played a critical role in Tfh development and in B cell-mediated humoral immune responses. IL-2/STAT5 promotes the expression of Bcl6 repressor Blimp-1 and inhibits the differentiation of Tfh cells. Mice with STAT5 deficiency in CD4+ T cells exhibited an increase of Tfh and germinal center B cells and impairment of B cell tolerance, suggesting that STAT5 signaling controls the Tfh generation and humoral immunity. This finding highlights a negative cross-talk between the IL-2/STAT5/Blimp-1 and the IL-6/IL-21/Bcl6 pathways in Tfh development and may help us to find ways to treat antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases associated with expansion of Tfh cells. We thank the Dong laboratory members for their help."
https://openalex.org/W2021955395,"DNA breaks can be repaired with high fidelity by homologous recombination. A ubiquitous protein that is essential for this DNA template-directed repair is RecA. After resection of broken DNA to produce single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RecA assembles on this ssDNA into a filament with the unique capacity to search and find DNA sequences in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that are homologous to the ssDNA. This homology search is vital to recombinational DNA repair, and results in homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands. Homologous pairing involves DNA sequence-specific target location by the RecA-ssDNA complex. Despite decades of study, the mechanism of this enigmatic search process remains unknown. RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, but ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA pairing and strand exchange, eliminating active search processes. Using dual optical trapping to manipulate DNA, and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to image DNA pairing, we demonstrate that both the three-dimensional conformational state of the dsDNA target and the length of the homologous RecA-ssDNA filament have important roles in the homology search. We discovered that as the end-to-end distance of the target dsDNA molecule is increased, constraining the available three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the molecule, the rate of homologous pairing decreases. Conversely, when the length of the ssDNA in the nucleoprotein filament is increased, homology is found faster. We propose a model for the DNA homology search process termed 'intersegmental contact sampling', in which the intrinsic multivalent nature of the RecA nucleoprotein filament is used to search DNA sequence space within 3D domains of DNA, exploiting multiple weak contacts to rapidly search for homology. Our findings highlight the importance of the 3D conformational dynamics of DNA, reveal a previously unknown facet of the homology search, and provide insight into the mechanism of DNA target location by this member of a universal family of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2055565790,"Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is an essential receptor for angiogenesis that binds to VEGF-A. Nrp1 binds directly to VEGF-A with high affinity, but the nature of their selective binding has remained unclear. Nrp1 was initially reported to bind to the exon 7-encoded region of VEGF-A and function as an isoform-specific receptor for VEGF-A(164/165). Recent data have implicated exon 8-encoded residues, which are found in all proangiogenic VEGF-A isoforms, in Nrp binding. We have determined the crystal structure of the exon 7/8-encoded VEGF-A heparin binding domain in complex with the Nrp1-b1 domain. This structure clearly demonstrates that residues from both exons 7 and 8 physically contribute to Nrp1 binding. Using an in vitro binding assay, we have determined the relative contributions of exon 7- and 8-encoded residues. We demonstrate that the exon 8-encoded C-terminal arginine is essential for the interaction of VEGF-A with Nrp1 and mediates high affinity Nrp binding. Exon 7-encoded electronegative residues make additional interactions with the L1 loop of Nrp1. Although otherwise conserved, the primary sequences of Nrp1 and Nrp2 differ significantly in this region. We further show that VEGF-A(164) binds 50-fold more strongly to Nrp1 than Nrp2. Direct repulsion between the electronegative exon 7-encoded residues of the heparin binding domain and the electronegative L1 loop found only in Nrp2 is found to significantly contribute to the observed selectivity. The results reveal the basis for the potent and selective binding of VEGF-A(164) to Nrp1."

https://openalex.org/W2146845286,"Substrates tagged with (poly)ubiquitin for degradation can be targeted directly to the 26 S proteasome where they are proteolyzed. Independently, ubiquitin conjugates may also be delivered by bivalent shuttles. The majority of shuttles attach to the proteasome through a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) while anchoring cargo at a C-terminal polyubiquitin-binding domain(s). We found that two shuttles of this class, Rad23 and Dsk2, dock at two different receptor sites embedded within a single subunit of the 19 S proteasome regulatory particle, Rpn1. Their association/dissociation constants and affinities for Rpn1 are similar. In contrast, another UBL-containing protein, the deubiquitinase Ubp6, is also anchored by Rpn1, yet it dissociates slower, thus behaving as an occasional proteasome subunit that is distinct from the transiently associated shuttles. Two neighboring subunits, Rpn10 and Rpn13, show a marked preference for polyubiquitin over UBLs. Rpn10 attaches to the central solenoid portion of Rpn1, although this association is stabilized by the presence of a third subunit, Rpn2. Rpn13 binds directly to Rpn2. These intrinsic polyubiquitin receptors may compete with substrate shuttles for their polyubiquitin-conjugate cargos, thereby aiding release of the emptied shuttles. By binding multiple ubiquitin-processing factors simultaneously, Rpn1 is uniquely suited to coordinate substrate recruitment, deubiquitination, and movement toward the catalytic core. The broad range of affinities for ubiquitin, ubiquitin-like, and non-ubiquitin signals by adjacent yet nonoverlapping sites all within the base represents a hub of activity that coordinates the intricate relay of substrates within the proteasome, and consequently it influences substrate residency time and commitment to degradation."

Young male C57BL/6 mice (25 g) developed ALI following airway deposition of bacterial LPS or IgG immune complexes in the absence or presence of appropriate stereoisomers (enantiomers) of β2AR agonists, albuterol or formoterol. Endpoints included albumin leak into lung and buildup of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and cytokines/chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluids. Both β2AR agonists suppressed lung inflammatory parameters (IC50=10-7 M). Similar effects of β2AR agonists on mediator release were found when mouse macrophages were stimulated in vitro with LPS. The protective effects were associated with reduced activation (phosphorylation) of JNK but not of other signaling proteins. Collectively, these data suggest that β2AR agonists have broad anti-inflammatory effects in the setting of ALI. While β2AR agonists suppress JNK activation, the extent to which this can explain the blunted lung inflammatory responses in the ALI models remains to be determined.—Bosmann, M., Grailer, J.

Docking computations identified putative sites of blocker binding at the extracellular surface of AQP4. The blockers did not affect complement-dependent cytotoxicity caused by anti-GD3 antibody binding to ganglioside GD3. The blockers reduced by >80% the severity of NMO lesions in an ex vivo spinal cord slice culture model of NMO and in mice in vivo.

Endo-D also possesses transglycosylation activity with sugar oxazoline as the donor substrate, but the transglycosylation yield is low due to enzymatic hydrolysis of the donor substrate and the product. We report here our study on the hydrolytic and transglycosylation activity of recombinant Endo-D and its selected mutants. We found that Endo-D preferred core-fucosylated N-glycan for hydrolysis but favored nonfucosylated GlcNAc acceptor for transglycosylation. Several mutants showed significantly enhanced transglycosylation efficiency over the wild type enzyme. Two mutants (N322Q and N322A) were identified as typical glycosynthases that demonstrated remarkable transglycosylation activity with only marginal or no product hydrolysis activity. Kinetic studies revealed that the N322Q [corrected]and N322A glycosynthases had much higher catalytic efficiency for glycosylating the nonfucosylated GlcNAc acceptor. In comparison, the N322Q was much more efficient than N322A for transglycosylation. However, N322Q and N322A [corrected] could not take more complex N-glycan oxazoline as substrate for transglycosylation, indicating their strict substrate specificity. The usefulness of the N322Q glycosynthase was exemplified by its application for efficient glycosylation remodeling of IgG-Fc domain."
https://openalex.org/W2088120315,"Inactivation of HSP90 and HSP70 leads to loss of invasion in a variety of cancer cell types, presumably as a result of destabilization of, as yet, undefined clients of these molecular chaperones that influence this phenotype. The WASF3 gene has been shown to be up-regulated in high-grade tumors and its down-regulation leads to loss of invasion and metastasis. WASF3 phosphorylation by ABL kinase is essential for its ability to regulate invasion. Mass spectroscopy analysis now shows that HSP90 is present in the WASF3 immunocomplex from prostate cancer cells. Inactivation of HSP90 in these and other cell types does not affect WASF3 stability but prevents its phosphoactivation as a result of destabilization of ABL. HSP70 was also found in the WASF3 immunocomplex and inactivation of HSP70 results in destabilization of WASF3 through proteasome degradation. Knockdown of WASF3, HSP90, and HSP70 individually, all lead to loss of invasion but as knockdown of WASF3 in the presence of robust expression of HSP90/70 has the same effect, it seems that the influence these chaperone proteins have on invasion is mediated, at least in part, by their control over the critical invasion promoting capacity of the WASF3 protein. Overexpression of HSP70 in WASF3 null cells does not enhance invasion. These observations suggest that targeting HSP90/70 may have efficacy in reducing cancer cell invasion."

The nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4449 is surrounded by a neutral HI cloud complex with a variety of features including rings, shells and a counter-rotating core. This complexity is suggestive of interactions with another galaxy, possibly the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 125, at a distance of 40 kiloparsecs. But new observations of the region around NGC 4449 reveal a previously unknown companion, a tidally distorted smaller galaxy, named NGC 4449B. Its properties, such as its S-shaped morphology (resembling the Sagittarius dwarf near the Milky Way), suggest that it has had a close encounter with NGC 4449. NGC 4449 is a nearby Magellanic irregular starburst galaxy1 with a B-band absolute magnitude of −18 and a prominent, massive, intermediate-age nucleus2 at a distance from Earth of 3.8 megaparsecs (ref. 3). It is wreathed in an extraordinary neutral hydrogen (H i) complex, which includes rings, shells and a counter-rotating core, spanning ∼90 kiloparsecs (kpc; refs 1, 4). NGC 4449 is relatively isolated5, although an interaction with its nearest known companion—the galaxy DDO 125, some 40 kpc to the south—has been proposed as being responsible for the complexity of its H i structure6. Here we report the presence of a dwarf galaxy companion to NGC 4449, namely NGC 4449B. This companion has a V-band absolute magnitude of −13.4 and a half-light radius of 2.7 kpc, with a full extent of around 8 kpc. It is in a transient stage of tidal disruption, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf7 near the Milky Way. NGC 4449B exhibits a striking S-shaped morphology that has been predicted for disrupting galaxies7,8 but has hitherto been seen only in a dissolving globular cluster9. We also detect an additional arc or disk ripple embedded in a two-component stellar halo, including a component extending twice as far as previously known, to about 20 kpc from the galaxy’s centre."

However, little is known about the host factors that are involved in regulating the intracellular and cell surface transport of NA. Here we identified the Cdc42-specific GAP, ARHGAP21 differentially expressed in host cells infected with influenza A virus using cDNA microarray analysis. Furthermore, we have investigated the involvement of Rho family GTPases in NA transport to the cell surface. We found that expression of constitutively active or inactive mutants of RhoA or Rac1 did not significantly affect the amount of NA that reached the cell surface. However, expression of constitutively active Cdc42 or depletion of ARHGAP21 promoted the transport of NA to the plasma membranes. By contrast, cells expressing shRNA targeting Cdc42 or overexpressing ARHGAP21 exhibited a significant decrease in the amount of cell surface-localized NA. Importantly, silencing Cdc42 reduced influenza A virus replication, whereas silencing ARHGAP21 increased the virus replication. Together, our results reveal that ARHGAP21- and Cdc42-based signaling regulates the NA transport and thereby impacts virus replication.

https://openalex.org/W2164740289,"MUC1 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that is overexpressed in breast cancers. The present studies demonstrate that the oncogenic MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) associates with the TCF7L2 transcription factor. The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) binds directly to the TCF7L2 C-terminal region. MUC1-C blocks the interaction between TCF7L2 and the C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), a suppressor of TCF7L2-mediated transcription. TCF7L2 and MUC1-C form a complex on the cyclin D1 gene promoter and MUC1-C promotes TCF7L2-mediated transcription by the recruitment of β-catenin and p300. Silencing MUC1-C in human breast cancer cells down-regulated activation of the cyclin D1 promoter and decreased cyclin D1 expression. In addition, a MUC1-C inhibitor blocked the interaction with TCF7L2 and suppressed cyclin D1 levels. These findings indicate that the MUC1-C oncoprotein contributes to TCF7L2 activation and thereby promotes cyclin D1 expression in breast cancer cells."

It has been shown that APP can be processed in lipid rafts, and γ-secretase-associated proteins can affect Aβ production. Here, we use a biotinylated inhibitor for affinity purification of γ-secretase and associated proteins and mass spectrometry for identification of the purified proteins, and we identify novel γ-secretase-associated proteins in detergent-resistant membranes from brain. Furthermore, we show by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of gene expression that a subset of the γ-secretase-associated proteins, in particular voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and contactin-associated protein 1 (CNTNAP1), reduced Aβ production (Aβ40 and Aβ42) by around 70%, whereas knockdown of presenilin 1, one of the essential γ-secretase complex components, reduced Aβ production by 50%. Importantly, these proteins had a less pronounced effect on Notch processing.

https://openalex.org/W2085639715,"The conserved Paf1 complex localizes to the coding regions of genes and facilitates multiple processes during transcription elongation, including the regulation of histone modifications. However, the mechanisms that govern Paf1 complex recruitment to active genes are undefined. Here we describe a previously unrecognized domain within the Cdc73 subunit of the Paf1 complex, the Cdc73 C-domain, and demonstrate its importance for Paf1 complex occupancy on transcribed chromatin. Deletion of the C-domain causes phenotypes associated with elongation defects without an apparent loss of complex integrity. Simultaneous mutation of the C-domain and another subunit of the Paf1 complex, Rtf1, causes enhanced mutant phenotypes and loss of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation. The crystal structure of the C-domain reveals unexpected similarity to the Ras family of small GTPases. Instead of a deep nucleotide-binding pocket, the C-domain contains a large but comparatively flat surface of highly conserved residues, devoid of ligand. Deletion of the C-domain results in reduced chromatin association for multiple Paf1 complex subunits. We conclude that the Cdc73 C-domain probably constitutes a protein interaction surface that functions with Rtf1 in coupling the Paf1 complex to the RNA polymerase II elongation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2021130838,"HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene epigenetically silenced or deleted in many human cancers. HIC1 is involved in regulatory loops modulating p53- and E2F1-dependent cell survival, growth control, and stress responses. HIC1 is also essential for normal development because Hic1-deficient mice die perinatally and exhibit gross developmental defects throughout the second half of development. HIC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor with five C(2)H(2) zinc fingers mediating sequence-specific DNA binding and two repression domains: an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a central region recruiting CtBP and NuRD complexes. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the Polycomb-like protein hPCL3 as a novel co-repressor for HIC1. Using multiple biochemical strategies, we demonstrated that HIC1 interacts with hPCL3 and its paralog PHF1 to form a stable complex with the PRC2 members EZH2, EED, and Suz12. Confirming the implication of HIC1 in Polycomb recruitment, we showed that HIC1 shares some of its target genes with PRC2, including ATOH1. Depletion of HIC1 by siRNA interference leads to a partial displacement of EZH2 from the ATOH1 promoter. Furthermore, in vivo, ATOH1 repression by HIC1 is associated with Polycomb activity during mouse cerebellar development. Thus, our results identify HIC1 as the first transcription factor in mammals able to recruit PRC2 to some target promoters through its interaction with Polycomb-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035476180,"Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins are ""gatekeepers"" of epigenetic gene silencing that is mediated by lysine 9 of histone H3 methylation (H3K9me). Current knowledge supports a paradigm whereby HP1 proteins achieve repression by binding to H3K9me marks and interacting to H3K9 histone methyltransferases (HMTs), such as SUV39H1, which methylate this residue on adjacent nucleosomes thereby compacting chromatin and silencing gene expression. However, the mechanism underlying the recruitment of this epigenetic regulator to target gene promoters remains poorly characterized. In the current study, we reveal for the first time a mechanism whereby HP1 is recruited to promoters by a well characterized Krüppel-like transcription factor (KLF), in a sequence-specific manner, to mediate complex biological phenomena. A PXVXL HP1-interacting domain identified at position 487-491 of KLF11 mediates the binding of HP1α and KLF11 in vitro and in cultured cells. KLF11 also recruits HP1α and its histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1, to promoters to limit KLF11-mediated gene activation. Indeed, a KLF11ΔHP1 mutant derepresses KLF11-regulated cancer genes, by inhibiting HP1-SUV39H1 recruitment, decreasing H3K9me3, while increasing activation-associated marks. Biologically, impairment of KLF11-mediated HP1-HMT recruitment abolishes tumor suppression, providing direct evidence that HP1-HMTs act in a sequence-specific manner to achieve this function rather than its well characterized binding to methylated chromatin without intermediary. Collectively, these studies reveal a novel role for HP1 as a cofactor in tumor suppression, expand our mechanistic understanding of a KLF associated to human disease, and outline cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, increasing the specificity of targeting HP1-HMT complexes to gene promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2118320007,"The down-regulation or cellular depletion of protein kinase C (PKC) attendant to prolonged activation by phorbol esters is a widely described property of this key family of signaling enzymes. However, neither the mechanism of down-regulation nor whether this mechanism occurs following stimulation by physiological agonists is known. Here we show that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 provides a timer for the lifetime of conventional PKC isozymes, converting the enzymes into a species that can be dephosphorylated and ubiquitinated following activation induced by either phorbol esters or natural agonists. The regulation by Pin1 requires both the catalytic activity of the isomerase and the presence of a Pro immediately following the phosphorylated Thr of the turn motif phosphorylation site, one of two C-terminal sites that is phosphorylated during the maturation of PKC isozymes. Furthermore, the second C-terminal phosphorylation site, the hydrophobic motif, docks Pin1 to PKC. Our data are consistent with a model in which Pin1 binds the hydrophobic motif of conventional PKC isozymes to catalyze the isomerization of the phospho-Thr-Pro peptide bond at the turn motif, thus converting these PKC isozymes into species that can be efficiently down-regulated following activation."
https://openalex.org/W2054965736,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is an important mediator of cell migration, and aberrant signaling via this system promotes a number of malignancies including ovarian cancer. We have identified the cell surface glycoprotein CDCP1 as a key regulator of EGF/EGFR-induced cell migration. We show that signaling via EGF/EGFR induces migration of ovarian cancer Caov3 and OVCA420 cells with concomitant up-regulation of CDCP1 mRNA and protein. Consistent with a role in cell migration CDCP1 relocates from cell-cell junctions to punctate structures on filopodia after activation of EGFR. Significantly, disruption of CDCP1 either by silencing or the use of a function blocking antibody efficiently reduces EGF/EGFR-induced cell migration of Caov3 and OVCA420 cells. We also show that up-regulation of CDCP1 is inhibited by pharmacological agents blocking ERK but not Src signaling, indicating that the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is required downstream of EGF/EGFR to induce increased expression of CDCP1. Our immunohistochemical analysis of benign, primary, and metastatic serous epithelial ovarian tumors demonstrates that CDCP1 is expressed during progression of this cancer.

VHL loss in renal cell carcinoma leads to up-regulation of CUB domain-containing protein 1 to stimulate PKCδ-driven migration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study we used EGF/EGFR-responsive epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines to explore the role of CDCP1 in EGFR-induced cell migration. We demonstrate that CDCP1 mRNA expression is up-regulated by EGF/EGFR signaling via a pathway that involves the activity of ERK but not Src. We also show that antibody and shRNA-mediated disruption of CDCP1 efficiently block EGF/EGFR-induced cell migration. Our immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates that CDCP1 is expressed during ovarian cancer progression. Targeting of CDCP1 may be a rational approach to inhibit malignancies, such as ovarian cancer, that are driven by EGF/EGFR. Antibodies were from the following suppliers: rabbit polyclonal antibody against unspecified C-terminal residues of CDCP1 (#4115 used in Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses), rabbit anti-pEGFR-Tyr-1068, mouse anti-EGFR, rabbit anti-pSrc-Tyr-416, mouse anti-Src, mouse anti-pMAPK/p44/42 (pERK1/2-Tyr-202/204), and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Quantum Scientific, Murarrie, Australia); monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody and anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) from Sigma; monoclonal anti-E-cadherin and anti-N-cadherin antibodies and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Invitrogen); IRDye 680- or 800-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE); anti-CDCP1 monoclonal antibody 10D7 (used for confocal microscopy analysis and cell migration assays) was previously described (36Deryugina E.I.

Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were from Invitrogen, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Sciences. EGFR antagonist AG1478, SFK selective inhibitor SU6656, and ERK inhibitor U0126 were from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma except where noted. The ovarian cancer cell lines OV90, Caov3, and SKOV-3 and a normal fibroblast cell line NFF1 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). PEO1, PEO4, PEO14, and OAW42 epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines were described previously (40Dong Y. Kaushal A. Bui L. Chu S. Fuller P.J. Nicklin J. Samaratunga H. Clements J.A.

All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml) except for OVMZ-6 cells, which were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), 2 mm sodium pyruvate and 2 mm l-glutamine (42Fischer K.

For treatments with pharmacological agents, cells were cultured until 60% confluent then washed twice with PBS before growth in serum-free media for 24 h before treatment with 0.1% DMSO, 0.1% DMSO with EGF (30 ng/ml), or 0.1% DMSO with EGF (30 ng/ml) and AG1478 (20 μm), SU6656 (10 μm), or U0126 (10 μm) for 0.2 and 24 h. For antibody treatments, cells were cultured as above followed by treatment with control IgG (20 μg/ml), EGF (30 ng/ml) and control IgG, or EGF (30 ng/ml) and CDCP1 function blocking antibody 10D7 (20 μg/ml). Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (43Dong Y. Tan O.L. Loessner D. Stephens C. Walpole C. Boyle G.M. Parsons P.G. Clements J.A. Kallikrein-related peptidase 7 promotes multicellular aggregation via the α5β1 integrin pathway and paclitaxel chemoresistance in serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2624-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by treatment with DNase I (Invitrogen), and 2 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed using a Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative-RT-PCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene cycler (Qiagen, Doncaster, Australia) with CDCP1-specific primers 5′-AATCTACGTGGTTGACTTGAGTAA-3′ and 5′-CCACATTCATCCACAGACG-3′ incorporating SYBR Green (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). CDCP1 expression was normalized to HPRT1 (primers: forward (5′- TGAACGTCTTGCTCGAGATGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCAGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAATTT-3′)). The ΔCT method (44He Y. Wortmann A. Burke L.J. Reid J.C.

Whole cell lysates were collected in a buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (1×), 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), NaCl (150 mm), and CHAPS (1%). Protein concentration was determined by a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific). Cell lysates (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR® Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated with secondary IRDye 680- or 800-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG as appropriate. Images were generated, and densitometry analysis was performed using the Odyssey system and software (LI-COR Biosciences). Bright field images were captured using a phase contrast microscope and a digital camera (10× objective, Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, Nikon, Japan) and V++ software. Time lapse images were captured every 15 min up to 24 h using a Leica AF-1600 wide-field microscope and system software (Leica Microsystems, Sydney, Australia). Cell scattering was measured as the distance between cell nuclei in three independent experiments using InDesign software (Adobe, Adobe Systems Pty Ltd, Chatswood, Australia). For cells silenced for CDCP1, measurements were performed from images acquired from the Nikon Eclipse system on 200 pairs of cells from 10 randomly selected fields per treatment group. For cells treated with anti-CDCP1 antibody 10D7 or control IgG, measurements were performed from time lapse images acquired on the Leica AF-1600 system on at least 80 individual randomly selected cells per treatment group. Cells were grown in serum-containing media on sterile coverslips until 60% confluent. The cells were then grown in serum-free media for a further 24 h then either left untreated or treated with EGF (30 ng/ml) for 24 h. After washes with PBS, cells were fixed (4% (w/v) with paraformaldehyde in PBS), permeabilized (0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS), and blocked (5% (w/v) BSA in PBS) then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-CDCP1 antibody 10D7 (dilution 1:200 (v/v) in 1% BSA/PBS) at room temperature for 2 h. After washes, cells were incubated with a mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin, and DAPI. Images were acquired using a Leica-TCS SP5 confocal microscope (63 × oil immersion objective lens). CDCP1 expression was suppressed as previously described (45Wortmann A. He Y. Christensen M.E.

Briefly, to generate lentivirus, a CDCP1 pLKO.1 lentiviral shRNA knock-down construct (OpenBiosystems, Millennium Science, Surrey Hills, Australia) or a control scramble shRNA construct (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) was transfected into HEK293T cells together with packaging plasmids (pCMV-VSVG and pCMV-dR8.2-dvpr) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Filtered conditioned media was used to sequentially infect target cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide. Polyclonal pools of stably infected cells were selected in puromycin (2 μg/ml) containing medium for 1 week. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 μm) were from benign serous adenomas (n = 3), primary serous tumors (n = 3), and serous metastases (n = 3). The source of these tissues was described previously (43Dong Y. Tan O.L. Loessner D. Stephens C. Walpole C. Boyle G.M. Parsons P.G. Clements J.A.

Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (40Dong Y. Kaushal A. Bui L. Chu S. Fuller P.J. Nicklin J. Samaratunga H. Clements J.A. Human kallikrein 4 (KLK4) is highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas.Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2363-2371PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated followed by antigen retrieval with microwave heat treatment in 10 mm citric acid (pH 6.0). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-CDCP1-C-terminal antibody (1:100 in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS) or rabbit IgG as the negative control (Dako, Campbellfield, Australia). Signal was detected using the EnVisionTM peroxidase system (Dako), and sections were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin. Staining was visualized using an Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus, Japan) and photographed with a Qimaging digital camera (MicroPublisher 3.3RTV) and associated software (QCapture Pro 6.0, Burnaby BC, Canada). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and displayed using CorelDraw14 (Corel Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia). One-tailed Student's t tests were performed for statistical analysis. p values with a 95% confidence interval were obtained from at least three independent experiments using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered to be significant. To identify cell lines suitable for examination of the role of CDCP1 in EGF/EGFR-mediated cell migration, we first analyzed the expression of CDCP1 in 10 epithelial ovarian cancer-derived cell lines. Anti-CDCP1 Western blot analysis was performed on lysates from cells cultured in serum-containing media. CDCP1 is produced as a 135-kDa cell surface protein (28Hooper J.D. Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T.

Binding of P to nucleocapsid is mediated by the X domain of P (XD) and a conserved sequence (Box-2) within the C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL).

The current work directly assessed the relationships among XD-induced NTAIL folding, XD-NTAIL binding affinity, and polymerase activity. Amino acid substitutions that abolished XD-induced NTAIL α-helical folding were created within Box-2 of Edmonston MeV NTAIL. Polymerase activity in minireplicons was maintained despite a 35-fold decrease in XD-NTAIL binding affinity or reduction/loss of XD-induced NTAIL alpha-helical folding. Recombinant infectious virus was recovered for all mutants, and transcriptase elongation rates remained within a 1.7-fold range of parent virus. Box-2 mutations did however impose a significant cost to infectivity, reflected in an increase in the amount of input genome required to match the infectivity of parent virus. Diminished infectivity could not be attributed to changes in virion protein composition or production of defective interfering particles, where changes from parent virus were within a 3-fold range. The results indicated that MeV polymerase activity, but not infectivity, tolerates amino acid changes in the XD-binding region of the nucleoprotein. Selectional pressure for conservation of the Box-2 sequence may thus reflect a role in assuring the fidelity of polymerase functions or the assembly of viral particles required for optimal infectivity.

Mononegavirales are nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses that share a complex and unique mode of transcription and replication (1Ruigrok R.W. Crépin T. Kolakofsky D.

Virions are enveloped, and the single strand of genomic RNA is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). For MeV, the envelope contains hemagglutinin (H) and a fusion glycoprotein (F) that mediates tissue targeting and MeV entry (3Mühlebach M.D. Mateo M. Sinn P.L. Prüfer S. Uhlig K.M. Leonard V.H.

Measles virus receptors.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 329: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar). This process is coordinated by the matrix (M) protein, which also mediates packaging of nucleocapsid into virions by interacting with both glycoprotein tails and nucleoprotein (6Gerlier D. Valentin H. Measles virus interaction with host cells and impact on innate immunity.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 329: 163-191PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleocapsids are filamentous, consisting of genomic RNA encapsidated into a regular helical array of N monomers. The structure of MeV N has been modeled (7Desfosses A. Goret G. Farias Estrozi L. Ruigrok R.W. Gutsche I. Nucleoprotein-RNA orientation in the measles virus nucleocapsid by three-dimensional electron microscopy.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) into the electron density of MeV nucleocapsids, using the crystal structure of the N protein from the respiratory syncytial virus as template (8Tawar R.G. Duquerroy S. Vonrhein C. Varela P.F. Damier-Piolle L. Castagné N. MacLellan K. Bedouelle H. Bricogne G. Bhella D. Eléouët J.F. Rey F.A. Crystal structure of a nucleocapsid-like nucleoprotein-RNA complex of respiratory syncytial virus.Science. 2009; 326: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This ribonucleoprotein complex, rather than naked RNA, is the template for both transcription and replication. These latter activities are carried out by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is composed of the large (L) protein and of the phosphoprotein (P). Once the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes are released into the cytoplasm of infected cells, the transcription of viral genes occurs using endogenous NTPs as substrate. Following primary transcription, the polymerase switches to a processive mode and ignores the gene junctions to synthesize a full, complementary strand of genome length. This positive-stranded RNA (antigenome) does not serve as a template for transcription; its unique role is to provide an intermediate in genome replication. The intracellular concentration of the N protein is the main element controlling the relative level of transcription versus replication (9Plumet S. Duprex W.P. Gerlier D. Dynamics of viral RNA synthesis during measles virus infection.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When N is limiting, the polymerase functions preferentially as a transcriptase, thus leading to an increase in the intracellular concentration of viral proteins including N. When N levels are high enough to allow encapsidation of the nascent RNA chain, the polymerase functions preferentially as a replicase (see Refs. 10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D.

The L protein does not directly bind viral genomic RNA during transcription and genome replication but instead is tethered onto the viral ribonucleoprotein template via oligomers of P. As such, the P protein is an essential polymerase co-factor. The exact oligomeric state of MeV P is not known. By analogy with the closely related Sendai virus (13Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ebel C.

Previously, we have shown that genetic ablation of Jup in cardiomyocytes in mice leads to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy similar to Naxos disease in humans. Currently, to determine the pathogenesis of Naxos disease-associated keratoderma, we generated Jup mutant mice by inactivating Jup restrictively in keratinocytes. Jup mutant mice largely recapitulated the clinical features of human palmoplantar keratoderma: overcornification and thickening of the epidermis. Jup mutant mice also suffered skin ulceration and inflammation. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were significantly elevated in Jup mutant epidermis. Ultrastructural analyses revealed the disruption of the assembly of desmosomes and adherens junctions in Jup mutant epidermis. We also demonstrated the compensational increase in β-catenin at Jup mutant cell-cell junctions without altering its signaling activities. Our findings provide important insights for understanding the pathogenesis of human palmoplantar keratoderma."

Because of the importance of PAR4 activation on platelets in humans and mice and emerging roles for PAR4 in other tissues, experiments were done to characterize the interaction between PAR4 homodimers. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) were used to examine the PAR4 homodimer interface. In bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments, PAR4 formed homodimers that were disrupted by unlabeled PAR4 in a concentration-dependent manner, but not by rhodopsin. In BRET experiments, the PAR4 homodimers showed a specific interaction as indicated by a hyperbolic BRET signal in response to increasing PAR4-GFP expression. PAR4 did not interact with rhodopsin in BRET assays. The threshold maximum BRET signal was disrupted in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled PAR4. In contrast, rhodopsin was unable to disrupt the BRET signal, indicating that the disruption of the PAR4 homodimer is not due to nonspecific interactions. A panel of rho-PAR4 chimeras and PAR4 point mutants has mapped the dimer interface to hydrophobic residues in transmembrane helix 4. Finally, mutations that disrupted dimer formation had reduced calcium mobilization in response to the PAR4 agonist peptide. These results link the loss of dimer formation to a loss of PAR4 signaling."

Because it is essential, mAGP is also regarded as a target for several antitubercular drugs. Herein, we demonstrate that exposure of Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin or Mycobacterium marinum to thiacetazone, a second line antitubercular drug, is associated with a severe decrease in the level of a major apolar glycolipid. This inhibition requires MmaA4, a methyltransferase reported to participate in the activation process of thiacetazone. Following purification, this glycolipid was subjected to detailed structural analyses, combining gas-liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

https://openalex.org/W1976589764,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) require transcriptional regulation to ensure rapid proliferation that allows for self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanism by which transcriptional factors regulate this rapid proliferation remains largely unknown. Here we present data showing that CIBZ, a BTB domain zinc finger transcriptional factor, is a key transcriptional regulator for regulation of ESC proliferation. Here we show that deletion or siRNA knockdown of CIBZ inhibits ESC proliferation. Cell cycle analysis shows that loss of CIBZ delays the progression of ESCs through the G1 to S phase transition. Conversely, constitutive ectopic expression of exogenous CIBZ in ESCs promotes proliferation and accelerates G1/S transition. These findings suggest that regulation of the G1/S transition explains, in part, CIBZ-associated ESC proliferation. Our data suggest that CIBZ acts through the post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of Nanog, a positive regulator of ESC proliferation and G1/S transition, but does not affect Oct3/4 and Sox2 protein expression. Notably, constitutive overexpression of Nanog partially rescued the proliferation defect caused by CIBZ knockdown, indicating the role of CIBZ in ESC proliferation and G1/S transition at least in part depends on the Nanog protein level."
https://openalex.org/W2124614974,"Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP14) is a zinc-dependent type I transmembrane metalloproteinase playing pivotal roles in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis and cellular migration. Elevated expression levels of MT1-MMP have been demonstrated to correlate with a poor prognosis in cancer. MT1-MMP has a short intracellular domain (ICD) that has been shown to play important roles in cellular migration and invasion, although these ICD-mediated mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that MT1-MMP is mono-ubiquitinated at its unique lysine residue (Lys(581)) within the ICD. Our data suggest that this post-translational modification is involved in MT1-MMP trafficking as well as in modulating cellular invasion through type I collagen matrices. By using an MT1-MMP Y573A mutant or the Src family inhibitor PP2, we observed that the previously described Src-dependent MT1-MMP phosphorylation is a prerequisite for ubiquitination. Taken together, these findings show for the first time an additional post-translational modification of MT1-MMP that regulates its trafficking and cellular invasion, which further emphasizes the key role of the MT1-MMP ICD."
https://openalex.org/W2050618043,"Adult organ-specific stem cells are essential for organ homeostasis and tissue repair and regeneration. The formation of such stem cells during vertebrate development is poorly understood. Intestinal remodeling during thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent Xenopus metamorphosis resembles postembryonic intestinal maturation in mammals. During metamorphosis, the intestine is remodeled de novo via a yet unknown mechanism. Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is up-regulated in and required for adult intestinal stem cells during metamorphosis. PRMT1 up-regulation is the earliest known molecular event for the developing stem cells and is also conserved during zebrafish and mouse intestinal development. To analyze how PRMT1 is specifically up-regulated during the formation of the adult intestinal stem cells, we cloned the Xenopus PRMT1 promoter and characterized it in CaCo-2 cells, a human cell line with intestinal stem cell characteristics. Through a series deletion and mutational analyses, we showed that the stem cell-associated transcription factor c-Myc could bind to a conserved site in the first intron to activate the promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that during metamorphosis, both c-Myc and PRMT1 were highly up-regulated, specifically in the remodeling intestine but not the resorbing tail, and that c-Myc was induced by T3 prior to PRMT1 up-regulation. In addition, we showed that T3 directly activated the c-Myc gene during metamorphosis in the intestine via binding of the T3 receptor to the c-Myc promoter. These results suggest that T3 induces c-Myc transcription directly in the intestine, that c-Myc, in turn, activates PRMT1 expression, and that this is an important gene regulation cascade controlling intestinal stem cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1970080065,"Cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond that connects the nucleobase to the backbone in DNA leads to abasic sites, the most frequent lesion under physiological conditions. Several DNA polymerases preferentially incorporate an A opposite this lesion, a phenomenon termed ""A-rule."" Accordingly, KlenTaq, the large fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I, incorporates a nucleotide opposite an abasic site with efficiencies of A > G > T > C. Here we provide structural insights into constraints of the active site during nucleotide selection opposite an abasic site. It appears that these confines govern the nucleotide selection mainly by interaction of the incoming nucleotide with Tyr-671. Depending on the nucleobase, the nucleotides are differently positioned opposite Tyr-671 resulting in different alignments of the functional groups that are required for bond formation. The distances between the α-phosphate and the 3'-primer terminus increases in the order A < G < T, which follows the order of incorporation efficiency. Additionally, a binary KlenTaq structure bound to DNA containing an abasic site indicates that binding of the nucleotide triggers a remarkable rearrangement of enzyme and DNA template. The ability to resolve the stacking arrangement might be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the respective nucleotide contributing to nucleotide selection. Furthermore, we studied the incorporation of a non-natural nucleotide opposite an abasic site. The nucleotide was often used in studying stacking effects in DNA polymerization. Here, no interaction with Tyr-761 as found for the natural nucleotides is observed, indicating a different reaction path for this non-natural nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2020123502,"Nucleostemin (NS) is a nucleolar GTP-binding protein essential for ribosomal biogenesis, proliferation, and animal embryogenesis. It remains largely unclear how this protein is regulated. While working on its role in suppression of MDM2 and activation of p53, we observed that NS protein (but not mRNA) levels decreased drastically in response to GTP depletion. When trying to further elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this unusual phenomenon, we found that NS was degraded independently of ubiquitin and MDM2 upon GTP depletion. First, depletion of GTP by treating cells with mycophenolic acid decreased the level of NS without apparently affecting the levels of other nucleolar proteins. Second, mutant NS defective in GTP binding and exported to the nucleoplasm was much less stable than wild-type NS. Although NS was ubiquitinated in cells, its polyubiquitination was independent of Lys-48 or Lys-63 in the ubiquitin molecule. Inactivation of E1 in E1 temperature-sensitive mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells failed to prevent the proteasomal degradation of NS. The proteasomal turnover of NS was also MDM2-independent, as its half-life in p53/MDM2 double knock-out MEF cells was the same as that in wild-type MEF cells. Moreover, NS ubiquitination was MDM2-independent. Mycophenolic acid or doxorubicin induced NS degradation in various human cancerous cells regardless of the status of MDM2. Hence, these results indicate that NS undergoes a ubiquitin- and MDM2-independent proteasomal degradation when intracellular GTP levels are markedly reduced and also suggest that ubiquitination of NS may be involved in regulation of its function rather than stability."
https://openalex.org/W2168110694,"Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer development in lifelong nonsmokers; however, the mechanistic involvement of SHS in the genesis of this malignancy remains elusive. The present study is the first comprehensive investigation of SHS mutagenicity in vivo, in which we have established the mutagenic effects of SHS in transgenic Big Blue mice, and subsequently found correlations between our experimental findings and those obtained from our analysis of the largest database of mutations in human TP53, which is the most frequently mutated gene in human lung cancer. We demonstrate that whole-body SHS exposure of mice for 5 h/d, 5 d/wk for a duration of 2 or 4 mo elicits a significant mutagenic response in the lung, trachea, and bladder of exposed animals, as reflected by the elevation of background cII mutant frequency in the respective organs. The organ-specific mutagenicity of SHS is most pronounced in the lung and remains persistent both in the lung and bladder of SHS-exposed animals after a 1-mo recovery in clean air. The induced cII mutagenesis in the lung of SHS-exposed mice perfectly recapitulates our analysis of the TP53 mutations in human lung cancer in nonsmokers. Remarkably, the relative frequencies of all types of mutations in the TP53 gene of nonsmokers' lung tumors and in the cII transgene of lung cellular DNA from SHS-exposed mice are indistinguishable from one another. We provide the first verification of a mechanistic mode of action for SHS of relevance for carcinogenesis and the first experimental evidence linking SHS exposure to lung cancer in nonsmokers.—Kim, S.-I., Yoon, J.-I., Tommasi, S., Besaratinia, A.

These organisms do not have glutathione and instead utilize the small molecule mycothiol (MSH) as their primary reducing agent and for the detoxification of xenobiotics. Due to these important functions, enzymes involved in MSH biosynthesis and MSH-dependent detoxification are targets for drug development. The metal-dependent deacetylase N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase (MshB) catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside to form 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside and acetate in MSH biosynthesis. Herein we examine the chemical mechanism of MshB. We demonstrate that the side chains of Asp-15, Tyr-142, His-144, and Asp-146 are important for catalytic activity. We show that NaF is an uncompetitive inhibitor of MshB, consistent with a metal-water/hydroxide functioning as the reactive nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism. We have previously shown that MshB activity has a bell-shaped dependence on pH with pKa values of ∼7.3 and 10.5 (Huang, X., Kocabas, E. and Hernick, M. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 20275–20282). Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the observed pKa values reflect ionization of Asp-15 and Tyr-142, respectively. Together, findings from our studies suggest that MshB functions through a general acid-base pair mechanism with the side chain of Asp-15 functioning as the general base catalyst and His-144 serving as the general acid catalyst, whereas the side chain of Tyr-142 probably assists in polarizing substrate/stabilizing the oxyanion intermediate. Additionally, our results indicate that Tyr-142 is a dynamic side chain that plays key roles in catalysis, modulating substrate binding, chemistry, and product release.

Because inhibitors of metalloenzymes typically contain a group that binds to the catalytic metal ion, we previously examined the cofactor preferences of MshB and found that MshB is a cambialistic metalloenzyme whose in vitro activity follows the following trend: Fe2+ > Co2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ > Ni2+ (14Huang X. Kocabas E. Hernick M. The activity and cofactor preferences of N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase (MshB) change depending on environmental conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 20275-20282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that the cofactor bound to MshB is dependent on environmental conditions (14Huang X. Kocabas E. Hernick M. The activity and cofactor preferences of N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase (MshB) change depending on environmental conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 20275-20282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MshB prefers Fe2+ under anaerobic conditions regardless of the metal ion content of the medium and switches between Fe2+ and Zn2+ under aerobic conditions as the metal content of the medium is altered. MshB has a bell-shaped dependence on pH (subsaturating concentrations of substrate, V/K), indicating that there are two ionizations that are important for maximal catalytic activity (14Huang X. Kocabas E. Hernick M. The activity and cofactor preferences of N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase (MshB) change depending on environmental conditions.J. Biol.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2010: 547-581Crossref Google Scholar). Herein we probe the chemical mechanism of MshB. We demonstrate that residues Asp-15, His-144, Asp-146, and Tyr-142 are important for maximal catalytic activity. Our results suggest that Asp-15 functions as a general base catalyst (GBC), whereas His-144 functions as a general acid catalyst (GAC), and the catalytic metal-water/hydroxide serves as the reactive nucleophile in the reaction. Furthermore, our results indicate that Tyr-142 is important for catalytic activity. We propose that Tyr-142 is a dynamic side chain that modulates substrate binding, chemistry (via polarization of carbonyl group/stabilization of oxyanion), and product release. These insights into the chemical mechanism indicate that MshB does not follow the prototypical metalloprotease-like mechanism but instead uses a GABC pair and a dynamics to catalyze the hydrolysis of substrate. All solutions were prepared using milliQ water. Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Genomic DNA was purchased from ATCC. DNA sequencing was performed at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute DNA Sequencing Facility (Virginia Tech). All chemicals were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific, Sigma-Aldrich, and Gold Biotechnology. For kinetic experiments, solutions were prepared with reagents that did not contain extraneous metal ions and/or were treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad), and solutions were stored in “metal-free” plasticware. To maintain anaerobic conditions (Fe2+ assays), experiments were carried out in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI). Molecular graphics images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package (22Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera.

Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (18,000 rpm, 4 °C) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (Buffer A; 30 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine or TCEP, 0.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) Co-IMAC column (50 ml of chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare) charged with CoCl2). The column was washed with 150 ml of Buffer A, and His-MBP-MshB was eluted using an imidazole step gradient (200 ml each: Buffer A + 10 mm imidazole, Buffer A + 25 mm imidazole, Buffer A + 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing His-MBP-MshB (via SDS-PAGE) were combined, concentrated (Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal devices, Millipore), and dialyzed (Snakeskin tubing, molecular weight cut-off 10,000; Pierce) versus 2 × 4 liters of Buffer A overnight in the presence of His-TEV protease (300 μg/ml) to remove the His-MBP tag. The resulting TEV-cleaved protein was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (Buffer A + 25 mm imidazole) Co-IMAC column. His-MBP and His-TEV remain bound to the Co-IMAC column, whereas MshB elutes in the flow-through. Fractions containing MshB (via 12% SDS-PAGE) were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed versus 2 × 4 liters of 25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine, pH 7.5 (Slide-a-Lyzer, molecular weight cut-off 10,000; Pierce). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Sigma). Protein aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For the preparation of apo-MshB (14Huang X.

After 1 h, the protein solution was concentrated; washed (diluted with buffer and then concentrated) with 3 × 15 ml of 25 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine, pH 7.5; and run over a desalting column to remove residual dipicolinic acid/EDTA. Metal ion concentrations were determined using an ICS-3000 ion chromatography system (Dionex). Apo-MshB samples contained ≤10% metal/protein. Prior to activity measurements, apo-MshB (≤10 μm) was incubated with a stoichiometric concentration of the desired metal ion (CoCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3, MnCl2, NiCl2, ZnSO4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. MshB deacetylase activity was measured with the substrate N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) (Sigma) using a fluorescamine-based assay (23Huang X. Hernick M. A fluorescence-based assay for measuring N-acetyl-1-d-myo-inosityl-2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase activity.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 414: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the GlcNAc substrate has a decreased affinity for MshB compared with the natural substrate GlcNAc-Ins (Km of 38 mm versus 340 μm), the GlcNAc moiety that undergoes the chemical transformation is conserved (12Newton G.L.

Because our primary interest is in examining the chemical step of the reaction, the commercially available GlcNAc substrate was used in these studies. In general, assay mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine or TCEP, pH 7.5, and 0–150 mm GlcNAc were pre-equilibrated at 30 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (1 μm). For pH dependence experiments, the following buffers were used (all 50 mm containing 1 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine, 50 mm NaCl): MES, pH 6–6.8; Mops, pH 6.5–7.5; HEPES, pH 7.3–8.8; Bistris propane, pH 8–9; borate, pH 9–10; carbonate, pH 10–11. After incubation for various times, reactions aliquots (30 μl) were quenched by the addition of 20% TCA (10 μl), and the cleared supernatant (25 μl) was transferred into a 96-well plate, diluted with 1 m borate, pH 9 (75 μl), and reacted with fluorescamine (30 μl in CH3CN; Invitrogen). After 10 min, the fluorescence was measured (excitation 395 nm; emission 485 nm) using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Initial rates of product formation (<10%) were determined from these data. Equation 1 was fit to the pH rate profile, where k1 represents V/K at the pH optimum, and Ka1 and Ka2 represent dissociation constants describing the two ionizations. Equations 2 and 3 were fit to the pH rate profiles for the D15A and Y142A/F mutants, respectively, in which only a single ionization is observed. For experiments under V/K conditions, 5–50 mm GlcNAc was used as the substrate in assays. Specific concentrations of substrate used were 5 (WT, Y142F), 10 (Y142A), 20 (D15A and H144A), or 50 mm (D146A) GlcNAc.V/Kobs=k1(1+[H+]Ka1+ka2[H+])(Eq. 1) V/Kobs=k1(1+ka2[H+])(Eq. 2) V/Kobs=k1(1+[H+]Ka1)(Eq. 3) For determination of the steady-state parameters, deacetylase activity was measured at 6–8 different concentrations of GlcNAc (0–300 mm), and the parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were obtained by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial linear velocities using the curve-fitting program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software), which also calculates the asymptotic S.E. values. For D146A, higher concentrations of GlcNAc (0–375 mm) were used. Solvent viscosity assays were carried out using the microviscogens sucrose (0–35% (w/v)) and glycerol (0–35% (w/v)) and the macroviscogen Ficoll 400 (0–10% (w/v)) with a subsaturating concentration (5 mm) or saturating concentration (100 mm) of GlcNAc.

Fluoride inhibition studies were carried out with 0–200 mm NaF added to the assay mixture. There was no effect on MshB activity observed in control experiments using an additional 200 mm NaCl in the assay mixture (supplemental Fig. S2). For solvent isotope effect experiments, initial rates at subsaturating substrate concentrations (5 (WT, Y142F), 10 (Y142A), 20 (D15A, H144A), or 50 mm (D146A) GlcNAc) in H2O were compared with the initial rates in ∼95% D2O.

Biol. 2002; 12: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). This library contains six possible Tyr rotamers that are commonly observed in proteins. A model of MshB with Tyr-142 positioned for a possible role in chemistry was prepared using Chimera by rotating Tyr-142 into the location of a Tyr rotamer in the Dunbrack library. The crystal structure of Zn2+-MshB (Fig. 1B) reveals a zinc ion in the active site bound by the side chains of three protein ligands (His-13, Asp-16, and His-147) and one to two water molecules that is surrounded by side chains typically involved in acid-base catalysis and/or stabilization of oxyanion intermediates (Asp-15, His-144, and Asp-146). Importantly, this structure reveals two potential acid-base catalysts that are in close proximity to the zinc-bound water molecules, Asp-15 and His-144; Asp-15 is located ∼2.8 Å from one zinc-bound water molecule, whereas His-144 is ∼3.4 Å away from the second zinc-bound water molecule. As a result of their close proximity to the catalytic zinc ion, these side chains are best positioned to serve as GBC/GAC in the chemical reaction. Crystal structures of a MshB·β-octyl-d-glucopyranoside (BOG) complex, which lack the catalytic metal ion (Fig. 1C), also indicate that these side chains are well positioned to interact with the substrate GlcNAc moiety (16McCarthy A.A. Peterson N.A. Knijff R. Baker E.N. Crystal structure of MshB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a deacetylase involved in mycothiol biosynthesis.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, the side chain of Asp-146 is located near His-13 and His-144 (2.9–3.6 Å), suggesting a potential role for Asp-146 in catalysis. On the basis of the crystal structure of the Zn2+-MshB active site (15Maynes J.T. Garen C. Cherney M.M. Newton G. Arad D. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. James M.N.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2010: 547-581Crossref Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possible mechanisms, we used a combination of mutagenesis and kinetic experiments. We prepared a series of MshB constructs wherein active site side chains (Asp-15, His-144, and Asp-146) were mutated to Ala using site-directed mutagenesis, and the steady-state parameters for these constructs were determined using the substrate GlcNAc (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3). Results from these experiments indicate that removal of the Asp-15, His-144, and Asp-146 side chains lead to an overall decrease in catalytic activity, suggesting that these side chains are important for maximal catalytic activity. Specifically, the D15A mutation leads to a modest (<2-fold) increase in Km, an ∼80-fold decrease in kcat, and a 222-fold decrease in kcat/Km. The H144A mutation leads to a modest increase in the value of Km to ∼50 mm but decreases the values of kcat and kcat/Km 60- and 100-fold, respectively. The D146A mutant could not be saturated with [GlcNAc] of 375 mm; therefore, the steady-state parameters for this mutant are estimated values. The D146A mutation results in a >10-fold increase in Km and >100-fold decrease in kcat/Km.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of MshB mutantsMshBaApo-MshB was incubated with stoichiometric Zn2+ for 30 min prior to activity measurement.,bSubstrate used GlcNAc.Kmkcatkcat/KmWT activitymmmin−1m−1 s−1%WTcData adapted from Ref. 14.38 ± 446 ± 220 ± 1D15A52 ± 110."
https://openalex.org/W2144012535,"The small G protein Ras regulates many cell processes, such as gene expression, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. Its mutations are associated with one-third of all cancers. Ras functions are mediated, at least in part, by Ral proteins and their downstream effector the Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1). RalBP1 is involved in endocytosis and in regulating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. It also regulates early development since it is required for the completion of gastrulation in Xenopus laevis. RalBP1 has also been reported to be the main transporter of glutathione electrophiles, and it is involved in multidrug resistance. Such a variety of functions could be explained by a differential regulation of RalBP1 localization. In this study, we have detected endogenous RalBP1 in the nucleus of interphasic cells. This nuclear targeting is mediated by nuclear localization sequences that map to the N-terminal third of the protein. Moreover, in X. laevis embryos, a C-terminal coiled-coil sequence mediates RalBP1 retention in the nucleus. We have also observed RalBP1 at the level of the actin cytoskeleton, a localization that depends on interaction of the protein with active Ral. During mitosis RalBP1 also associates with the mitotic spindle and the centrosome, a localization that could be negatively regulated by active Ral. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of post-transcriptional and post-translational isoforms of RalBP1 lacking the Ral-binding domain, which opens new possibilities for the existence of Ral-independent functions.—Fillatre, J., Delacour, D., Van Hove, L., Bagarre, T., Houssin, N., Soulika, M., Veitia, R.

Those other than the muscle-type (embryonic α1β1γδ- or adult α1β1γϵ-) nAChR are thought to be composed of different permutations of eight α subunits (α2-α7, α9-α10) and three β subunits (β2-β4) in humans (1Lukas R.J.

We hypothesized that similar mutations in nAChR α6 subunits would increase agonist sensitivity and efficacy of α6(L9′S or V13′S)(β4 or β2)*-nAChR to provide enough functional gain to facilitate evaluation of effects of wild-type β3 subunits on complexes and even to ensure that we can detect incorporation of wild-type β3 subunits into α6(L9′S or V13′S)*-nAChR. We also hypothesized that wild-type β3 subunits would have the same effects, dominant-negative or potentiating, depending on the subunit combination investigated, on gain-of-function α6(L9′S or V13′S)*-nAChR as they did on wild-type α6*-nAChR. This would help us assess whether any reduction or abolishment of function is due to altered open channel probability (21Broadbent S. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Krashia P.A. Harkness P.C. Millar N.S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Incorporation of the β3 subunit has a dominant-negative effect on the function of recombinant central-type neuronal nicotinic receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or due to reduced surface expression of nAChR because β3 subunit incorporation facilitates formation of dead end intermediates (23Kuryatov A. Onksen J. Lindstrom J. Roles of accessory subunits in α4β2* nicotinic receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that whenever nAChR β3 subunits are incorporated into (α6 or hα6(N143D+M145V))(L9′S or V13′S)*-nAChR, function is potentiated (i.e. there is higher agonist potency and larger magnitude responses) irrespective of whether there are dominant-negative or potentiating effects of β3 subunits on wild-type α6*-nAChR.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have investigated how nAChR β3 subunits might incorporate as accessory partners into nAChR subtypes, specifically into α6*-nAChR (4Dash B.

To further understand how β3 subunits might incorporate into α6*-nAChR, we exploited the gain-of-function/reporter mutant strategy (4Dash B. Bhakta M. Chang Y. Lukas R.J.

This approach allows us to focus on cell surface, functional receptors without complications due to ambiguities of protein chemical or immunochemical studies confounded by the prevalent expression of intracellular and perhaps partially assembled receptor complexes and the unreliable quality and/or availability of most anti-nAChR antibodies for use in immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblot studies (15Dash B.

Identification of N-terminal extracellular domain determinants in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α6 subunits that influence effects of wild-type or mutant β3 subunits on function of α6β2*- or α6β4*-nAChR.J.

However, with the exception of the insignificant difference in the magnitude of function seen for all-mouse mα6L9′Smβ4- and mα6mβ4-nAChR, the increase in function upon expression with the α6 subunit 9′ mutants is remarkable because of the lack of reliable function for wild-type, all human hα6hβ4-, or hybrid mα6hβ4-nAChR. The little-if-any function for all-wild-type α6β4-nAChR complicates quantitative assessment of effects of α6 subunit gain-of-function mutations on agonist potency, although qualitatively, nicotine EC50 values are over 10 μm for α6β4-nAChR and never higher than 3.1 μm for α6(L9′S or V13′S)β4-nAChR. However, gain-of-function effects manifest as increases in agonist potency and in peak current magnitudes are very clear based on comparisons of hα6hβ4hβ3- with hα6L9′Shβ4hβ3-nAChR and comparisons of mα6hβ4hβ3- with mα6L9′Shβ4hβ3-nAChR. A difference in agonist potency is also clear for comparison of mα6mβ4hβ3- with mα6L9′Smβ4hβ3-nAChR, although there is only a 2-fold difference in peak current response across these receptors, partly due to the relatively high absolute levels of function for the hybrid mα6mβ4hβ3-nAChR. Once again, however, all-mouse α6β4β3-nAChR are outliers because there is only modest function for mα6L9′Smβ4mβ3-nAChR, although there is no reliable function for the all-wild-type analog, mα6mβ4mβ3-nAChR.Nevertheless, and very interestingly, for all-mouse α6*-receptors, although there is not reproducible function for mα6V13′Smβ4-nAChR, there are increases both in agonist potency and in response magnitude for mα6V13′Smβ4mβ3-nAChR when compared with those parameters for any form of mα6mβ4-nAChR or for mα6mβ4mβ3- or mα6L9′Smβ4mβ3-nAChR. Our initial studies of mouse α6*-nAChR were prompted because of the reported difficulties in heterologous expression of all-human α6*-nAChR and because so many data on naturally expressed α6*-nAChR function came from studies using rodents, but we have found all-mouse α6*-nAChR no easier to express than human α6*-nAChR. Expression of hybrid nAChR made up of subunits from different species has been more productive, suggesting that subtle differences for a given subunit across species in amino acid sequences in N-terminal, extracellular domains, but also in cytoplasmic and perhaps transmembrane domains, and at what must be at subunit interfaces not heretofore recognized as being functionally important, can strongly influence whether functional α6*-nAChR can be produced (4Dash B. Bhakta M. Chang Y. Lukas R.J. Identification of N-terminal extracellular domain determinants in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α6 subunits that influence effects of wild-type or mutant β3 subunits on function of α6β2*- or α6β4*-nAChR.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 37976-37989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fact that mα6 L9′S and V13′S mutations differing in position by just one turn in the second transmembrane domain α-helix can have such a large difference in their impact on mα6mβ4*-nAChR function indicates unexpectedly important roles for this channel-lining region in α6*-nAChR function. More work is warranted to more thoroughly characterize the bases for these influences.Our findings demonstrate that α6 subunit L9′S or V13′S modifications can function as reporter and/or gain-of-function mutations, leading to production of receptors with heightened sensitivity to agonists, thus confirming the presence of α6 subunits in functional receptor complexes, as expected. These studies also further affirm and recapture the strategy applied to exploit gain-of-function α6 subunit mutations expressed in vivo to enhance sensitivity to agonists and thus to help reveal roles played by α6*-nAChR in dopaminergic pathways relevant to movement disorders and nicotine dependence (13Drenan R.M.

By contrast to earlier work by others (21Broadbent S. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Krashia P.A. Harkness P.C. Millar N.S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Incorporation of the β3 subunit has a dominant-negative effect on the function of recombinant central-type neuronal nicotinic receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), in which β3 subunits were coexpressed in excess over other subunits, we chose to introduce equal amounts of subunit cRNAs into oocytes for the current work, anticipating that approximately equal amounts of subunit proteins would be made and that this more closely approximates conditions in vivo. We confirmed our previous observations (4Dash B. Bhakta M. Chang Y. Lukas R.J.

However, with the exception of the lack of an obvious effect of mβ3 subunit incorporation on low functioning mα6L9′Smβ4*-nAChR, wild-type β3 subunit incorporation into any of the tested α6(L9′S or V13′S)β4-nAChR potentiated levels of function by >11-fold, notably including effects of hβ3 subunits on low functioning mα6L9′Smβ4*-nAChR and effects of mβ3 subunits on mα6V13′Smβ4*-nAChR.

This question was prompted by our previous characterization of Pparg2-knockout (KO) mice that revealed striking genetic background differences in the severity of their adipose tissue development impairment and dysfunction. Analysis is done of pharmacological lipolytic responses combined with protein and mRNA expression analysis in isolated adipocytes from the gonadal pad of Pparg2-KO mice in 2 different backgrounds (129S6/SvEv and C57BL/6). We provide evidence of the prolipolytic role of PPARg2 and how these effects are modulated by genetic background, leading to differential severity of metabolic syndrome. Specifically, ablation of Pparg2 reduced both basal and stimulated lipolysis as a result of impaired β3-AR signaling, a general defect at downstream lipases, and increased insulin-mediated antilipolytic action. Of note, the C57BL/6 Pparg2-KO mice exhibited more active lipolytic response to catecholamines than 129S6/SvEv Pparg2-KO mice with respect to their wild-type controls. Pparg2-KO mice exhibit metabolic inflexibility resulting from the combined effects of impaired lipid deposition coupled with impaired lipolytic lipid mobilization. The genetic background-dependent differences in lipolysis may account for Pparg2-KO background-specific differences in the severity of their metabolic disturbances. Our findings identify the isoform Pparg2 as an integrator of the adipose lipid metabolism coordinating both anabolic and catabolic processes.—Rodriguez-Cuenca, S., Carobbio, S., Vidal-Puig, A.

https://openalex.org/W2009597371,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme consists of a heterodimeric core (AC core) comprising a scaffolding subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Earlier studies suggest that upon DNA damage, a specific B subunit, B56γ, bridges the PP2A AC core to p53, leading to dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr-55, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56γ-PP2A also inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by an unknown mechanism. B56γ contains 18 α-helices that are organized into eight HEAT (Huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR) repeat motifs. Although previous crystal structure study has revealed the residues of B56γ that directly contact the A and C subunits, the contribution of HEAT repeats to holoenzyme assembly and to B56γ-PP2A tumor-suppressive function remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that HEAT repeat 1 is required for the interaction of B56γ with the PP2A AC core and, more importantly, for B56γ-PP2A tumor-suppressive function. Within this region, we identified a tumor-associated mutation, C39R, which disrupts the interaction of B56γ with the AC core and thus was unable to mediate dephosphorylation of p53 by PP2A. Furthermore, due to its lack of AC interaction, C39R was also unable to promote the p53-independent tumor-suppressive function of B56γ-PP2A.

https://openalex.org/W2047389193,"Paracingulin is an M(r) 150-160 kDa cytoplasmic protein of vertebrate epithelial tight and adherens junctions and comprises globular head, coiled-coil rod, and globular tail domains. Unlike its homologous tight junction protein cingulin, paracingulin has been implicated in the control of junction assembly and has been localized at extrajunctional sites in association with actin filaments. Here we analyze the role of paracingulin domains, and specific regions within the head and rod domains, in the function and localization of paracingulin by inducible overexpression of exogenous proteins in epithelial Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and by expression of mutated and chimeric constructs in Rat1 fibroblasts and MDCK cells. The overexpression of the rod + tail domains of paracingulin perturbs the development of the tight junction barrier and Rac1 activation during junction assembly by the calcium switch, indicating that regulation of junction assembly by paracingulin is mediated by these domains. Conversely, only constructs containing the head domain target to junctions in MDCK cells and Rat1 fibroblasts. Furthermore, expression of chimeric cingulin and paracingulin constructs in Rat1 fibroblasts and MDCK cells identifies specific sequences within the head and rod domains of paracingulin as critical for targeting to actin filaments and regulation of junction assembly, respectively. In summary, we characterize the functionally important domains of paracingulin that distinguish it from cingulin."
