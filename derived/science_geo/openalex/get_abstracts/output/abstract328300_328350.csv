https://openalex.org/W2063902157,"Melting of diamond at high pressure and the properties of liquid carbon at pressures greater than 1 megabar were investigated with a first-principles molecular dynamics technique. The results indicate an increase of the diamond melting temperature with pressure, which is opposite to the behavior of silicon and germanium. This is contrary to long-held assumptions, but agrees with recent experiments, and has important implications for geology and astrophysics. As is the case for the solid phase of carbon at low temperature, which changes greatly with pressure from graphite to diamond, the structural and bonding properties of liquid carbon vary strongly with pressure."

Structural analysis suggests that the domal structure formed as a consequence of extensional deformation, much like the Tertiary metamorphic core complexes in the North American Cordillera. Unlike its North American counterparts, the Kangmar dome developed in an entirely convergent tectonic setting. The documentation of metamorphic core complexes in the Himalayan orogen supports the emerging concept that extensional processes may play an important role in the evolution of compressional mountain belts."

Five populations of a fish with genetically based variation in temperature-dependent sex determination were maintained for 5 to 6 years in artificial constant-temperature environments that initially caused the sex ratio to be highly skewed. Increases in the proportion of the minority sex occurred in subsequent generations until a balanced sex ratio was established, thus confirming a central premise underlying the theory of sex-ratio evolution."

Comparison of the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the fracture carbonates with those of modern soil carbonates in the area shows that the fracture carbonates are pedogenic in origin and that they likely formed in the presence of vegetation and rainfall typical of a glacial climate. Their isotopic composition differs markedly from that of carbonate associated with nearby springs. The regional water table therefore remained below the level of Trench 14 during the time that the carbonates and silica precipitated, a period probably covering parts of at least the last 300,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2095067215,"Massive neutrinos are expected in most grand unified theories that attempt to unify the strong and electroweak interactions. So far, heroic laboratory experiments have yielded only upper bounds on the masses of the elusive neutrinos. These bounds, however, are not very restrictive and cannot even exclude the possibility that the dark matter in the universe consists of neutrinos. The astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the masses of the muon and tau neutrinos, mv(vmicro) and mv(vtau), which already are much more restrictive than the laboratory bounds, and the laboratory bound on the mass of the electron neutrino, mv(vc), can be improved significantly by future astrophysical and cosmological observations that perhaps will pin down the neutrino masses. Indeed, the recent results from the solar neutrino experiments combined with the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses suggest that mv(vc) approximately 10(-8) electron volts, mv(vmicro) approximately 10(-3) electron volts, and mv(vtau) approximately 10 electron volts, which can be tested in the near future by solar neutrino and accelerator experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2143511380,"Funding for the US fusion energy program has suffered and will probably continue to suffer major cuts. A committee hand-picked by Energy Secretary James Watkins urged the Department of Energy to mount an aggressive program to develop fusion power, but congress cut funding from $323 million in 1990 to $275 million in 1991. This portends dire conditions for fusion research and development. Projects to receive top priority are concerned with the tokamaks and to keep the next big machine, the Burning Plasma Experiment, scheduled for beginning of construction in 1993 on schedule. Secretary Watkins is said to want to keep the International Thermonuclear Energy Reactor (ITER) on schedule. ITER would follow the Burning Plasma Experiment."
