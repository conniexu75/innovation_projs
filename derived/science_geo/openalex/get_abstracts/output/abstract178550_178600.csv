https://openalex.org/W1982729445,"Dual EGFR/erbB2 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy for epithelial tumors, as ligand-induced erbB2/EGFR heterodimerization triggers potent proliferative and survival signals. Here we show that a small molecule, GW572016, potently inhibits both EGFR and erbB2 tyrosine kinases leading to growth arrest and/or apoptosis in EGFR and erbB2-dependent tumor cell lines. GW572016 markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and erbB2, and inhibited activation of Erk1/2 and AKT, downstream effectors of proliferation and cell survival, respectively. Complete inhibition of activated AKT in erbB2 overexpressing cells correlated with a 23-fold increase in apoptosis compared with vehicle controls. EGF, often elevated in cancer patients, did not reverse the inhibitory effects of GW572016. These observations were reproduced in vivo, where GW572016 treatment inhibited activation of EGFR, erbB2, Erk1/2 and AKT in human tumor xenografts. Erk1/2 and AKT represent potential biomarkers to assess the clinical activity of GW572016. Inhibition of activated AKT in EGFR or erbB2-dependent tumors by GW572016 may lead to tumor regressions when used as a monotherapy, or may enhance the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapeutics, since constitutive activation of AKT has been linked to chemo-resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2027021865,"Death receptors, such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors, recruit Fas-associated death domain and pro-caspase-8 homodimers, which are then autoproteolytically activated. Active caspase-8 is released into the cytoplasm, where it cleaves various proteins including pro-caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis. The cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein long form (FLIP<sub>L</sub>), a structural homologue of caspase-8 lacking caspase activity because of several mutations in the active site, is a potent inhibitor of death receptor-induced apoptosis. FLIP<sub>L</sub> is proposed to block caspase-8 activity by forming a proteolytically inactive heterodimer with caspase-8. In contrast, we propose that FLIP<sub>L</sub>-bound caspase-8 is an active protease. Upon heterocomplex formation, a limited caspase-8 autoprocessing occurs resulting in the generation of the p43/41 and the p12 subunits. This partially processed form but also the non-cleaved FLIP<sub>L</sub>-caspase-8 heterocomplex are proteolytically active because they both bind synthetic substrates efficiently. Moreover, FLIP<sub>L</sub> expression favors receptor-interacting kinase (RIP) processing within the Fas-signaling complex. We propose that FLIP<sub>L</sub> inhibits caspase-8 release-dependent pro-apoptotic signals, whereas the single, membrane-restricted active site of the FLIP<sub>L</sub>-caspase-8 heterocomplex is proteolytically active and acts on local substrates such as RIP."

https://openalex.org/W2039517040,"Increased brain metal levels have been associated with normal aging and a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Copper and iron levels both show marked increases with age and may adversely interact with the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide causing its aggregation and the production of neurotoxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) possesses copper/zinc binding sites in its amino-terminal domain and in the Aβ domain. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP, containing Aβ, results in significantly reduced copper and iron levels in transgenic mouse brain, while overexpression of the APP in Tg2576 transgenic mice results in significantly reduced copper, but not iron, levels prior to the appearance of amyloid neuropathology and throughout the lifespan of the mouse. Concomitant increases in brain manganese levels were observed with both transgenic strains. These findings, complemented by our previous findings of elevated copper levels in APP knock-out mice, support roles for APP and Aβ in physiological metal regulation.

Numerous reports have also demonstrated transition metal imbalances in AD brain, such as decreased copper, and increased iron, zinc, and manganese (6Connor J.R. Snyder B.S. Beard J.L. Fine R.E.

Gerontol. 1994; 27: 324-327Google Scholar). Therefore, a breakdown of metal regulation could be an inevitable consequence of aging. Copper and iron are redox active metals that play important catalytic roles in many enzymes. Their levels must be strictly regulated to prevent aberrant reactive oxygen species production resulting in cellular toxicity. AD brain exhibits marked oxidative damage of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (20Pappolla M.A. Omar R.A. Kim K.S. Robakis N.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 621-628Google Scholar, 21Smith M.A. Rottkamp C.A. Nunomura A. Raina A.K. Perry G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 139-144Google Scholar). APP possesses a copper binding site in its NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain, which reduces Cu2+ to Cu1+ (22Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Science. 1996; 271: 1406-1409Google Scholar). APP also has a zinc binding site, which is believed to have a structural role (23Bush A.I. Multhaup G. Moir R.D. Williamson T.G. Small D.H. Rumble B. Pollwein P. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16109-16112Google Scholar). APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) knock-out mice show specific elevations in brain and liver copper levels (24White A.R. Reyes R. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. Zheng H. Bush A.I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 439-444Google Scholar), which suggests that APP has a role in copper homeostasis. Aβ, a product of APP proteolytic processing, accumulates in the neocortex in AD. This peptide also possesses selective high and low affinity Cu2+ and Zn2+ binding sites. Aβ reduces Cu2+ to Cu1+ and Fe3+ to Fe2+, catalyzing the O2-dependent production of H2O2 (25Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Google Scholar). This interaction of Aβ with copper mediates toxicity (26Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S.

Treatment of the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model for AD with clioquinol, an orally bioavailable metal chelator induced a marked inhibition of cortical amyloid accumulation (33Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of aging and APP and/or Aβ overexpression on metal levels, we measured copper, zinc, iron, copper, and manganese levels in the brains of normal and transgenic (Tg) mice across the majority of their lifespan (2.8–18 months (mo)). We utilized transgenic mice overexpressing human APP695.K670N-M671L (Swedish mutation) (Tg2576) as well as two lines of mice expressing the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues of APP (C100), with and without the familial AD mutation V717F (TgC100.V717F and TgC100.wt, respectively). TgC100 mice express human Aβ at lower levels than the Tg2576 line, and display no Aβ accumulation nor amyloid plaques up to 20 months (34Li Q.X. Maynard C. Cappai R. McLean C.A. Cherny R.A. Lynch T. Culvenor J.G. Trevaskis J. Tanner J.E. Bailey K.A. Czech C. Bush A.I. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2479-2487Google Scholar). These mice provide a model to study the effect of increased human Aβ production without holoAPP overexpression. The TgC100.V717F line produces relatively more Aβx-42, which is of interest, since Aβ1–42 binds copper with much greater affinity than Aβ1–40 (29Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C.

These increases may contribute to the age-dependent formation of amyloid and oxidative damage in Tg2576 mice, and possibly also in AD brain. We also show that APP and Aβ expression modulates metal levels, particularly copper, in transgenic mouse brain. These data suggest that the corrupted metabolism of Aβ in AD may cause severe perturbances of essential metal homeostasis. These imbalances may contribute to the neurodegenerative phenotype. All mice were housed according to standard animal care protocols and fed standard laboratory chow and tap water ad libitum. We maintained the Tg2576 colony (35Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Google Scholar) by crossing Tg2576 males with C57BL6/SJL F1 females and determined transgene status by PCR of tail DNA, using primers as described previously (36Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecola C. Clark H.B. Carlson G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1203-1218Google Scholar). NTg littermates were used as controls (referred to as BL6/SJL). We analyzed mice at 2.8 months (2.81 ± 0.002 months), 3.6 months (3.59 ± 0.002 months), 11 months (11.14 ± 0.01 months), and 18 months (18.21 ± 0.03 months). Transgenic mouse lines TgC100.V717F and TgC100.wt were generated as described previously (34Li Q.X. Maynard C. Cappai R. McLean C.A. Cherny R.A. Lynch T. Culvenor J.G. Trevaskis J. Tanner J.E. Bailey K.A. Czech C. Bush A.I. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2479-2487Google Scholar) and bred to homozygosity in a C57BL6/DBA background. NTg controls for the C100 lines were of the same genetic background (C57BL6/DBA F2) (referred to as BL6/DBA). We studied these mice at 2.8 months (2.76 ± 0.02 months), 8 months (7.8 ± 0.1 months), and 18 months (17.6 ± 0.1 months). All groups contained similar numbers of males and females. To minimize metal contamination of samples, we presoaked all tubes and equipment in 1% nitric acid and rinsed them in distilled water prior to use. We sacrificed mice by anesthetization with halothane, followed by transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline at 100–120 mm Hg until the perfusate ran clear. We then dissected brains to remove olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and brain stem; weighed the remaining wet brain tissue; and snap-froze samples and stored them at −80 °C until use. We dissolved the freeze-dried brains overnight in 0.6 ml of concentrated HNO3 (Aristar, BDH), followed by heating to 80 °C for 20 min, and allowed them to cool to room temperature. To dissolve lipid components, we added 0.6 ml of H2O2, and once effervescing had ceased (approximately 30 min) we heated samples to 70 °C for 15 min and allowed them to cool. We diluted samples in triplicate by 1/51 in 1% HNO3 (60-μl sample plus 3 ml of 1% HNO3) and measured metal levels by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with an Ultramass 700 (Varian, Victoria, Australia) in peak-hopping mode with spacing at 0.100 atomic mass unit, 1 point per peak, 50 scans per replicate, and 3 non-consecutive replicates per sample. Plasma flow was 15 liter/min with an auxiliary flow 1.5 liter/min. R F power was 1.2 kilowatts. Each sample was introduced using a glass nebulizer at a flow of 0.88 liter/min. We calibrated the instrument using a 1% HNO3mixed calibration standard (Merck Pty. Ltd.) containing 10, 50, and 100 ppb of all metals measured in 1% HNO3. We diluted and measured each brain sample in triplicate and used the average value for analysis. The metal values presented are the mean ng or μg/g wet weight of the original prefrozen brain sample. Error bars represent S.E. of the mean of each group of mouse brains analyzed. We performed statistical analyses using StatisticaTM for the Macintosh (StatSoftTM). To determine whether metal levels changed significantly with age within each mouse line, and whether this differed for males and females, we performed two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on data from all age groups, with age group and sex as independent variables. If a significant age-sex interaction was found, males and females were re-analyzed separately. To determine whether metal levels in each age group were significantly different from the youngest age group (2.8 months), we performed post-hoc Scheffe tests. To determine whether brain metal levels in each line of transgenic mouse differed from their corresponding NTg controls, and whether this differed between males and females, we performed two-way ANOVA on metal level data from the two mouse lines in all age groups, including sex and age group as independent variables. If a significant mouse type-sex interaction was found, males and females were analyzed separately. Significant differences between transgenic and NTg mice in each age group individually were determined by applying simple contrasts to the data. Average percentage changes in metal levels due to transgene expression represent the average of the percentage differences in each age group ± S.E., hence giving equal weighting to data in each age group. We first examined how brain metal levels are affected by age in both strains of non-transgenic mouse. Two-way ANOVA of metal levels in both BL6/SJL and BL6/DBA mouse lines, with age group and sex as independent variables, revealed marked and significant age dependent increases (p < 0.001) in copper, iron, and cobalt levels (Fig.1). No significant age-sex interaction was found for any of these metal level increases, indicating that the effects of age on brain copper, iron, and cobalt levels is similar for both males and females. In comparison with the youngest (2.8 mo) group, copper, iron, and cobalt levels in the BL6/SJL line had not changed significantly by 3.4 months, but by 11 and 18 months, significant increases were observed in each metal (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 A). Copper levels increased by 46% from 5.1 ± 0.1 μg/g (wet weight) at 2.8 months to 7.5 ± 0.2 μg/g at 18 months; iron levels increased 51% from 17.3 ± 0.3 μg/g at 2.8 months to 26.1 ± 0.7 μg/g at 18 months; and copper levels increased 66% from 11.6 ± 0.3 ng/g at 2.8 months to 19.3 ± 0.7 ng/g at 18 months. Zinc levels showed no significant overall change with age, but a significant age sex interaction was found (p < 0.01). When male and female zinc levels were analyzed separately, we found that males displayed a relatively small increase (10%, p < 0.01) in brain zinc levels across the age groups from 20.5 μg/g at 2.8 months to 22.5 μg/g at 18 months. Females zinc levels, however, remained between 20.1 and 21.1 μg/g in all age groups measured. Manganese levels showed no significant overall change with age, and no significant age-sex interaction, with levels remaining between 0.44 and 0.46 μg/g in all age groups measured. In the BL6/DBA line (Fig. 1 B), copper levels increased by 34% from 4.9 ± 0.1 μg/g at 2.8 months to 6.5 ± 0.1 μg/g at 18 months; iron levels increased 34% from 16.5 ± 0.2 μg/g at 2.8 months to 21.9 ± 0.6 μg/g at 18 months; and copper levels increased 41% from 12.1 ± 0.2 ng/g at 2.8 months to 17.6 ± 0.7 ng/g at 18 months. Manganese levels, in contrast to the BL6/SJL strain, showed a significant overall decrease with age (p < 0.01), dropping by 14% from 0.51 ± 0.02 μg/g at 2.8 months to 0.44 ± 0.01 μg/g at 18 months (p < 0.001). No significant age-sex interaction was found for any of these metal level changes. Zinc levels showed no significant overall change with age, but a significant age-sex interaction was found (p < 0.05). Separate analysis of male and female zinc levels revealed no more than a 5% fluctuation in zinc levels across the three age groups in both males and females. These changes reached significance only in females (p< 0.05), where a 5% drop in zinc levels was observed from 2.8 to 8 months (p < 0.05), whereas 18-month zinc levels were unchanged from 2.8-month levels. Zinc levels remained between 19.0 ± 0.2 and 20.1 ± 0.6 μg/g in males and females in all age groups analyzed. The three Tg mouse lines (Tg2576, TgC100.wt, and TgC100.V717F) displayed the same direction of age-related changes in copper, iron, cobalt, and manganese levels as their corresponding NTg background controls, but exhibited transgene-related adjustments in metal levels. Tg2576 mice express relatively stable human APP695.swe levels across the lifespan, but human Aβ levels in their brains increase exponentially with age, resulting in amyloid plaques by around 10–12 months (35Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Google Scholar, 37Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L. Saido T. Shoji M. Ashe K. Younkin S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Google Scholar). To determine the effect of APP695.swe overexpression and Aβ accumulation on brain metal homeostasis, we compared brain metal levels between Tg2576 and BL6/SJL NTg littermates at 2.8, 3.6, 11, and 18 months. Two-way ANOVA of metal levels in Tg2576 compared with BL6/SJL brain, with age group and sex as independent variables, revealed a significant overall reduction in copper levels by 14 ± 1% in Tg2576 compared with BL6/SJL brain (p< 0.001) (Fig. 2). This reduction showed no dependence on sex, but a significant age group effect was observed (p < 0.05). Significantly reduced (p< 0.001) copper levels were observed in each age group, and this effect increased with increasing age (11% at 2.8 months, 14% at 3.6 months, 14% at 11 months, and 16% at 18 months). We also found a small but significant reduction in zinc levels (4 ± 1%,p < 0.001) in Tg2576 compared with BL6/SJL brains. While the percentage reduction in zinc levels was relatively small compared with the percentage reduction in copper levels, the average absolute decreases in zinc and copper levels were identical (both 13 nmol/g). In contrast, manganese levels were significantly increased in Tg2576 compared with BL6/SJL brain, by 5 ± 3% (p< 0.001). Neither of these metal level changes showed any significant dependence on age or sex. Iron levels showed no significant overall difference between Tg2576 and BL6/SJL groups when males and females were analyzed together; however, significant mouse type-sex (p < 0.01) and mouse type-age (p < 0.05) interactions were found. Separate analysis of males and females revealed a significant change in iron levels in males that was dependent on age (p < 0.001), a significant reduction (13%, p < 0.001) was observed in the 11-month age group, but no other age groups. Females, in contrast, showed no significant overall change in iron levels due to APP695.swe expression; however, a significant effect of age group was observed (p < 0.05), whereby iron levels were significantly increased (14%, p < 0.01) only in the oldest (18 month) age group compared with age-matched BL6/SJL controls. Cobalt levels showed no significant overall difference between the Tg2576 and BL6/SJL groups and no significant effect of sex or age. The alterations to metal levels in the Tg2576 brain could be attributed either to the metal binding sites in the APP NH2-terminal domain or to the metal binding sites on Aβ. To test whether Aβ expression alone could modify metal levels, we also measured metal levels in the brains of the TgC100.V717F (Fig.3) and TgC100.wt (Fig.4) mouse lines at 2.8, 8, and 18 months and compared them with BL6/DBA NTg controls.Figure 4Effect of C100.wt overexpression on brain metal levels. Metal levels were measured in TgC100.wt and BL6/DBA brain at 2.8 months (n = 20 and 17, respectively), 8 months (n = 28 and 23, respectively), and 18 months (n = 20 and 14, respectively) by ICP-MS. Each group contained similar numbers of males and females. Metal levels are given as μg/g or ng/g wet brain weight. ANOVA results represent significant differences between TgC100.wt and BL6/DBA brain metal levels by two-way ANOVA of data in all age groups, including age group and sex as independent variables. Significant differences in metal levels at each age group are indicated by asterisks. These represent contrast analysis of TgC100.wt compared with BL6/DBA brain within each age group. a represents a significant sex-mouse type interaction. In these cases, male and female data were re-analyzed separately.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We found significant overall reductions in copper and iron levels in the TgC100.V717F line compared with BL6/DBA controls (p< 0.001) that showed no dependence on sex. Significantly reduced copper and iron levels were found in each age group (p< 0.001), and only in the case of iron was a significant effect of age observed (p < 0.05), whereby the decrease was greatest in the older age groups. A small but significant (3.5 ± 0.3%,p < 0.05) overall increase in zinc levels that bore no effect of sex or age was found in the TgC100.V717F line compared with BL6/DBA controls. Cobalt levels, however, showed a significant (p < 0.01) increase that was dependent on age. TgC100.V717F mice at 18 months had 19% higher cobalt levels than age-matched BL6/DBA controls (p < 0.001), while in the younger age groups, there were no significant differences. Manganese levels were significantly increased in TgC100.V717F brain compared with BL6/DBA controls (11 ± 3%, p < 0.001). This increase showed no dependence on sex or age, and significant increases were observed in each age group (p < 0.01). The TgC100.wt line, similarly to the TgC100.V717F line, showed significantly reduced copper and iron levels (p < 0.001) in conjunction with significantly increased manganese levels (p < 0.001) when compared with the BL6/DBA controls. However, a significant effect of sex was observed for each of these metals. On separate analysis of males and females, we found that although copper levels were significantly reduced in both sexes, the decrease was greater in females (13 ± 3%, p < 0.001) than males (7 ± 4%, p < 0.01). In addition, iron levels were significantly decreased in female TgC100.wt mice (9 ± 1%, p < 0.001) but were unchanged in males. Conversely, manganese levels were significantly increased in males (20 ± 1%, p < 0.001) but unchanged in females. No significant effect of age was found on any of these metal level changes. We found no significant difference in zinc levels in the TgC100.wt compared with the BL6/DBA line and no effect of sex. Cobalt levels showed the same alterations as in the TgC100.V717F line, with a significant increase (p < 0.01) that was dependent on age. The oldest (18 months) age group displayed 19% higher cobalt levels than BL6/DBA controls (p < 0.001), while levels in the younger age groups were unchanged. This study demonstrates age-dependent increases in copper, iron, and cobalt levels in bulk brain tissue from two normal mouse strains and three strains of APP- or Aβ-overexpressing Tg mice. We hypothesize that the marked elevations in copper and iron as a product of age could explain the age-dependent onset of amyloid neuropathology in the Tg2576 model (35Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Google Scholar). Studies in humans suggest that the aging human brain follows a similar pattern of age-related changes, at least for iron (13Drayer B. Burger P. Darwin R.

In the following model, if the changes in metals we observed in mice are also reflected in the aging human brain, then a senescent rise in brain copper and iron could be the neurochemical basis for age being the major risk factor for AD neuropathology (41Smith M.A. Perry G. J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 134 (suppl.): 92-94Google Scholar). Synaptic zinc released by the glutamatergic synapses (42Frederickson C.J. Bush A.I. Biometals. 2001; 14: 353-366Google Scholar) is critical for Aβ plaque formation (43Lee J.Y. Cole T.B. Palmiter R.D. Suh S.W. Koh J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7705-7710Google Scholar), although we find that zinc concentrations averaged through the whole brain remain relatively constant with age (Fig. 1). However, Aβ plaque indeed contains a mixture of supraphysiological concentrations of copper (≈0.4 mm), iron (≈1 mm), and zinc (≈1 mm) (3Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Google Scholar). We hypothesize that excess binding of copper and iron to Aβ could alter the metabolism of Aβ leading to its precipitation by the constitutively high ambient zinc concentrations in the synaptic (and corticovascular) milieu. Copper and iron binding to Aβ engenders H2O2 production by Aβ (25Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20627-20635Google Scholar), leading to Aβ accumulation. An alternative possibility is that Aβ is oxidatively modified by reaction with excess copper or iron (2Atwood C.S. Huang X. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1999; 36: 309-364Google Scholar) and that these modified forms of Aβ are more vulnerable to zinc- (or other metal) induced precipitation. Such oxidative modification inhibits catabolic degradation of polypeptides (45Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990;"

However, the role of endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways in atheroma has received much less attention. Therefore, using cDNA microarrays, we screened for genes regulated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potential endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human macrophages (MΦ). PGE2 (50 nm) attenuated LPS-induced mRNA and protein expression of chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1β, and interferon-inducible protein-10. PGE2 also inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α-, interferon-γ-, and interleukin-1β-mediated expression of these chemokines. In contrast to the case of MΦ, PGE2 did not suppress chemokine expression in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMC) treated with LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. To assess the potential paracrine effect of endogenous PGE2 on macrophage-derived chemokine production, we co-cultured MΦ with SMC in the presence of LPS. In these co-cultures, cyclooxygenase-2-dependent PGE2 production exceeded that in the mono-cultures, and MIP-1β declined significantly compared with MΦ cultured without SMC. We further documented prominent expression of the PGE2receptor EP4 in MΦ in both culture and human atheroma. Moreover, a selective EP4 antagonist completely reversed PGE2-mediated suppression of chemokine production. Thus, endogenous PGE2may modulate inflammation during atherogenesis and other inflammatory diseases by suppressing macrophage-derived chemokine production via the EP4 receptor.

Thus, endogenous PGE2may modulate inflammation during atherogenesis and other inflammatory diseases by suppressing macrophage-derived chemokine production via the EP4 receptor. Atherosclerosis involves chronic vascular inflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and proteases (1Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar, 2Libby P. Ridker P.M. Maseri A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (5792) Google Scholar). During atherogenesis, these factors can act in an autocrine or paracrine manner to regulate cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix metabolism. However, atheroma formation may not occur in a continuous and linear fashion (3Libby P. Braunwald E. Zipes D.P. Libby P. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. Harcourt, Philadelphia2001: 995-1009Google Scholar). The balance between persistent pro-inflammatory signals and intrinsic anti-inflammatory pathways likely determines development, progression, and clinical manifestation of atherosclerotic plaques. Several therapeutic strategies may decrease the progression of atherosclerosis through the regulation of the inflammatory response. For example, in addition to its original intended targets, lipid lowering therapy also stabilizes lesions by decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PG, prostaglandin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MΦ, macrophage; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MIP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1; IP-10, interferon-inducible protein-10; EC, endothelial cell(s); SMC, smooth muscle cell(s); COX, cyclooxygenase; Th1, T helper cell type 1; RPA, RNase protection assay; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A; TXA2, thromboxane A2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; IL, interleukin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PG, prostaglandin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MΦ, macrophage; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MIP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1; IP-10, interferon-inducible protein-10; EC, endothelial cell(s); SMC, smooth muscle cell(s); COX, cyclooxygenase; Th1, T helper cell type 1; RPA, RNase protection assay; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A; TXA2, thromboxane A2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; IL, interleukin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; IFN, interferon; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered salinetissue factor, MCP-1, and CD40 ligand (4Aikawa M.

PPARα agonists such as the fibric acid derivatives, beyond effect on the lipid profiles, can exert anti-inflammatory properties by suppression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and tissue factor (7Marx N.

However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways in the evolving atherosclerotic plaque remain incompletely understood. Atheroma, like other inflammatory lesions, display increased biosynthesis of eicosanoids such as prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and PGE2(8Rolland P.H. Jouve R. Pellegrin E. Mercier C. Serradimigni A. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 70-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that human atheroma contain both cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2), the key enzymes of prostanoid synthesis (9Schonbeck U. Sukhova G.K. Graber P. Coulter S.

In the context of atherosclerosis, PGI2 or PGE2 inhibits platelet activation and also relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by augmenting intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), whereas TXA2 activates platelets and contracts SMC by increasing intracellular Ca2+ (12Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGE2 can inhibit SMC proliferation induced by IL-1 (13Libby P. Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and augment MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages (MΦ), proteolytic enzymes that may promote vulnerability of atheroma (11Cipollone F.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In contrast to the pro-inflammatory properties of PGE2, some recent data show that PGE2 modulates the T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response, impairing the expression of TNF-α, IL-12, and IFN-γ (14van der Pouw Kraan TC Boeije L.C.

Here we have applied transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays to unveil the effects of several prostanoids and other endogenous mediators on LPS-activated human MΦ. Our results indicate that PGE2 selectively suppresses expression of several chemokines in activated MΦ. Furthermore, we identify the EP4 receptor as the predominant PGE2 receptor isoform present in human MΦ both in culture and in human atheroma, and the involvement of EP4 receptor in the signaling of this novel anti-inflammatory effect of PGE2. All prostanoids and anti-human EP4 receptor antiserum were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). An EP4 receptor-selective antagonist, L-161,982 (EP4A), and a chemically related inactive analog, L-161,983, were kindly provided by Drs. R. N. Young and M. Abromovitz (Merck Frosst Canada & Co., Kirkland, Quebec, Canada). LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), human recombinant IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (Endogen Inc., Cambridge, MA) were used for cell stimulation. Monocytes were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation, employing Lymphocyte Separation Medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) and subsequence adherence to cell culture dishes from leukopacs of healthy donors. Monocytes were cultured in M199 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 5% human serum (ICN Biomedicals) for 7–9 days to obtain MΦ. Forty-eight h before and during the experiments, the MΦ were incubated in M199 medium containing 1% human serum. Human SMC and endothelial cells (EC) were isolated from human saphenous veins and cultured as described previously (9Schonbeck U. Sukhova G.K. Graber P. Coulter S. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Both cell types were used after three or four passages. SMC were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, amphotericin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and then cultured 24 h before the experiment in serum-free insulin/transferrin media as described previously (13Libby P. Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). EC were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, amphotericin B, heparin (50 μg/ml), endothelial cell growth factor derived from bovine brains, and 5% fetal bovine serum, and then cultured for 12 h before the experiment in M199 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum without endothelial cell growth factor and heparin. Human MΦ were treated with or without PGE2 (50 nm) for 2 h and then cultured with or without LPS (1 ng/ml) for 5 h. After the stimulation, total RNA was isolated by RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase I. The cDNA microarray experiments were performed with GF211 cDNA array (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) containing 4324 known genes. One microgram of total RNA from each experimental condition was used to synthesize 33P-labeled probes. The hybridization, the data collection, and the data normalization were performed as described previously (16Garcia-Cardena G. Comander J. Anderson K.R. Blackman B.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed with PATHWAYS 3.0 software (Research Genetics) and Argus (17Comander J. Weber G.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and are expressed as the ratio representing the relative expression between two different conditions. This initial screening transcriptional profile was performed once, and the results of current interest were verified quantitatively at the mRNA and protein levels as described below. RPA for human chemokines was performed using hck5 probe set and RiboQuant RPA assay kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. After electrophoresis, the gel was exposed to x-ray film and PhosphorImager plate (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify the intensity of the bands using ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). Release of MIP-1β, MCP-1, IL-8, and IP-10 were measured by sandwich ELISA using the recombinant standards and antibodies purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The level of PGE2 was measured using a PGE2 enzymatic immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical). SMC were cultured on 24 × 30-mm cover slips in a six-well culture plate to confluence with the medium described above. Monocytes/MΦ were cultured in a six-well plate for 7–9 days. The cover slips with SMC were placed onto MΦ for co-culture and fresh M199 containing 1% human serum with or without COX inhibitors (flurbiprofen or NS-398; Cayman Chemical) were added. After 30 min of incubation, LPS was added at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml for 24 h. Then, the culture medium was harvested to measure MIP-1β and PGE2. Two micrograms of DNase I-treated total RNA from human MΦ was reverse-transcribed by Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the instruction manual. Equal aliquots of cDNA were PCR-amplified by Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a 50-μl reaction containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 0.2 μm sense, and antisense primers. The condition for amplification was 3 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, followed by an extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The sequence of sense primers, antisense primers, and product size for PGE2 receptor isoforms are as follows: EP1, 5′-ATCTGCTGGAGGCCAATGCTGGTGT-3′ and 5′-AGTCGTTGGGCCTCTGGTTGTGCTT-3′, 311 bp; EP2, 5′-CCTGGCCGTGCTGCCTGTCATCTAT-3′ and 5′-CCATGGACACCCTTT CCCTCTCCT-3′, 311 bp; EP3, 5′-TTCGGGCTGACCATGACTGTTTTCG-3′ and 5′-GAGGC GAAGAAAAGGTTGCCCCAGT-3′, 299 bp; EP4, 5′-TTTGCAGGCCATCCGAATTGCTTCT-3′ and 5′-CCTGCCTCCAAGGCCATTTTCACTGG-3′, 304 bp. PCR products were electrophoresed using 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. MΦ were washed with PBS and lysed on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5% SDS supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Thirty micrograms of protein was separated by standard 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blot was blocked overnight in PBS containing 5% defatted dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. After 2 h of incubation with anti-human EP4 receptor antiserum (Cayman Chemical), the blot was washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was added for another 1 h. Finally, the blot was washed, and immunoreactive protein was visualized using chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Western blotting for cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB was performed using anti-CREB antibody and anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Human MΦ were cultured in eight-well chamber slides for staining. Slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 3% normal goat serum, and then incubated with anti-EP4 receptor antiserum or control rabbit serum for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the slides were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with biotin. Secondary antibodies were detected with ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed with Fast Red (Sigma). Atherosclerotic plaques from human coronary and carotid arteries and non-atherosclerotic arteries were obtained from transplantation donors at endarterectomy and at autopsy. Air-dried serial cryostat sections (6 μm) were fixed in acetone for 5 min at −20 °C, treated with PBS containing 0.3% H2O2, and then incubated with anti-EP4 receptor antiserum, anti-macrophage-specific CD68, or anti-smooth muscle-specific α-actin antibodies. Subsequent processing was performed using Universal Dako LSAB2 peroxidase kit (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Antibody binding was visualized with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (Sigma). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Using Student's t test, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To unveil potential anti-inflammatory pathways mediated by PGE2 in human atherosclerosis, we used cDNA arrays as screening tools. All experiments used MΦ derived from human peripheral blood monocytes. After 9 days of culture, MΦ were treated with PGE2 (50 nm) or vehicle for 2 h and then treated with 1 ng/ml LPS. In the initial screen, LPS augmented the expression of 95 of the 4234 surveyed genes (using a cut-off ratio LPS versuscontrol > 1.9). Interestingly, PGE2 pretreatment attenuated the expression of four transcripts among the 95 genes (the ratio of PGE2+LPS versus LPS <0.6). These four mRNAs included those encoding MIP-1β and IL-8 (TableI). Although regulation of all of the chemokine genes tested did not completely fulfill the prespecified numerical criteria, the microarray screening data indicated that PGE2 selectively regulates chemokine expression in human MΦ stimulated with LPS (Table I).Table IMicroarray screening shows that chemokines are potential targets for PGE2LPS/controlPGE2 + LPS/LPSMIP-1β37.490.33IL-82.960.53MCP-11.630.77MIP-1α1.610.55RANTES1.541.56IP-101.100.55Ratios represent the relative expression between two indicated conditions by cDNA microarray analysis. Open table in a new tab Ratios represent the relative expression between two indicated conditions by cDNA microarray analysis. To validate the microarray data, we used a quantitative RPA to test regulation of mRNAs encoding potential target chemokines in MΦ isolated from different donors. LPS induced IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IP-10, and RANTES mRNA expression (Fig.1). Pretreatment with PGE2substantially suppressed the expression of IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and IP-10 (by 44, 90, 65, 79, and 95%, respectively, as assessed by PhosphorImager analysis), but not the level of RANTES mRNA (Fig. 1). Furthermore, addition of PGE2 at the time of LPS stimulation yielded suppression of chemokine expression similar to pretreatment (data not shown). Additional experiments tested whether the production by MΦ of the corresponding proteins correlated with mRNA level. PGE2pretreatment potently reduced the release of immunoreactive MCP-1, MIP-1β, IP-10, and IL-8 from LPS-stimulated MΦ (by 95 ± 3.8, 82 ± 7.1, 92 ± 7.0, and 58 ± 11.7%, respectively; means ± S.D. for inhibition in three independent experiments; Fig. 2 A). Moreover, PGE2 inhibited MIP-1β production in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 17 nm (Fig. 2B). Atheroma display increased biosynthesis of various prostanoids. We compared the anti-inflammatory activity of PGE2 with other prostanoids produced in atheroma such as PGI2, PGD2, PGF2α, 15-deoxy-Δ−12,14-PGJ2, and I-BOP (a stable analog of TXA2). PGE2 (∼10−8m) inhibited LPS-induced MIP-1β production, whereas the other prostanoids tested did not significantly inhibit MIP-1β production at 50 or 500 nm (data not shown). Multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ participate in atherogenesis. Thus, we examined the effect of PGE2 on chemokine production induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-α, IL-1β, or IFN-γ induced MIP-1β production to a lesser degree than LPS. PGE2 significantly suppressed MIP-1β production induced in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IFN-γ + TNF-α, and IFN-γ + IL-1β (by 76 ± 5.0, 86 ± 1.5, 85 ± 4.3, 76 ± 15.7, and 92 ± 5.4%, respectively; means ± S.D. for inhibition in three independent experiments) as well as LPS (Fig.3). IFN-γ or IL-1β augmented MCP-1 production to a greater extent than LPS. As in the case of MIP-1β, PGE2 significantly reduced MCP-1 production from activated MΦ (Fig. 3). In human atheroma, EC and SMC also elaborate chemokines. We therefore tested the cell specificity of the inhibitory effect of PGE2 in cells found in atheroma by RPA. TNF-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α + IFN-γ, LPS, or LPS + IFN-γ induced MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10, and RANTES to variable degrees in both cell types (Fig.4). However, in contrast to the case of MΦ, PGE2 had little or no effect on chemokine expression in either EC or SMC (Fig. 4). We showed above that exogenous PGE2 attenuates chemokine expression in human MΦ. Next, we tested the effects of endogenous PGE2 in a co-culture experiment. SMC synthesize PGE2 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α (13Libby P. Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Soler M. Camacho M. Escudero J.R. Iniguez M.A. Vila L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), both generated by activated MΦ. Thus, to assess potential anti-inflammatory effects of SMC-derived PGE2, MΦ were co-cultured with SMC in the presence of LPS for 24 h (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). The culture medium contained MIP-1β and PGE2 after this incubation. LPS (5 ng/ml) did not induce PGE2 synthesis in MΦ or SMC cultured separately, whereas LPS augmented PGE2 secretion in the co-cultures. In LPS-treated co-cultures, MIP-1 β secretion significantly declined, compared with MΦ cultured without SMC (26 ± 3.5% inhibition; means ± S.D. for three independent experiments). Under the same co-culture conditions, we assessed the effect of two different types of COX inhibitors. Flurbiprofen, a non-selective inhibitor (19Barnett J. Chow J. Ives D. Chiou M. Mackenzie R. Osen E. Nguyen B. Tsing S. Bach C. Freire J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), or NS-398, a COX-2-selective inhibitor (20Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), added to the co-cultures before LPS stimulation, inhibited PGE2 synthesis and yielded increased production of MIP-1β production compared with the co-cultures without COX inhibitors (Fig.5). Four PGE2 receptor isoforms (EP1–4) mediate the diverse actions of PGE2 (12Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether human MΦ express these receptors. RT-PCR (30 cycles) demonstrated mRNA encoding the EP4 receptor in MΦ (Fig.6 A). Moreover, human MΦ express EP4 receptor protein, as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 6, B and C). After 35 PCR cycles, a weak signal for EP2 receptor mRNA appeared (data not shown). A potent EP4-receptor-selective antagonist, L-161,982 (≥100 nm) (21Machwate M. Harada S. Leu C.T. Seedor G. Labelle M. Gallant M. Hutchins S. Lachance N. Sawyer N. Slipetz D. Metters K.M. Rodan S.B. Young R. Rodan G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), completely reversed the anti-inflammatory action of PGE2 in LPS-activated human macrophages. In three independent experiments, the mean inhibition of LPS-stimulated MIP-1β production was 34 ± 7.9% (means ± S.D.) at 0 nm antagonist and 102 ± 3.2% at 100 nmantagonist (Fig. 7). An inactive analog of the EP4R antagonist (L-161,983) at 500 nm did not significantly alter the anti-inflammatory effect of PGE2. Neither compound (500 nm) directly induced MIP-1β production in human macrophages. These observations establish a primary role for the EP4 receptor in the anti-inflammatory action of PGE2 in human MF. The EP4 receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase (22Hwang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that the downstream signaling pathway for the EP4 receptor involves cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and its target proteins such as CREB. We therefore examined the role of members of this signaling pathway in the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on MIP-1β production by using a cell membrane-permeable analog of cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), and a PKA-selective inhibitor, H-89, and tested the relationship between the anti-inflammatory activity of PGE2 and the level of CREB phosphorylation. Similar to PGE2, pretreatment with 8-Br-cAMP (500 μm) suppressed MIP-1β production in LPS-activated MΦ (Fig. 8 A). H-89 (10 μm) inhibited PGE2 or 8-Br-cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 8 B). However, H-89 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of PGE2on MIP-1β production in MΦ (mean ± S.D. inhibition in three independent experiments was 81 ± 8.7% for PGE2 aloneversus 90 ± 1.8% for H-89 + PGE2), suggesting that PKA and CREB do not participate in this pathway. To extend our observations directly to human disease, we sought the expression of the EP4 receptor in human atherosclerotic lesions by staining adjacent sections of human carotid atheroma with anti-EP4 receptor, anti-CD-68, and anti-α smooth muscle actin antibodies. The EP4 receptor localized mainly in MΦ-rich lesions and, to a lesser extent, in intimal smooth muscle cells (Fig. 9, A–C). In contrast, non-atherosclerotic arterial tissues express little or no immunodetectable EP4 receptor (Fig. 9 D). Human atheroma contain various chemokines including MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1β, IP-10, and RANTES (23Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Gordon D. Wilcox J.N. J. Clin.

Targeted disruption of the gene for MCP-1, its receptor CCR-2, or the murine homologue of IL-8 receptor, CXCR-2, significantly decreased atherogenesis in mice (27Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M.

Recent reports suggest that MIP-1β and SDF-1 heighten the thrombotic response that cause acute coronary events, by inducing tissue factor expression on SMC or platelet aggregation (25Schecter A.D. Calderon T.M. Berman A.B. McManus C.M. Fallon J.T. Rossikhina M. Zhao W. Christ G. Berman J.W. Taubman M.B. J. Biol.

Modified LDL and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ, or CD40 ligand induce chemokine expression in cells found in atheroma, such as EC, SMC, and MΦ (31Wang J.M. Sica A. Peri G.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, knowledge of potential endogenous inhibitory mechanisms has lagged behind understanding of pro-inflammatory stimuli. This study demonstrates that PGE2 selectively and potently suppresses the expression of IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and IP-10 in LPS-activated human MΦ. Among atheroma-related prostanoids, PGE2 most potently inhibits chemokine production by MΦ. Interestingly, we did not observe suppression by PGE2 of chemokine expression in activated EC and SMC in culture, indicating the selectivity of the inhibitory effects of PGE2 for MΦ. This observation indicates cell specificity in the molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory actions of PGE2. Other endogenous agonists such as nitric oxide or PPARα activators can attenuate inflammatory function of other cells involved in atherogenesis, such as EC and SMC as well as MΦ (24Mach F. Sauty A.

Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Our data show that PGE2 may minimize the propagation of inflammation initiated by MΦ. Th1 lymphocytes, which produce IFN-γ, express abundant receptors for MIP-1α, MIP-1β (CCR-5), and IP-10 (CXCR3) (36Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Further recruitment of Th1 cells and increased production of IFN-γ in atheroma can jeopardize plaque stability by suppressing collagen synthesis and promoting expression of pro-inflammatory mediators by EC, SMC, and MΦ (3Libby P. Braunwald E. Zipes D.P. Libby P. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. Harcourt, Philadelphia2001: 995-1009Google Scholar, 37Gupta S. Pablo A.M. Jiang X. Wang N. Tall A.R. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). PGE2 may attenuate IFN-γ expression in atheroma by suppressing Th1-related chemokines such as MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or IP-10. PGE2 synthesis from arachidonic acid involves two isoforms of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). Many cells types constitutively express COX-1 (38O'Neill G.P. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of COX-2 generally requires exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, CD40 ligand, or LPS (9Schonbeck U. Sukhova G.K. Graber P. Coulter S. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 39Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among cells found in atheroma, SMC elaborate PGE2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, accompanied by the induction of COX-2 protein (13Libby P. Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Soler M. Camacho M. Escudero J.R. Iniguez M.A. Vila L. Circ.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1644-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using MΦ co-cultured with SMC, we demonstrated that SMC-derived PGE2can reduce MIP-1β production in MΦ. In this experiment, LPS (5 ng/ml) did not induce PGE2 synthesis in SMC directly. Such low concentrations of LPS can stimulate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α by MΦ (data not shown). These macrophage-derived cytokines can then augment PGE2synthesis from SMC in a paracrine manner. A COX-2-selective inhibitor, NS-398, suppressed PGE2 production and restored the production of MIP-1β in the co-cultures. Although usually considered a pro-inflammatory molecule, recent work suggests that COX-2 may actually hasten resolution of acute inflammation (20Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that COX-2 can also exert an anti-inflammatory action in human atheroma through suppression of chemokine expression. Prostanoids and certain fatty acids exert their biological function via cell surface receptors or nuclear receptors such as PPARs. Although the PGE2-derived prostanoids, PGA2 and PGB2, can act as agonists for PPARα and PPARδ (42Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar), these ligands (50 nm) did not inhibit chemokine expression in MΦ (data not shown). This result indicates that PPAR activation does not likely account for the anti-inflammatory actions of PGE2 described here. The interaction of PGE2with specific cell surface receptors presumably mediates its anti-inflammatory action. Four G protein-coupled heptahelical receptors (EP1–4) exist (12Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hwang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that human MΦ predominantly express the EP4 receptor. The experiment using a potent EP4 receptor-selective antagonist shows a role for the EP4 receptor in the anti-inflammatory action of PGE2 in human MΦ. We furthermore showed the expression of EP4 receptor protein within human atheroma. The EP4 receptor localized mainly in macrophage-rich lesions, consistent with a role in modulating inflammation during atherogenesis. Very recent work demonstrated that targeted disruption of the gene for EP4 decreases PGE2-mediated inhibition of TNF-α and IL-12 in LPS-activated mouse macrophages (43Nataraj C. Thomas D.W. Tilley S.L. Nguyen M.T. Mannon R. Koller B.H. Coffman T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), supporting the primary role of the EP4 receptor in the anti-inflammatory pathway in macrophages. The interaction of PGE2 with the EP4 receptor transiently increases intracellular cAMP. cAMP activates PKA, which subsequently phosphorylates downstream effector proteins such as CREB (22Hwang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This pathway appears involved in some PGE2 functions mediated by the EP4 receptor. In this study, a cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, inhibited MIP-1β production. However, our experiments did not support involvement of the PKA and CREB pathway in chemokine suppression by PGE2 in MΦ. In addition, cAMP-elevating ligands may repress NF-κB-dependent transcription by a variety of mechanisms (44Parry G.C. Mackman N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5450-5456PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, NF-κB regulates expression of the genes encoding MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10, and MIP-1α (45Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar, 46Widmer U. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Sherry B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4996-5012PubMed Google Scholar, 47Tomura K. Narumi S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence establishes involvement of the NF-κB signaling in MIP-1β expression (46Widmer U. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Sherry B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4996-5012PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ziegler S.F. Tough T.W. Franklin T.L. Armitage R.J. Alderson M.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2234-2239PubMed Google Scholar). Our cDNA microarray screening demonstrated that PGE2 selectively regulates a subset of genes induced by LPS. For example, PGE2 treatment did not suppress expression of RANTES, a NF-κB-dependent gene (49Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the suppression of NF-κB does not account for the mediated anti-inflammatory actions of PGE2. Elucidation of the mechanism by which EP4 receptor stimulation suppresses chemokine production in MΦ will require further investigation. In summary, these results suggest a novel role of PGE2 as an endogenous inhibitor of inflammation, a finding of potential relevance to atherosclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. From a practical standpoint, this study raises the possibility that modification of PGE2-EP4 receptor signaling might provide a new therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Recent clinical data have raised the possibility that COX-2 inhibitors may increase coronary events in some individuals (50Mukherjee D. Nissen S.E. Topol E.J. JAMA. 2001; 286: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Therefore, fuller characterization of anti-inflammatory pathways stimulated by COX-2-dependent products may have considerable and practical clinical impact in addition to pathophysiological interest.

https://openalex.org/W1985129279,"Increased placental leptin has been demonstrated in preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder associated with placental hypoxia. This suggests that leptin gene expression is enhanced in response to oxygen deficiency in this organ. In support of this hypothesis, we have previously shown that hypoxia activates the leptin promoter in trophoblast-derived BeWo cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric HIF-1α/HIF-1β complex that regulates the transcription of hypoxia-responsive genes. To test whether this factor is involved in hypoxia-induced leptin promoter activation, BeWo cells were transiently transfected with a HIF-1α expression vector. Exogenous HIF-1α markedly increased luciferase reporter activity driven by the leptin promoter when HIF-1β was co-expressed in the same cells. This effect was similar to that elicited by CoCl2, an agent known to stabilize endogenous HIF-1α. These data suggest that HIF-1α/HIF-1β dimers are involved in the effect of CoCl2 to activate the leptin promoter. To confirm the implication of HIF-1, the cells were transfected with a dominant negative form of HIF-1α producing transcriptionally inactive HIF-1β/HIF-1α dimers. This mutant HIF-1α protein abolished CoCl2 activation of the leptin promoter, providing direct evidence that the effect of CoCl2 is mediated by endogenous HIF-1α. Deletion analysis and site-specific mutagenesis demonstrated that a HIF-1 consensus binding site (HRE) spanning −120 to −116 bp relative to the start site was required for CoCl2 and exogenous HIF-1α induction of leptin promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed with in vitro-translated HIF-1α and HIF-1β proteins demonstrated binding to this HRE and not to mutated sequences only when both subunits were used together. These data demonstrate that leptin is a new hypoxia-inducible gene, which is stimulated in a placental cell line through HIF-1 interaction with a consensus HRE site located at −116 in the proximal promoter."

It is capable both of responding to nonspecific stimuli, such as bacterial lipopolysaccarides (LPS)1 and activated complement factors, but can also engage processes of the acquired immune response such as antibody-dependent opsonization and subsequent antigen presentation to T-cells (1Gordon S.

Macrophage function can be influenced profoundly by cytokines released from T-cells and other immune cells. These cytokines have been divided largely along two axes: TH1 cytokines, dominated by INF-γ and TH2 cytokines, dominated by IL-4 (3Mosmann T.R. Cherwinski H. Bond M.W. Giedlin M.A. Coffman R.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2348-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage stimulation by TH1 cytokines results in free-radical release and increased cytokine secretion, implicated as essential signaling components of a successful response to infection by intracellular bacteria and viruses (4Heinzel F.P.

In contrast, efficient defense against extracellular pathogens and parasites requires a different response, characterized by the release of TH2 cytokines (7Finkelman F.D. Urban Jr., J.F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 772-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These mediate B-cell class switching to IgE antibodies, macrophage opsonization of soluble antigens, and activation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. These two cytokine axes have been proposed to be mutually antagonistic, both in the commitment of T-cells toward a TH1 or TH2 lineage and in their influence on effector cells such as the macrophage. In parallel with the separation of T-cells into either TH1- or TH2-biased cells, a number of groups have proposed recently that the exposure of macrophages to a specific set of cytokines also biases them toward either an M-1 phenotype (activated macrophages) or an M-2 phenotype (alternatively activated macrophages) (8Mills C.D.

Macrophage exposure to IL-4 substantially blunts subsequent LPS- or INFγ-stimulated production of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α), receptors (CD14, FcγI, FcγII, and FcγIII), and superoxide radicals (11Goerdt S.

At the same time, macrophage exposure to IL-4 results in the increased expression of scavenger receptors (the mannose receptor, the scavenger receptor type I, and CD163), CD13 (the aminopeptidase, capable of inactivating inflammatory mediators), and CD23 (FcεRII), thus blunting the cytotoxic effects of the macrophage and shifting its opsonizing focus from IgG antibodies to IgE while increasing its phagocytic capabilities (9Dickensheets H.L.

Allergic challenge of BALB/c mice with ovalbumin following sensitization has been shown to result in the recruitment of macrophages into an environment enriched in IL-4 and IL-5 (16Zuany-Amorim C. Leduc D. Vargaftig B.B. Pretolani M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Zuany-Amorim C. Creminon C. Nevers M.C. Nahori M.A. Vargaftig B.B. Pretolani M.

This allergic response provides a useful model of macrophages activated alternatively because of the relative abundance of macrophages, the cytokine milieu they are recruited into, and their high expression of arginase I, a marker of macrophages activated alternatively (19Munder M. Eichmann K. Moran J.M. Centeno F. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3771-3777PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this model of allergic response has been used to characterize general allergic phenomenon as they may apply to human pathophysiology of allergy and asthma. INF-γ and LPS induce large and profound transcriptional changes in the macrophage (13Paludan S.R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Nau G.J.

In contrast, relatively few genes have been characterized as direct targets of IL-4 stimulation. The development of large scale expression arrays allows near global glimpses of changes in gene expression profiles during cell proliferation, division, and in response to environmental signals. We applied this technology to probe the transcriptional response of murine macrophages to the quintessential TH2 cytokine, IL-4. Ym1 was one of the most highly induced IL-4 target genes, exhibiting a level of induction of 70-fold or greater in multiple macrophage populations. Studies of the Ym1 promoter suggest that the binding of STAT6 to multiple sites within a 600-bp region up-stream of the transcriptional start site is required for the IL-4 response in BEAS-2B cells and RAW macrophages. Ym1 was also highly induced in macrophages recruited to the peritoneal cavity during allergic peritonitis in an IL-4- and STAT6-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings establish molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response of the most highly induced IL-4 target gene identified to date in macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated by peritoneal lavage 3 days following peritoneal injection of 2.5 ml of 3% thioglycollate (Difco). Cells were plated in 10% RPMI and washed after 5 h. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated by culturing total bone marrow in macrophage colony stimulating factor provided by 30% L-cell-conditioned media for 7 days in RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum (22Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). ECoM-M monocytic leukemia cells were cultured as described previously (23Sykes D.B. Kamps M.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RAW 267.4 macrophages and BAES-2B bovine airway epithelial cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum and RPMI (Invitrogen). Total RNA was purified with Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). cRNA was generated from 10 μg of total RNA using Superscript (Invitrogen) and the high yield RNA transcription labeling kit (Enzo). Fragmented cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix arrays according to manufacturer's instruction. Data was analyzed with Microarray Suite (Affymetrix) and Genespring (Silicongenetics). RNA analysis by Northern blotting followed the procedure of Ausubel (24Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of total RNA were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (Supercharge; Schleicher & Schuell). Prior to hybridization, membranes were UV cross-linked (Stratagene) and stained with methylene blue (MRC). Probes were generated by RT-PCR using the following primers followed by random priming labeling (Invitrogen) and hybridization with QuickHyb (Stratagene): Arginase I, GAAACAGAGTATGACGTGAGAG, AGGTGGTTTAAGGTAGTCAGTC; Ifi30, TTCTGCTTCTGCTGTTCCCACT and ACTCCATGATACTCTCTGTGAC; Hspa5, GTGAGGTAGAAAAGGCTAAGAG and GAAGAAACTCTTTCCCAGTTGC; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, ATCTGGCATCCTCTTGTTGCTA and GATCTCCAAGTGCACAAGCCTA; Ym1, CTGTGTACTCACCTGATCTATG and GAAAGAACCACTGAAGTCATCC; Scya9, TTCTGCTTCTGCTGTTCCCACT and ACTCCATGATACTCTCTGTGAC. Macrophages were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell debris were spun down for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and supernatants were collected. The total protein content was quantified, and 50 μg of total protein was separated on a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-Ym1 antibody (1:500) kindly provided by Shioko Kimura (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Immune complexes were revealed by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript (Invitrogen) and amplified with the following primers: Ym1, CTGGAATTGGTGCCCCTACA and CAAGCATGGTGGTTTTACAGGA or Ym2, CAGAACCGTCAGACATTCATTA and ATGGTCCTTCCAGTAGGTAATA. PCR was performed for 25 cycles with Mastermix Taq (Qiagen) at an annealing temperature of 58 °C and visualized by gel electrophoresis.BstYI digestion was performed on cDNA amplified with primers redundant for Ym1 and Ym2: CCTACCAGCTGATGTGCTACTA and GAAAGAACCACTGAAGTCATCC using Pfu(Stratagene) and for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Protocol followed that of Ausubel (24Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar) with the substitution of Superscript (Invitrogen) for avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. In brief, 10 μg of total RNA from control and IL-4-treated ECoM-M macrophages were hybridized at 65 °C for 90 min to end-labeled primers GGAAGATCCCAGCTGTACGTTCAGAAG or GCACATCAGCTGGTAGGAAGATCCCAG. Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 42 °C with Superscript in the appropriate buffer. RNA was degraded with RNaseH (Invitrogen), and cDNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction, separated on a 9% acrylamide/7 M urea sequencing gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts were generated following Nonidet P-40 cell lysis as described previously (25Guidez F., Li, A.C. Horvai A. Welch J.S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3851-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 10 min on ice with bovine serum albumin (2 μg), poly(dI-dC) (2 μg) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol followed by 30 min on ice with appropriate end-labeled, annealed oligonucleotides as follows: A, GATCCGGCAAGTTCTTTGGAACTCTTA and GATCTAAGAGTTCCAAAGAACTTGCCG; B, GATCTACTTCTTTCTGAAGAATGGTGTG and GATCCACACCATTCTTCAGAAAGAAGTA; C, GATCCAATGTCTTCCATGGAATCAA and GATCTTGATTCCATGGAAGACATTG; D, GATCCTATGTTTCTAAGAAGTGGGTA and GATCTACCCACTTCTTAGAAACATAG. Samples were separated in a gel consisting of 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C, 300 V. Gel was pre-run for 1 h at 4 °C, 300 V. Promoter fragments were amplified from the genomic clone 5b (26Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using Pfx (Stratagene), cloned into TOPOII-Blunt (Invitrogen) and transferred to the BNXH luciferase or minimal TK-luciferase reporter (27Ricote M., Li, A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar) by BamHI/HindIII digestion and subsequent ligation. Promoter constructs used in deletional studies were amplified from genomic clone 5A, a generous gift from Robert B. Kirkpatrick (GlaxoSmithKline) (26Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), using the following primers: CTTAGGATCCCAATATCCATGA TTAAGGATCCAGTGTCCAAGAC, ATGTGGATCCGATTTGTCTAGG, ATAGGGATCCTGACTGAACTGG, TCGCCCTAAGCTTCAGGATTGC, CACCAGATCTGTCAAGATAGC, CCTAGACAGATCTTATTCACATAG, GGGCAGATCTCTGGACATTG, GCTTGGATCCAGGCAAGTTC. Oligonucleotides described for EMSA analysis of the C site were used to generate the multimerized C reporter. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and treated overnight with human IL-4 (10 ng/ml) (Endogen). Extracts were harvested and assayed as described previously (27Ricote M., Li, A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). The expression vector for human STAT6 was a generous gift of William LaRochelle (NCI, National Institutes of Health) (28Patel B.K. Pierce J.H. LaRochelle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of Ym-1/luciferase promoter construct DNA and 3 μg of a murine STAT6 expression vector (gift of Yoshihiro Ohmori). 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector was also co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Ten million cells were electroporated in 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II and pulsing at 280 V, 1070 microfarad. Immediately after pulsing, cells were recovered into pre-warmed RPMI supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, andl-glutamine. The medium was replaced 1 h later with standard 10% fetal calf serum RPMI in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-4, and cells were harvested 16 h later for analysis of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized to control transfected β-galactosidase enzyme activity. Mice were sensitized with subcutaneous injections of 100 μg of ovalbumin (Sigma) absorbed in 0.1 ml of aluminum hydroxide (Inject Alum; Pierce) and 0.1 ml of PBS on days 1 and 7. Efficiency of sensitization was assessed by blood IgE levels and by splenocyte IL-4 production following in vitro ovalbumin challenge. On day 14, mice were challenged with intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of ovalbumin in 0.2 ml of PBS. Cells were harvested at indicated time points. αIL-4 (11B.11) (NCI, National Institutes of Health) was injected 1 h prior to and 4 h after ovalbumin challenge. BALB/c, C57Bl/6, STAT6 knock-out, and WBB6F1/J mice were purchased from Harlan and Jackson Laboratories. Splenocytes were isolated, and B-cells, macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells were depleted by magnetic cell sorting using major histocompatibility complex II (Ia) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 × 107 cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and injected intravenously into naı̈ve mice. 24 h after adoptive transfer, mice were challenged as described above. To assess genome-wide effects of IL-4 on macrophage physiology, we characterized the transcriptional response of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (TG-Mφ) to IL-4 treatment using Affymetrix Mu11kA and Mu11kB microarrays. Together these arrays contain a total of 13179 targets, of which 4215 (∼32%) were scored as being present in at least one of the two treatment groups (Fig.1 A). Arginase I, mannose receptor, and TIMP-2, which have been demonstrated previously to be regulated by IL-4 (30Raveh D. Kruskal B.A. Farland J. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Ihn H. Yamane K. Asano Y. Kubo M. Tamaki K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were induced and served as positive controls (data not shown). In addition, several additional genes were induced, including the glucose-regulated heat shock protein Hspa5 (GenBankTM accession number AA086684, Unigene accession number Mm.918), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 (NM_011593, Mm.8245), the cytokine Scya9 or MIP-1γ (U19482, Mm.2271), and the interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase Ifi30 (AA106931, Mm.30241) (Fig. 1 B). A more complete description of the global transcriptional response of macrophages to IL-4 will be presented elsewhere. 2Welch et al., manuscript in preparation. Two genes were up-regulated dramatically in both the array experiment and subsequent confirmation, arginase I (U51805, Mm.154144) and Ym1 (M94584, Mm.4571) (Fig. 1). The up-regulation of arginase I in response to IL-4 has been described previously and suggested to be an important marker of macrophage bias toward an M-2 phenotype (19Munder M. Eichmann K. Moran J.M. Centeno F. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3771-3777PubMed Google Scholar), where it competes with the inducible nitric-oxide synthase for a common substrate (32Rutschman R. Lang R. Hesse M. Ihle J.N. Wynn T.A. Murray P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2173-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little is known about the transcriptional regulation of Ym1, a member of the chitinase family that is sufficiently similar to Ym2 at the nucleotide sequence level to make it difficult to differentiate the two by microarray and Northern blot techniques. Ym1/2 expression is up-regulated in response to IL-4 stimulation in multiple populations of murine macrophages including bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-Mφ), TG-Mφ, and the immortalized monocytic cell line ECoM-M (23Sykes D.B. Kamps M.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Aand B) (data not shown). Induction of Ym1/2 in primary macrophages was found to be STAT6-dependent as Ym1/2 expression did not respond to IL-4 in TG-Mφ derived from STAT6-deficient mice (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, three separate clones of the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 failed to up-regulate Ym1/2, suggesting a lack of an essential signaling component in these cells (data not shown). Although multiple populations of primary murine macrophages robustly up-regulate Ym1/2 expression in response to IL-4 stimulation, the mixed splenocyte population, consisting largely of T-cells and B-cells, with a smaller population of monocytes, displayed a blunted response, suggesting that the response to direct stimulation with IL-4 may be largely monocyte-/macrophage-specific (data not shown). We examined the responsiveness of Ym1/2 expression to a large panel of cytokines and macrophage stimuli. In addition to IL-4, IL-13 was capable of strongly inducing Ym1/2 RNA and protein expression and did so nearly equally (Fig. 2, C and D). Both of these cytokines bind to the γ-common chain of the IL-4 receptor resulting in STAT6 activation (33de Vries J.E. J Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 165-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, INF-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14PGJ2, and LPS failed to induce Ym1/2 expression (Fig. 2 D) (data not shown). Thus, Ym1/2 induction appeared, as arginase I, to be a restricted response to TH2-biased cytokines. Because arginase I was described to be induced synergistically by IL-4 and IL-10 in bone marrow-differentiated macrophages and dendritic cells (19Munder M. Eichmann K. Moran J.M. Centeno F. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3771-3777PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the effect of the combination of these cytokines on Ym1 expression in TG-Mφ. Although IL-4-induced Ym1 RNA expression seemed to be increased slightly further by IL-10 (Fig. 2 F), no synergy between these two cytokines was observed at the protein level (Fig.2 E). Ym1 is related closely to Ym2, another member of the murine chitinase family (26Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ym2 shares 95% RNA sequence identity with Ym1 (34Webb D.C. McKenzie A.N. Foster P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41969-41976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR and primers specific for Ym1 or Ym2, we identified the IL-4-induced macrophage transcript as Ym1 (Fig. 2 G). In addition, Ym1 and Ym2 can be distinguished based on three restriction sites: ScaI, BglII, and BstYI.ScaI specifically digests Ym1, BglII specifically digests Ym2, and BstYI digests Ym1 in two fragments of nearly equal size and Ym2 in three fragments. We amplified a 1054-bp product with primers common to Ym1 and Ym2 from the same RT reactions and found that digestion with BstYI yielded a single band of ∼520 bp (Fig. 2 H). BglII digestion did not alter the size of the fragment, and ScaI digestion yielded two fragments, one 880 bp, and the other 270 bp (data not shown). This digestion pattern further confirms that the IL-4-induced macrophage transcript was Ym1. To characterize the promoter and enhancer structure of Ym1, we identified a trace sequence (krv64h11.b1) from the mouse genome project containing the first exon of Ym1 (26Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Using primers specific for exon 1 and exon 3, we confirmed that this promoter sequence was located immediately up-stream of exon 1 and 3.4 kb up-stream of exon 3 in both the Lambda FIXII clone 5A (26Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in the Celera database (mCG10749) (data not shown). This is important, because exons 1–3 of Ym2 differ from exons 1–3 of Ym1 only by nine nucleotides, but intron 1 of Ym2 (mCG63439) is 4.3 kb, allowing one to distinguish between promoters of Ym1 and Ym2 by their position relative to exon 3. Using primer extension analysis, we identified the mRNA start site and found it to be 20 nucleotides up-stream of the ATG located in exon 1 (Fig. 3) (data not shown). The trace krv64h11.b1 and clone 5A sequence matched the information in the Celera database, with the exception of the deletion of a single T, 29 nucleotides up-stream of the mRNA start site. Previous work has characterized the canonical binding site for STAT proteins as the sequence TTCNXGAA (35Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). STAT6 homodimers generally prefer binding to sites containing a four-nucleotide spacer (N4), whereas STAT1 homodimers generally prefer a three nucleotide spacer (N3) (Fig. 3 C). We identified four such sites in the 600 nucleotides up-stream of the transcriptional start site and only one in the next 9400 nucleotides up-stream. Two of these (A and C) are canonical N4 sites, whereas the most immediate site up-stream of the start site, D, is an N3site (Fig. 3 C). The B site contains two overlapping sites, one an N5 and the other an N4. The A, C, and D sites all bound IL-4-inducible complexes with similar mobility when incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from BM-Mφ as assessed by EMSA analysis, with strongest binding to the A site (Fig.4 A). These complexes were absent in BM-Mφ from STAT6-deficient mice, indicating that they contain STAT6 and require its presence for DNA binding. In contrast, nuclear extracts from the ECoM-M cell line induced IL-4-dependent shifts on the A and C probes but bound a complex with different mobility on the D probe that was lost after IL-4 activation (Fig. 4 B). We were unable to identify this complex by supershift analysis with antibodies against STAT1α, STAT2, STAT5a, and STAT5b. Unlike the A and C sites, the D site is an N3 site. This differential binding of complexes in different cell types, one induced and one lost during IL-4 stimulation, suggests that the D site may be an important negative regulator or modulator of basal Ym1 expression in some cell types. The B site was not retarded in the presence of nuclear extracts from cells under either condition, suggesting that the overlapping sequences prevent binding of STAT6 to this site (data not shown). The lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was chosen initially for analysis of the Ym1 promoter because of its responsiveness to IL-4 upon expression of STAT6 (36Conrad D.J. Lu M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Ym1 promoter (−664 to +27) was induced consistently 10-fold by IL-4 treatment when these cells were co-transfected with a STAT6 expression vector (Fig. 4 C). IL-4 induction was not observed in the absence of cotransfected STAT6 (data not shown). Constructs lacking the A site were no longer responsive to IL-4 stimulation (D1, −630 to +27; D2, −550 to +27; D3, −326 to +27; D4, −176 to +27) (Fig. 4 C). Although the B and C sites were not sufficient for responses to IL-4 in the context of the YM1 proximal promoter, the multimerized C site (3xC-TK) was as responsive to IL-4 as the multimerized STAT6 site from the human 12/15-lipoxygenase promoter (4xSTAT6-TK) (36Conrad D.J. Lu M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 C). A 3′-deletion series of the YM1 promoter was tested for the ability to enhance the activity of the TK promoter in an IL-4-dependent ma"

In contrast to the close structural similarity of fibrils formed in different amyloid diseases, the structures of the corresponding native proteins differ widely. We show here that peptides as short as 4 residues with the sequences KFFE or KVVE can form amyloid fibrils that are practically identical to fibrils formed in association with disease, as judged by electron microscopy and Congo red staining. In contrast, KLLE or KAAE do not form fibrils. The fibril-forming KFFE and KVVE show partial β-strand conformation in solution, whereas the non-fibril-forming KLLE and KAAE show random structure only, suggesting that inherent propensity for β-strand conformation promotes fibril formation. The peptides KFFK or EFFE do not form fibrils on their own but do so in an equimolar mixture. Thus, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, either between charged dipolar peptides or between complementary charges of co-fibrillating peptides favor fibril formation.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data suggest that the proteins have polymerized into a cross-β-sheet structure with the β-strands perpendicular to the fibril axis (2Sunde M. Blake C.C.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The structure of amyloid fibrils is typically very similar, although the polypeptides they are formed from can be highly dissimilar in their native states. Initially, only a few peptides and proteins were considered capable of forming fibrils, although also short fragments of amyloidogenic proteins form fibrils. More recently, it has been established that even globular all-helical proteins like myoglobin, which normally do not give rise to amyloid, can be converted to fibrils if incubated under partly denaturing conditions (3Fändrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This suggests that most proteins have the potential to form amyloid fibrils. It is not known which features cause a few specific proteins to form amyloid fibrils in vivo. Some amyloidogenic peptides and proteins harbor specific α-helices that are predicted to generate β-strands (4Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and evidence that aggregation is initiated from particular regions of a polypeptide chain is accumulating (5Taddei N. Capanni C. Chiti F. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37149-37154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, the peptides NFGAIL from islet amyloid polypeptide, HQKLVFFAED from the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ),1 and VQIVYK from tau form fibrils and are crucial for fibril formation of the full-length peptides (6Azriel R. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34156-34161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 7Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehöök C. Terenius L.

Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Common to these sequences is the presence of hydrophobic amino acids of which at least one is aromatic. In this work, we aimed to explore the minimum requirements for fibril formation in short model peptides. The results show that peptides as short as 4 residues can form amyloid fibrils. Hydrophobic residues with high propensities for β-strand conformation and residues with complementary charges promote fibril formation, and positively and negatively charged peptides can copolymerize. All peptides were purchased from Interactiva (Darmstadt, Germany) and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column and a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile supplemented with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The identity of the peptides was verified with electrospray mass spectrometry. The peptides were incubated at 200 or 300 μm for 10 days at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or in water, pH 5.0. The co-incubation of KFFK and EFFE employed 100 μm of each peptide. After incubation the peptide solutions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g, and pelleted material was suspended in 40 μl of water by low energy sonication for 5 s. Aliquots of 8 μl were placed on EM grids covered by a carbon-stabilized Formvar film. Excess fluid was withdrawn after 30 s, and after air drying the grids were negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate in water. The stained grids were examined and photographed in a Philips CM120TWIN electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Determination of fibril widths was made from high magnification micrographs (×180,000–200,000) viewed under a ×15 magnifier equipped with a graduated scale glass. Pelleted material was mixed with Congo red dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, and incubated overnight. The sample was spun at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in TBS and spun at 16,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in fresh TBS and transferred to a microscope slide and viewed under polarized light at ×200 magnification. For analysis of secondary structure by CD spectroscopy peptides were dissolved at 300 μmconcentration in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, or water. Immediately after solubilization, CD spectra between 180 and 260 nm were recorded at 20 °C with 2-s response time, 2 data points/nm, and scan speed of 20 nm/min using an AVIV model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Jacksonville, NJ). To compensate for the contributions of the phenylalanine side chains to the CD spectra, the spectrum of the dipeptide FF was subtracted from the spectra of peptides containing an FF sequence. Residual molar ellipticities (θ) were calculated from peptide concentrations determined by amino acid analysis, and are expressed in kilodegrees × cm2/dmol. To find the minimum requirements for fibril formation, we investigated the peptides KFFE, KVVE, KLLE, KAAE, KFFK, and EFFE. Lysine and glutamate have high β-sheet pair correlation,i.e. they are often found in neighboring strands in β-sheets (9Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and KE-rich peptides form fibrils (10Zhang S. Holmes T. Lockshin C. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3334-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine and valine are frequent in β-strands, whereas leucine and alanine are overrepresented in helices (4Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 days KFFE and KVVE produce sedimentable amyloid fibrils (1.2–1.6 nm in width) and fibril bundles as detected by EM (Fig.1 a). Moreover, the tetrapeptide aggregates show a classical Congo red birefringence under polarized light (Fig. 1 b). The tetrapeptide fibrils are indistinguishable from disease-associated amyloid fibrils in these respects. The peptides KLLE and KAAE do not form fibrils, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions are not sufficient for fibril formation. Removal of the terminal charges of KFFE by acetylating the N terminus and amidating the C terminus significantly reduced fibril formation. Fibril formation of KFFE and KVVE was more pronounced in water than in phosphate buffer, indicating that charge attractions are important for fibril formation. The peptides KFFK and EFFE do not form fibrils when incubated individually. However, coincubation of equimolar amounts of KFFK and EFFE produce fibrils as detected by EM (Fig.2). Typically, these fibrils were shorter and thicker (average width, 2.5–3.0 nm) than the fibrils formed from KFFE or KVVE and were also grouped into small aggregates. Fibrils virtually identical to those shown in Fig. 1 a, although less abundant, were formed also from the KFFK/EFFE mixture. Thus, heteropolymers can be formed from peptides with complementary charges.Figure 2Fibrils formed from co-incubated KFFK and EFFE. Electron micrograph of fibrils formed from 100 μm KFFK and 100 μm EFFE incubated together. Scale bar, 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we investigated whether shorter peptides could form fibrils. The tripeptides were chosen based on optimal charge complementarity (KFE) and maximal β-strand propensity (VVV and FFF). Neither of these peptides formed fibrils. Therefore, we conclude that 4 residues are necessary and sufficient for fibril formation. CD spectra of freshly dissolved KFFE show two minima in the 216–217 and 198–200 nm regions (Fig.3 A), diagnostic of coexisting β-strand and random structures. In contrast, non-fibrillogenic KAAE (Fig. 3 B) and KLLE (data not shown) show CD spectra with one minimum at about 190 nm and a broad maximum around 215 nm, typical of an unordered structure. The comparison of the CD spectra of KVVE and KAAE (Fig. 3 B) highlights the presence of β-strand structure in KVVE, evidenced by the decrease in ellipticity between 210 and 220 nm, a red shift of the short wavelength minimum, and increased ellipticity around 190 nm. The CD spectra of the non-fibrillating KFFK and EFFE (Fig.4) show the same features as the spectrum of KFFE. The spectrum of co-incubated KFFK and EFFE was virtually identical to the spectra of the individual peptides, suggesting that a significant part of the β-strand structure is present in the monomeric peptides. Many proteins and peptides form fibrils. The determinants for fibril formation are not fully understood. Here we show that peptides as short as 4 residues can form amyloid fibrils and that β-strand structure in solution and attractive electrostatic interactions are required for fibrillogenesis. KFFE and KVVE are the shortest fibril-forming peptides known to date and could serve as models for further studies of amyloid fibril formation and structure. The similarity in fibril formation efficiency and secondary structure of KFFE and KVVE indicates that β-strand structure as such is a strong determinant of fibril formation. This suggests that the frequent occurrence of aromatic residues, in particular F, in amyloid-forming proteins is in part related to their high β-strand propensities (4Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, also the contributions from π interactions between phenylalanines in adjacent strands are probably important (11Gazit E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The principles for fibril formation now proposed are in good agreement with previous results from studies of amyloid-forming peptides. For example, it has been found that changing the sequence KLVFF in Aβ (positions 16–20) to AAVFA prevents fibril formation (12Tjernberg L.O. Naslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlstrom A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), as would be predicted from the present results. Likewise, a V18A replacement in Aβ reduces the capacity to form fibrils (13Soto C. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), which is in excellent agreement with the different fibrillation capacity now found for KVVE and KAAE. This agreement is noteworthy, as the peptides now studied are not derived from known fibril-forming proteins but were designed from basic structural features of amino acid residues. The fibril formation was more pronounced at low salt concentrations, indicating that charge interactions are important. The peptides KFFK or EFFE did not form fibrils when incubated alone but did so when co-incubated. Thus, the possibility of K-E interactions seems to be essential. These results and the high pair correlation of K and E in β-sheets (9Wouters M.A. Curmi P.M. Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) suggest that the peptides KFFE and KVVE have an antiparallel alignment in the fibrils. An energy-minimized model of KFFE in an antiparallel alignment is shown in Fig.5. If the present fibrils are composed of the tetrapeptides in a cross-β-sheet conformation, their width should be 1.4 nm (4-residue β-strand). This was found to be the case; the width of 10 measured fibrils was 1.2–1.6 nm. In general, the appearance of amyloid fibrils as observed by EM is similar, independent of size and structure of the native protein. The smallest widths in amyloid fibrils formed from 40-residue Aβ and ∼350-residue transpeptidase are 3–4 nm, and for the 100-residue C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein and the ∼600-residue coagulation factor XIII, 4–6-nm fibrils are found (4Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The widths of the fibrils apparently do not correspond to the size of the protein of which they are composed. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include that the protein in question makes several intramolecular β-strands in the direction of the fibril and that only a fraction of the polypeptide chain is incorporated in the fibrils. The possibility that amyloid fibrils made from different proteins and peptides can be composed of β-strands as short as 4 residues may help to explain why attempts to find common motifs among these proteins have so far been largely unsuccessful. Help from Nenad Bogdanovic and Erik Nordling in the preparation of figures is greatly appreciated."

The adrenergic control was assessed by studying the levels of β3- and α2A-adrenergic receptors (AR) and by determining the lipolytic response to norepinephrine (β1-, β2-, β3-, and α2-AR agonist), isoprenaline (β1-, β2-, and β3-AR agonist), and CGP12177A (selective partial β3-AR agonist but β1- and β2-AR antagonist) together with post-receptor agents, forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The female rats that had greater oxygen consumption showed higher UCP1 content, a higher multilocular arrangement, and both longer cristae and higher cristae dense mitochondria in BAT indicating heightened thermogenic capacity and activity; this picture is accompanied by a more sensitive β3-AR to norepinephrine signal (EC50 10-fold lower for CGP12177A) and a lower expression of α2A-AR than male rats. Taken together, our results support the idea that the BAT hormonal environment could be involved in the control of different elements of lipolytic and thermogenic adrenergic pathways. Gender dimorphism is both at receptor (changing α2A-AR density and β3-AR affinity) and post-receptor (modulating the links involved in the adrenergic signal transduction) levels. These changes in adrenergic control could be responsible, at least in part, both for the important mitochondrial recruitment differences and functional and morphological features of BAT in female rats under usual rodent housing temperatures.

FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Within this overall response, brown adipose tissue (BAT)1 is the main effector of non-shivering thermogenesis, with UCP1 as the principal mediator (2Nedergaard J. Golozoubova V. Matthias A. Asadi A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 82-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 3Matthias A. Ohlson K.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25073-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). UCP1 is an inner-membrane mitochondrial protein whose function is to uncouple the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis by dissipating the proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain as heat (4Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 3-10Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Activity and expression of UCP1 is under adrenergic control. The main physiological regulator of BAT thermogenesis is norepinephrine (NE), released by sympathetic terminals that densely innervate this tissue, which promotes thermogenesis activation in two ways. First, adrenergic stimulation promotes BAT differentiation increasing the UCP1 expression (2Nedergaard J. Golozoubova V. Matthias A. Asadi A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochim. Biophys.

Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12 Suppl. 1: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Second, adrenergic stimulation increases release of FFA, which are positive UCP1 modulators (11Lafontan M. Berlan M. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 716-738PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 347: 643-651Crossref Google Scholar), supporting the concept that lipolysis represents the flux-generating step controlling BAT respiration (10Atgie C. D'allaire F. Bukowiecki L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1136-C1142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of catecholamines on thermogenic and lipolytic activity are mainly mediated by adrenergic receptors (9Lafontan M. Barbe P. Galitzky J. Tavernier G. Langin D. Carpene C. Bousquet-Melou A. Berlan M. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12 Suppl. 1: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the β-adrenoreceptors (β1-AR, β2-AR, and β3-AR), positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, co-exist with α2-AR, negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (11Lafontan M. Berlan M. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 716-738PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, β3-AR is quantitatively the most abundant of adrenoreceptors in brown adipocytes (12Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 347: 643-651Crossref Google Scholar) and is the most important adrenoreceptor coupled to the induction of UCP1 synthesis (13Rehnmark S. Nechad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16464-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chaudhry A. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R147-R153PubMed Google Scholar); it is also the predominant receptor to mediate agonist-induced lipolysis in adipocytes (15Germack R. Starzec A.B. Vassy R. Perret G.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Zhao J. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R2002-R2011PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been well established that the α2/β3-AR balance is key in the regulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis by modulating the net adrenergic signal response in the adipocyte (17Valet P. Grujic D. Wade J. Ito M. Zingaretti M.C. Soloveva V. Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Cinti S. Lafontan M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol.

Gender dimorphism in energy metabolism has been established, and in particular some differences have been found in brown adipose tissue thermogenic capacity (18Rodriguez E. Monjo M. Rodriguez-Cuenca S. Pujol E. Amengual B. Roca P. Palou A. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Roca P. Rodriguez A.M. Oliver P. Bonet M.L. Quevedo S.

Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is known that there is a positive correlation between the energy metabolism of a tissue and the general morphological features of the mitochondria of this tissue, such as the number and size of mitochondria and also the surface area and cristae density (cristae length per mitochondrial area) (21Ghadially F.N. Ultrastructural Pathology of the Cell and Matrix. 3rd Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, London1988: 194Google Scholar). Thus, this study was designed to investigate further gender dimorphism in BAT thermogenesis and its adrenergic control and also to analyze whether the gender differences in thermogenic capacity and activity correspond to particular mitochondrial morphological features. 110-Day-old Wistar rats, 32 female and 32 male rats (supplied by CRIFFA, Barcelona, Spain), were randomized into the following four studies: thermogenic BAT parameters, indirect calorimetry, electron microscopic analysis, and lipolysis determination. They were housed in group cages (2 rats/cage) at 22 °C, with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 h), with free access to water and food. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were assessed with a Power Lab analyzer (ADInstruments PTY Ltd., Australia). Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured independently in four experiments (14 male and 14 female rats) by open circuit respirometry (flow rate 1 liter/min). VO2 and VCO2 were adjusted for mass (ml·min−1 × kg0.75). A separate value for respiratory quotient (RQ = VCO2/VO2) was calculated. Animals were allowed to become acclimated for 30 min before data collection was initiated, which was continued for 2 h before the beginning of the 12-h light cycle. Room temperature was maintained at 22 °C. Data recordings were made every 120 s and were averaged over the entire collection period. All animals (8 male and 8 female rats) were killed by decapitation at the start of the light cycle. The interscapular BAT depot was dissected and weighed. The BAT was then homogenized in HEPES/sucrose buffer (250 mmsucrose, 1 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA) with a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Homogenate was used for total protein content, cytochrome-c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) activity determination, and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COX activity was measured using a spectrophotometric method (23Wharton D. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-246Crossref Scopus (1331) Google Scholar); DNA was measured using diaminobenzoic acid method (24Thomas P.S. Farquhar M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the triglyceride content was measured using the Folch extract (25Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and determined with a Sigma chemical kit (triglycerides triglyceride (INT)20). Brown adipocytes were isolated from BAT of each rat (7 male and 7 female rats) by modification of the method of O'Donnell and Horwitz (55O'Donnell M.E. Horwitz B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C46-C51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell counts were performed with an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Measurements of lipolytic activity were performed by incubating isolated adipocytes (125,000 cells/ml) at 37 °C in a shaking bath in 0.5 ml of KRB buffer (modified with 4% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm glucose, 250 units/ml penicillin, and 250 μg/ml streptomycin) in the presence of various concentrations of lipolytic agents under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in O2, and then incubated for 60 min in a 37 °C shaking (49 cpm) water bath. The ligands and concentrations used in this study are as follows: norepinephrine (β1-, β2-, β3-, and α2-AR agonist), isoprenaline (β1-, β2-, and β3-AR agonist), CGP12177A (selective partial β3-AR agonist but β1- and β2-AR antagonist), forskolin (stimulating adenylyl cyclase) from 10−9 to 10−4m, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (stimulating protein kinase A) from 10−9 to 10−3m. After 60 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped in an ice water bath for 30 min to allow the adipocytes to separate from the buffer, and aliquots (200 μl) of the cell-free medium were taken to determine the glycerol concentration, as an index of lipolysis. The glycerol content of the deproteinated supernatant was determined enzymatically with a Sigma chemical kit (triglyceride (GPO-Trinder) number 337). Varying amounts of BAT total protein of homogenate (15 μg for UCP1 and 25 μg for adrenergic receptor) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide for UCP1 and 9% polyacrylamide for adrenergic receptors) according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransfered onto a nitrocellulose filter as described elsewhere (27Puigserver P. Llado I. Palou A. Gianotti M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Staining with Ponceau S was used to provide visual evidence for correct loading and electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose filter. Blocking and development of the immunoblots were performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against UCP1 and goat polyclonal antibodies against α2A-adrenergic receptor and β3-adrenergic receptor were used as primary antibodies. Bands in films were analyzed by scanner photodensitometry and quantified using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software. Autoradiograms of membrane proteins revealed a protein exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 32, 58, and 55 kDa, for UCP1, β3-AR, and α2A-AR, respectively. The difference between the values obtained for β3-AR and α2A-AR and the corresponding calculated molecular mass based on the deduced amino acids of rat genes, is attributed to the presence of carbohydrate moiety (28Cervantes-Olivier P.

For electron microscopic examination, BAT was carefully removed and placed in ice-cold fixative buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m trihydrated sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2) for 6 h. The specimens were then washed four times in 0.2 m trihydrated sodium cacodylate buffer and postfixed (1% OsO4) for 2 h. The fixed pellets were dehydrated in graded acetone steps, stained with 2% uranyl acetate overnight, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections for electron microscopy, about 50 nm thick, were stained with saturated lead citrate solution and examined by a Hitachi H-600 electron microscope at 75 kV. Transmission electron micrographs were obtained at magnifications of ×2,500 for locularity analysis and ×15,000 for mitochondrial analysis. For morphometric studies, scanning and transmission electron micrographs were analyzed by Scion Image and Zeiss KS-100 software. In the case of locularity evaluation, the analysis was performed randomly in a double-blind test; sections (three from each animal) were independently graded (by five people) for degree of multilocularity. In the case of mitochondrial morphology, the analysis was performed randomly from 340 mitochondria from three animals per group. All enzymes, substrates, and coenzymes were obtained from Sigma. Antibody for UCP1 was obtained from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX), and antibodies for β3-AR and α2A-AR were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (±)-Norepinephrine bitartrate salt, (−)-isoproterenol (+)-bitartrate salt (isoprenaline), forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), andClostridium histolyticum collagenase type II were obtained from Sigma. (±)-CGP12177A was obtained from Research Biochemicals International. Reagents for glycerol determination and routine chemicals used were from Sigma, Panreac (Spain), Amersham Biosciences, and Cultek (Spain). The lipolytic activity was expressed as a percentage stimulation over basal lipolysis levels. All agonists caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of glycerol release that reached a plateau at the highest agonist concentrations. Dose-response curves for agonists and the differences between male and female rats in the maximal capacity and EC50 differences were fitted with nonlinear regression analysis for sigmoidal curves using GraFit computer program (R. J. Leatherbarrow, version 4, Erithacus Software Ltd.). This data processing allowed us to calculate the maximal stimulation of the glycerol release induced by each agonist, and EC50 was used as an affinity value. Likewise the differences between male and female rats in the maximal capacity and EC50 values were obtained with the same program. The level of probability was set at p < 0.05 as statistically significant. With respect to body and tissue weights, COX activity, protein, DNA, triglyceride content and oxygen consumption, adrenergic receptor levels, basal lipolysis, and morphometric analysis, differences between groups were assessed by Student's t test. The analysis was performed with SPSS 10.0 for Windows. The level of probability was set at p < 0.05 as statistically significant. Previous studies (19Roca P. Rodriguez A.M. Oliver P. Bonet M.L.

Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have clearly demonstrated that female rats show a lower threshold temperature for cold-induced thermogenic response, showing a higher thermogenic capacity at 22 °C, the usual rodent housing temperature, than males. Thus, in order to establish further the characterization of this response, some BAT parameters were obtained in female and male rats (see TableI). Female rats showed clear signs of BAT recruitment compared with males; their BAT depot represented a higher percentage of total body mass (47% with respect to males) showing marked BAT hypertrophia with a lower DNA content and higher triglyceride and protein content. The greater amount of protein has been attributed to an increase of mitochondrial protein (20Quevedo S. Roca P. Pico C. Palou A. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of gender on body weight and general BAT parameters in male and female ratsParameterMalesFemalesBody weight (g)451 ± 5290 ± 3aValues shown are femalesversus males.BAT weight (mg tissue)372 ± 12353 ± 19% BAT body mass (g IBAT · 103/g animal)0.82 ± 0.031.21 ± 0.06aValues shown are femalesversus males.DNA (mg/g tissue)1.88 ± 0.101.50 ± 0.12aValues shown are femalesversus males.Triglycerides (mg/g tissue)280 ± 26356 ± 34Protein (mg/g tissue)90.5 ± 11.5130 ± 15aValues shown are femalesversus males.Data are the means ± S.E. of 8 animals per group.

Although there was no significant difference in specific COX activity (IU/mg protein) between genders (see TableII), female rats had a higher COX activity per g of tissue (38% with respect to males). The UCP1 levels (per mg of protein) were higher in female rats (representative Western blots are given in Fig. 1), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the levels of UCP1 per g of tissue were 70% higher (statistically different) in female rats than male rats. In the same way, the UCP1 content corrected per Kg0.75 was, in females, ∼2-fold that of males. The COX/UCP1 ratio was lower in female rats, which could indicate a tendency to higher uncoupling of the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis.Table IIEffect of gender on BAT levels of UCP1 and α2A-, β3-AR, and protein levels in male and female Wistar ratsParameterMalesFemalesSpecific COX activity (IU/mg protein)0.81 ± 0.120.68 ± 0.09COX activity (IU/g tissue)72.8 ± 7.1101 ± 11aValues shown are femalesversus males.UCP1 (a.u./μg protein)ba.u. indicates arbitrary units.100 ± 15116 ± 12UCP1 (a.u./g tissue)100 ± 19170 ± 15aValues shown are femalesversus males.COX/UCP1 ratio1.00 ± 0.240.63 ± 0.16β3-AR (a.u./μg protein)100 ± 14104 ± 13β3-AR (a.u./g tissue)100 ± 15140 ± 26α2A-AR (a.u./μg protein)100 ± 19.253 ± 7.3aValues shown are femalesversus males.α2A-AR (a.u./g tissue)100 ± 13.180.3 ± 10.7α2A-AR/β3-AR ratio1.00 ± 0.120.45 ± 0.08aValues shown are femalesversus males.UCP1 and adrenergic receptor mean values of the male rats were set as 100%; calculated ratios of COX/UCP1 and α2A/β3-AR of male rats were set as 1.

The data represent the means ± S.E. of 8 animals per group. Significant differences are from Student'st test (p < 0.05). As commented previously, the α2/β3-AR balance is key in the regulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis in BAT by modulating the net adrenergic signal response. It has been established that a lower α2/β3-AR ratio would lead to a greater thermogenic and lipolytic activity and vice versa (18Rodriguez E. Monjo M. Rodriguez-Cuenca S. Pujol E. Amengual B. Roca P. Palou A. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29LLado I. Rodrı́guez-Cuenca S. Pujol E. Monjo M.E. Estrany M. Roca P. Palou A.

In this study, the protein levels of α2A-AR were lower in female than male rats, ∼50% (representative Western blot is given in Fig. 1). With respect to β3-AR protein levels, there were no differences between genders. However, considering the levels of α2A-AR and β3-AR per g of tissue, the profile was modified, with female rats showing higher values of β3-AR and slightly lower levels of α2A-AR. Thus, the lower α2A-/β3-AR ratio in female rats supports the fact that under low adrenergic stimulation they show a higher thermogenic capacity than males. Considering the gender differences in BAT thermogenic capacity, it was interesting to study whether this feature was found in BAT energy expenditure. Because global oxygen consumption is held to correlate positively with BAT oxygen consumption (31Gomez-Ambrosi J. Fruhbeck G. Aguado M. Milagro F.I. Margareto J. Martinez A.J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar), the whole animal O2 consumption, CO2 release, andRQ value were measured (see TableIII). Female rats showed a higher O2 consumption than males; this increase was on the order of 30%. In accordance with this increase, the values of CO2 released also reached higher levels in female rats. In this way, female rats had a higher energy expenditure than males. TheRQ showed no significant differences between genders.Table IIIEffect of gender on O2 consumption, CO2 production, and respiratory quotient (RQ) in male and female ratsParameterMalesFemalesV O2 (ml × min−1 × kg−0.75)12.9 ± 0.617.2 ± 1.7aValues shown are femalesversus males.V CO2 (ml × min−1 × kg−0.75)14.6 ± 0.820.4 ± 1.2aValues shown are femalesversus males.Respiratory quotient1.14 ± 0.041.26 ± 0.08Data are the means ± S.E. of 14 animals per group.

Significant differences are from Student's t test (p < 0.05). In addition, in order to evaluate further whether the findings commented above (concerning thermogenic features of brown adipose tissue in both males and females) were reflected in particular histological characteristics, a whole tissue histological study was performed. Thus, female BAT showed a more shaped multilocular brown adipocyte structure, i.e. numerous small lipid droplets dispersed in the cytoplasmic space around a central nucleus (see Fig. 2). This picture is characteristic of the greater thermogenic activation situation of this tissue (32McBennet S.M. Andrews J.F. Challoner D. Jakobson M.E. Obesity in Europe. John Libbey & Co. Ltd., London1993: 399-406Google Scholar), indicating that female rats showed an increased thermogenic activity in BAT compared with male rats. Because mitochondria do not always have the same distribution or the same morphological or biochemical features varying in several physiological situations (33Lanni A. Moreno M. Lombardi A. Goglia F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial morphometric parameters were also studied in order to analyze the existence of gender-related differences. Thus, the area, perimeter, cristae length, and cristae density were measured (see TableIV). Female rats showed a greater size of mitochondria than males: larger area (20%), longer perimeter (10%), greater cristae length (42%), and higher mitochondrial cristae density (14%) than male rats. In Fig. 3, representative photographs of BAT mitochondria from male and female rats can be observed. It is possible to appreciate that female BAT had bigger mitochondria and a greater amount of cristae.Table IVEffects of gender on the mitochondrial morphometric parameters in BATParameterMalesFemalesArea (μm2)0.51 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.02aValues shown are femalesversus males.Perimeter (μm)2.77 ± 0.043.03 ± 0.04aValues shown are femalesversus males.Cristae length (μm)7.37 ± 0.2210.5 ± 0.35aValues shown are femalesversus males.Cristae density (μm−1)15.0 ± 0.2917.1 ± 0.29aValues shown are femalesversus males.The data represent the mean ± S.E. from 340 mitochondria of 3 animals per group and were analyzed by Student's t test.

Open table in a new tab The data represent the mean ± S.E. from 340 mitochondria of 3 animals per group and were analyzed by Student's t test. Significant differences (p < 0.05). It is well established that catecholamines secreted from the sympathetic nerves in BAT promote mitochondriogenesis (7Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), general recruitment (37McDonald R.B. Horwitz B.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Nava M.P. Fernandez A. Abelenda M. Puerta M. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and thermogenesis (34Himms-Hagen J. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1991; 12: 38-93Google Scholar). At this point several questions may arise, The first is whether the gender differences in the morphology and function of BAT are due to a distinct NE release in this tissue. Along these lines, gender-related differences in sympathetic outflow in BAT have been established; thus, McDonald et al. (35McDonald R.B. Hamilton J.S. Horwitz B.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 6-month-old 26 °C housed female rats show a higher sympathetic activity on BAT by measuring NE turnover. Furthermore, estradiol treatment has been shown to restore sympathetic nervous system activity and outflow in BAT of ovariectomized rats (36Yoshida T. Nishioka H. Yoshioka K. Kondo M. Metabolism. 1987; 36: 1-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, the sympathetic signaling to BAT is not necessarily a full indicator of thermogenic responsiveness, suggesting in this way that differences with respect to signal transduction could also be involved in thermogenesis activity in BAT (37McDonald R.B. Horwitz B.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Nava M.P. Fernandez A. Abelenda M. Puerta M. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In order to go further into this issue, functional effects of different adrenoreceptor agonists were studied: norepinephrine (β1-, β2-, β3-, and α2-AR agonist), isoprenaline (β1-, β2-, and β3-AR agonist), and CGP12177A (selective partial β3-AR agonist but β1- and β2-AR antagonist), in isolated brown adipose cells from female and male rats. Thus, the EC50 value and maximal lipolytic capacity as a percentage of basal lipolysis are compiled in TableV.Table VEffect of gender on adrenergically stimulated lipolytic activity of isolated fat cells from interscapular brown adipose tissue of male and female ratsParameterEC50Maximal capacityMalesFemalesMalesFemalesnmMaximal stimulationNorepinephrine627 ± 131563 ± 23976.9 ± 5.998.4 ± 7.2aValues shown are femalesversus males.Isoprenaline2.0 ± 1.012.0 ± 10aValues shown are femalesversus males.116.6 ± 9.199.8 ± 4.2CGP12177A3887 ± 1494122 ± 61aValues shown are femalesversus males.65.4 ± 6.752.6 ± 5.2Basal lipolysis (nmol glycerol/(106 cells × 1 h))658 ± 36638 ± 28Data are means ± S.E. of 7 animals per group.

Maximal action over basal lipolysis, EC50, and significant differences were obtained using the GraFit computer program.a Values shown are femalesversus males. Open table in a new tab Data are means ± S.E. of 7 animals per group. The lipolytic activity was expressed as a percentage of stimulation over basal lipolysis. Maximal action over basal lipolysis, EC50, and significant differences were obtained using the GraFit computer program. Isolated adipocytes from female and male rats showed no differences in basal lipolysis. All agonists stimulated lipolysis in a concentration-dependent pattern. In male adipocytes the potency rank for agonists was isoprenaline > norepinephrine > CGP12177A. In female adipocytes the potency rank was isoprenaline > CGP12177A > norepinephrine. In the latter, norepinephrine gave a greater maximal stimulation (+30%) and showed a marked affinity response to CGP12177A treatment compared with male rats (see Table V and Fig. 4), whereas female rats had a lower affinity in the case of isoprenaline treatment. Norepinephrine, which stimulates both α2A-AR and β-AR, acted as a full agonist in the case of females, showing approximately 99% intrinsic activity with respect to the isoprenaline maximal effect, whereas in male rats it was only a partial agonist with approximately 66% intrinsic activity. In the latter, this would point to the higher presence of an inhibitory effect, due to α2A-AR. In addition, the results obtained when increasing doses of NE were tested in the presence of RS79948 (α2A-AR antagonist) point to the inhibitory effects of α2A-AR being more important in male rats than in females (data not shown). The lower α2A-AR pool in female rats could contribute, at least in part, to the observed gender-dependent variations in BAT thermogenic and lipolytic response. It is also worth noting that the affinity of β3-AR to its agonist CGP12177A is more than 1 order of magnitude higher in female than in male rats, without any gender differences in β3-AR functional receptor pool (determined by the maximal capacity value). These data suggest that under low physiological NE concentrations, the β3-AR of female rats would be more activated. On the other hand, several links in the lipolytic and thermogenic pathway should also be considered when it comes to establishing adrenergic signal response differences. Thus, both forskolin, which mimics nonspecific β-agonist effects and the combined effects of adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, and Bt2cAMP, which mimics the effects of protein kinase A-interacting factors, were used in adipocytes isolated from male rats. The maximal stimulation was obtained with Bt2cAMP, which was higher in males than females (see Table VI), whereas there were no differences in forskolin-induced response. These data suggest that all the links involved in the adrenergic signal transduction pathway could be important to establish gender dimorphism in the control of thermogenesis and lipolysis.Table VIEffect of gender on post-receptor level stimulated lipolytic activity of isolated fat cells from interscapular brown adipose tissue of male and female ratsParameterMaximal capacityMalesFemalesMaximal stimulationForskolin90.1 ± 8.791.7 ± 7.9DBcAMP196 ± 14110 ± 3aValues shown are femalesversus males.Data are means ± S.E. of 7 animals per group.

Open table in a new tab Data are means ± S.E. of 7 animals per group. The lipolytic activity was obtained using the GraFit computer program, and expressed as a percentage of stimulation over basal lipolysis. In this paper, gender differences in the thermogenic response, adrenergic control pathway, and morphology of BAT in 110-day-old rats have been reported. Female rats had a higher energy expenditure than males such as can be concluded from the oxygen consumption values. Likewise, there was a clear sign of BAT thermogenesis activation; their BAT depot represented a greater percentage of total body mass, with marked BAT hypertrophy, a higher multilocular arrangement of lipid droplets, greater UCP1 levels, and a lower COX/UCP1 ratio. The gender dimorphism observed in the thermogenic capacity and activity was accompanied by differences in mitochondrial morphological features. Thus, the female rats, more thermogenically activated, showed larger and more active mitochondria (greater mitochondrial size, longer cristae, and higher cristae density) in comparison with males; these parameters are considered as an index of functional activity of mitochondria (39Loncar D. Afzelius B.A. Cannon B. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 101: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This increased size of mitochondria and greater number of cristae per mitochondrion in BAT have been reported under different conditions like cold exposure, which stimulates the activity of BAT (40Morroni M. Barbatelli G. Zingaretti M.C. Cinti S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1995; 19: 126-131PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cinti S. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 319-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting their role in heightened metabolic activity during thermogenesis, but never before had gender-dependent differences in morphological features been established. As far as the signal transduction pathway of the thermogenic activation is concerned, gender differences have been found for different adrenoreceptor protein levels, which might contribute to explaining, at least in part, the gender differences in thermogenic and lipolytic parameters. In this study, female rats expressed lower levels per mg of protein of α2A than males, with no observed gender differences in β3-AR levels, thus the α2A/β3-AR ratio was double in male rats than females. Therefore, the results obtained in this paper could help to understand that under low adrenergic stimulation (22 °C usual rodent housing temperature), female rats have a higher thermogenic response than males. Thus, in females, this lesser presence of α2A-AR, a receptor with high affinity for catecholamines and clearly involved in the inhibition of lipolysis (14Chaudhry A. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R147-R153PubMed Google Scholar), could be responsible for the higher thermogenic activity due to a lower inhibitory effect on thermogenic and lipolytic signal transduction pathway. Moreover, BAT of female rats has a more sensitive β3-AR to NE signal (EC50 10-fold lower for CGP12177A), leading to a higher signal for lipolytic and thermogenic activation with identical levels of NE. One of the causes for these gender differences in thermogenic activity and control could be dependent, at least in part, on the action of sex steroid hormones. Hence, both in vivo and in vitro studies have documented that sex steroid hormones modify both lipolytic signal transduction pathway by changing the responsiveness and/or density of β- and α2A- AR (42De Pergola G. Holmang A. Svedberg J. Giorgino R. Bjorntorp P. Acta Endocrinol. 1990; 123: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Giudicelli Y. Dieudonne M.N. Lacasa D. Pasquier Y.N. Pecquery R.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that 17β-estradiol modulates both β3-AR affinity and density suggesting both genomic and non-genomic effects (51Malo A. Puerta M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, the study carried out on forskolin and Bt2cAMP reveals that gender dimorphisms not only were in the regulation points in lipolysis and thermogenesis important at receptor level but also at postreceptor level. In the latter level, sexual hormonal effects have been well established (52Xu X., De Pergola G. Eriksson P.S., Fu, L. Carlsson B. Yang S. Eden S. Bjorntorp P. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 53Pecquery R. Dieudonne M.N. Leneveu M.C. Giudicelli Y.

Taken together, our results support the idea that brown adipose tissue hormonal environment could be involved in the different elements of lipolytic and thermogenic adrenergic pathway activation. Gender dimorphism is both at receptor (changing α2A-AR density and β3-AR affinity) and at postreceptor (modulating the links involved in the adrenergic signal transduction) levels. These changes in the adrenergic control could be responsible, at least in part, both for the important mitochondrial recruitment differences and functional and morphological features of BAT in female rats under usual rodent housing temperature (22 °C), a more activated BAT with a higher multilocular arrangement, greater mitochondrial machinery (bigger mitochondria and higher cristae density), and finally a higher thermogenic capacity and activity."

https://openalex.org/W2086686877,"In advanced atherosclerosis, macrophage foam cells progressively accumulate large amounts of unesterified or “free” cholesterol (FC), a process that is thought to contribute to foam cell death and lesional necrosis. The cellular consequences of early FC accumulation, including those that lead to further FC accumulation, are poorly understood. In this context, we show that cholesterol and phospholipid efflux mediated by ABCA1, which is initially induced in the cholesterol-loaded macrophage, was inhibited by ∼80% in pre-toxic FC-loaded macrophages. Cholesterol efflux to HDL2, which is mediated by a non-ABCA1 pathway, was inhibited by only ∼20% in FC-loaded macrophages. FC loading led to decreased levels of ABCA1 protein via increased degradation of ABCA1, and not by decreased transcription or translation of AbcA1 mRNA. The decrease in ABCA1 protein occurred relatively early and was not prevented by caspase inhibitors, indicating that it was not a consequence of FC-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of proteasomal function by lactacystin largely prevented the degradation of ABCA1. Importantly, the FC-induced decrease in ABCA1 function and protein was almost entirely prevented in macrophages that had partial deficiency of npc1 or were exposed to nanomolar concentrations of U18666A, both of which lead to defective cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum, but leave trafficking to the plasma membrane largely intact. Thus, a relatively early event during FC loading of macrophages is increased degradation of ABCA1, which appears to require trafficking of cholesterol to a peripheral cellular site, but not bulk trafficking of excess cholesterol to the plasma membrane.

These findings provide new insight into the post-translational regulation of ABCA1 and the pathobiology of the FC-loaded macrophage. cholesteryl ester free cholesterol acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase N-acetyl-leucine-leucyl-norleucinal aldehyde benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone t-butoxycarbonyl-aspartyl(methoxy)-fluoromethyl ketone low-density lipoprotein high-density lipoprotein phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin radioimmune precipitation assay Niemann-Pick C The hallmark of the early atherosclerotic lesion is the cholesteryl ester (CE)1-laden macrophage, or foam cell (1Ross R.

As lesions progress, however, there is a progressive increase in the unesterified or “free” cholesterol (FC) content of macrophages (3Lundberg B. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 56: 93-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Small D.M. Bond M.G. Waugh D. Prack M. Sawyer J.K. J. Clin.

Presumably, progressive lipid loading of macrophages leads to deficiencies in the cholesterol esterifying enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), cholesterol transport to ACAT, and/or cellular efflux of FC. A recent study suggested that increased activity of neutral CE hydrolase may also contribute to these events (7Mori M. Itabe H. Higashi Y. Fujimoto Y. Shiomi M. Yoshizumi M. Ouchi Y. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1771-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the accumulation of large amounts of FC eventually leads to macrophage death (8Warner G.J. Stoudt G.

Myers W. Tytell M. Challa V. Bond M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ball R.Y. Stowers E.C. Burton J.H. Cary N.R. Skepper J.N. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the FC-loaded macrophage may be a critical turning point in atherosclerosis. In particular, lesional necrosis is a precipitating factor in plaque erosion and rupture, which in turn lead directly to acute thrombosis and acute vascular occlusion (12Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar, 13Mallat Z. Hugel B. Ohan J. Leseche G. Freyssinet J.M. Tedgui A.

Kardiol. 1997; 86: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, FC-induced macrophage death may be one of the events leading to this fatal turn of events. Recent in vivo studies have begun to provide support for components of this model. For example, our laboratory has shown that prevention of FC-induced death in a mouse model of atherosclerosis diminishes lesional necrosis (16Zhang D. Feng B. Kuriakose G. Yao P.M. Tang W. Xie B. Tabas I. Circulation. 2001; 104 (abstr.): II-45Google Scholar), and another recent report has shown that accelerated macrophage FC accumulation in vivo results in atherosclerotic lesions with increased macrophage death (17Fazio S. Major A.S. Swift L.L. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Importantly, this latter model also demonstrated increased lesion sizeper se, which raises the possibility that the FC-loaded macrophage has other attributes that affect lesion progression as well as lesional necrosis. In this context, there has been increasing interest in understanding the biology of the FC-loaded macrophage. Cell culture studies have revealed a series of specific molecular events that occur as macrophages become progressively loaded with FC. Early adaptive processes include induction of phospholipid biosynthesis, which also occurs in lesional macrophages in vivo, and desaturation of the fatty acyl moieties of membrane phospholipids (18Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Blom T.S. Koivusalo M. Kuismanen E. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14635-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These events are adaptive in that they buffer the cell against the harmful effects of a high FC/phospholipid ratio in cellular membranes (9Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With continued FC loading, however, these adaptive mechanisms fail, and the cells develop the molecular and morphological properties of apoptosis and necrosis (8Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol.

In particular, Fas ligand is activated; Bax levels increase; mitochondrial membrane potential drops; mitochondrial cytochrome c is released into the cytoplasm; and proximal and distal caspases are activated (21Yao P.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42468-42476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cell death ensues, with the majority of macrophages showing the morphological signs of apoptosis initially, followed by typical necrotic properties after very long period of FC loading (8Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages showing signs of apoptosis and necrosis are also observed (23Mitchinson M.J. Hardwick S.J. Bennett M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned studies and observations suggest that interventions designed to diminish FC accumulation in lesional macrophages would be beneficial. Consistent with this idea, previous work has shown that promoting cellular cholesterol efflux during FC loading potently protects macrophages against FC-induced toxicity (8Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N.

In this context, ABCA1 (ATP-bindingcassette protein A1) may have a particularly important role. ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux from these cells in the presence of apolipoprotein acceptors like apoA-I (24Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tall A.R. Wang N. J. Clin.

Thus, ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux is likely an important anti-atherosclerotic process that tends to prevent excess cholesterol accumulation in lesional macrophages. Yet, as mentioned above, macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions accumulate large amounts of FC, suggesting that one or more cholesterol efflux pathways become progressively dysfunctional. To explore this idea, the goal of this study was to assess cholesterol efflux in cultured macrophages at various stages of cholesterol loading. Although the AbcA1 gene is transcriptionally induced when macrophages accumulate mostly CE and a limited amount of FC (33Gillotte-Taylor K. Nickel M. Johnson W.J. Francone O.L. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11811-11820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we show here that an early consequence of FC accumulation is dysfunction of the ABCA1 cholesterol efflux pathway via induction of ABCA1 degradation. Interestingly, the accelerated turnover of ABCA1 protein induced by FC loading is almost completed abrogated by genetic and pharmacological manipulations that primarily block cholesterol trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide new insight into the post-translational regulation of ABCA1 and suggest new ideas related to the pathobiology of the FC-loaded macrophage and the recently observed effects of macrophage FC accumulation on atherosclerotic lesion development in vivo.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL; d1.020–1.063 g/ml) and HDL2 (d 1.063–1.125 g/ml) from fresh human plasma were isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation as described (35Havel R.J. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Acetyl-LDL was prepared by reaction with acetic anhydride (36Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S.

The mice used in this study were wild-type C57BL6/J and BALB/c, apoE knockout/C57BL6/J, apolipoprotein E knockout/C57BL6/J Nctr-npc1 N heterozygous, and BALB/cNctr-npc1 N heterozygous. Thenpc1 N mutation was detected by PCR analysis of tail DNA using PCR primers mp25-8F (GGTGCTGGACAGCCAAGTA) and mp25-INTR3 (GATGGTCTGTTCTCCCATG) as described by Loftus et al. (38Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D., Gu, J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The apoE knockout/C57 NPC1 heterozygous mice were produced by crossing BALB/cNctr-npc1 N mice (stock number 003092, Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) onto the apoE knockout/C57BL6/J background for five generations. Mice (6–10 weeks old) were injected with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 40 μg of concanavalin A intraperitoneally, and the macrophages were harvested 3 days later by peritoneal lavage. The harvested cells were plated in cell culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20% L-cell-conditioned medium (39Tang W. Walsh A. Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The medium was replaced every 24 h until the macrophages were confluent, at which point they were incubated with 50–100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with or without 10 μg/ml compound 58035 and/or other inhibitors. First, acetyl-LDL (800 μg) was incubated with 10 μCi of [3H]cholesterol for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 8 ml of DMEM and 0.2% BSA were added. The macrophages were incubated in this medium for 5 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated in DMEM and 0.2% BSA for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the macrophages were incubated in DMEM and 0.2% BSA containing 15 μg/ml apoA-I or 20 μg/ml HDL2. At the indicated time points, 100 μl of the medium were removed and spun for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris, and the radioactivity in this fraction of the medium was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. After the last time point, the remainder of the medium was removed, and the cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1n NaOH containing 0.5% SDS (5 h at room temperature). A 100-μl aliquot of the cell lysate was counted, and the percent efflux was calculated as follows: ((media cpm)/(cell + media cpm)) × 100. Total protein in cell lysate was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Note that there was no statistical difference in cellular cpm or protein between CE- and FC-loaded macrophages. Macrophages were labeled with [3H]choline (5 μCi/ml) in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. After washing three times with PBS, the macrophages were incubated with 100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL ± compound 58035 in DMEM and 0.2% BSA for 5 h. The cells were then incubated with 15 μg/ml apoA-I in DMEM and 0.2% BSA for the indicated time periods. [3H]Choline-containing phospholipids in aliquots of the medium were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and those remaining in the cells in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v); the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Macrophages were incubated in DMEM and 0.2% BSA containing 0.1 mm[14C]oleate complexed with albumin and 3 μg/ml acetyl-LDL. At the indicated time points, the cells were washed two times with cold PBS, and the cell monolayers were extracted twice with 0.5 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Whole-cell cholesterol esterification activity was assayed by determining the cellular content of cholesteryl [14C]oleate by thin-layer chromatography (40Tabas I. Boykow G.C. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cell monolayers were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were assayed for protein by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage monolayers in 35-mm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing five times with ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), the cells were scrapped into PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. The pelleted macrophages were lysed in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 8)) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Ten μl of the lysate were subjected directly to 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE for determination of total ABCA1. The rest of the cell lysate was affinity-purified to isolate biotinylated proteins. Briefly, the cell lysates were diluted to 150 μl in RIPA buffer and incubated with 50 μl of immobilized streptavidin-agarose (Pierce), which was prewashed three times with RIPA buffer at 0 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking. The agarose was pelleted by centrifugation using a microcentrifuge at 5000 rpm for 2 min; the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer; and the process was repeated five times. The agarose was resuspended 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 330 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 15 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. ABCA1 and β1-integrin were detected by Western blotting using anti-ABCA1 and anti-β1-integrin antisera. The blots were reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody, which detected no actin signal, thus verifying that no cytosolic protein was biotinylated by the procedure. Peritoneal macrophages were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (15–30 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transfer tank. For Western blot detection of ABCA1, anti-ABCA1 antiserum was used. Signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were reprobed with anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody or anti-β1-integrin antiserum for the proper internal control. The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry. The procedure used by Smith and colleagues (42Zheng P. Horwitz A. Waelde C.A. Smith J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1534: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to measure AbcA1mRNA by quantitative PCR was used, with slight modifications. Monolayers of macrophages in 22-mm dishes were incubated for 5 h with 100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml compound 58035. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent to isolate total RNA. Five μg of total RNA were reversed-transcribed using Invitrogen Superscript II and poly(T) as the primer, and PCR was conducted using 62.5 ng of cDNA in the Mx4000TM Multiplex quantitative PCR system from Stratagene. The primers for the AbcA1 gene were 5′-cctcagccatgacctgccttgtag-3′ and 5′-ccgaggaagacgtggacaccttc-3′. To control for input cDNA, a β-actin primer/probe set from PE Biosystems was used. The PCR products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that a single PCR product was obtained. A standard curve was obtained by plotting the cycle thresholdversus the log of input cDNA, which was obtained from CE-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages. Both the β-actin andAbcA1 standard curves were linear between 31.25 and 250 ng of cDNA (r 2 = 0.99 for both). The PCRs were set up using SYBR green PCR core reagents from Applied Biosystems. The PCR was initiated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 0.5 min, 56 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.4 min. After obtaining real-time fluorescence measurements, cycle threshold values were determined. Using the standard curves in the linear range (i.e. exponential amplification phase), the quantities of AbcA1 and β-actin mRNAs were calculated. The final data are expressed as the ratio of AbcA1 to β-actin mRNA. Results are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3) unless otherwise noted. Absent error bars in the figures signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. For the quantitative PCR measurements, triplicate values were obtained, and there was <1% variation among these values. Whereas modest increases in cellular cholesterol increase expression of ABCA1 and thus increase apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux (33Gillotte-Taylor K. Nickel M. Johnson W.J. Francone O.L.

Thus, mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated for 5 h with [3H]cholesterol-labeled acetyl-LDL alone to effect predominantly CE loading or in the presence of the ACAT inhibitor compound 58035 to induce FC loading (21Yao P.M.

The cells were then chased for 2.5 h in medium containing apoA-I to measure ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux or containing HDL2 to measure cholesterol efflux by other pathways (43Leventhal A.R. Chen W. Tall A.R. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44976-44983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, FC loading resulted in a marked reduction in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. In contrast, cholesterol efflux to HDL2 was only modestly reduced (Fig. 1 B). The data in Fig. 1 Bdemonstrate that FC loading did not substantially inhibit cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane, as might be expected in toxic cells. Indeed, although more prolonged FC loading eventually does cause cytotoxicity and death (21Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol.

The first step is proposed to be phospholipid efflux to lipid-free apoA-I, and the second step is cholesterol efflux to these apoA-I·phospholipid complexes. According to this model, a defect in phospholipid efflux would indicate reduced ABCA1 transporter activity per se. To test this point, phosphatidylcholine efflux to apoA-I was measured for both FC- and CE-loaded macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1 C, phosphatidylcholine efflux by FC-loaded cells was markedly less than that b"

To identify proteins that interact with Crx in the retina, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen of a retinal cDNA library. One of the identified clones encodes Baf (barrier toautointegration factor), which was previously shown to have a role in mitosis and retroviral integration. Additional biochemical assays provided supporting evidence for a Baf-Crx interaction. The Baf protein is detectable in all nuclear layers of the mouse retina, including the photoreceptors and the bipolar cells where Crx is expressed. Transient transfection assays with a rhodopsin-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells demonstrate that overexpression of Baf represses Crx-mediated transactivation, suggesting that Baf acts as a negative regulator of Crx. Consistent with this role for Baf, an E80A mutation of CRX associated with cone-rod dystrophy has a higher than normal transactivation potency but a reduced interaction with Baf. Although our studies did not identify a causative Baf mutation in retinopathies, we suggest that Baf may contribute to the phenotype of a photoreceptor degenerative disease by modifying the activity of Crx. In view of the ubiquitous expression of Baf, we hypothesize that it may play a role in regulating tissue- or cell type-specific gene expression by interacting with homeodomain transcription factors.

Among these, Nrl, HMGA1, and CREB-binding protein/p300 enhance, whereas Phd (PhLPs) and ataxin-7 repress, the transactivation activity of Crx. To further enhance our understanding of Crx function, we carried out a protein-protein interaction screen of a bovine retinal cDNA library in yeast with Crx as bait. Here, we report the identification of barrier-to-autointegration factor (Baf) as a Crx-interacting protein and a detailed characterization of the physical and functional interaction of Crx and Baf. Our studies suggest a novel cellular function for Baf that is directly linked to transcriptional regulation of tissue-specific genes in addition to its reported role in chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope assembly during mitosis (29Haraguchi T.

The “bait” construct Crx-HD-pAS2 contains the bovine Crx homeodomain and its flanking sequences (amino acid residues 34–107) fused in frame with the Gal4-DNA binding domain (dbd) in the pAS2-1 vector. A bovine retinal cDNA library (34Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) generated in pACTII (the prey vector with a Gal4 activation domain) was used for screening Crx-HD-interacting clones. The reporter strain Y190 was transformed with the bait vector Crx-HD and tested for a basal expression level of the dual reporter genes His3 andlacZ using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT; a competitive inhibitor of the His3 protein) and a colony lift X-gal filter assay, respectively, as described in the CLONTECH manual. The bait-containing Y190 cells were subsequently transformed with 20 μg of DNA from the retinal cDNA library. Colonies that grew on SD-Trp−, Leu−, His− medium supplemented with 15 mm 3-AT were considered as “positives,” and they were verified using X-gal filter assays. Y190 transformants containing the known interacting protein partners, Snf1 (in pAS1) and Snf4 (in pACTII), were used as controls for a positive interaction (35Celenza J.L. Eng F.J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Yeast DNA harboring a mixture of the bait and prey plasmids was prepared from each of the clones that tested positive by the dual reporter assay. The prey plasmids in the positive colonies were recovered by electroporation of the yeast DNA intoEscherichia coli strain DH5α, selection of E. coli colonies containing the plasmids, and subsequent amplification and purification of plasmid DNA. False positives were further eliminated by retransforming the prey DNA to the original bait strain and a strain harboring the unrelated bait Snf1. Library clones that were positive for interaction with Crx-HD but not with Snf1 were sequenced and characterized. To confirm the interaction of Crx and the product of the Bafgene identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening, an insert swap between the bait and prey was performed. The Baf insert was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pAS2 bait vector at theNdeI site (filled in) with the predicted open reading frame fused in-fame with Gal4-dbd. The full-length coding region of bovineCrx was cloned in-frame with Gal4 activation domain in pACTII at the BamHI (5′) and XhoI (3′) site. The resulting Baf bait and Crx prey constructs were co-transformed into the yeast Y190 for 3-AT and X-gal assays as described above. To express and purify the bovine Baf (bBaf) protein from E. coli, a PCR-amplified cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame ofbBaf was cloned in frame with the His6 tag of pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) at the BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) site. For mammalian expression and in vitrotranscription/translation, a PCR-amplified cDNA containing thebBaf coding region fused in frame with an N-terminal Myc tag was generated and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at theHindIII and XbaI site (bBaf-pcDNA3.1(+)/myc). All of the PCR amplifications were performed using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The frame of each fusion protein was confirmed by sequencing using an ABI Prism DNA sequencing kit and ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The His6-tagged Baf (Baf-His) and the His6 tag alone (His) were expressed in the E. coli BL21 strain (Stratagene) and purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under denaturing conditions with 6 mguanidine-HCl according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. In brief, bacterial cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mmTris-Cl, 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0), bound to the Ni2+-NTA resin using the batch method, washed with the lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mm imidazole, and eluted with an imidazole gradient (20–700 mm) in the lysis buffer. The fractions containing either Baf-His or His were pooled after SDS-PAGE analysis of each fraction. The affinity-purified proteins were renatured by dialysis against a storage buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting protein preparations were quantified using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit II and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots with the anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and an anti-Baf antibody (see below). Each protein preparation was also analyzed for possible DNA contamination by UV spectrum measurement (at 260 and 280 nm) and agarose gel electrophoresis (1% with ethidium bromide).

Crude protein lysates were prepared by homogenization of frozen tissue samples or cell pellets in a 3-fold volume of a sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue using a Pro250 homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Monroe, CT), followed by immediately boiling for 10 min. Eight μl of each protein sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), which was probed with the primary antibody against Baf at a 1:1000 dilution, and the signal was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution and the ECL kit (AmershamBiosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation assays with in vitrotranslated proteins were carried out essentially as described previously (28La Spada A.R., Fu, Y. Sopher B.L. Libby R.T. Wang X., Li, L.Y. Einum D.D.

Antibodies used for co-immunoprecipitation include anti-Crx P261 (28La Spada A.R., Fu, Y. Sopher B.L. Libby R.T. Wang X., Li, L.Y. Einum D.D. Huang J. Possin D.E. Smith A.C. Martinez R.A.

Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant 5.0 analytic program (Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation assays with tissue extracts, whole cell extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissue samples in a 3-fold volume of a whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 450 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After a brief centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, 200 μl of the supernatants were incubated with 2 μl of the anti-Crx P261 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 45 μl of 50% Protein A-Sepharose beads and gentle mixing on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. After being washed five times with the wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots with the anti-Baf antibody. For pull-down assays, 100 ng of the purified Crx-HD-GST protein was gently mixed with 45 μl of Ni2+-NTA beads coupled with the Baf-His or His protein in 100 μl of a binding buffer (1× PBS, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C overnight. In a reciprocal approach, 50 ng of the purified Baf-His protein in 100 μl of the binding buffer was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with Crx-HD-GST or GST. Proteins bound to the beads were washed five times with the wash buffer, eluted from the beads by boiling in 20 μl of a SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (11–15% gel), and detected by immunoblots with the anti-GST antibody (Sigma) (for assays with the His protein beads) or anti-Baf antibody (for assays with the GST protein beads). For EMSAs with Crx-HD peptides, the GST tag was removed from the Crx-HD-GST proteins by digestion with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 2 units/μg of fusion protein (room temperature for 4 h). EMSAs with recombinant proteins and bovine retinal nuclear extracts were performed as described (5Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For supershift EMSAs, the Crx-HD peptides or the bovine retinal nuclear extract were preincubated with increasing amounts (in μl) of the Baf-His protein or the His tag control in the reaction buffer for 10 min on ice prior to the addition of the probes. The reactions were incubated on ice for an additional 30 min and resolved by native PAGE (5% gel). HEK293 cells were cultured on 35-mm plates, transfected using the calcium phosphate method, and analyzed using dual luciferase assays as described by Chenet al. (13Chen S. Wang Q.-L., Xu, S. Liu Y.

Each sample was done in duplicate, and at least four independent experiments were performed. The significance of the results was calculated using Student's t test, and it was assumed that each pair of samples under comparison had equal variances. For analyzing the effect of Baf on transactivation activity of the Gal4 fusion proteins and c-Jun/c-Fos, two different luciferase reporters were used: a Gal4-responsive luciferase construct pFR-luc (Stratagene) for assays with Gal4dbd-Crx-(111–299) or Gal4-VP16 (13Chen S.

https://openalex.org/W2006105383,"A recently identified class of signaling factors uses critical cysteine motif(s) that act as redox-sensitive 'sulfhydryl switches' to reversibly modulate specific signal transduction cascades regulating downstream proteins with similar redox-sensitive sites. For example, signaling factors such as redox factor-1 (Ref-1) and transcription factors such as the AP-1 complex both contain redox-sensitive cysteine motifs that regulate activity in response to oxidative stress. The mammalian thioredoxin reductase-1 (TR) is an oxidoreductase selenocysteine-containing flavoprotein that also appears to regulate multiple downstream intracellular redox-sensitive proteins. Since ionizing radiation (IR) induces oxidative stress as well as increases AP-1 DNA-binding activity via the activation of Ref-1, the potential roles of TR and thioredoxin (TRX) in the regulation of AP-1 activity in response to IR were investigated. Permanently transfected cell lines that overexpress wild type TR demonstrated constitutive increases in AP-1 DNA-binding activity as well as AP-1-dependent reporter gene expression, relative to vector control cells. In contrast, permanently transfected cell lines expressing a TR gene with the active site cysteine motif deleted were unable to induce AP-1 activity or reporter gene expression in response to IR. Transient genetic overexpression of either the TR wild type or dominant-negative genes demonstrated similar results using a transient assay system. One mechanism through which TR regulates AP-1 activity appears to involve TRX sub-cellular localization, with no change in the total TRX content of the cell. These results identify a novel function of the TR enzyme as a signaling factor in the regulation of AP-1 activity via a cysteine motif located in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2064861213,"Arrestins selectively bind to the phosphorylated activated form of G protein-coupled receptors, thereby blocking further G protein activation. Structurally, arrestins consist of two domains topologically connected by a 12-residue long loop, which we term the “hinge” region. Both domains contain receptor-binding elements. The relative size and shape of arrestin and rhodopsin suggest that dramatic changes in arrestin conformation are required to bring all of its receptor-binding elements in contact with the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor. Here we use the visual arrestin/rhodopsin system to test the hypothesis that the transition of arrestin into its active receptor-binding state involves a movement of the two domains relative to each other that might be limited by the length of the hinge. We have introduced three insertions and 24 deletions in the hinge region and measured the binding of all of these mutants to light-activated phosphorylated (P-Rh*), dark phosphorylated (P-Rh), dark unphosphorylated (Rh), and light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin (Rh*). The addition of 1–3 extra residues to the hinge has no effect on arrestin function. In contrast, sequential elimination of 1–8 residues results in a progressive decrease in P-Rh* binding without changing arrestin selectivity for P-Rh*. These results suggest that there is a minimum length of the hinge region necessary for high affinity binding, consistent with the idea that the two domains move relative to each other in the process of arrestin transition into its active receptor-binding state. The same length of the hinge is also necessary for the binding of “constitutively active” arrestin mutants to P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, and Rh*, suggesting that the active (receptor-bound) arrestin conformation is essentially the same in both wild type and mutant forms.

The signaling by a vast family of G protein-coupled receptors is quenched by the binding of arrestin proteins to activated receptors that have been phosphorylated by specific receptor kinases (1Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 155: 455-465Google Scholar). Selective binding to an appropriate functional form of the receptor and timely dissociation are prerequisites for the proper function of arrestin in the cell (1Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Phosphorylation and activation recognition sites on arrestin bind simultaneously to the phosphorylated receptor C terminus and regions of receptor that change conformation upon activation, respectively (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two interactions activate arrestin, allowing its transition into a high affinity receptor-binding state (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that a major conformational rearrangement of the arrestin molecule is a part of this transition (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Second, the susceptibility of arrestin to proteolysis upon its binding to phosphorylated and light-activated rhodopsin (P-Rh*) 1The abbreviations used are: P-Rh*, light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin; P-Rh, dark phosphorylated rhodopsin; Rh*, light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin; Rh, dark unphosphorylated rhodopsin; WT, wild type (Note that here we use the systematic names of non-visual arrestins.

Third, an additional hydrophobic binding site, which is not involved in its interaction with light-activated (Rh*) or phosphorylated dark (P-Rh) rhodopsin participates in arrestin binding to P-Rh* (2Gurevich V.V.

The largest distance between implicated residues is approximately 70 Å (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B.

Because arrestin binds P-Rh* at a 1:1 ratio (13Pulvermuller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), all of these data suggest that in the process of arrestin activation and transition to its receptor-binding conformation, its two domains move relative to each other. To test this idea, we manipulated the length of the interdomain hinge (a loop between β-strands X and XI, residues 179–190 (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B.

Our data show that although the lengthening of the hinge region does not appreciably change arrestin binding characteristics, its shortening results in a progressive decrease in P-Rh* binding. These results suggest that there is a minimum length of the hinge necessary for high affinity arrestin binding, consistent with the idea that movement of the two domains relative to each other occurs during the transition of arrestin into its active state. [γ-32P]ATP, [14C]leucine, and [3H]leucine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs.

Mutations were introduced by PCR using an appropriate mutagenizing oligonucleotide as a forward primer and an oligonucleotide downstream from the far restriction site to be used for subcloning as a reverse primer. Resulting fragments of various lengths and an appropriate primer upstream of the near restriction site were then used as reverse and forward primers, respectively, for the second round of PCR. SitesSalI (codons 145–146) plus StuI (codons 191–193) were used for mutations in the hinge region. The resulting fragments were purified, digested with appropriate enzymes, and subcloned into appropriately digested pARR-SC. Combination mutants were constructed by excising fragments carrying one mutation and subcloning them into the appropriately digested plasmid carrying another mutation. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitrotranscription to produce mRNAs encoding full-length arrestin proteins. In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Arrestins were labeled by the incorporation of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine with the specific activity of the mixture of 1.5–3 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activity of proteins within the range of 54–80 Ci/mmol (120–180 dpm/fmol). The translation of each of the arrestin mutants used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE. Two parameters were used for the assessment of mutant stability (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). First, protein yields in the in vitro translation are known to correlate with stability, most probably because misfolded or denatured proteins are rapidly destroyed by proteases present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, denatured proteins tend to aggregate and are pelleted by centrifugation at 350,000 ×g for 1 h. As an estimate of the relative stability of a mutant, we used its yield multiplied by the percentage of the protein remaining in the supernatant after incubation for 10 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation. This integral parameter calculated for a mutant was expressed as a percent of that for wild type arrestin (14Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The relative stability of all mutants used in this study exceeds 60%. Improperly folded or denatured proteins are very sensitive to proteolysis. In contrast, arrestin in its native conformation (similar to most proteins) is relatively insensitive to low trypsin concentrations, whereas in the presence of heparin, its C-tail is clipped off under similar conditions (4Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because heparin interacts with arrestin N terminus, thereby displacing the C-tail (20Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used limited trypsinolysis to ascertain that hinge deletions do not dramatically change arrestin folding and do not obliterate its proper conformational response to heparin. To this end, 5 μl of in vitro translated (without protease inhibitors) radiolabeled arrestins were treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin in the presence or absence of 0.3 mg/ml heparin. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of 10 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA and then was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dissolved in ethanol. The protein was precipitated by the addition of 9 volumes of methanol supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of 90% methanol, dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The samples along with undigested controls were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with GelCode Blue reagent (Pierce) soaked in 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in glacial acetic acid for 10 min. The fluorochrome was precipitated by washing the gel in three changes of water, and the gels were dried and exposed at −80 °C for 36–72 h. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with rhodopsin kinase, and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described previously (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar), a major conformational rearrangement of the arrestin molecule is necessary to bring all of the residues implicated in binding in contact with the cytoplasmic surface of P-Rh*. We have previously proposed that in the process of arrestin activation, the N- and C-domains move relative to each other (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 22Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol.

Hence, a measurable decrease in P-Rh* binding of arrestin mutants with shortened hinge can be expected, whereas an increase in hinge length should not be detrimental for the binding. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the length of the hinge by introducing deletions and insertions into it. We specifically chose residues that do not participate in intramolecular interactions in the basal state of arrestin (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We also avoided prolines because of their possible importance for the geometry of the hinge (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 6Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To systematically test the effect of hinge length, we introduced deletions of 1–4 residues in two different parts of this region and then constructed 16 possible combinations, producing 24 mutants with deletions ranging from 1 to 8 residues (Fig.2). Increasing deletions of the hinge result in diminished arrestin binding to P-Rh*. Binding is abolished by the elimination of 7 or 8 residues, which leaves the hinge only of 4–5 residues long. Importantly, the distance between the end of β-strand X and the beginning of β-strand XI in the basal state of arrestin (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) is ∼20 Å, i.e. the length of five residues in a fully extended conformation (Fig. 1). Notably, none of the deletions changes the arrestin binding profile to the various rhodopsin forms (Fig. 2). The analysis of the pooled data for 24 mutants reveals a strong correlation between the number of deleted residues and the decrease in P-Rh* binding (r = 0.91, F(1,23) = 107;p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3). Although P-Rh* binding tends to decrease with hinge length, the binding of different mutants with the same size of deletion varies (Fig. 2). To test whether other factors contribute to observed changes in P-Rh* binding, we analyzed the effect of protein stability. We found no statistically significant correlation between mutant relative stability (determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and P-Rh* binding (p > 0.05) or between the size of hinge deletion and protein stability (p > 0.05). The effect of no single deletion is smaller than expected based on the slope of the correlation, suggesting that the reduction of hinge lengthper se is detrimental to P-Rh* binding. The effects of several deletions are stronger than would be expected, suggesting that these deletions have effects in addition to merely shortening the hinge. For example, the deletion of Ala-190 decreases P-Rh* binding by 40%, possibly because it brings Arg-189 and Glu-191 close enough to interact, thereby reducing hinge flexibility. Indeed, an additional deletion of Arg-189 does not suppress the binding further (Fig. 2). Note that all of the deviating mutations yield proteins with lower than expected binding. Thus, they do not contradict the conclusion that progressive shortening of the hinge reduces the ability of arrestin to assume the active conformation necessary for high affinity P-Rh* binding.Figure 3The loss of P-Rh* binding correlates with the extent of the deletion in the hinge region. The P-Rh* binding of 24 mutants with various deletions in the hinge region (the absolute values are shown in Fig. 2) was analyzed as a function of the total number of deleted residues using GraphPad Prism (version 2a, Power MacIntosh). The correlation was found to be statistically significant (r = 0.91, F(1,23) = 107;p < 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because hinge deletions affecting the junction between the two arrestin domains are loss-of-function mutations, it is important to ascertain that these mutations do not cause protein misfolding. To this end, we compared the susceptibility to limited proteolysis of all of the mutants used in this study with insertions of 1–3 residues and deletions ranging from 1 to 8 residues to that of wild type arrestin. We chose trypsin for these experiments for two reasons. First, its effect on WT arrestin in the basal conformation was characterized previously (4Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, it has been convincingly demonstrated that in response to heparin, the conformation of arrestin changes, making its C-tail susceptible to trypsinolysis under the same conditions where arrestin alone is not affected (4Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin was later shown to interact with arrestin N terminus, thereby displacing its C-tail (20Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which apparently makes the C-tail accessible to trypsin. Thus, trypsinolysis provides a test for the preservation of the protease-resistant native conformation of the mutants and, as an added bonus, an even more rigorous test for the well characterized conformational response of arrestin to heparin (4Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that all three insertion mutants and 16 of 24 deletion mutants behave exactly like WT arrestin, i.e. they are resistant to trypsinolysis in the absence of heparin and yield a 44-kDa product in the presence of heparin. The remaining eight mutants rapidly yield a 21-kDa product (similar to the product that WT arrestin yields after longer digestion with trypsin (4Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This 21-kDa fragment has the mobility of arrestin-(1–191) truncated mutant, suggesting that trypsin cuts at Arg-189 in the hinge (data not shown). The analysis of the actual hinge sequence of the mutants yielding this fragment shows that all of them have a deletion of two or more residues and an intact Arg-189, suggesting that an increased accessibility to the protease of Arg-189 rather than improper global folding is the reason for their higher sensitivity to trypsin. Nonetheless, we re-analyzed the correlation between the size of the deletion and P-Rh* binding for the group of 16 mutants that behave exactly like WT arrestin (Fig.4) and found the same strong correlation (r = 0.91; F(1,15) = 64; p < 0.0001) as with the whole set of 24 deletion mutants (Fig. 3). Fig. 4shows that the mutants with a wide range of deletion lengths (up to seven residues) demonstrate relative resistance to proteolysis by 10 μg/ml trypsin similar to WT arrestin. Moreover, under the same conditions in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml heparin, a fragment of the same size (approximately 4 kDa) is cleaved off WT arrestin and these hinge mutants. These data strongly indicate that neither the native conformation of arrestin nor its conformational response to heparin is affected by hinge deletions. Thus"

Like most members of the FGF family, the activity of FGF-7 is strongly influenced by binding to heparin, but this glycosaminoglycan is absent on keratinocyte cell surfaces and minimally present in the wound environment. In this investigation we compared the relative activity of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate), glycosaminoglycans that are present in wounds. A lymphoid cell line (BaF/KGFR) containing the FGF-7 receptor (FGFR2 IIIb) was treated with FGF-7 and with various glycosaminoglycans. FGF-7 did not support cell proliferation in the absence of glycosaminoglycan or with addition of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate A/C but did stimulate BaF/KGFR division in the presence of dermatan sulfate or highly sulfated low molecular weight fractions of dermatan. Dermatan sulfate also enabled FGF-7-dependent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and promoted binding of radiolabeled FGF-7 to FGFR2 IIIb. In addition, dermatan sulfate and FGF-7 stimulated growth of normal keratinocytes in culture. Thus, dermatan sulfate, the predominant glycosaminoglycan in skin, is the principle cofactor for FGF-7.

Whereas some FGF family members bind to multiple FGF receptors (FGFRs 1–4) (11Ornitz D.M., Xu, J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

Because DS and FGF-7 are both induced in wounds, and the FGF-7 signaling pathway is regulated differentially by heparin compared with other FGF ligands, we have asked whether DS serves as a cofactor for FGF-7. In this study, we used a previously described GAG- and FGFR-deficient cell line engineered to express the FGF-7 receptor (FGFR2 IIIb) (21Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D.

Our results show that DS is superior to HS and approaches the effectiveness of heparin in its ability to promote FGF-7-FGFR2 IIIb binding and cellular proliferation. This effect is specific for FGF-7 as the activity of another ligand of FGFR2 IIIb, FGF-1, is not supported by the addition of exogenous DS. These findings strongly support the premise that DS is the physiologically relevant cofactor for FGF-7.

GAGs and FGF-7 were diluted in basal medium for stimulation. Cells were cultured for 48 h, and cellular proliferation was determined. Proliferation assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Promega Cell Titer 96 non-radioactive cell proliferation kit. Relative cell number was determined as the quotient of theA 570 determined for experimental samples toA 570 of cells in identical wells grown in basal medium alone. In some experiments, results of proliferation assay were confirmed by manual cell counts using a hemocytometer. BaF/KGFR cells in culture were washed three times and then incubated for 18 h in RPMI containing 0.1% FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine prior to addition of test reagents. After 2 h of exposure, 3 × 105cells were extracted in 0.05 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 15 μl of this extract were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel prior to transfer to nitrocellulose (Osmonics, Westborugh, MA). Western blot was performed with anti-phospho MAP kinase or anti-non-phospho MAP kinase per the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p44/42 control proteins (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were evaluated simultaneously to confirm sensitivity and specificity of Western blot. Recombinant FGF-7 was radioiodinated using the chloramine T method as described (26Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free iodine was separated from labeled FGF-7 using HiTrap™ heparin-Sepharose columns. The specific activity of the labeled ligand was low, ∼3 × 104 cpm/ng. FGF-7 binding to BaF/KGFR cells was performed as described (26Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C. Cohen O.E. Chan A.M. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells were suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer in the presence or absence of GAGs (1 μg/ml heparin, 50 μg/ml DS, 10 μg/ml DT, 100 μg/ml DO, and 100 μg/ml HS) and I125-FGF-7 (5 ng/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Chemical cross-linking was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with disuccinimidyl suberate. Following cross-linking, cells were lysed in 50 μl of buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). Binding was quantified using a Genesys 5000 series multiwell γ-counter. Receptor·ligand complexes were resolved on a 4–20% gradient gel and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager Screen and Storm Phosphorimager. Human wound fluid contains abundant amounts of soluble GAGs, with DS and HS at concentrations up to 65 μg/ml. At these physiologic concentrations both DS and HS can promote FGF-2-dependent proliferation (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine whether wound fluid-derived glycosaminoglycan (WFGAG) stimulates FGF-7-dependent signaling, we used BaF3 cells, a GAG-deficient mouse lymphocyte cell line stably expressing the FGFR2 IIIb receptor (designated BaF/KGFR) that binds FGF-7 and FGF-1 (11Ornitz D.M., Xu, J.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1553-1561PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with 50 μg/ml WFGAG or 0.5 μg/ml heparin with or without 5 ng/ml FGF-1 or FGF-7 for 72 h, and cellular proliferation was measured. Neither ligand nor GAG alone significantly stimulated cell growth above background levels (Fig.1). In the presence of heparin, FGF-7 stimulated growth by ∼3.0-fold. WFGAG resulted in an approximate doubling of the proliferative effect of FGF-7. We next asked whether the addition of pure DS, a major component of WFGAG, to BaF/KGFR cells would affect FGF-7 signaling. Cells were cultured with commercially available purified DS (at 50 μg/ml). The absence of contaminating heparin or HS in the DS preparations was confirmed by independent analysis of monosaccharide composition by the University of California, San Diego Glycobiology Core Facility. Cellular proliferation increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of FGF-7 (Fig.2 a). By contrast, FGF-1 was not as effective in promoting cell proliferation with DS. As expected based on prior reports (29Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), heparin (1 μg/ml) enhanced the proliferative activity of both FGF-1 and FGF-7 (data not shown). The concentration of sulfated GAGs in wound fluid has been reported to range between 15 and 65 μg/ml (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We saw more than a 2-fold stimulation when 50 μg/ml DS was combined with 5 ng/ml or more of FGF-7 but only ∼1.5-fold stimulation with FGF-1 in similar amounts. To determine the effect of a range of DS concentrations on FGF-1 and FGF-7, we compared approximately equipotent amounts of FGF-1 (5 ng/ml) and FGF-7 (2 ng/ml, the minimum concentration capable of inducing an increase in cell proliferation at 50 μg/ml DS) (Fig.2 b). Both FGF-7 and FGF-1 showed a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation in response to DS, but DS always potentiated a greater increase in cell proliferation by FGF-7. A 2-fold increase in cell number was induced by 2.5 μg/ml DS and FGF-7 whereas 250 μg/ml DS was required to stimulate a similar response in the presence of FGF-1. Heparin is frequently used in vitro as a required cofactor for FGF-dependent signaling and to study the three-dimensional structure of the GAG·FGFR·FGF complex believed to be required for this signaling to take place (30Schlessinger J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, as mast cells (the sole source of cutaneous heparin) are present in very low numbers in the skin under physiologic conditions, we asked whether the abundant native GAGs (HS and chondroitin sulfates (CS)) support FGF-7-dependent cellular proliferation. Because GAG structure varies between tissues, and this may affect GAG-FGF binding, we tested HS from two sources (33Friedl A. Chang Z. Tierney A. Rapraeger A.C. Am J Pathol. 1997; 150: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 34Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Porcine intestinal heparin, bovine kidney HS, porcine intestine HS, CS A/C (70% CS A and 30% CS C), and DS were tested with 5 ng/ml FGF-7 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 μg/ml. Consistent with our previous results, heparin led to the highest increase in proliferation at low doses, stimulating it ∼3-fold over control levels at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 3). At concentrations similar to those found in wounds, DS stimulated FGF-7-dependent proliferation to a maximum of 4.5-fold at 25 μg/ml. Comparatively, HS from porcine origin and CS A/C had minimal stimulatory effects on FGF-7 although bovine kidney HS had activity at high concentrations (50 μg/ml) that approached heparin. To directly evaluate rapid downstream events after FGF-R2 occupancy, the phosphorylation of p44 and p42 MAP kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) was studied in BaF/KGFR cells. Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% FCS for 18 h and then exposed for 2 h to fresh medium alone, FGF-7, DS, or the combination of FGF-7 and DS. Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinases was only seen when DS and FGF-7 were present together (Fig.4). The ability of certain GAGs to bind to and stimulate their protein partners depends upon their structure, size (number of disaccharides), and sulfation pattern. These elements combine to form discrete preferentially bound cassettes within the heterogeneous GAG molecule (35Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 30: 30Google Scholar, 36Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 13: 13Google Scholar, 37Delehedde M. Lyon M. Vidyasagar R. McDonnell T.J.

To begin to investigate this possibility for DS, we used unfractionated and fractionated DS species from Celsus Laboratories (designated DO and DT, respectively) that differ by size and sulfation (TableI). These preparations of DS, which differentially affect the anticoagulant effect of activated protein C (40Fernandez J.A. Petaja J. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were added to BaF/KGFR cells with 5 ng/ml FGF-7. Native, unfractionated DS and the low molecular weight fraction (DT) at 50 μg/ml resulted in a 4.5- and 5-fold induction in cellular proliferation, respectively (Fig. 5). The high molecular weight fraction (DO) induced cell growth by only 1.6-fold at this concentration. Increasing the concentration of DO by 10-fold (to 500 μg/ml) did not result in an effect equal to that of the other species. Interestingly, DT supports FGF-7-dependent cellular proliferation at a 10-fold lower dose (5 μg/ml) than unfractionated DS.Table ICharacteristics of dermutan sulfate fractionsMW rangeTotal sulfurApproximate charge/masskDa%DS35 ± 56.2–6.90.19–0.21DO50 ± 56.0–6.50.12–0.13DT25 ± 2.55.8–7.30.23–0.29Data supplied by Celsus Laboratories. Open table in a new tab Data supplied by Celsus Laboratories. Based upon our assumption that the proliferative effects of DS stem from its ability to promote the binding of FGF-7 to its receptor, we next attempted to demonstrate this effect. Radioiodinated FGF-7 was incubated with BaF/KGFR cells in the presence of heparin (1 μg/ml), DS (50 μg/ml), DT (10 μg/ml), DO (100 μg/ml), and HS (100 μg/ml), and a cross-linking reaction was performed. The GAG concentrations were chosen based upon the results obtained in our proliferation assays. DS increased the binding of labeled FGF-7 by 6.9-fold compared with control (Fig.6 a, no GAG). Heparin increased binding by 9.1-fold. In agreement with the proliferation assay results, DT exceeded the amount of binding supported by unfractionated DS and approached that of heparin (8-fold increase over control). In all cases binding was observed as two bands resolved by SDS-PAGE that correspond to the expected sizes of a monomer and dimer of the receptor·ligand complex (Fig. 6 b). DO had no significant effect on binding, and HS did not support binding above background. All reactions were carried out using molar concentrations of GAGs equivalent to those used in proliferation assays. We next extended our results to a more physiologically relevant cell system. FGF-7 is a potent mitogen for keratinocytes and has also been shown to modulate differentiation (13Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1990; 144: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human keratinocytes in basal medium were treated with 5 ng/ml FGF-7 in the presence of heparin or DS. Cellular proliferation was assessed after 48 h in culture. DS at 5 μg/ml supported FGF-7-dependent growth in keratinocytes to a level that exceeded heparin and FGF-7 or FGF-7 alone (Fig.7). Interestingly, this effect was seen at a 10-fold lower concentration than was required for FGF-7-stimulated proliferation in the BaF/KGFR system but decreased at higher DS concentrations. A similar trend was noted for FGF-10, another FGFR2 IIIb ligand that has been shown to promote proliferation in keratinocytes (data not shown) (42Marchese C. Felici A. Visco V. Lucania G. Igarashi M. Picardo M. Frati L. Torrisi M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 623-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, no growth was observed for cells treated with GAG alone. In the present work we have demonstrated how a physiologically relevant WFGAG, DS, affects FGF-7. Most FGF family members require the presence of GAGs to bind to and signal through their tyrosine kinase receptors (24Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 43Rapraeger A.C. Guimond S. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

These effects presumably result from either (a) the stabilization of the receptor·ligand complex (45Kan M. Wang F., Xu, J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,46Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or (b) by acting as an extracellular stockpile for growth factors (47Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Fuks Z. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 48Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Heparin and HS have been the traditional focus of GAG-FGF interactions. These GAGs share structural aspects, but their availability to cells in vivo is not likely to be equivalent. HS is ubiquitous in the extracellular matrix, cell surface, and basement membrane. DS is located primarily in the extracellular matrix of skin. Heparin, however, is sequestered in mast cells and only becomes available to the tissue upon recruitment and degranulation of this cell type. DS is more similar structurally to HS than the other chondroitin sulfates as both DS and HS contain iduronate residues. The core proteins to which DS and HS are attached show altered expression patterns during development, pathogenesis, and wounding (49Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 50Brown C.T. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell.

No such regulation has been shown for serglycin, the primary core protein on which heparin is found. These observations suggest that heparin may have limited relevance to the functional significance of GAG and growth factor interactions seen in vitro to an in vivosystem such as wound repair where FGF-7 is expressed abundantly. Previous work has demonstrated that FGF-2-dependent activity is enhanced by DS derived from wound fluid (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The present data show that FGF-7-dependent proliferation is also enhanced by a wound fluid-derived GAG mixture (Fig. 1) and that this effect can be reproduced with the use of purified DS (Fig. 2). One explanation for the observed effect of DS upon FGF-7 signaling is contamination of the DS reagent with heparin or HS. Analysis performed by the Glycobiology Core Facility at our institution (by acid hydrolysis followed by high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection) found that the DS used in our assays contains N-acetyl galactosamine, iduronate, and glucuronate.N-Acetyl glucosamine was not detected significantly, confirming the absence of heparin and HS contamination. Furthermore, the proliferative effect of DS was likely to be directly through the interaction of FGF-7 with its receptor, because downstream phosphorylation of MAP kinase was observed within 2 h. Within this time period secondary effects on cell growth that could manifest themselves within the 48–72-h time periods of the proliferation assays become less likely. WFGAG and DS stimulated FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation to a much greater extent than FGF-1 (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Even at high, and likely supraphysiologic, concentrations of DS (Fig.2 b) or FGF-1 (Fig. 2 a), FGF-1-dependent cellular proliferation was not enhanced, suggesting that the effect of DS is selective for FGF-7. This may represent the physiological situation or reflect diminished activity of the recombinant growth factors used in this study. However, this differential effect of GAGs upon FGF-dependent binding and activity has been shown previously. Glypican-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, enhances FGF-1 receptor binding and cellular proliferation but does not support either the binding or activity of FGF-7 in BaF/KGFR cells and mouse keratinocytes (21Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 53Bonneh-Barkay D. Shlissel M. Berman B. Shaoul E. Admon A. Vlodavsky I. Carey D.J. Asundi V.K. Reich-Slotky R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our data support these results. HS had less effect upon FGF-7-dependent cellular proliferation over a range of concentrations (Fig. 3) and did not support cell surface receptor binding (Fig. 6). The differential potentiation and binding of FGF-1 and FGF-7 are supported by, and in the case of HS likely explained by, their dependence upon unique oligosaccharides that differ by size and sulfation patterns (29Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the size and sulfation level of DS affect both proliferation and receptor binding (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Proliferation and cell surface binding studies performed with equivalent molar concentrations of GAG and ligand showed similar results, thus supporting the hypothesis that the action of DS is similar to mechanisms described previously for heparin. The highest molecular weight DS fraction, DO (charge to mass ratio 0.12–0.13), had minimal effectiveness in promoting FGF-7-dependent proliferation and did not support FGF-7 binding to FGFR2 IIIb. By contrast, the lowest molecular weight fraction, DT (charge to mass ratio 0.23–0.29), has a higher charge to mass density than either DO or unfractionated DS and was more active and potent than native DS. This fraction approached the effectiveness of heparin in promoting cellular proliferation. This derivative is also more active than either unfractionated DS or DO in enhancing activated protein C-dependent anticoagulation (40Fernandez J.A. Petaja J. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DT is enriched in 4,6-di-O-sulfated N-acetyl galactosamine residues, but no other structural information is available currently. Unfractionated heparin exhibits differential effects upon FGF-7, supporting receptor binding and cellular proliferation at low concentrations but inhibiting both events at higher doses (21Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe an inhibitory effect by heparin upon either binding FGF-7 to FGFR2 IIIb or FGF-7-dependent proliferation in our BaF/KGFR studies. This is likely because of the relatively low concentration of heparin (1 μg/ml) used in our assays. Prior studies have reported that heparin enhances FGF-dependent cellular proliferation at this concentration (21Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We did however observe inhibition of FGF-7-dependent proliferation at increasing concentrations of DS in normal human keratinocytes. Thus, as has been reported previously with heparin, facilitation of FGF-7 activity by DS is highly dependent on the concentration of DS available to the cell. One question raised by our findings is whether the nature of DS in wound fluid differs (in terms of oligosaccharide size) from that present normally in the extracellular matrix. Other molecules in the extracellular matrix and the skin microenvironment, such as the perlecan core protein, can also serve as ligands for FGF-7 (54Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural requirements for FGF-7 binding and potentiation of receptor activation are complex. Further investigation of DS structure is needed to characterize how DS size and sulfation affect FGF-7:FGFR2 IIIb binding and the affinity constants of these interactions. As more structural information becomes available from the study of the various GAGs, it will become clear that particular subdomains within GAGs (e.g. highly sulfated regions rich in iduronate residues), or other ligands, will prove to differentially affect FGF family member signaling. Such information will not only advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of GAG function but will also help us understand the basic science of wound healing. The current observations illustrate that cellular synthesis and availability of GAGs must be considered when extending models of GAG and growth factor interactions from the test tube to the tissue. In the case of events associated with the skin, DS may exceed HS for many heparin-dependent processes characterized previously. We thank Drs. Hermann van Halbeek and Brad Hayes of the University of California, San Diego Glycobiology Research and Training Center for the analysis of DS. We thank Dr. Anna Di Nardo for NHK isolation and assistance with culture."

Comparison of expression levels revealed 111 genes with mean expression values of >2.5-fold higher in carcinoma cells. Similarly, 62 genes were expressed at >2.5-fold higher levels in normal ovarian epithelial cells. For a few selected genes, we demonstrate that the pattern of differential expression observed in cultured epithelial cells is present in the normal ovaries and epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

https://openalex.org/W2004666492,"Using an estrogen-inducible retroviral system, we demonstrate that oncogenic Raf-1 induces growth arrest and morphological changes in finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). This arrest does not rely on expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p16(INK4a), nor on changes in expression of the CKIs p21(Cip1), p14(ARF), p27(Kip1) or p57(Kip2). The Raf-induced arrest is independent of viral oncogene mediated inactivation of p53 and pRB, or c-myc overexpression. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrates that cells arrest in both G1 and G2. The Raf-induced arrest is mitigated or eliminated in some immortally transformed HMEC. Immortal HMEC that have both overcome replicative senescence and undergone the recently described conversion process maintain growth in the presence of transduced oncogenic Raf-1; they also gain EGF-independent growth and a low frequency of anchorage-independent growth. However, HMEC that have overcome replicative senescence but have not undergone conversion and HMEC immortalized by transduction with the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, remain severely growth arrested. These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms responsible for the Raf-1-induced growth arrest may vary among different finite lifespan cell types, and that in HMEC, this mechanism is altered during the conversion process, rather than as a direct consequence of overcoming senescence or expressing hTERT."
https://openalex.org/W2088516779,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) exists both as a membrane-integrated type II precursor protein and a soluble cytokine that have different bioactivities on TNFR2 (CD120b) but not on TNFR1 (CD120a). To identify the molecular basis of this disparity, we have investigated receptor chimeras comprising the cytoplasmic part of Fas (CD95) and the extracellular domains of the two TNF receptors. The membrane form of TNF, but not its soluble form, was capable of inducing apoptosis as well as activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-κB via the TNFR2-derived chimera. In contrast, the TNFR1-Fas chimera displayed strong responsiveness to both TNF forms. This pattern of responsiveness is identical to that of wild type TNF receptors, demonstrating that the underlying mechanisms are independent of the particular type of the intracellular signaling machinery and rather are controlled upstream of the intracellular domain. We further demonstrate that the signaling strength induced by a given ligand/receptor interaction is regulated at the level of adaptor protein recruitment, as shown for FADD, caspase-8, and TRAF2. Since both incidents, strong signaling and robust adapter protein recruitment, are paralleled by a high stability of individual ligand-receptor complexes, we propose that half-lives of individual ligand-receptor complexes control signaling at the level of adaptor protein recruitment. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) exists both as a membrane-integrated type II precursor protein and a soluble cytokine that have different bioactivities on TNFR2 (CD120b) but not on TNFR1 (CD120a). To identify the molecular basis of this disparity, we have investigated receptor chimeras comprising the cytoplasmic part of Fas (CD95) and the extracellular domains of the two TNF receptors. The membrane form of TNF, but not its soluble form, was capable of inducing apoptosis as well as activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-κB via the TNFR2-derived chimera. In contrast, the TNFR1-Fas chimera displayed strong responsiveness to both TNF forms. This pattern of responsiveness is identical to that of wild type TNF receptors, demonstrating that the underlying mechanisms are independent of the particular type of the intracellular signaling machinery and rather are controlled upstream of the intracellular domain. We further demonstrate that the signaling strength induced by a given ligand/receptor interaction is regulated at the level of adaptor protein recruitment, as shown for FADD, caspase-8, and TRAF2. Since both incidents, strong signaling and robust adapter protein recruitment, are paralleled by a high stability of individual ligand-receptor complexes, we propose that half-lives of individual ligand-receptor complexes control signaling at the level of adaptor protein recruitment. The majority of cell surface receptors initiate intracellular signals after ligand-mediated homo- or heteromultimerization.

Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Essential for intracellular signal induction is the subsequent recruitment of adaptor proteins (e.g.members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family or death domain-containing proteins like TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) or Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)) (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). These two protein groups define the two major signaling pathways leading to either gene induction (TRAFs) or the activation of the apoptotic program via autoproteolytic cleavage of initiator caspases by induced proximity (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). TNF binds to two membrane receptors, TNFR1 (CD120a; p55/60) and TNFR2 (CD120b; p75/80). Whereas TNFR1 seems to be constitutively expressed in most tissues, TNFR2 expression is more restricted and can be found especially in immune cells but also in endothelial and neuronal tissue (2Grell M. Scheurich P. LeRoith D. Bondy G.P. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1997: 669-726Google Scholar). TNFR2 is a typical member of the non-death domain-containing subgroup of the TNF receptor family. It directly binds TRAF2, leading to the activation of NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). TNFR1 carries a death domain in its cytoplasmic part and therefore represents a direct activator of apoptotic caspases after recruitment of TRADD and FADD. In parallel to its cytotoxic activity (and this seems to be unique within the TNF receptor family), TNFR1 is a strong activator of gene induction. Receptor-bound TRADD serves as an assembly platform also for recruitment of TRAF2 and receptor-interacting protein (3Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), which act together in the activation of the inhibitor of κB kinases, leading to the activation of NF-κB (4Wajant H. Scheurich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Many aspects of the initial events during signal initiation of TNF, however, are poorly understood. After ligand binding, TNF receptor complexes are internalized or may be, alternatively, proteolytically cleaved (5Pennica D. Lam V.T. Mize N.K. Weber R.F. Lewis M. Fendly B.M. Lipari M.T.

Menegazzi R. Cramer R. Alberi L. Presani G. Garbisa S. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2165-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Internalization has been shown to be important for intracellular signal initiation by TNFR1 (8Schutze S. Machleidt T. Adam D. Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Kruse M.L. Heinrich M. Wickel M. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10203-10212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) but not for others like Fas (CD95, APO-1) (8Schutze S. Machleidt T. Adam D. Schwandner R.

Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Further, in some cellular systems the activation of the initiator caspase-8 was found to be necessary for Fas cluster formation (9Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Remarkably, most ligands of the TNF family are expressed as type II transmembrane proteins from which soluble ligands are formed by proteolytic cleavage. In a recent publication, we have compared the signaling capacity of the membrane-bound (memTNF) versus the soluble form of TNF (sTNF) and have demonstrated that TNFR2, but not TNFR1, differentially responds to these two ligand forms (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). It was shown that memTNF, when acting on TNFR2, displays a superior capacity to initiate various cellular responses in a positive cooperative manner with TNFR1. Full TNFR2 activation can even cause a shift in the phenotype of the respective cellular response to sTNF (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). In addition, we have developed a TNFR2-specific monoclonal antibody, termed 80M2, that mimics the bioactivity of memTNF when combined with sTNF. Kinetic studies with iodinated TNF revealed that 80M2 stabilizes ligand binding in terms of a prolonged receptor complex half-life (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). These data raised the hypothesis that the kinetics of receptor ligand complex formation and disintegration might at least in part determine intracellular signaling strength. Accordingly, transient binding of sTNF to TNFR2 would only allow formation of short living complexes that may inefficiently induce intracellular signals (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the bioactivity of 80M2 is dependent on its dimeric IgG1 structure, since Fab fragments derived thereof are inactive (data not shown). These data raised the possibility that secondary clustering of TNF·TNFR2 complexes by 80M2 might reflect the underlying mechanism by which memTNF gains superior signaling capability on TNFR2. Differences in the bioactivity of soluble and membrane-bound forms of other members of the TNF ligand family have also been described (e.g. for Fas ligand (FasL) (11Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), CD40L (12Pound J.D. Challa A. Holder M.J. Armitage R.J. Dower S.K. Fanslow W.C. Kikutani H. Paulie S. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and TRAIL (13Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wuest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schonherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). Soluble FasL can even exert antiapoptotic activity by serving as an antagonist for the membrane-bound form of FasL (11Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In this study, we have analyzed receptor chimeras derived from the extracellular domains of the two TNF receptors and the intracellular domain of Fas. TNFR2-Fas chimera, comprising the extracellular domain of TNFR2 and the cytoplasmic part of Fas, strongly induced apoptosis only after treatment with memTNF-like stimuli but not with sTNF. In contrast, both ligand forms induced a strong apoptotic signal in TNFR1-Fas chimeras. These data show that the individual responsiveness of TNFR1 and TNFR2 for soluble or membrane-bound TNF can be transferred to a distinct intracellular signaling system, indicating that responsiveness is dominantly controlled by the extracellular domains. HeLa cells stably transfected with human TNFR2 (HeLa80) or TNFR2 plus Fas (HeLa80Fas) (14Weiss T. Grell M. Hessabi B. Bourteele S. Muller G. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J.

Simian virus 40 large T-immortalized murine fibroblasts have been generated from TNFR1 and TNFR2 double knockout mice and were generously supplied by Daniela Männel (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). HeLa cells, CHO cells, and immortalized mouse fibroblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. 1 μg/ml puromycin A was added once a week to TNFR1-Fas and TNFR2-Fas expressing mouse fibroblasts routinely. Kym-1 cells were grown in Clicks-RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G.

Additional antibodies specific for TNFR2 were purchased from R&D (goat anti-huTNFR2), TRAF2-specific antibodies (mouse anti-huTRAF2, clone C90–481) were from Pharmingen, and antibodies specific for JNK (rabbit anti-huJNK; C-17) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The expression plasmids pFADD-EGFP and pCaspase-8-EGFP were kind gifts from Michael Lenardo (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and pTRAF2-EGFP was from Harald Wajant (University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany), and they have been described elsewhere (19Siegel R.M.

(Paris). 1990; 48: 639-641PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa80Fas (3 × 105 cells) were seeded into chambers (Molecular Devices). The cell capsule was placed into a flow- and temperature (37 °C)-regulated sensing chamber of the microphysiometer, and pH changes were monitored. Cells were perfused with low phosphate-buffered RPMI medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) in a cyclic manner. The pump cycle was 120 s, comprising a flow-on period (100 μl/min for 80 s) followed by a flow-off period (40 s). The extracellular acidification rate was mathematically normalized to 100% at the data point just prior to stimulation with TNF143N/145R (150 ng/ml) (basal acidification rate). The addition of mAb 80M2 (2 μg/ml) was performed 30 min prior to treatment with TNF mutants and extended to the whole TNF stimulation time of 30 min. Expression constructs encoding the fusion proteins TNFR1-Fas and TNFR2-Fas were generated by PCR cloning. A KpnI site was introduced by silent mutagenesis into the coding region of pBS-TNFR1 and pBS-TNFR2 at bp 704 and 899, respectively, 3′ of the potential transmembrane region. In addition, the cytoplasmic region of Fas was amplified by PCR introducing 5′ and 3′ appropriate restriction sites for TNFR ligation (pBS TNFR1-Fas and pBS TNFR2-Fas). TNFR1-Fas and TNFR2-Fas were subcloned into the expression vector pEF PGKpuro (23Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), usingBamHI and EcoRV, generating pEFpuroTNFR1-Fas and pEFpuroTNFR2-Fas. All constructs generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. Immortalized mouse fibroblasts (4 × 105cells) from TNFR1 and TNFR2 double knockout cells were transfected with pEFpuroTNFR1-Fas or pEFpuroTNFR2-Fas using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The day after, cells were selected for stably expressing cells by 1–5 μg/ml puromycin A, and 2 weeks later they were sorted for TNFR1-Fas- and TNFR2-Fas-positive cells by flow cytometry using a FACStar+(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Briefly, 5 × 105cells were harvested and resuspended in PBA (0.025% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) containing mouse 5 μg/ml anti-huTNFR1 (Htr 9) or mouse anti-TNFR2 antibodies (MR2–1). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, cells were washed once with PBA, resuspended in PBA containing secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG plus IgM antibodies (Dianova, Germany), and incubated at least for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed again and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting. 10,000–30,000 positive cells were collected and grown in cell culture medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin A. TNFR1-Fas and TNFR2-Fas expressing mouse fibroblasts (MF-R1-Fas and MF-R2-Fas cells, respectively) were stable for at least 3 weeks. Mouse fibroblasts (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 96-well plates overnight. Cells were then treated as indicated and cultivated overnight. The next day, cells were washed three times with PBS followed by crystal violet staining (20% methanol, 0.5% crystal violet) for 15 min. The wells were washed with H2O and air-dried. The dye was resolved with methanol for 15 min, and optical density at 550 nm was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (SPECTRAmax 340PC; Molecular Devices). For coculture experiments, CHO cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded into a 12-well plate. The next day, MF-R2-Fas cells (1.5 × 105) were given on top and cultivated at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by light microscopy, and pictures were taken 1 h after seeding of the mouse fibroblasts. HeLa80Fas cells (5 × 106 cells) were pretreated where indicated with antagonistic TNFR1-Fab fragment (H398-Fab) for 30 min followed by stimulation with sTNF (100 ng/ml) or Cys-TNF (116 ng/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plate in PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biosciences). Proteins were extracted by vortexing three times for 40 s, and TNFR2 complexes were immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C while tumbling. Immune complexes were washed in lysis buffer and assessed by Western blotting using TRAF2-specific antibodies. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce). 5 × 105 cells/well HeLa80Fas cells or mouse fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates and grown overnight. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 2 μg/ml mAb 80M2 for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated for various times with the indicated reagents. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), and samples were adjusted for identical protein levels. As probe, [32P]ATP-end-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) were used. JNK assays were performed basically as described (25Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, following stimulation, cells (5 × 106 cells) were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm NaF) by sonification. JNK was immunoprecipitated with 0.6 μg of JNK-specific antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subjected to kinase assays using GST-Jun-(5–89) (0.5 μg/assay) and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP as substrate. The reactions were carried out in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were harvested and transiently transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmids of pFADD-EGFP and pTRAF2-EGFP, respectively, or with 4 μg of pCaspase-8(C369S)-EGFP plus 4 μg of murine pFADD by electroporation. Cells (800 μl; 1.25 × 106 cells/ml) were electroporated at 1800 microfarad and 250 V in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Peqbio Easyject Plus; Peqlab). After electroporation, cells were immediately transferred into cell culture medium, and 3 × 105cells/dish (35 mm; Maltek) were grown for 18 h before analysis. Electroporation with pCaspase-8(C369S)-EGFP required the addition of 20 μm z-VAD-fmk. For live imaging TNF, mAb 80M2 and Cys-TNF143N/145R were coupled with AlexaFluor-546 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed in PBS and, where indicated, preincubated with AlexaFluor-546-coupled 80M2 (80M2(red)) (6 μg/ml) for 4 min at room temperature or 1.7 μg/ml AlexaFluor-546-coupled sTNF (sTNF(red)) on ice followed by two washings with cell culture medium without phenol red. Cells were placed into a chamber held constantly at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and treated where indicated with 300 ng/ml TNFR2-specific TNF mutant (Cys-TNF143N/145R), and pictures were taken at the indicated time points. Alternatively, 105 cells were seeded onto coverslips in a 24-well plate and treated as above. Instead of performing live imaging of the cells, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C at various time points, mounted with Flouromount-G (Biozol, Germany) onto glass slides, and examined using a Leica DM IRBE confocal immunofluorescence microscope. Pictures were taken at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with a magnification of ×630 for live imaging and ×1000 for fixed cells. Receptor-ligand studies were performed as described (26Grell M. Wajant H. Zimmermann G. Scheurich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, TNF was labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method. Murine fibroblasts were incubated with 0.2 nm125I-TNF in the presence or absence of mAb 80M2 (2 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice. Cells were incubated for several time periods at 37 °C, and cell-bound 125I-TNF was determined after centrifugation of the cells through a phthalate oil mixture. To get a better understanding for the molecular basis of the differential signaling capacity of sTNF and memTNF, we constructed chimeras of Fas and TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively. These fusion proteins consist of the extracellular and transmembrane region of the respective human TNFRs fused to the cytoplasmic domain of human Fas (Fig.1 A). Hybrid constructs TNFR1-Fas and TNFR2-Fas were stably expressed in large T antigen-immortalized fibroblasts derived from TNFR1/TNFR2 double knockout animals, obtaining a cellular system devoid of any TNF background responsiveness. Fluorescence analyses of the TNFR1-Fas- and TNFR2-Fas-expressing mouse fibroblast cells, MF-R1-Fas and MF-R2-Fas, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1 B. Equilibrium binding studies using iodinated TNF revealed ligand binding sites of 15,000 for MF-R1-Fas cells and 45,000 for MF-R2-Fas cells per cell (data not shown). As expected, we could not detect any TNF responsiveness in the parental mouse fibroblasts devoid of both mouse TNF receptors (data not shown). MF-R1-Fas cells, however, developed a strong cytotoxic response after treatment with serial dilutions of sTNF (Fig.2 A). Development of cell death was nearly maximum at TNF concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, and the majority of the cells showed typical blebbing already after 3 h of sTNF treatment (data not shown). Further, cell death could be blocked by the inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, demonstrating the involvement of caspases (data not shown). Wild type TNFR1 is equally well activated by sTNF and memTNF (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). We confirmed this for TNFR1-Fas using the TNF mutein Cys-TNF32W/86T, derived from a TNFR1-specific mutant of sTNF (27Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows additional receptor cross-linking due to the formation of cysteine-linked multimers (Fig. 2 A). The respective TNFR2-specific mutein of TNF, Cys-TNF143N/145R, did not induce apoptosis in MF-R1-Fas cells (Fig. 2 A). In a parallel set of experiments, we investigated the chimeric receptor TNFR2-Fas. MF-R2-Fas cells were treated with sTNF up to concentrations of 300 ng/ml, but no significant cytotoxic response could be observed after overnight culture (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of the antibody 80M2, however, a strong cytotoxic response was observed with a half-maximum effect at a TNF concentration of about 100 pg/ml, whereas 80M2 on its own was not toxic (Fig. 2 B). Cell death developed rapidly; most cells showed massive signs of disintegration after 1 h of memTNF-like stimulation (data not shown). Again, induction of cytotoxicity could be efficiently blocked with the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (data not shown). The TNFR2-selective derivative Cys-TNF143N/145R also induced a significant apoptotic response, although with reduced efficacy when compared with sTNF plus 80M2 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the TNFR1-specific mutein Cys-TNF32W/86T was ineffective (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that the transmembrane form of TNF is also able to induce apoptosis in MF-R2-Fas cells, these were cocultured for 1 h with CHO cells expressing a mutant form of memTNF that cannot be processed by the tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (10Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). These cells (Fig.2 C, right panel), but not control CHO cells (Fig. 2 C, left panel), induced a strong cytotoxic response in TNFR2-Fas-expressing mouse fibroblasts. When apoptotic cells were counted after 3 h of coculture, <5% of apoptotic MF-R2-Fas cells were determined in cocultures with control CHO cells, whereas between 68 and 79% (n = 3) of MF-R2-Fas cells showed an apoptotic phenotype in cocultures with memTNF-expressing CHO cells (data not shown). These values are in good agreement with the percentage of the MF-R2-Fas cells expressing high numbers of chimeric receptors as estimated from flow cytometry data (Fig. 1 B). As expected, memTNF-expressing CHO cells were also toxic for MF-R1-Fas cells (data not shown). In summary, these results show that the divergent responsiveness of TNFR1 and TNFR2 to sTNF is independent of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors, since it is transferable to the intracellular part of Fas. Although Fas represents the prototype of a death receptor, it is also known to activate gene expression (e.g.via the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases) (25Muhlenbeck F.

To investigate whether the differential responsiveness of TNFR2-Fas to sTNF and memTNF also holds true for noncytotoxic Fas responses, we analyzed the activation of NF-κB and JNK in both MF-R1-Fas and MF-R2-Fas cells after treatment with sTNF and memTNF-like stimuli. The activations of NF-κB and JNK were investigated by electromobility shift assays and immunocomplex kinase assays, respectively, revealing an identical response pattern for both cellular responses (Fig. 2,"

Both responses were inhibited by progesterone. Moreover, addition of recombinant LEFTY-A to proliferative explants was sufficient to stimulate the expression of proMMP-3 and -7; this response was also blocked by ovarian steroids. Collectively, these data indicate that LEFTY-A may provide a crucial signal for endometrial breakdown and bleeding by triggering expression of several MMPs. Progesterone appears to exert a dual block, upstream by inhibiting LEFTY-A expression and downstream by suppressing its stimulatory effect on MMPs.

Extensive lysis and renewal of this tissue occur every month under the control of ovarian steroids. Estrogens induce tissue proliferation during the proliferative phase; following ovulation, progesterone induces glandular secretion and stromal decidualization. In the absence of pregnancy, the fall of both ovarian steroids in the late secretory phase triggers a cascade of events leading to proteolytic breakdown, shedding of the functional layer, and menstrual bleeding. Irregular and unpredictable ECM breakdown and bleeding between menstruations are common disorders that occur in diverse endometrial pathologies or upon hormonal treatment (2Marbaix E. Vekemans M.

In endometrium undergoing normal or abnormal bleeding, several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), are produced selectively by foci of stromal cells in areas of ECM disruption (see Refs. 4Hampton A.L.

Expression of these MMPs and of gelatinase-A (MMP-2) progresses along with tissue breakdown, suggesting strongly that these proteinases play a crucial role in endometrial ECM degradation. Although the profile of gelatinase-B (MMP-9) expression along the menstrual cycle is still controversial, the presence of its active form seems restricted to the perimenstrual phase (7Jeziorska M.

Using an ex vivo explant system, MMPs were found to be responsible for the menstrual-like ECM degradation and to be repressed by physiological concentrations of progesterone (1Marbaix E. Kokorine I.

Thus, active MMPs are thought to degrade the endometrial ECM, including the basement membrane of the blood vessels, a prerequisite for the occurrence of menstrual and abnormal bleeding (5Kokorine I. Marbaix E. Henriet P. Okada Y. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2151-2160PubMed Google Scholar). The focal nature of MMP production and initial ECM breakdown suggests strongly that a local response modulates the overall effect of ovarian steroid withdrawal (5Kokorine I. Marbaix E. Henriet P. Okada Y. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2151-2160PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Cannon P. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J.

The following two factors likely contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of hormonal effects: (i) the unequal distribution of hormone receptors within the tissue; and (ii) the involvement of other molecules such as cytokines acting as local relays (14Singer C.F. Marbaix E. Kokorine I. Lemoine P. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10341-10345Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LEFTY-A, also called EBAF (endometrialbleeding-associated factor), is a recently discovered member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family (15Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I., Wu, S.Q. Chegini N.

Reprod. 1998; 4: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human LEFTY-A is secreted as a 42-kDa precursor susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, and LEFTY-A active forms are able to induce mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and to inhibit TGF-β signaling (18Ulloa L.

Tumors derived from transduced fibroblastic cells overexpressing LEFTY-A secrete abundant collagenolytic activity that was not detected in tumors derived from mock-transduced cells (20Mason J.M., Xu, H.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that LEFTY-A may act as a physiological modulator of MMP expression. In human, LEFTY-A mRNA has been observed in several (but not all) tissues, including the endometrium (15Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I., Wu, S.Q. Chegini N. Tabibzadeh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Tabibzadeh S. Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I.I. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: a18-a25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using Northern and Western blotting, endometrial expression was always abundant in the perimenstrual phase (i.e. late secretory and menstrual endometrium), was detected at lower levels in some patients around ovulation, and was not detected during the other phases of the menstrual cycle. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, both LEFTY-A mRNA and protein were essentially found in stromal cells of the functional layer of the perimenstrual endometrium (15Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I., Wu, S.Q. Chegini N. Tabibzadeh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Tabibzadeh S. Lessey B. Satyaswaroop P.G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Abnormal expression ofLEFTY-A mRNA has also been observed in the non-perimenstrual endometrium of patients with irregular bleeding (15Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I., Wu, S.Q. Chegini N. Tabibzadeh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and infertile women (22Tabibzadeh S. Mason J.M. Shea W. Cai Y. Murray M.J. Lessey B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2526-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations suggest that LEFTY-A expression may be controlled by ovarian steroids and may correlate in time and space with bleeding-associated MMPs. LEFTY-A is therefore a good candidate to locally modulate progesterone action on these proteinases within the endometrium. In the present study, we used competitive RT-PCR (RT-cPCR) (23Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) as a more quantitative and sensitive methodology than Northern blotting to measure endometrial LEFTY-A mRNA concentration, both along the normal menstrual cycle in vivo and in response to ovarian steroids in cultured explants ex vivo. We next investigated the temporal correlation between LEFTY-AmRNA expression and the production of several endometrial MMPs. Finally, we tested directly the ability of recombinant LEFTY-A to modulate MMP expression in explant culture. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Université Catholique de Louvain, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association. Normal endometrial tissue was obtained from hysterectomy specimens (n = 38) or biopsies (n = 8) sampled at various phases of the menstrual cycle. An ideal menstrual cycle of 28 days was divided into the following phases: early proliferative (days 6–8, n = 11), mid-proliferative (days 9–11, n = 1), late proliferative (days 12–14, n = 9), early secretory (days 15–18, n = 6), mid-secretory (days 19–22,n = 6), late secretory (days 23–27, n= 5), and perimenstrual phases (days 28–5, n = 8). All patients were premenopausal (range: 25 to 55 years old) and were not involved in hormonal treatment. For the hysterectomy specimens, endometrium that appeared normal to the naked eye was scraped gently from the surface of the uterine cavity with a sterile surgical blade by an experienced pathologist (E. M.) and put in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for further processing; biopsies were collected immediately in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Part of the endometrial tissue used for the study was fixed in 4% formaldehyde for histological examination; dating was first estimated following established microscopic criteria (24Noyes R.W. Hertig A.T. Rock J. Fertil. Steril. 1950; 1: 3-25Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and was adjusted finely according to clinical information of the last menstrual period whenever available. Pathological examination of the operative specimens and biopsies showed no organic lesion (n = 9), uterine leiomyoma(s) (n = 31) or leiomyosarcoma (n = 1), adenomyosis (n = 10), endometrial polyp (n = 3), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (n = 2), hydrosalpinx (n = 2), ovarian dermoid cyst (n = 1), or ovarian and vaginal endometriosis (n = 1). Non-cultured samples were frozen quickly at −80 °C in lysis buffer (SV Total RNA Isolation System; Promega, Madison, WI). Alternatively, tissue explants were cultured as described (1Marbaix E. Kokorine I. Moulin P. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9120-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue samples were cut in pieces of about 1-mm with a sterile surgical blade and placed in tissue culture inserts (Millipore, Bedford, MA; 24 explants/30-mm insert for RNA extraction; 6 explants/12-mm insert in triplicates for experiments addressing the effect of recombinant LEFTY-A). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), devoid of serum and phenol red, was placed in the lower chamber and renewed daily (300 μl or 1.2 ml in 12- and 30-mm inserts, respectively). Medium was without hormonal addition (−H), or supplemented with 1 nm water-soluble 17β-estradiol (+E), 100 nm progesterone (+P), or a combination of both (+E+P; Sigma-Aldrich) and, when applicable, in the presence of the indicated concentration of recombinant LEFTY-A (R & D Systems). It was verified that the presence of 0.5 μg/ml 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich) used as steroid vehicle did not affect the expression of LEFTY-A mRNA or β-ACTIN mRNA (data not shown). In addition, we have demonstrated previously that the inhibitory effect of progesterone on the expression of several MMPs was independent of this vehicle (1Marbaix E. Kokorine I. Moulin P. Donnez J. Eeckhout Y. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9120-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After collection, all media were supplemented with 0.05 vol of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 m CaCl2, 60 mm NaN3 and kept frozen at −20 °C until biochemical analysis. At the end of the culture, explants were frozen at −80 °C in lysis buffer until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. RNA integrity was controlled by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Aliquots (100 or 200 ng) of total RNAs extracted from endometrial tissue were reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl by using the Thermoscript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Oligo(dT) primers were compared with hexamers degenerated randomly, and the former ones were used in subsequent experiments, because stronger signals were obtained after PCR amplification (data not shown). The cDNA products were stored at 4 °C until subsequent PCR analyses. Specific oligonucleotide primers for human LEFTY-A andβ-ACTIN (for standardization) were derived from their cDNA sequences (GenBankTM accession numbersAF081513 and X00351, respectively). Primers were designed to create amplicons crossing over exonic boundaries (Fig.1), to ensure that the detected products resulted from specific amplification of the target sequence and not from contamination by genomic DNA. In addition, the LEFTY-Adownstream primer was chosen in the 3′-untranslated region to ensure distinction from the related LEFTY-B sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF081512). Customized primers were obtained from Invitrogen, and their optimal hybridization temperatures (Table I) were determined by comparing different temperatures in parallel PCR reactions using a Biometra T-gradient thermocycler (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplificationmRNAPrimersSequence (5′ → 3′)Position on cDNAHyb.TLEFTY-A3′-EndAAGACCACCTCTATGCACACG1224–12045′-EndCCTGGACCTCAGGGACTATGG785–805} 553′-End competitorAAGACCACCTCTATGCACACGTTCTGCACCCTCATGTTGGGC1224–1204/1117–1097} 65β-ACTIN5′-EndGGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG489–5073′-EndGCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA1101–1083} 685′-End competitorGGCATCGTGATGGACTCCGATGAAGATCCTCACTGAGCG489–507/609–628} 65Position on cDNAs refers to GenBankTM sequence annotation.

Competitors for LEFTY-A andβ-ACTIN cDNA PCR amplification were constructed by deleting, respectively, an 86- and a 101-bp fragment from the corresponding target cDNA. Truncated fragments were synthesized by PCR using a modified primer and the appropriate regular opposite primer (Table I). Mutated amplicons were purified from agarose gels with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and inserted into pCR®II-TOPO® plasmids (Invitrogen) to be amplified in One Shot® TOP10 chemically competentEscherichia coli (TOPO TA Cloning® kit; Invitrogen). Purified plasmids were obtained using the QIAfilter Maxi Protocol (Qiagen). Competitor sequences were extracted from the vectors by EcoRI enzymatic digestion (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), purified from agarose gels, and quantified against a 100-bp DNA ladder (DNA Molecular Weight Marker XIV; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Serial dilutions of competitors were prepared and stored at −20 °C as aliquots (10 μl) that were thawed only once and used immediately. Aliquots (1 μl) of the RT products were subjected to PCR in the PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) containing 22 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 55 mm KCl, 1.65 mmMgCl2, 220 μm dNTPs, 22 units/mlTaq DNA polymerase with 0.5 μm of adequate paired primers in a total volume of 20 μl. A control PCR without template DNA was performed in each experiment. The PCR reactions were realized using Biometra thermocyclers as follows. After an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, the DNA was amplified through 30 to 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at the optimal annealing temperature of the primer pair (Table I), and 30 s at 72 °C. The reaction was terminated at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were stored at 4 °C until use. In competitive PCRs, RT products were coamplified with a defined amount of the corresponding competitor in a reaction mixture supplemented with 1 μCi [α32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). For each sample, three or four different concentrations of the competitor were used for parallel PCR reactions. The concentrations of target cDNA were first estimated roughly and then measured precisely using closely adjusted concentrations of the diluted competitor. The amplicons (target and competitor) were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and cpm were quantified by direct counting on defined areas of the dried gels using an InstantImager detector (Packard, Meriden, CT). Data were plotted on a logarithmic scale as (target cpm/competitor cpm) ratios for increasing concentrations of competitor (Fig.2 A) (23Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The concentration of the target sequence in the sample was defined as the intersection of the linear regression with the x axis (when ratio = 1, log = 0). In addition, for each experiment, the slope of the line was measured to control that the target and the competitor sequences were amplified with the same efficiencies. Data generating slopes deviating from the −0.6 to −1.2 range were discarded, and PCRs were repeated with redefined competitor concentrations. The sensitivity, linearity, and dynamic range of the method were evaluated by quantifying serial 10-fold dilutions (over 3 logs) of one sample (Fig.2 B). The lowest detectable amount measured in the present study was 22 LEFTY-A mRNA molecules in a reaction tube. To evaluate the reproducibility of the assay, LEFTY-A orβ-ACTIN mRNA was measured twice by independent RT-cPCR in 26 samples of total RNA (Fig. 2 C). In a comparative experiment using the same primers, similar results were obtained by competitive PCR assay and by real-time PCR (data not shown).β-ACTIN mRNA was used as a housekeeping gene to standardize the levels of LEFTY-A mRNA (25Chegini N.

Conditioned media were assayed in solution for the release of spontaneous and total (i.e. after zymogen activation by aminophenylmercuric acetate, APMA) collagenase activities and by gelatin, casein, or reverse gelatin zymography for the identification of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) (1Marbaix E.

For Western blotting, proteins in conditioned media (50 μl/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-C extra; Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl), 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 500 ng/ml primary antibodies in TBS, 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 followed by three washes in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Blots were finally incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1/10,000 in TBS, 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 and washed once in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and twice in TBS. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometry (Scion Image Program; Scion, Frederick, MD). Data were normalized according to protein concentration in conditioned media determined using the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal.

Statistical significance was tested using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test or the Wilcoxon two-sample test, as appropriate. Differences were interpreted as significant forp < 0.05. Previous studies based on Northern blotting andin situ hybridization have shown that LEFTY-AmRNA levels vary in the cycling human endometrium, being detected only during perimenstrual phases and in some periovulatory tissues (15Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I., Wu, S.Q. Chegini N. Tabibzadeh S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,21Tabibzadeh S. Kothapalli R. Buyuksal I.I. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: a18-a25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To quantify the expression of LEFTY-A mRNA throughout the menstrual cycle, we analyzed by RT-cPCR 45 endometria sampled at different phases of the normal cycle. These values were expressed as relative amounts, by reference toβ-ACTIN mRNA measured in parallel. The relative amount of LEFTY-A mRNA varied considerably between patients, even for a given phase of the cycle, as shown in Fig.3. We verified in two hysterectomy specimens that the variation was not due to heterogeneity of expression within the organ. Indeed, similar values were observed at three different sites of endometrium sampling (fundus, corpus, isthmus). Despite these individual differences, there was a significant increase of relative LEFTY-A mRNA amount during the perimenstrual phase (herein defined as the period from day 28 to day 5 of the next cycle; values ≥ 2.0 × 10−4 in all patients;n = 8), as compared with all other phases together (values < 2.0 × 10−4 in 28 of 37 non-perimenstrual endometria; p < 0.001). The median in the perimenstrual group (3.7 × 10−3) was 100-fold higher than in the non-perimenstrual group (3.5 × 10−5). Interestingly, two out the nine non-perimenstrual samples with higher LEFTY-A mRNA relative amounts showed superficial foci of menstrual-like tissue breakdown (two proliferative endometria represented by filled symbols in Fig. 3). When analyzing together all endometria with tissue breakdown regardless of the phase (n = 10), the relative LEFTY-AmRNA amount was also significantly higher than in tissue without breakdown (p < 0.002); values in 28 of 35 endometria without signs of breakdown (Fig. 3, open symbols) were below the lowest level (2.0 × 10−4) found in endometria with tissue breakdown. The median in the group with tissue breakdown (3.0 × 10−3) was also 100-fold higher than in the group with intact tissue (2.8 × 10−5). Several, but not all, mid- and late secretory endometria also showed an increased expression of LEFTY-A mRNA, but none exhibited stromal breakdown. The relative levels of LEFTY-A mRNA in endometria sampled at the mid-secretory, late secretory, and perimenstrual phases of the cycle were significantly higher than in the endometria sampled during the other phases of the cycle (p < 0.005). The β-ACTIN housekeeping gene was expressed at similar steady-state levels throughout all phases of the menstrual cycle and during explant culture under various hormonal conditions, except at the mid-secretory phase during which a 3- to 6-fold decrease (p < 0.005) was observed compared with the other phases of the cycle (Table II). However, this relatively modest fall of β-ACTIN mRNA at the mid-secretory phase did not influence the overall pattern of variation of LEFTY-A mRNA throughout the cycle.Table IIβ-ACTIN mRNA expression during menstrual cycle in vivo and in explant cultureβ-ACTINmRNA (log values)Number of samplesNon-culturedEarly proliferative6.5 ± 0.411Mid-proliferative6.51Late proliferative6.5 ± 0.38Early secretory6.3 ± 0.36Mid-secretory5.8 ± 0.4*6Late-secretory6.6 ± 0.55Perimenstrual6.3 ± 0.3824 h of culture−H6.6 ± 0.316+E6.5 ± 0.54+P6.6 ± 0.54+E+P6.6 ± 0.316The amount of β-ACTIN mRNA molecules in 10 ng of total RNA was quantified by RT-cPCR in non-cultured endometria sampled along the menstrual cycle, as well as in endometrial explants cultured for 24 h in the absence of ovarian steroids (−H) or in the presence of 1 nm estradiol and 100 nm progesterone in combination (+E+P; eight proliferative and eight secretory endometria in both cases) or with 1 nm estradiol alone (+E) or 100 nm progesterone alone (+P; four proliferative endometria in both cases).

These so-called intrabodies have great potential in functional genomics as a tool to study the function of newly identified proteins in vivo, for example by binding-induced modulation of their activity or by blocking interactions with other proteins. However, the intracellular expression and activity of many single-chain Fvs are limited by their instability and folding efficiency in the reducing intracellular environment, where the highly conserved intrachain disulfide bonds do not form. In the present work, we used an in vivo selection system to isolate novel antigen-binding intrabodies. We screened two intrabody libraries carrying a randomized third hypervariable loop onto the heavy chain of a stable framework, which had been further optimized by random mutagenesis for better behavior in the selection system, and we biophysically characterized the selected variants to interpret the outcome of the selection. Our results show that single-framework intrabody libraries can be directly screened in vivo to rapidly select antigen-specific intrabodies.

Antibodies are pivotal components of the vertebrate immune system that can bind to almost any molecule with a high degree of specificity and affinity. These characteristics have been exploited to turn the natural antibodies into powerful biotechnological tools in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Advances in recombinant DNA technology have facilitated the manipulation, cloning, and expression of the antibody genes in a wide variety of hosts (1Plückthun A. Krebber A. Krebber C. Horn U.

Several forms of antibodies have been constructed to obtain derivatives that carry the binding site in a smaller assembly. One of the minimal forms still retaining the full binding site is the single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) 1The abbreviations used are: scFv, single-chain Fv; CDR, complementarity determining regions; AD, activation domain; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; wt, wild type; RIA, radioimmunoassay. (4Bird R.E. Hardman K.D. Jacobson J.W. Johnson S. Kaufman B.M. Lee S.M. Lee T. Pope S.H. Riordan G.S. Whitlow M. Science. 1988; 242: 423-426Google Scholar, 5Huston J.S. Levinson D. Mudgett-Hunter M.

Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1362-1367Google Scholar). In the scFv form, the variable regions of the heavy and the light chains, which bear the hypervariable loops (or complementarity determining regions (CDR)), are connected by a flexible linker, allowing the expression of the protein from a single cDNA sequence. Natural antibodies, which are secreted by plasma cells, have evolved to function in an extracellular environment. In contrast to full-length, double-chain antibodies, the scFv antibody form can in principle be readily expressed also in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and directed to any compartment to target intracellular proteins and thus evoke specific biological effects. Hence, intracellular scFvs, also known as “intrabodies,” might have a great potential in functional genomics by blocking or modulating the activity of a growing number of newly identified proteins, thereby contributing to the understanding of their functions. In the long run, intrabodies might even be used in therapeutic applications, possibly in gene therapy settings. However, there are only few examples of successful applications (7Rondon I.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 75-80Google Scholar), and the cytoplasmic expression of scFvs is generally confronted with the difficulties concerning the stability, solubility, and aggregation tendency of the intrabody. Because the reducing environment of the cytoplasm prevents the formation of the highly conserved intradomain disulfide bridges, very stable frameworks are needed that fold in the absence of the disulfide bond and do not undergo aggregation (14Mössner E. Koch H. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 115-122Google Scholar, 15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). The sequence requirements that make an scFv very stable such that it might also function in an intracellular environment are only now emerging. 2S. Ewert, T. Huber, A. Honegger, and A. Plückthun, submitted for publication. We have recently described a model system to measure the binding activity of a series of cytoplasmically expressed scFvs in yeast (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). These scFvs, which carry the same CDR loops on different frameworks, were all directed against the dimerization domain of the sequence-specific transcriptional activator Gcn4 (16Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar). Heterologous expression in yeast of some of these specific scFvs inhibited activation of transcription by Gcn4, presumably by blocking the homodimerization of this protein. With our experiments, we demonstrated a clear correlation between in vivo performance and in vitro stability of the different anti-GCN4 variants. Indeed, a framework-engineered stabilized scFv showed significantly stronger activity, thus indicating that thermodynamic stability is one of the most important parameters for intracellular activity. Consequently, improving the thermodynamic stability of scFvs might be a promising strategy to increase the yield of functional intrabodies. In this work, we present a further development of our approach (i) to select for scFv frameworks that behave better in vivo and (ii) to screen random CDR libraries constructed on selected frameworks for identifying intracellular antigen-binding single-chain antibodies directly. We have used a selection assay in yeast that allows the isolation of functional intrabodies based on their ability to bind the cognate antigen in vivo. In this assay, which is an adaptation of the yeast two-hybrid system (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar), the scFv is linked to a transcriptional activation domain, whereas the target antigen is linked to a DNA-binding domain. A specific interaction between the scFv fusion protein and the antigen leads to the activation of expression of a selectable reporter gene. We successfully applied this selection system in combination with random mutagenesis to test and optimize thein vivo performance of an scFv fragment. In addition, the system was used to identify CDR-H3 sequences binding to either the original or a new antigen in vivo. We also have characterized some of the resulting scFvs to be able to interpret the properties of this intracellular selection system. Plasmids expressing various anti-GCN4 fusion proteins were constructed as follows. The Gal4 activation domain (amino acid residues 768–881) was amplified by the PCR using pGAD424 (Clontech) as template. Both primers (upstream primer, 5′-CCA TGG GCC CAA GCT TTG CAA AGA TGG ATA AAG-3′; downstream primer, 5′-TTT GGG CCC GAA GAA CCG CCA CCA CCA GAA CCG CCT CCA CCA GAG CCA CCA CCA CCA GGC CTG ATC TCT TTT TTT GGG TTT GGT G-3′) contain an ApaI site suitable for cloning the Gal4 activation domain including the SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal N-terminal to the different scFvs in the context of pESBA-Act (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). The activation domain and the single-chain antibodies are separated by a (GGGS)3 linker encoded by the downstream primer. All clones were sequenced to confirm in-frame fusion with the Gal4 activation domain. The plasmids expressing the LexA proteins fused to the leucine zippers of Gcn4 or human c-Jun were generated by PCR. The Gcn4 leucine zipper (Swiss-Prot accession number P03069, amino acids 247–281) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with the following primer pair: upstream primer, 5′-GGA ATT CCG TTC TCG TGC GAG AAA GTT-3′; downstream primer, 5′-GGA ATT CTA ATA TGG TGG AGT CAG CTG AG-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into plex113 (18Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Google Scholar) cut with EcoRI. The leucine zipper of the human c-Jun protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P05412, amino acids 274–314) was generated by PCR from plasmid pAB140 3A. Barberis, unpublished data. with the primers 5′-CGG GGA TCC ACC GCA TCG CTG CCT CCA AGT G-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAG CTC AAA ATG TTT GCA ACT GCT GCG TTA G-3′ carrying a BamHI andXbaI site, respectively. The DNA fragment was digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned into BamHI- andXbaI-digested plex113 (18Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Google Scholar). Expression of these LexA derivatives is controlled by the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) promoter. The plasmids are of Ars/Cen type, harboring the LEU2 selection marker. To introduce random amino acid mutations throughout the λ-graft framework (see below), mutagenic PCR was performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following primer pair was used to mutagenize the scFv portion by error-prone PCR: 5′-CAA CTA GTA ACT ATG CCT CCT GGG TC-3′ upstream; 5′-TGT TGG TGA CCA TAA CAC C-3′ downstream. The PCR product was digested with SpeI and SalI and cloned into the Gal4AD-λ-graft expression vector. Three amino acid exchanges in the heavy chain of the λ-graft framework were selected in a random mutagenesis of the λ-graft framework and were combined into a single framework, dubbed “Ω-graft”: H-N84D, H-G85C, and H-K86E (for nomenclature see Ref.20Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 657-670Google Scholar). These amino acid changes were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Randomization of three or eight amino acids in the CDR-H3 of the variable heavy chain was performed by a PCR-based method. Both libraries (3- and 8-mer) were based on the Ω-graft framework and were fused to the Gal4 activation domain. A 2-μm vector was used that carries an ACT1promoter and a TRP1 selection marker. The integrating reporter plasmid pDE200 (21Escher D. Bodmer-Glavas M. Barberis A. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Google Scholar) carries thelacZ and HIS3 reporter genes expressed from a bi-directional promoter with six LexA-binding sites. This plasmid was linearized at the AflII site in the HIS33′-untranslated region and integrated into the his3Δ200 locus of JPY9 (22Farrell S. Simkovich N. Wu Y. Barberis A. Ptashne M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2359-2367Google Scholar) (MATα ura3-52 his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 lys2Δ385 gal4Δ11). Correct integration was confirmed by genomic PCR and functional assays. This reporter strain was named YDE173 and was used for growth selection and to quantify reporter gene activation by measuring β-galactosidase activity. The yeast strain YAdM2xGCN4-150, which expresses the enzyme β-galactosidase under the control of two Gcn4-binding sites, is described elsewhere (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed according to the standard lithium acetate protocol. Transformants were selected by using auxotrophic markers for the corresponding plasmids. Transformed yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in drop-out medium (−Trp/−Leu). The saturated cultures were serially diluted in water (dilution factor 5) starting with a concentration of 106cells/ml. Always 10 μl of each dilution were spotted on selective plates (−Trp/−Leu/−His) containing 0, 40, or 80 mm of 3-aminotriazole. Six different dilutions of each transformant were spotted, which theoretically corresponds to 10,000, 2000, 400, 80, 16, and 3 cells per spot, respectively. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and scanned after 48, 72, and 120 h. The β-galactosidase assay in solution was performed using permeabilized cells as described (23Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 169-173Google Scholar). Activity was normalized to the number of cells assayed. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and averaged values are given. Five ml of a saturated yeast overnight culture was grown in media solely selecting for the library plasmid. Cells were centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of H2O and 200 μl of yeast lysis solution (2% Triton X-100; 1% SDS; 100 mm NaCl; 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8; 1 mm EDTA). The suspension was mixed with about 200-μl glass beads and 200 μl of phenol/chloroform, and the resulting mixture was vortexed. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was subjected again to phenol/DCM and DCM extract, and finally precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in 50 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer (TE) and treated with RNase. ElectrocompetentEscherichia coli cells were transformed with about 0.2 μl of this DNA, and transformed cells were screened for the presence of the scFv-encoding plasmid. For in vitro analysis, the single-chain Fv fragments were expressed and isolated from the bacterial periplasm. Genes encoding the scFvs were cloned into the expression vector pIG6 (24Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-266Google Scholar), containing a signal sequence and a C-terminal His6 tag sequence. The constructs were expressed for 4 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested and disrupted by French press. The single-chain Fv fragments were purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The elution fraction was concentrated using Centriprep concentrators (Millipore). The intrinsic fluorescence of the scFv fragments was detected to follow renaturation and denaturation. A 5 μm solution of the purified single-chain Fv fragments was reduced in 6 m urea in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol (pH 9, for 3 h at 30 °C). The reduced protein was diluted to urea concentrations of 0.6–8 m and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. All measurements were done in 20 mm Hepes buffer (150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorimeter. The center of spectral mass was calculated from the fluorescence spectra as described (25Dumoulin M. Conrath K. Van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 500-515Google Scholar). The curves were normalized and analyzed for relative stabilities as described (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). The scFv portion from five scFv-fusion constructs, carrying different randomized residues in the CDR-H3 loop on the same framework (Ω-graft), namely ALF, GFA, GLF, GLV, and GLW (position 109–136 (20Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 657-670Google Scholar)), and the original clone λ-graft were amplified in three subsequent PCRs. In the first PCR, the scFv portion was amplified as follows: upstream primer, 5′-TCC ATG GCG GAC TAC AAA GAT CCG GAT ATC GTT ATG ACC CAA TCT T-3′; downstream primer, 5′-TGT TGG TGA CCA TAA CAC C-3′ annealing in the 3′-terminator sequence of the expression vector. This PCR product served as template for the second PCR using the same downstream primer and a nested upstream primer: 5′-AGA CCA CAA CGG TTT CCC TCT AGA AAT AAT TTT GTT TAA CTT TAA GAA GGA GAT ATA TCC ATG GCG GAC TAC AAA GAT-3′, introducing a ribosome entry site. The last PCR was performed using again the same downstream primer and another nested primer: 5′-ATA CGA AAT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAC CAC AAC GG-3′, which carries the T7 promoter (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). The last PCR product was directly used for in vitro transcription, and the RNA was purified by LiCl precipitation (27Pokrovskaya I.D. Gurevich V.V. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 420-423Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA were used for in vitro translation using an E. coli S-30 translation system (28Chen H.Z. Zubay G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 674-690Google Scholar). Translation of 10 μg of mRNA was performed for 45 min at 37 °C in a 110-μl reaction as described (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.6 μm[35S]methionine. The translation mix was split into aliquots, and milk in PBST (10 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) was added to an end concentration of 1%. To two of the three aliquots, different amounts of the peptide Gcn4(7P14P) RMKQLEPKVEELLPKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGER (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The protein was bound to a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Nunc) that was first coated with 100 μl of 4 μg/μl Neutravidin overnight and 100 μl of a 290 nm solution of the biotinylated peptide Gcn4(7P14P) for 30 min and blocked for 4 h at room temperature with 4% milk in PBST. Each antibody was split and bound in duplicates to the plate for 15 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of competitor peptide. After washing 5 times with PBST, bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m triethylamine and quantified in a scintillation counter (Wallac). Affinities of single-chain Fv fragments were measured using surface plasmon resonance by the inhibition method as described previously (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar) on a BIAcore 3000 instrument. Inhibition of the purified single-chain Fv fragments was performed with the peptide Gcn4(7P14P), which remains monomeric in solution. The protein was diluted to about 5 nm and equilibrated with different concentrations of the peptide Gcn4(7P14P) overnight ranging from 0 to 15 nm. All measurements were done in Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) on a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) previously coated to maximal density with Neutravidin (Pierce) and biotinylated peptide (7P14P)Gcn4. All curves were measured in triplicate, and the averaged data were fitted as described (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structural model of the Ω-graft variant, a nickname of a triple point mutant of the λ-graft with the CDR-H3 sequence ALFDY, is based on the crystal structure of the originally selected (26Hanes J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13120-13127Google Scholar). Both domains of the λ-graft were individually superimposed with the domains of the anti-GCN4 scFv in complex with the antigen, as seen in the crystal structure. Interface residues differing between the crystal structure of the anti-GCN4 binder and λ-graft (which is, with the exception of three outer loop residues, identical to the interface of Ω-graft) were energy-minimized. The same was done with the mutated residues in the outer loop of VH (which is different between λ-graft and Ω-graft) and with the mutated residues in CDR-H3. In our recent work (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar), we demonstrated that stability is the key component for the function of an intrabody in the reducing intracellular environment. To obtain a suitable model system, we had studied scFvs that had been first selected in vitro to bind antigen (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). Subsequently, a series of constructs spanning a range of stabilities was made, and it was found that the most stable ones could function for inhibiting the antigen activity in vivo (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). In the present work, we first established a system for directly identifying scFvs that are well expressed, soluble, and stable enough to bind the antigen of interest in the absence of disulfide bonds inside a eukaryotic cell. In the second part we then extended this work to select for scFvs binding a different antigen. In our vectors scFvs were fused to the C terminus of the activation domain of Gal4. The model antigen, which consists of the leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcription factor Gcn4, was fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Both hybrid proteins were expressed in the yeast strain YDE173 carrying the divergently oriented reporter genes HIS3and lacZ both under the control of six LexA-binding sites (Fig. 1). The lacZ gene allows quantification of reporter gene activity, whereas the HIS3gene can be exploited to identify antigen-antibody interactions by growth selection. To develop and validate our system, several previously characterized scFv fragments displaying very similar antigen-binding properties, but different in vitro stability and in vivoperformance (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar), were fused to the activation domain (AD) of Gal4. Yeast cells co-expressing anti-Gcn4 scFv variants fused to the activation domain of Gal4 and with the leucine zipper antigen fused to LexA were grown in culture and tested by a β-galactosidase assay to quantify reporter gene activation (Fig. 1). The original anti-GCN4 wild-type (anti-GCN4wt) scFv had been obtained by ribosome display from a murine library (26Hanes J. Jermutus L. Weber-Bornhauser S. Bosshard H.R. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14130-14135Google Scholar). Different variants of this anti-GCN4 single-chain antibody have been extensively characterized for their in vitro stability and solubility, as well as for their in vivo performance as inhibitors of the Gcn4 transcriptional activity in yeast (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). These anti-GCN4 scFv fragments were either point mutants of the original murine antibody, or the CDRs were grafted on a stable framework. Because the CDR donor had a λ light chain, but the recipient framework light chain was of κ type, two versions were constructed, one with the original κ VL-VH dimer interface residues (“κ-graft”) and one with additional six dimer interface residues changed, which were not involved in antigen contact, to retain the original domain orientation (“λ-graft”) (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that the fusion protein bearing the stable scFv moiety called λ-graft exhibited the strongest effect in our screening and selection system, followed by the anti-GCN4wt, and the destabilized point mutant anti-GCN4(H-R66K), corresponding to position H-77 in the new nomenclature (20Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 657-670Google Scholar). In contrast, the even more stable but weakly binding κ-graft and the cysteine-free anti-GCN4(SS−) variant of the wild-type framework caused no significant reporter gene expression. The control fusion protein bearing the unrelated scFv AL5, which is unable to interact with the Gcn4 leucine zipper, did not activate thelacZ reporter gene. The same results were obtained in a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plate assay (data not shown). In summary, the in vivoactivity of the different Gal4AD-scFv fusion variants in our two-hybrid based screening system correlated well with the performance of these scFvs as intracellular inhibitors of Gcn4, as described previously (15Wörn A. Auf der Maur A. Escher D. Honegger A. Barberis A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2795-2803Google Scholar). The reporter construct, which is integrated in the yeast genome, contains the HIS3 gene under the control of six LexA-binding sites (Fig. 1). Binding of the scFv-Gal4 fusion to the antigen-LexA fusion is expected to restore growth on media lacking histidine. Thus, cell growth should be usable as a selection assay to identify antigen-antibody interactions. Furthermore, a combined property of stability, solubility, and affinity of the antibody for the antigen are expected to correlate with the level of gene activation that the interaction between these proteins can elicit, thereby allowing a selection for the “quality” of an intrabody. Various levels of HIS3 gene activation can be readily monitored by selective growth in the presence of different concentrations of 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor for the HIS3 gene product. The yeast growth selection experiments were performed by spotting yeast cells in a series of 5-fold dilutions, starting with ∼10,000 cells on selective plates lacking histidine and containing different concentrations of 3-AT. Growth of yeast cells co-expressing the Gcn4 leucine zipper-LexA hybrid together with various Gal4AD-scFv fusion proteins was monitored over 5 days (Fig. 2 B). Cells expressing the fusion protein LexA-Gal11 (18Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Google Scholar), a strong activator, were used as a positive control for strong HIS3 activation and efficient growth. As a negative control, the unrelated scFv AL5 fused to the Gal4 activation domain was used. Under non-selective conditions, no difference in the growth rate could be observed between the positive control and any of the other transformed yeast cells, indicating that none of the constructs was toxic to the cell. Under selective conditions, however, a 40 mm 3-AT concentration was sufficient to readily discriminate between cells expressing different fusion proteins (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with the results obtained by measuring expression of thelacZ reporter gene (Fig. 2 A), HIS3gene activation of the fusions with the scFv moieties of the κ-graft, the anti-GCN4(SS−), and the less stable anti-GCN4(H-R66K) were insufficient to allow growth in the presence of 40 mm3-AT. Even at concentrations of 20 mm 3-AT, growth of these cells was suppressed (data not shown). In contrast, cells expressing the λ-graft fusion or the an"

It has been predicted to contain a coupled diiron center on the basis of a conserved sequence motif consisting of the proposed iron ligands, four glutamate and two histidine residues. However, this prediction has not been experimentally verified. Here we report the high level expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana alternative oxidaseAOX1a as a maltose-binding protein fusion inEscherichia coli. Reduction and reoxidation of a sample of isolated E. coli membranes containing the alternative oxidase generated an EPR signal characteristic of a mixed-valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) binuclear iron center. The high anisotropy of the signal, the low value of the g-average tensor, and a small exchange coupling (−J) suggest that the iron center is hydroxo-bridged. A reduced membrane preparation yielded a parallel mode EPR signal with a g-value of about 15. In AOX containing a mutation of a putative glutamate ligand of the diiron center (E222A or E273A) the EPR signals are absent. These data provide evidence for an antiferromagnetic-coupled binuclear iron center, and together with the conserved sequence motif, identify the alternative oxidase as belonging to the growing family of diiron carboxylate proteins. The alternative oxidase is the first integral membrane protein in this family, and adds a new catalytic activity (ubiquinol oxidation) to this group of enzymatically diverse proteins.

Nyns E.-J. Sub-cell Biochem. 1975; 4: 1-65PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meeuse B.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 117-126Crossref Google Scholar, 3Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It has subsequently been found in many plant tissues and in many fungal (4Veiga A. Arrabaça J.D. Loureiro-Dias M.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 190: 93-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protist species (5Dinant M. Baurain D. Coosemans N. Joris B. Matagne R.F. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). AOX plays a key role in the respiration of the trypanosome (6Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Temple S. Hill G.C. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Because the enzyme is absent from animal mitochondria, there has been interest in AOX as a target for anti-parasite therapeutics. The AOX does not pump protons, and therefore the energy derived from the oxidation of ubiquinol is not conserved as ATP. The metabolic rationale behind the presence of AOX can vary with organism. In the mammalian bloodstream stage of trypanosomes, where AOX is the only terminal oxidase, its dissipation of excess reducing equivalents balances the glycolytic reactions occurring in the glycosome. In an unusual group of plants belonging to the family Araceae, the AOX allows the rapid uncoupled respiration, which leads to heating of the inflorescence (2Meeuse B.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 117-126Crossref Google Scholar). In more typical plants, there is evidence that AOX is a response to oxidative stress (7Møller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that here the presence of AOX serves to prevent overreduction of the quinone pool and in so doing minimizes the release of reactive oxygen species. Evidence consistent with this role has been obtained in cultured tobacco cells (8Maxwell D.P. Wang Y. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8271-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In keeping with this role, in yeast the presence of AOX correlates with the absence of an alternative means to dissipate excess reducing equivalents, i.e. aerobic fermentation (4Veiga A. Arrabaça J.D. Loureiro-Dias M.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 190: 93-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its wide occurrence in mitochondria and the early observation of the activity, the nature of the active site of AOX has remained elusive. In the early 1970s a specific inhibitor was reported, and this discovery allowed AOX activity to be further specified as a cyanide-resistant, salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive ubiquinol oxidase (9Schonbaum G.R. Bonner Jr., W.D. Storey B.T. Bahr J.T. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, continued efforts at spectroscopic detection of the enzyme were not successful. Detergent-solubilized, partial-purified preparations of this integral membrane protein yielded no EPR signal upon reduction or oxidation, and no visible absorption spectrum above 320 nm (10Berthold D.A. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for the identity of the cofactor emerged when iron was shown to be required for the appearance of activity from the AOX apoprotein in whole-cell experiments with the yeast Pichia anomala (formerly Hansenula anomala) (11Minagawa N. Sakajo S. Komiyama T. Yoshimoto A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and more recently for the trypanosome AOX activity in heme-deficient E. coli (12Ajayi W. Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8187-8193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the late 1980s a partial purification of AOX allowed the generation of an antibody (13Elthon T.E. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8399-8403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which permitted the first cloning of the gene from the thermogenic aroid Sauromatum guttatum (15Rhoads D.M. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The further cloning of AOX from a variety of species revealed several conserved Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His motifs. This prompted Siedow et al. (16Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to postulate that AOX was a diiron carboxylate protein. Modification of that original hypothesis using additional sequence data and evolutionary considerations has generated a model of AOX as a diiron carboxylate protein that interacts with one leaflet of the membrane bilayer as an interfacial integral membrane protein (17Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To date it has not been possible to experimentally confirm the identity of the metal center because of the continued difficulties in purifying AOX in a stabilized form and with a yield sufficient for spectroscopic methods (6Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Temple S. Hill G.C. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Berthold D.A. Siedow J.N.

Here we have expressed the A. thaliana alternative oxidaseAOX1a to high levels in E. coli membranes. Using these membranes, we present the first EPR spectra of AOX. The spectra are characteristic of a mixed-valent-coupled Fe(II)/Fe(III) state and identify AOX as a diiron carboxylate protein. We have also mutated several putative iron ligands and show loss of this distinctive mixed-valent EPR signal, in agreement with the assignment of the EPR signal to the diiron center in the AOX. The A. thalianaalternative oxidase gene AOX1a was amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pAOX (22Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as a template, and the primers (cggaattcagcatgcatatggctagcacgatt) and (caggatccgtcgactcaatgatacccaat), and cloned into theEcoRI-BamHI sites of pMALc2 (New England BioLabs) such that the coding region of AOX (omitting the signal sequence) was fused to the C terminus of MBP. The AOX gene in this construct, pAtAOc2, was sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced and subsequently transferred to pMALc2X (New England BioLabs) with an EcoRI-BamHI digest to form pAtAOc3. The AOX gene was split into two cassettes for mutagenesis at the KpnI site. pNNK8 was described previously (23Djajanegara I. Holtzapffel R. Finnegan P.M. Hoefnagel M.H.N. Berthold D.A. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). pKH9 contains the KpnI-HindIII fragment from pAtAOc3 in pUC119. Mutagenesis was performed by recombination PCR (24Yao Z. Jones D.H. Grose C. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 1: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), using two overlapping oligonucleotides specific to the β-lactamase gene (gacttggttgaatattcaccagtc and gactggtgaatattcaaccaaagtc), and two oligonucleotides specific to each mutation: E222A (gcagagaatgCgagaatgcatcttatg and cattctcGcattctctgcttcc); H225A (gagagaatgGCtcttatgacattcatg and cataagaGCcattctctcattc); E273A (gtaccttgCGgaagaagcgatcc and gcttcttcCGcaaggtaccgag); and H327A (gaggctcatGCGcgtgatgtaaacc and catcacgCGCatgagcctcgtc). Following sequencing, the mutated cassettes were reintroduced into pAtAOc3, and the plasmids sequenced again to verify the transfer. When low level expression of AOX was desired, a spontaneous mutant of pAtAOc2 having an attenuated expression level was used. The mutations in this vector, pAtAOcM, are found outside theAOX-coding region. The isolation and characterization of pAtAOcM will be described elsewhere (25Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Nordlund P. Protein Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). For expression, pAtAOc3 was transformed into E. coli C43 (DE3). The cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking in LB media containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μmFeSO4 to an OD600 of 0.5, at which point the temperature was dropped to 18 °C. After 1 h, 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce expression. The cells were harvested 15–18 h after induction. pAtAOcM was transformed into E. coli GO103 (a gift from R. B. Gennis, University of Illinois), grown at 37 °C in the same medium, and harvested after a 6-h induction with 0.1 mm IPTG. For complementation studies, the mutations were transferred to plasmid pAtAOn3, which is based upon pAtAOmKX (26Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but has an altered 3′-non-coding region containing the rrnB terminator and yields roughly double the level of AOX expression. To construct pAtAOn3, a fragment containing the terminator region was transferred from pAtAOc2 to pAtAOmKX by digestion with KpnI and SacI. The activity of the AOX mutants in pAtAOn3 was assessed by testing their ability to restore aerobic respiration in heme-deficient E. coli as described previously (26Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 days. Colonies expressing wild type AOX were visible after 2 days. The E. coli cell pellet was resuspended at an OD600 of 50–100 in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm pyruvate, with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added immediately prior to breakage. The cells were broken using one pass through a French Pressure Cell (18,000 psi). Unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min, 10,000 × g), and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged a second time. The supernatant of the second centrifugation was centrifuged (2 h, 100,000 ×g) to pellet the membrane fraction. The pellet was homogenized in a minimal volume of 15% sucrose, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyruvate, pH 7.0, and frozen at −80 °C. Prior to EPR analysis, the membranes were thawed and diluted into 50 mm Tris, 5 mmpyruvate, pH 7.5, and ultracentrifuged as above. The pellet was homogenized in 15% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 5 mmpyruvate, pH 7.5 and either used for EPR immediately, or stored at −80 °C until use. In later experiments, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 replaced the potassium phosphate buffer throughout the preparation, and EDTA was omitted from the −80 °C storage buffer. Protein was determined using Petersen's modification of the Lowry method (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The protein concentration in the E. coli C43 (DE3) membrane preparations ranged from 73–78 mg protein/ml, and that in the E. coli GO103 preparation (containing the low expression level of AOX) was 58 mg protein/ml. For preparation of EPR samples, the membrane suspension was diluted 2-fold. All protein and spin concentrations given in the text refer to the original undiluted sample. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out using a modified Laemmli system containing 2.5m urea as previously described (10Berthold D.A. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that the protease inhibitor was omitted, and dithiothreitol (0.1 m) replaced β-mercaptoethanol as the reducing agent. Oxidation-reduction potential titrations were carried out in an apparatus similar to that described by Dutton (28Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The sample (1.6–1.8 ml) was stirred in a vessel maintained at 0 °C. The redox potential was measured using a platinum electrode with a calomel reference. Seven mediators were used: indigo carmine (E'o = −125 mV), methylene blue (E'o = 10 mV), duroquinone (E'o = 10 mV), thionine (E'o= 56 mV), phenazine methosulfate (PMS) (E'o = 80 mV), 1,2-naphthoquinone (E'o = 143 mV),N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl phenylenediamine (E'o = 276 mV) in a mixture containing 50 μmeach. The membrane suspension was reduced with 10 μl of 200 mm dithionite (DT) in 1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.5) or 30 μl of 200 mm NADH in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) while flushing with argon. After stabilization of redox potential of the reduced membrane suspension at ∼−300mV (in the case of DT) and −150mV (in the case of NADH) reoxidation was performed either by titration with 200 mmK3Fe(CN)6 or by flushing with air. Samples were transferred to EPR tubes using a Hamilton syringe and frozen in cold isopentane. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer with an Oxford Instruments ESR9 helium cryostat. Spin quantitation was made by comparison with a standard solution of 1 mm CuSO4 in 50 mmEDTA, by double integration of spectra recorded at nonsaturating microwave power levels using standard Bruker software. A single gene product was shown to be sufficient to give an active AOX when it was reported that the AOX1a gene from anA. thaliana library restored aerobic respiration in a heme-deficient E. coli mutant (22Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We undertook extensive screening to identify an inducible high level expression system. The optimal expression construct was found to be an MBP fusion under a tac promoter. Fig. 1 depicts a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of isolated membranes showing the level of protein expressed from this plasmid, pAtAOc3, following IPTG induction. Using scanning densitometry we estimated that the MBP-AOX fusion was 25% of the total protein or 250 μm AOX monomer. This MBP-AOX fusion is active, insofar as uninduced (leaky) expression from pAtAOc3 complements heme-deficient E. coli, restoring the capacity for aerobic respiration. Since the sequence motif suggested a diiron carboxylate site in AOX (16Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we used EPR to search for signals that might arise from the overexpressed AOX protein in the isolated membranes. We began with redox conditions similar to those used to observe the mixed-valent paramagnetic site in mouse ribonucleotide reductase protein R2 (29Atta M. Andersson K.K. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6429-6430Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded at low temperature (5 K). The EPR sample was made strictly anaerobic by repeatedly adding argon and evacuating. DT (2 mm) was added directly to the EPR tube with the mediator PMS (1 mm). Only an EPR signal at g = 1.94 was seen and no mixed-valent signal (Fig.2 a). The g = 1.94 signal is typical for the iron-sulfur centers in the respiratory chain of E. coli, which are paramagnetic in the reduced form. Fig. 2, b–d show EPR spectra from samples prepared in an oxygen electrode chamber without initial removal of oxygen, where they were reduced by DT and PMS, and then exposed to air with increasing incubation times. The spectra show a characteristic mixed-valent (Fe(II)/Fe(III)) EPR signal that should originate from the metal site of AOX with g-values 1.86, 1.67, 1.53. The mixed-valent signal appears in increasing amount with time of aerobic incubation. Fig. 3 depicts a time course of sample preparation showing the oxygen concentration and quantitation of the mixed-valent EPR signal.Figure 3Time course of AOX sample preparation showing formation of the mixed-valent state. E. coli membranes containing the overexpressed alternative oxidase (76 mg of protein/ml) were added to the oxygen electrode sample chamber, held at 7 °C, with stirring. Phenazine methosulfate (PMS, 2.5 mm) and dithionite (DT) were added at the times indicated. Oxygen was re-introduced by removing the chamber lid. Samples were removed to an EPR tube made anaerobic by flushing with argon and frozen immediately using isopentane. The time of removal and the spin concentration of each sample are shown by bars. One sample (indicated by an asterisk) was removed to the EPR tube and held anaerobic on ice for the time indicated (dashed line, labeled -O2), and then frozen. Instrument parameters are as follows: microwave frequency, 9.62 GHz; microwave power, 100 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1 mT; temperature, 5 K. The ordinate on theleft (O2 concentration) is derived from the initial calibration of the electrode (100% saturation = 376 μm at 7 °C) but over the course of the measurement the sensitivity of the electrode declined from interaction with the oxidation products of DT. Note that the lag in oxygen reappearance is due to the residual DT in the chamber, as well as the slow diffusion across the sample interface owing to the viscosity of the membrane sample. The spin concentration of the sample begins to increase with time after oxygen is reintroduced to the chamber and becomes maximal near the point where the oxygen begins to accumulate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A control sample with overexpressed AOX prepared was removed from the electrode chamber prior to the introduction of oxygen and was kept anaerobically on ice for 30 min. Only a small EPR signal from the mixed-valent iron center was observed (Fig. 2 e), which is even smaller than that from the initial sample (Fig. 2 f). Another control sample, consisting of E. coli membranes, which lacked AOX, was treated under the same conditions as Fig.2 c (reduction by DT and PMS, and exposure to oxygen for 20 min). This sample gave no evidence of a mixed-valent EPR signal (Fig.2 f and TableI A).Table IAppearance of the mixed-valent diiron EPR signal in E. coli membranes with varying levels of expression of AOX or selected mutantsPreparationTreatmentRedox state of E. colirespiratory chainaMonitored by the EPR signals of iron-sulfur centers of the respiratory chain of E. coli: ferredoxin-type centers of NADH-dehydrogenase (N1–N4) and succinate dehydrogenase (S-1) that all are paramagnetic in the reduced state and contribute to the signal at g = 1.94 (49,50) and HiPIP iron-sulfur center of succinate dehydrogenase S-3, which is paramagnetic in oxidized state (g av = 2.03) (51).Spin concentration mixed-valent EPR signalμmA.

Open table in a new tab Further characterization of the conditions producing the mixed-valent EPR signal are shown in Table 1, B–E. The membranes were reduced under an argon atmosphere, and the redox potential was monitored throughout the preparation. The redox state of the Fe/S centers in the E. coli membranes, as determined by theg = 1.94 and the g = 2.03 EPR signals, were used as internal monitors for the redox state. Interestingly, with overexpressed AOX, the mixed-valent signal was initially observed in membranes prior to any treatment at a level of about 25% of the maximal observable signal. The maximal signal (about 11 μm) was obtained after reduction by DT and reoxidation by air. We observed this maximum signal (with a range from 9.6 to 12 μm) in six independent experiments, which used three separate membrane preparations. In contrast, when the sample was reduced and reoxidized with ferricyanide rather than air, only a small signal was observed (which may be due to imperfect anaerobic transfer of the sample to the EPR tube). This result demonstrates the specific requirement for oxygen and not simply an oxidant for the generation of the mixed-valent EPR signal. When NADH was used to reduce the sample, only a partial reduction of the Fe/S centers was obtained, and in this instance we did not see the maximal appearance of the mixed-valent signal. We also found that no mediators were required for the appearance of the signal, regardless of whether DT or NADH was used as reductant. A very high level of MBP-AOX protein is expressed from pAtAOc3 under conditions of IPTG induction. For comparison, we investigated a preparation of E. coli GO103/pAtAOcM membranes containing a low AOX expression level. In this preparation, the MBP-AOX band is not immediately identifiable on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 1,lane 4). Preliminary results from an immunoblot indicate that the level of expression is 4–7-fold less than the sample expressed from pAtAOc3 (data not shown). In these membranes, we observed a maximal mixed-valent spin concentration of 2 μm (Table 1C). This concentration is 6-fold less than what is observed for the high expression level samples. In order to observe the effect of a disrupted diiron center on the appearance of the mixed-valent EPR signal, we mutated each of four putative iron ligands (Glu-222, His-225, Glu-273, and His-327) individually to alanine. The mutants were tested for their ability to restore aerobic respiration to the heme-deficient E. coliSASX41BD. Using this complementation assay, it was observed that none of the four mutants were active. When either of the two histidine ligands His-225 or His-327 were mutated to alanine, the protein was destabilized such that little or no protein was observed on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 8). Mutation of the glutamate residues Glu-222 or Glu-273 to alanine did allow a level of protein expression similar to the native MBP-AOX fusion (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 7). Reduction and reoxidation of the E. coli membranes containing either of these two mutants yielded no detectable mixed-valent EPR signal (Table 1, D and E), in agreement with the proposed role of these residues as iron ligands. The EPR signal at g < 2 observed after the reduction and reoxidation of AOX is highly characteristic of an antiferromagnetic-coupled Fe(II)/Fe(III) site (30Andersson K.K. Gräslund A. Adv. Inorg.

From this relationship, the exchange integral was found to be −J = 5.5 ± 1 cm−1.

EPR and UV-visible absorption spectra show that protonation of the primary intermediate of radiolytic reduction, the peroxo-ferric complex, to form the hydroperoxo-ferric complex is completed only after annealing at temperatures 150–180 K. After further annealing at 195–205 K, this complex directly transforms to ferric HRP without any observable intervening species. The lack of Compound I formation is explained by inability of the enzyme to deliver the second proton to the distal oxygen atom of hydroperoxide ligand, shown to be necessary for dioxygen bond heterolysis on the “oxidase pathway,” which is non-physiological for HRP. Alternatively, the physiological substrate H2O2 brings both protons to the active site of HRP, and Compound I is subsequently formed via rearrangement of the proton from the proximal to the distal oxygen atom of the bound peroxide.

Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been successfully applied to other enzymes (2English A.M. Tsaprailis G. Adv. Inorg.

The essential features of this mechanism also provide a framework for the analysis of new systems, which involve formation of redox-active heme-oxygen intermediates (6Watanabe Y. Groves J.T.

A crucial point in the formation of the ferryl-oxo species is the second protonation of the distal oxygen atom of the bound hydroperoxo species, followed by the heterolytic scission of O–O bond. The importance of these elementary steps has been confirmed by quantum chemical methods (9Loew G.H. Dupuis M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10584-10587Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Woon D.E.

Despite many efforts, experimental characterization of this step, as well as the detailed properties of the hydroperoxo-ferric heme (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex in peroxidases, is still far from complete. One reason is the low stability of such complexes (16Tajima K. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1989; 163: 115-122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), because their transient character leads to a lack of accumulation during the reaction course.

Loew G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10588-10594Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Even so, we are aware of only one successful isolation of an (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate in an H2O2-driven heme protein system, which was obtained using a distal pocket mutant of Mb (24Brittain T. Baker A.R. Butler C.S. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Greenwood C. Watmough N.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The difficulties in the kinetic resolution of the (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate on this pathway may be caused by the fact that both protons necessary for the Compound I formation are brought into the active site of the enzyme with the H2O2molecule itself. Apparently, the subsequent 1-2 proton shift is fast and not rate-limiting under most conditions (5Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. Adv. Inorg.

An alternative way of generating (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediates with high yield is the cryoradiolytic reduction of the corresponding oxy-ferrous complexes using ionizing radiation (25Symons M.C.R.

This method mimics the oxidase/oxygenase pathway of oxygen activation, which uses molecular oxygen instead of H2O2, and includes the reduction of the bound oxygen and delivery of two external protons to form Compound I (6Watanabe Y.

Earlier investigations using cryoradiolysis (30Gasyna Z. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or pulse radiolysis at ambient conditions (39Kobayashi K. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12350-12354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for reduction of oxy-ferrous HRP, have not provided unambiguous assignment of observed intermediate states. Detailed studies of the reductive pathway of oxygen activation in HRP, where the associated Compound I state is relatively stable, could provide critical input into the mechanism of oxygen-oxygen bond scission and the requirements for specific distal pocket residues in generating higher valent metal-oxo complexes thought to be operating in the heme-thiolate oxygenases such as cytochrome P450. To investigate this path, we used the cryogenic radiolytic reduction of oxy-ferrous HRP to prepare the peroxo/hydroperoxo ferric intermediate and monitor its protonation and possible Compound I formation using EPR and optical absorption spectroscopy. As a reference point, we also document the cryoradiolytic reduction of Compound I, prepared using the classic reaction of the ferric enzyme with hydrogen peroxide. Ferrous HRP was prepared by anaerobic reduction of the ferric HRP (Type XII; Sigma) with dithionite and subsequent anaerobic chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) to remove the excess dithionite and decomposition products. The enzyme solution was mixed with buffered deoxygenated glycerol (gas chromatography grade; Sigma) to give a final concentration of 25–50 μmHRP in 70% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1 m phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 6.2, oxygenated at 270 K by bubbling air and stirring for 30 s, and cooled to 77 K, as described previously (33Denisov I.G.

All samples for optical spectroscopy were prepared in UV-enhanced methacrylate semimicro spectroscopic cells (Fisher) and used with 4.3-mm path. The ferric HRP samples used for the control were prepared in the same fashion, cooled to 77 K and irradiated together with other samples. Compounds I and II were prepared according to published procedures (3, and references therein). Compound I was obtained by manual mixing 70% glycerol/buffer solutions of the ferric HRP and 1.2 molar excess of H2O2 at low temperature (260–270 K). After mixing for 20–30 s, the sample was placed into a thermostat and quickly cooled to 200 K. The sample was then slowly cooled to 77 K using UV-visible spectroscopy to monitor the purity of the preparation. Compound II was prepared by mixing of 75% glycerol/buffer solutions of the ferric HRP, containing 4-fold molar excess of the substrate, 3,5-dimethylphenol, with a 4-fold molar excess of H2O2 in the similar conditions. The spectra of Compounds I and II showed weak temperature dependence and were similar to those reported in the literature (40Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol.

UV-visible spectra were measured on a Cary 3 spectrophotometer (Varian) in an unsilvered Dewar (33Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

Electron spin resonance spectra were obtained at the University of Illinois EPR Resource Center on a Varian E-122 X-Band (9.08 GHz) spectrometer with a protein concentration of 0.4 mm. Typical conditions include a microwave power of 0.5 milliwatts with modulation amplitude of 12.5 G at 100 kHz. A liquid helium flow system (Air Products, Allentown, PA) was used for measurements at 4–20 K. Samples for EPR were prepared in a similar manner as those for UV-visible experiments, with a final glycerol concentration of 20% (v/v). The radiolytic reduction of the enzyme and reference samples was achieved by exposing to γ-radiation from a 60Co source (dose rate, 11 kilograys/h for 4 or 8 h) (Notre Dame Radiation Laboratory, Notre Dame University, South Bend, IN). The samples were fully immersed in liquid nitrogen during irradiation. Background absorption from the radiolysis products was subtracted as described previously (33Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11648-11652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using irradiated buffer/glycerol reference samples. These samples were irradiated at 77 K together with the protein samples, and 40 absorption spectra were taken at different temperatures from 80 to 240 K. The background spectra for any arbitrary temperature in this range were then calculated using linear interpolation. The spectra of oxy-HRP before and after irradiation at 77 K are shown in Fig. 1.

The yield of this intermediate (35–50%) was estimated from the dose-dependent absorption spectra, using the spectra of oxy-HRP as the reference. The spectrum of the pure (Fe3+P-OOH−) HRP complex, calculated from multiple experiments with different yields, is also shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum of this intermediate has a red-shifted Soret band (maximum at 419 nm, compared with 416 nm for oxy-ferrous HRP) and blue-shifted Q-bands (556 and 526 nm). This spectrum is in very good agreement with the spectrum of the (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex of heme oxygenase, 2I. G. Denisov, M. Ikeda-Saito, T. Yoshida, and S. G.

Unfortunately, it was impossible to resolve the spectra of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex at wavelengths shorter than 360 nm because of the high absorption of the products of radiolysis of glycerol and the protein matrix. Thus, we cannot confirm the true hyperporphyrin shape of the Soret band of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex, as calculated by Harris and Loew (23Harris D.L. Loew G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10588-10594Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and often used as a criterion to distinguish between the neutral peroxide-ferric (Fe3+P-HOOH) and hydroperoxo-anion-ferric (Fe3+P-OOH−) complexes based on their absorption spectra in the Soret region (19Rodrigues-Lopez J.N. Lowe D.J. Hernandez-Ruiz J. Hiner A.N.P. Garcia-Canovas F. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11838-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 44Hiner A.N.P. Raven E.L.

Fig. 2 shows the annealing of the (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex monitored by EPR and UV-visible spectra. In the EPR spectra, the presence of two species in the primary intermediate is clearly resolved. Based on the analogous studies of other heme proteins (25Symons M.C.R. Petersen R.L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1978; 201: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Kappl R.

Soc. 1999; 121: 10654-10655Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), these are assigned as the unprotonated peroxo-ferric heme complex (Fe3+P-OO2−, g3 = 2.27) and the protonated, hydroperoxo-ferric heme complex (Fe3+P-OOH−, g3 = 2.32). Gradual annealing at 140–160 K results in disappearance of the feature at g3 = 2.27 and increase at g3 = 2.32 as the first protonation of peroxo-ferric complex and formation of hydroperoxo intermediate is completed. These results are in agreement with EPR spectra obtained using cryoradiolytic reduction studies of oxy-HRP in 50% ethylene glycol (30Gasyna Z. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The analysis of absorption spectra of the similar samples measured at 90–160 K does not reveal any significant changes that can be assigned to the protonation of peroxo-ferric intermediate. Thus, at least under the conditions of our experiments, the optical spectra in this region are not sensitive enough to distinguish clearly between the unprotonated and protonated peroxo/hydroperoxo-ferric heme complex of HRP. Recently we obtained EPR and UV-visible spectra of peroxo/hydroperoxo intermediates of the distal mutants of cytochrome P450 CYP101, in which the first protonation of a peroxo-ferric heme complex could be detected in optical absorption spectra as a 3-nm blue shift of Soret and a similar blue shift of the Qα band from 561 to 558 nm. 3T. M. Makris, I. G. Denisov, S.-C. Hung, V. Kulik, I. Schlichting, K. Chu, R. M. Sweet, and S. G. Sligar, manuscript in preparation. However, the relative spectral differences between oxy-ferrous and peroxo/hydroperoxo-ferric heme complexes in the Soret region are weaker in HRP and in heme oxygenase than in P450 enzymes (33Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11648-11652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Denisov I.G. Hung S.-C. Weiss K.E. McLean M.A. Shiro Y. Park S.-Y. Champion P.M. Sligar S.G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This difference, which is caused by the different proximal ligands in these enzymes, imidazole/imidazolate in HRP and heme oxygenaseversus thiolate in P450, also results in different sensitivity of the optical absorption spectra to the protonation of the distal peroxo- ligand. Further annealing by increasing the sample temperature from 180 to 210 K shows the decay of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex with no evidence for the formation of a Compound I intermediate. EPR spectra of the samples annealed at 195, 200, and 210 K, show gradual decrease of the signal from (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex and formation of the ferric HRP with no other observable intermediates. This result is consistent with two scenarios. One would involve the transient formation of Compound I, which is quickly reduced to generate the EPR-silent Compound II and after the second reduction returns to the ferric enzyme. Another possibility is the direct decay of (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate through dissociation of the ligand and return to the ferric resting state of HRP. Because EPR-silent species may be involved in the evolution of this system, EPR spectroscopy does not provide complete characterization of the (Fe3+P-OOH−) fate in HRP. Thus, the optical absorption spectra of the similar samples were studied, and the reference experiments using cryoradiolytic reduction of Compound I were performed to assign the annealing pathway of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex. Fig. 2 B shows the absorption spectra of the radiolytically reduced oxy-ferrous HRP measured at 190–210 K. At temperatures above the glass transition of the solvent matrix, the hydroperoxo-ferric complex gradually disappears, as clearly seen by simultaneous decrease of the sharp maximum at 557 nm and of the Soret band at 420 nm. No increase of absorption at 650 nm characteristic for Compound I porphyrin π-cation radical was detected in annealing experiments. On the contrary, the bands at 407 and 635 nm are observed, corresponding to the spectrum of the resting form of HRP, possibly perturbed by the presence of the dissociated hydroperoxo-anion/hydrogen peroxide at the distal pocket of the enzyme. At higher temperatures, this spectrum, as well as the spectrum of the remaining oxy-HRP, disappears, and the characteristic spectrum of the carbonmonoxy-ferrous complex of HRP emerges with Soret band at 421 nm and Q bands at 540 and 572 nm (not shown). The CO adduct is the result of the nonspecific reduction of the heme enzyme by the products of radiolysis and binding of CO, which is one of the products of glycerol radiolysis (45Woods R.J. Pikaev A.K. Applied Radiation Chemistry: Radiation Processing. Wiley Interscience, New York.1994Google Scholar) and is always observed after thawing of irradiated frozen solutions of the heme enzymes (33Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

In a control experiment, the dissolution of nonirradiated metMb into a glycerol/buffer reference sample, which was irradiated at 77 K and thawed, resulted in formation of fully reduced Mb-CO. To probe the reactivity of Compound I under radiolytic conditions we separately generated this intermediate using H2O2, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 3 shows the spectra of Compound I before and after radiolytic reduction. The spectrum of Compound I obtained at low temperature is in a good agreement with earlier reports (40Blumberg W.E. Peisach J. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1854-1862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gasyna Z. Browett W.R. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2502-2509Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Radiolytic reduction of Compound I at 77 K results in formation of a new species with the absorption spectra similar to those reported for Compound II. Direct formation of Compound II confirms the chemical competence of cryoradiolysis on HRP intermediates and the true one-electron reduction caused by cryogenic radiolytic treatment of heme enzyme intermediates. At temperatures below 190 K, the shape of the spectrum of Compound II does not change significantly, which implies that it is relatively stable and does not undergo further reduction by products of radiolysis until annealed above the glass transition temperature. At 198 K, this intermediate begins to disappear gradually, with concomitant formation of ferric HRP (Fig. 3, spectra at 198–205 K). The latter process is consistent with one-electron reduction of Compound II, as occurs in the peroxidase enzymatic cycle under ambient conditions. Results shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the annealing of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex in HRP (Fig.2 B) to form ferric HRP does not follow a path through Compound I and Compound II. Comparison of Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3reveals substantial differences in observed spectra and annealing behavior of reduced oxy-HRP and Compound II. Although the spectrum of Compound II has almost the same peak positions (418, 526, and 558 nm, Fig. 3) as the (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate (419, 526, and 556 nm), the spectra of these two species are not identical. The Qα band at 556 nm has substantially higher amplitude than the Qβ band at 526 nm in the spectrum of (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex, whereas in the spectrum of Compound II, these two bands are of almost the same intensity. Thus, the appearance of Compound II spectra in the optical annealing studies of (Fe3+P-OOH−) species would have been detected if the pathway through Compounds I and II was the operative one. Instead, in all such experiments, the spectrum of ferric HRP emerged at the expense of (Fe3+P-OOH−) spectrum, and the direct decay of hydroperoxo-ferric complex, or the so-called peroxide shunt, was observed. The lack of Compound I formation from its immediate precursor, (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex, may be considered as an unexpected result, because HRP is known for its facile formation of the stable Compound I species. However, there are important mechanistic differences between the enzymatic cycle of this enzyme, which uses H2O2 as the oxygen donor, and the oxidase/oxygenase path explored in the current studies. The (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex is formed as the precursor of Compound I in both systems, and the second protonation of the β oxygen atom in this complex is the decisive step to form Compound I. The specific delivery of this second proton is crucial for Compound I formation from (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex (10Woon D.E. Loew G.H. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1998; 102: 10380-10384Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Wirstam M. Blomberg M.R.A. Siegbahn P.E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10178-10185Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Harris D.L.

The perturbation of this proton delivery system caused by mutations at the active site was shown to result in nonproductive reduction of oxygen and formation of hydrogen peroxide, or “uncoupling” in the cytochrome P450 catalytic cycle (49Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 50Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In HRP, the (Fe3+P-OOH−) complex is formed from H2O2 via deprotonation of the neutral hydrogen peroxide at the distal pocket of the enzyme, and the same proton can be used for the second protonation of the β oxygen via the rearrangement catalyzed by the distal His42 and Arg38 side chains (1Poulos T.L.

If dioxygen is used instead of H2O2, both protonation steps have to be provided by the enzyme, as occurs in the P450 monooxygenases (32Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G.

Because this path is non-physiological for HRP, the enzyme fails to deliver the second proton required for Compound I formation, and an uncoupling is observed. In conclusion, we prepared the main redox intermediates of the HRP enzymatic cycle and performed the radiolytic reduction of these species. The (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate, the precursor of Compound I formation, was isolated via radiolytic reduction of oxy-HRP. Absorption and EPR spectra of this intermediate are reported with much higher resolution and precision than in previous studies. The first protonation of the peroxo-ferric heme complex, the primary product of the reduction of oxy-ferrous HRP, is completed only at the temperatures higher than 150 K, as was observed in D251N mutant of P450 CYP101 (32Davydov R.

Annealing of the reduced oxy-ferrous complex of HRP results in completion of the first protonation of the peroxide ligand and formation of the ferric hydroperoxo intermediate. Formally, this intermediate is the same as the one formed in the reaction of H2O2 with heme proteins, which is a precursor for the formation of Compound I in HRP and other peroxidases. However, when obtained by reduction of the oxy-ferrous heme complex, the peroxo-ferric intermediate via this path still needs two protons provided by the enzyme to affect O–O bond scission. This difference between peroxidase (using H2O2) and oxygenase/oxidase (using O2) pathways is essential in the subsequent evolution of this intermediate. Annealing at higher temperatures of (Fe3+P-OOH−) intermediate in HRP did not result in Compound I formation. We conclude, that Compound I is not formed on this pathway, because the delivery of the second proton to the distal (β) oxygen atom of the hydroperoxo-anion ligand is not optimized in HRP. These results confirm the importance of protonation mechanisms in heme enzymes, which use dioxygen for the formation of the redox active heme oxygen intermediates.

We have identified the βγ subunit complex of the photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin (T), as a target of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Ubiquitylated species of the transducin γ-subunit (Tγ) but not the α- or β-subunits were assembled de novo in bovine photoreceptor preparations. In addition, Tγ was exclusively ubiquitylated when Tβγ was dissociated from Tα. Ubiquitylation of Tβγ on Tγ was selectively catalyzed by human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5 and UbcH7 and was coincident with degradation of the entire Tβγ subunit complex in vitroby a mechanism requiring ATP and the proteasome. We also show that Tβγ association with phosducin, a photoreceptor-specific protein of unknown physiological function, blocks Tβγ ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation. Phosphorylation of phosducin by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which inhibits phosducin-Tβγ complex formation, completely restored Tβγ ubiquitylation and degradation.

They include the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (6Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Res. 2001; 43: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Phosducin is most highly expressed in the mammalian pineal gland and retina. In the latter it is present in high concentrations (>350 μm) in the cytosol of photoreceptor (i.e. rod) cells (8Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N.

Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar). Phosducin forms a tight complex with the βγ heterodimer of the photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin (Tαβγ) following light-induced transducin dissociation (10Lee R.H. Ting T.D. Lieberman B.S.

Formation of the phosducin-Tβγ (Pd-Tβγ) complex reduces the availability of free Tβγ for re-association with Tα·GDP, which is required for subsequent transducin activation. Dark-dependent phosducin phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) reduces phosducin binding to Tβγ by 3- and 300-fold, respectively (11Yoshida T.

These observations suggested a mechanism in which the cycle of phosducin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates the light sensitivity of the photoreceptor by controlling the amount of transducin available for activation. Such a mechanism might be important for photoreceptor light adaptation, during which potentially saturating levels of light input to photoreceptor cells are countered by desensitization (reviewed in Ref. 16Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, recent studies (9Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eye Res. 2000; 71: S179Google Scholar) clearly demonstrate that most phosducin is localized not in the outer segments of photoreceptors, where the light receptor rhodopsin is present and where phototransduction occurs, but in the inner segments, which are primarily responsible for the metabolic functions of the cell. This inconsistency calls for a revision of the proposed role of phosducin in photoreceptors. A solution might be provided by the observation that, upon continuous illumination, up to 90% of both Tα and Tβγ translocate from the photoreceptor outer segment to the inner segment (Ref. 19Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovski V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (307) Google Scholar and references therein). However, the functional importance of Tβγ interaction with phosducin in the inner segment is unclear. The ubiquitin (Ub) proteasome pathway (UPP) provides another potential mechanism of G protein regulation (20Obin M. Nowell T. Taylor A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Taylor A. Shang F. Obin M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: 305-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The UPP is a conserved pathway of selective protein modification and degradation that controls levels and activities of many highly regulated eukaryotic proteins (reviewed in Refs. 22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar, 23Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Substrates of the UPP are covalently ligated to one or more monomers of the 8.5 kDa protein, ubiquitin, by the sequential activities of three families of thiol enzymes: Ub-activating enzymes (E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (Ubc), and Ub-isopeptide ligases (E3) (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar, 23Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Two E1 enzymes, over 30 Ubc enzymes, and more than 100 E3 ligases have been identified. Selectivity in ubiquitylation is accomplished by the specific interplay between Ubc and E3, which interact with distinct but incompletely understood ubiquitylation signals within substrates. Ubiquitylation signals (also called “degrons” when ubiquitylation targets proteins for degradation) consist of two modules: 1) primary determinants for recognition by Ubc, E3 (and occasionally ancillary factors) and 2) secondary determinants, i.e. one or more lysines to which ubiquitin is covalently attached (reviewed in Ref. 24Varshavsky A. Byrd C. Davydov I.V. Dohmen R.J., Du, F. Ghislain M. Gonzalez M. Grigoryev S. Johnson E.S. Johnsson N. Johnston J.A. Kwon Y.T. Levy F. Lomovskaya O. Madura K. Ota I. Rumenapf T. Shrader T.E. Suzuki T. Turner G. Waller P.R.H. Webster A. Xie Y. Peters J-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 223-278Crossref Google Scholar). Multiple ubiquitin molecules can be subsequently attached to a substrate as an isopeptide-linked polyubiquitin chain. Such chains preferentially target the substrate moiety of the Ub-protein conjugate for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, a multicatalytic, ATP-dependent protease (reviewed in Ref. 25Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Although the best recognized function of ubiquitylation is selective targeting of proteins for rapid degradation (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar, 23Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), ubiquitylation per se can regulate protein trafficking, phosphorylation, and other nonproteolytic fates (reviewed in Ref. 26Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The most extensive evidence for the regulation of G protein signaling by the UPP has been obtained in S. cerevisiae, where Ub-dependent proteolysis of Gα controls signaling through the mating pheromone receptor (24Varshavsky A. Byrd C. Davydov I.V. Dohmen R.J., Du, F. Ghislain M. Gonzalez M. Grigoryev S. Johnson E.S. Johnsson N. Johnston J.A. Kwon Y.T. Levy F. Lomovskaya O. Madura K. Ota I. Rumenapf T. Shrader T.E.

Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Madura K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We previously identified Tαβγ as a UPP substrate in vitro (20Obin M. Nowell T. Taylor A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and proposed that Tγ was the ubiquitylated subunit, based on detection of a ∼30 kDa Ub protein conjugate in the transducin fraction from bovine photoreceptors (28Obin M. Jahngen-Hodge J. Nowell T. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14473-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosducin has also been suggested to interact with the UPP. Specifically, two-hybrid screens, reconstitution assays and overexpression studies (29Barhite S. Thibault C. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Zhu X. Craft C.M. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 13PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phosducin (and PhLP) interacts with p45/Sug1, a subunit of the 26 S proteasome 19 S regulatory complex. This observation has led to a suggestion that phosducin and/or PhLP act as adapters linking Gβγ heterodimers to the 26 S proteasome (29Barhite S. Thibault C. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Zhu X. Craft C.M. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 13PubMed Google Scholar, 31Flanary P.L. DiBello P.R. Estrada P. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18462-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon delivery to the proteasome, Gβγ could be degraded, or alternatively, refolded by the chaperone activity of the 19 S regulatory complex (32Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Here we report that Tβγ is ubiquitylated on Tγ and that Tγ ubiquitylation targets the Tβγ heterodimer for degradation by the 26 S proteasome in vitro. However, Tβγ is completely resistant to ubiquitylation and degradation when complexed with phosducin. These data provide the first example of Gβγ subunit complexes being UPP substrates and suggest a novel role for phosducin as a protective factor for Tβγ during continuous illumination.

PdS73A-Myc-His6-Tβγ complex was formed in vitro by coincubating PdS73A -Myc-His6 (6 μg) and purified Tβγ (4 μg) in 10–12 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1 mm DTT for 30 min at 22 °C. The ability of recombinant phosducins to bind Tβγ was confirmed by inhibition of light-induced binding of Tα to Tβγ (11Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W.

The inability of phosphorylated phosducin to bind Tβγ was confirmed in Tα binding assays (as above).

Assays also received 2–4 μg of exogenous substrate (i.e. Tα·GTPγS/Tβγ, Tβγ, or purified or reconstituted Pd-Tβγ complex). To identify Ubcs involved in Tβγ ubiquitylation, some assays were supplemented with 0.2–0.8 μg of individual recombinant human Ubc or 4 μg of active site Cys→Ser mutants of UbcH5a or UbcH7. To control for differences in Ubc activity, the amount of each Ubc added to assays varied as the inverse of Ubc activity, which was quantitated by autoradiography as the formation of 125I-labeled Ub-Ubc thiol esters in the presence of purified rabbit E1 and ATP (41Obin M.

Phosducin phosphorylation was prevented by inclusion of the kinase inhibitor H-89 (Calbiochem, Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) at a final concentration (400 μm) sufficient to inhibit both PKA (K i, 0.25 μm) and CaMKII (K i, 30 μm). Phosphorylated phosducin was stabilized against phosphatase activity by inclusion of microcystin LR (10 μm final concentration). Ubiquitylation assays were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated and were terminated by boiling with gel loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Ubiquitylated proteins were visualized by Western blotting (41Obin M. Mesco E. Gong X. Haas A.L. Joseph J. Taylor A. J. Biol.

Specific binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and visualized by ECL. Signal intensities were quantified by digital densitometry (Amersham Biosciences), using standard curves of antigens (in assay mixtures) to determine the linear range of ECL signal detection. Ubiquitylation assays (70 μl) were incubated for 1 h and terminated with Buffer I (8 murea, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Next, 25 μl of washed Ni-NTA beads (50% slurry) were added and incubated (30 min, 22 °C) with gentle rotation. The beads were subjected to 5 cycles of washing with Buffer II (Buffer I, pH 6.5). His6-Ub-protein conjugates were then eluted with Buffer III (Buffer I, pH 4.5 containing 0.5m imidazole), boiled in reducing gel buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteolysis assays were constituted similarly to ubiquitylation assays (above), except that Ub-aldehyde was omitted, and reactions were conducted in the presence and absence of both ATP and MG132. Degradation (i.e. loss) of specific proteins was assessed by densitometry of immunoblotted assay mixtures or, when 125I-labeled Tβγ was used as a substrate, by γ-counting of acid-precipitable cpm (20Obin M.

A role of p38 MAP kinase in ischemic brain injury has been previously suggested by pharmacological means. In the present study, we provide evidence for a role of MK2 in cerebral ischemic injury using MK2-deficient (MK2−/−) mice. MK2−/− mice subjected to focal ischemia markedly reduced infarct size by 64 and 76% after transient and permanent ischemia, respectively, compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, MK2−/− mice had significant reduction in neurological deficits. Real-time PCR analysis identified a significantly lower expression in interleukin-1β mRNA (53% reduction) but not in tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA in MK2−/− mice over wild-type animals after ischemic injury. The significant reduction in interleukin-1β was also confirmed in MK2−/− mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The marked neuroprotection from ischemic brain injury in MK2−/− mice was not associated with the alteration of hemodynamic or systemic variables, activation of caspase-3, or apoptosis. Our data provide new evidence for the involvement of MAP kinase pathway in focal ischemic brain injury and suggest that this effect might be associated with the expression of interleukin-1β in the ischemic brain tissue.

These MAP kinases have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) is one of several kinases that are regulated exclusively through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase in response to stress stimuli. Mice deficient in MK2 showed a reduction in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and nitric oxide (2Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of MK2 in inflammatory cytokine production. Cerebral ischemia is a pathophysiological condition caused by decrease in blood supply to the brain and hence the deprivation of oxygen and glucose in the ischemic brain tissue, which eventually leads to cell death (necrosis and apoptosis) and inflammation (3Wang X.K. Feuerstein G.Z. Drug News Perspect. 2000; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitant activation of extracellular regulated kinase, c-junN-terminal kinase, and p38 MAP kinase has been reported in both gerbil and rat models of transient brain ischemia (4Sugino T. Nozaki K. Takagi Y. Hattori I. Hashimoto N. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4506-4514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Irving E.A. Barone F.C. Reith A.D. Hadingham S.J. Parsons A.A. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain MAP kinases have been implicated in cerebral ischemic injury. For example, inhibition of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 by a selective MAP kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase kinase 1 inhibitor revealed significant neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia in mice (6Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 7Wang H., Xu, L. Venkatachalam S. Trzaskos J.M. Friedman S.M. Feuerstein G.Z. Wang X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase reduced brain injury and neurological deficits after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in rats (8Barone F.C. Irving E.A. Ray A.M. Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A.M. White R.F. McVey M.J. Legos J.J. Erhardt J.A. Nelson A.H. Ohlstein E.H. Hunter A.J. Ward K. Smith B.R. Adams J.L. Parsons A.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar). Because MK2 is an immediate downstream kinase of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, we hypothesized that MK2 might also be directly associated with ischemic brain injury after MCAO. Therefore, mice genetically deficient in MK2 were used to test this hypothesis in both transient and permanent focal stroke induced by MCAO. In this model, histological and functional variables have been explored along with biochemical markers of inflammation and apoptosis. MK2−/− mice were on a mixed 129v × C57BL/6 background as described previously (2Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and the colony further expanded by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Genotyping of MK2−/− was carried out using a three-primer PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-cgtgggggtggggtgacatgctggttgac (5′MK2), 5′-ggtgtcaccttgacatcccggtgag (3′MK2), and 5′-tgctcgctcgatgcgatgtttcgc (Neo). A fragment length of about 500 bp indicates wild type and 800 bp indicates the gene disruption. Adult MK2−/− and C57BL/6 mice (18–22 g, paired for gender and weight) were used throughout the experiments. Animals were housed and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (29Department of Health and Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (DHEW (DHHS) Publication No. (NIH) 85-23). Office of Science and Health Reports, DRR/NIH, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar). Procedures using laboratory animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. Mice were anesthetized with gas inhalation, which is composed of 30% oxygen (0.3 liter/min) and 70% nitrous oxide (0.7 liter/min). The gas was passed through an isoflurane vaporizer set to deliver 3–4% isoflurane during initial induction and 1.5–2% during surgery. Under such conditions, an incision of the skin was made directly on top of the right common carotid artery region, and the bifurcation of the external common carotid and internal common carotid was identified. A small incision was made on the external common carotid, and a 5–0 mono-filament suture (9–11 mm long with a round tip) was threaded into the internal common carotid via the external common carotid. The suture was advanced toward the middle cerebral artery to create focal ischemia. In the case of permanent brain ischemia, the suture was not removed, whereas for transient brain ischemia, the suture was removed 30 min after MCAO. Sham operation was performed using the same procedure except that no suture was inserted into the carotid artery. At the end of the study, mice were anesthetized with gas inhalation and forebrains were removed at various times after ischemia, reperfusion, or sham surgery as indicated in each figure legend. For biochemical analysis, the entire ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for later use. To measure the infarct volume, brains were removed 24 h after MCAO and evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of 2-mm thick brain slices. The stained brain tissue was fixed in 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline. The image was captured using a Microtek ScanMaker 4 DUO scanner (Microtek, Carson, CA) and quantitated using Image Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Neurological deficits were examined at days 1 and 3 after MCAO (n = 10) using a five-point scale adapted and modified from Zhang et al. (9Zhang R.L. Chopp M. Zhang Z.G. Jiang Q. Ewing J.R. Brain Res. 1997; 766: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) (no neurological deficit, 0; right Horner's syndrome, 1 point; failure to extend left forelimb and hindlimb, 1 point each; turning to left, 1 point; and circling to left, 1 point. The physiological parameters were measured and confirmed under two anesthesia conditions (i.e.gas inhalation as described above and pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally)). In randomly selected animals, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with a laser Doppler perfusion monitor (Moor Instruments Inc., Wilmington, DE). After anesthesia, a small incision was made at the midpoint between the right orbit and the external auditory canal. The temporalis muscle was retracted and the underlying fascia cleared. The laser Doppler probe was placed 1.5 mm posterior and 3.5 mm lateral to the bregma on the ipsilateral hemisphere. CBF was carefully monitored (to avoid any large vessel) before, during (15 min), and after (30 min) MCAO. Relative CBF was calculated as percentage relative to levels before MCAO. The arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by connecting tubing through the femoral artery using an MP100 workstation and analyzed using an AcqKnowledge software (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Femoral arterial blood samples were analyzed for pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide by direct collection through a PE-50 tubing into an i-STAT G3+ cartridge and processed with a portable clinical analyzer (Abbott). Total RNA was isolated from ipsilateral and contralateral brain tissues (n = 8) after transient MCAO or after sham operation using an RNA isolation kit from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA). The primers and probes (TableI) used for real-time RT-PCR were designed using Primer-Express 1.0 software from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The specificity of PCR primers for IL-1β, TNFα, and a housekeeping gene, ribosomal protein L32, was tested using a standard PCR protocol in an ABI thermocycler (model 9600) before TaqMan quantitation and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Real-time PCR was performed as described previously in detail (10Wang X., Li, X. Currie R.W. Willette R.N. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: One-step RT-PCR was performed using a Platinum Taq System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specification. The reaction started with 0.5–1 μg of total RNA in a 25-μl reaction volume. The reaction mixture contained 12.5 μl of 2× reaction mix, 0.6 μl of 50 mmMgSO4, 0.125 μl of RNase inhibitor, 0.5 μl each of the 10 μm forward and reverse primers, 0.5 μl of the 5 μm probe, and 0.3 μl of RT/Taq mix. The mixture was incubated in 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 5 min, and then the PCR cycles were started at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s for 40 cycles. Each RT-PCR was done in duplicate and performed simultaneously.

TaqMan probes contain 6-carboxyfluorescein for IL-1β and TNFα at 5′-end and VIC, an ABI dye, for the rpL32. All the probes have a quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, at the 3′ end. Open table in a new tab PCR primers (F, forward; R, reverse) and probes were synthesized according to the mouse TNF-α (GenBank accession no. M13049), IL-1β (GenBank accession no.

All the probes have a quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, at the 3′ end. Tissue lysate from ipsilateral and contralateral brain samples (15 h after MCAO for the peak expression of IL-1β, n > 7) were pulverized using a porcelain mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. The pulverized brain tissues were incubated in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100) and 5 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340; Sigma) for 1 h at 4 C°. After a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 ×g, the supernatant of tissue lysate was collected and aliquoted for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and protein concentration measurement using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The levels of IL-1β protein in the brain tissue were measured using an ELISA kit for mouse IL-1β (Endogen) following the manufacturer's specification. Tissue extracts (50 μl) were applied to each well for the ELISA and the final measure was read out using a plate reader at 450 nm. The concentration of IL-1β protein in each sample was determined according to the standard (recombinant mouse IL-1β protein) provided with the kit. All the measured IL-1β concentrations were at the linear part of the standard curve. Each sample was normalized by its total protein concentration in milligrams. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the levels of the active form of caspase-3 in MK2−/− (n = 8) and wild-type (n = 9) mice 24 h after transient MCAO. The pulverized brain tissues were lysed and processed as described in the previous section. The soluble component of the tissue lysate was used for Western blot (100 μg of protein/lane) using a mouse monoclonal IgG against caspase-3 (sc-7272) as described in detail previously (11Wang H. Zhan Y., Xu, L. Feuerstein G.Z. Wang X. Stroke. 2001; 32: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The blot was stripped and re-probed to a goat polyclonal anti-actin antibody (sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Apoptosis was measured by quantitating the DNA fragmentation in MK2−/− (n = 8) and wild-type (n = 9) mice 24 h after transient MCAO using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This sandwich-enzyme immunoassay provides a quantitative determination of histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) based on a photometric reaction using monoclonal antibodies directed against both DNA and histones. Frozen, pulverized brain tissue was lysed using the lysing buffer provided by the kit (30 min at room temperature) and pelleted (200 × g). Aliquots of the supernatant were used in the assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data in text and figures are mean ± S.E. for the indicated number (n) of animals. Statistical comparisons were made by analysis of variance (Fisher's protected least squares difference), and values were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Cerebral blood flow, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, pH, blood oxygen, and blood carbon dioxide were measured in MK2−/− and wild-type mice before and after transient MCAO (Table II). No significant difference was observed in CBF, heart rate, and blood gases between MK2−/− and wild-type mice before and after MCAO. The only significant difference was the 11% increase in the mean arterial blood pressure in MK2−/− mice compared with wild-type mice 30 min after reperfusion (p < 0.05; Table I). However, this small increase in blood pressure is within the normal range in mice.Table IIPhysiological conditions in the wild-type and MK2−/− mice after MCAO with reperfusionMCAO treatmentCBFHRMABPpCO2pO2pH%min−1mm Hgmm Hgmm HgWild typen = 7n = 6n = 6n = 6n = 6n = 6Before100299 ± 4184 ± 439 ± 4114 ± 127.33During23 ± 5326 ± 1882 ± 447 ± 393 ± 157.32After37 ± 7348 ± 4587 ± 437 ± 1121 ± 67.41MK2−/−n = 7n = 6n = 6n = 8n = 8n = 8Before100376 ± 2582 ± 842 ± 484 ± 137.34During28 ± 6373 ± 2689 ± 456 ± 399 ± 97.27After44 ± 5434 ± 1897 ± 3a, p < 0.05 compared with the wild-type mice.44 ± 6112 ± 97.34Mice were subjected to 30 min of MCAO followed by reperfusion.

As shown in Fig. 1, significant reduction in infarct size was observed after transient (64% reduction, n = 13, p < 0.05) and permanent (76% reduction, n = 10, p < 0.01) MCAO in MK2−/− mice compared with the paired wild-type mice. The resistance of MK2−/− mice to ischemic brain injury was also supported by the reduction in neurological deficits (Fig. 2). The neurological deficits were not significantly reduced in MK2−/− mice until 3 days after transient MCAO (34% reduction compared with wild-type mice, n = 14, p < 0.01). In contrast, a significant reduction in neurological deficits was observed 24 h after permanent MCAO (52% reduction in MK2−/−mice compared with the wild-type mice, n = 10,p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). The 3-day neurological deficit data were not collected after permanent MCAO because these animals were processed for infarct size evaluation at 24 h.Figure 2Neurological deficits in MK2 −/− and wild-type mice after transient and permanent MCAO. For transient MCAO (TMCAO), MK2−/− (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to 30-min MCAO followed by reperfusion, and neurological deficits were evaluated at days 1 and 3 after reperfusion (n = 14). For permanent MCAO (PMCAO), neurological deficits were examined at day 1 (24 h; n = 10) after ischemia using the same groups of animals for infarct size measurement (illustrated in Fig. 1). Neurological deficits were measured using a five-point scale as described under “Experimental Procedures.” **, p < 0.01 compared with the wild-type animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig.3 depicts the mRNA expression of two key inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNFα, in MK2−/−and wild-type mice 12 h after transient MCAO. Significant induction was observed for both cytokine mRNAs in the ipsilateral (ischemic) over the contralateral brain tissue in wild-type mice (with 4.3- and 3.4-fold increases for TNFα and IL-1β mRNA, respectively). However, in MK2−/− mice, significant induction was seen only in TNFα mRNA (3.6-fold increase in the ipsilateral brain tissue) but not IL-1β mRNA (1.6-fold increase) after MCAO (Fig. 3). The levels of IL-1β mRNA expression in the ischemic brain tissue were significantly lower in MK2−/−than in wild-type mice (p < 0.05, n = 8). ELISA analysis showed that levels of IL-1β expression were increased 3.3-fold (n = 11, p < 0.05) and 7.9-fold (n = 7, p < 0.01) in the ischemic brain tissue over the nonischemic (contralateral) tissue in wild-type mice 15 h after transient and permanent MCAO, respectively. Similar to its mRNA induction profile, the levels of IL-1β expression after brain ischemia were significantly lower in MK2−/− mice (Fig. 4) (i.e. only 49% (n = 9, p < 0.05) and 21% (n = 8, p < 0.05) compared with the wild-type mice after transient and permanent MCAO, respectively). Because MAP kinase has been implicated in cell survival as well as apoptosis after cerebral ischemic injury, we evaluated key markers of apoptosis (i.e. activation of caspase-3 (assessed for the expression of active caspase-3) and DNA fragmentation). Western analysis was used to detect the expression of active caspase-3 (p20) in the brain after MCAO. The levels of active caspase-3 in the ischemic brain were significantly elevated 24 h after MCAO in both MK2−/− and wild-type mice, showing 1.8- and 2.0-fold increases, respectively, over the contralateral tissue. However, no significant difference was observed between these two experimental groups (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, although 3.9- and 4.3-fold increases in DNA fragmentation were observed in MK2−/− and wild-type mice, respectively, after cerebral ischemia, as evaluated by measurement of DNA fragmentation using an ELISA method, no significant difference was noted between these two groups (Fig. 5 B). In the present study, we have demonstrated that ischemic brain injury was significantly reduced in MK2-deficient mice compared with that of wild-type mice after either transient or permanent MCAO. Permanent MCAO results in the depletion of energy and oxygen to brain tissue, which ultimately leads to cell death; transient MCAO results in ischemic brain injury primarily because of cellular toxicity caused by oxygen radicals and other mediators involved with reperfusion injury (12Floyd R.A. Carney J.M. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: S22-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Both permanent and transient MCAO result in an inflammatory reaction as one of the key pathophysiological events occurring after ischemic brain injury. Activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway after transient and permanent MCAO has been demonstrated (5Irving E.A. Barone F.C. Reith A.D. Hadingham S.J. Parsons A.A. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 77: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by a specific small molecule inhibitor was shown to protect the brain from ischemic injury after permanent MCAO in rats (8Barone F.C. Irving E.A. Ray A.M. Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A.M. White R.F. McVey M.J. Legos J.J. Erhardt J.A. Nelson A.H. Ohlstein E.H. Hunter A.J. Ward K. Smith B.R. Adams J.L. Parsons A.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar). However, the involvement of a particular downstream component of p38 MAP kinase in ischemic brain injury has not been previously elucidated. In the present study, we provide direct evidence for the potential role of MK2, which is regulated by the p38 MAP kinase, in the ischemic brain injury using a genetic model of MK2 deficiency. Mice deficient in MK2 showed no difference in several key hemodynamic, hematologic, and biochemical parameters compared with wild-type animals under normal conditions or post stroke. However, mice deficient in MK2 gene were protected from both transient and permanent MCAO, as evidenced by smaller infarct size and improved neurological function. Although only TTC staining was used to assess infarct size in this study, the validity of this method as an authentic representation of tissue injury was demonstrated by the tight correlation of data generated with TTC staining quantitation of infarct size using hematoxylin and eosin staining (13Bederson J.B. Pitts L.H. Germano S.M. Nishimura M.C. Davis R.L. Bartkowski H.M. Stroke. 1986; 17: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 14Barone F.C. Clark R.K. Feuerstein G. Lenkinski R.E. Sarkar S.K. Brain Res. Bull. 1991; 26: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TTC staining was also corroborated by magnetic resonance imaging (14Barone F.C. Clark R.K. Feuerstein G. Lenkinski R.E. Sarkar S.K. Brain Res. Bull. 1991; 26: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Minematsu K., Li, L. Fisher M. Sotak C.H. Davis M.A. Fiandaca M.S.

Finally, and more importantly, the relative resistance of the MK2−/−mice to stroke was manifested not only by reduction in infarct size but also by improvement in motor function (Figs. 1 and 2). The specific mechanism by which MK2 may promote ischemic brain injury is unknown. Because inflammation is a notable pathophysiological consequence after cerebral ischemia (17del Zoppo G. Ginis I. Hallenbeck J.M. Iadecola C. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and MK2 has been implicated in regulation of cytokine production (2Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), the expression of two key proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNFα, was evaluated in MK2−/− and wild-type mice after MCAO. Interestingly, whereas TNFα mRNA was significantly induced by ischemia in both MK2−/− and wild-type mice, the levels of IL-1β mRNA were significantly lower in MK2−/− mice compared with the wild-type mice. The corresponding reduction in IL-1β protein was also noted in MK2−/− mice compared with wild-type animals. These data are in agreement, at least in part, with a previous report that one class of p38 antagonists, known as cytokine-suppressing anti-inflammatory drugs, has the capacity to inhibit IL-1 production in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation in human monocytes (18Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Young P.R.

Unfortunately, because of lack of proper reagents to study mouse TNFα in tissue, the levels of TNFα protein could not be determined in the present study. We wish to offer our speculation that because TNFα mRNA expression was not altered in MK2−/− mice compared with wild-type mice, similar response in protein levels might be expected. Increase in IL-1β expression has been observed in several types of brain injury including excitotoxicity and lipopolysaccharide-induced brain injury as well as brain trauma and ischemia (17del Zoppo G. Ginis I. Hallenbeck J.M. Iadecola C. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 95-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 20Rothwell N.J. Luheshi G.N. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In particular, the significant up-regulation of IL-1β is recognized to play a detrimental role after brain ischemia, because the blockade of IL-1 by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist has been shown to be neuroprotective (21Loddick S.A. Rothwell N.J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). IL-1 was recently shown to be associated with inflammatory cell activation and the induction of cyclooxygenase-2, IL-1, and IL-6 in other models of brain injury (22Basu A. Krady J.K. O'Malley M. Styren S.D. DeKosky S.T. Levison S.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6071-6082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the suppression of IL-1β production in the ischemic brain tissue of MK2−/− mice might be associated with reduced ischemic damage. Apoptosis represents another potential mechanism associated with ischemia-induced neuronal death (23Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In particular, p38 MAP kinase has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis in response to various stimuli (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the potential involvement of apoptosis in MK2-deficient mice subjected to MCAO. Whereas apoptosis has been clearly demonstrated after cerebral ischemia, as monitored by active caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, no difference was found between MK2−/− mice and wild-type mice in these apoptotic parameters after MCAO. In addition, no difference was observed in gliosis and microglial activation as evidenced by immunohistochemical evaluation. 2X. Wang, L. Xu, H. Wang, P. R. Young, M. Gaestel, and G. Z. Feuerstein, unpublished observations. Gene expression array also failed to detect differences between MK2-deficient and control mice in the activation of specific signaling pathways using the “Pathway Finder” panel (Super Array, Inc.) (data not shown). It should also be pointed out that several downstream targets have been reported to be phosphorylated and regulated by MK2, including the 27-kDa heat shock protein (25Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar), lymphocyte-specific protein 1 (26Huang C.K. Zhan L., Ai, Y. Jongstra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), tyrosine hydroxylase (27Thomas G. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and 5-lipoxygenase (28Werz O. Szellas D. Steinhilber D. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14793-14800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, because of lack of reagents that cross-react with mouse protein, the specific activation of these MK2 substrates could not be determined. In conclusion, our study provides further evidence for the involvement of the p38/MK2 pathway in focal ischemic brain injury. The diminution of IL-1β expression in the MK2−/− mice may suggest that MK2 might be a key modulating pathway of certain inflammatory cytokines activated in brain injury."

https://openalex.org/W2060289052,"By inducing p53-dependent G2 arrest, the pretreatment with low concentrations of DNA damaging drugs (e.g., doxorubicin, DOX) can prevent cell death caused by microtubule-active drugs (e.g., paclitaxel, PTX), thus potentially permitting selective killing of p53-deficient cancer cells. However, DOX still protects a subset of tumor cell lines lacking wt p53 (HL60 and Jurkat leukemia cells), thus limiting the utility of protection of cells with wt p53 (e.g., normal cells). The present work overcomes this obstacle by adding an abrogator of p53-independent checkpoint (e.g., UCN-01) to the DOX-PTX sequence. By inhibiting a p53-independent pathway, UCN-01 overrode DOX-induced G2 arrest and instead induced G1 arrest in HL60 and Jurkat, thus propelling these p53-deficient cells from G2 to G1. Once they entered mitosis, cells were killed by PTX. Induction of G2 arrest with sequential abrogation of a p53-independent checkpoint allows pharmacological manipulation of Raf-1/Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation, PARP and Rb cleavage and cell death caused by PTX in p53-deficient cells. Unlike previous approaches, this strategy is intended to increase selectivity, not the cytotoxicity of PTX. This rational sequence of agents that induces p53-dependent and abrogates p53-independent arrest represents a cancer-selective strategy for treatment of p53-deficient tumors."

A<i>Drosophila</i> cDNA homologous to mammalian β4-galactosyltransferases was identified using a human β<i>4GalT7</i> cDNA as a probe in a BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags. The <i>Drosophila</i> cDNA encodes a type II membrane protein with 322 amino acids and shows 49% identity to human β4GalT7. Extracts from L cells transfected with the cDNA exhibited marked galactosyltransferase activity specific for a xylopyranoside acceptor. Moreover, transfection with the cloned cDNA restored glycosaminoglycan synthesis in β4GalT7-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. In transfectant lysates the properties of<i>Drosophila</i> and human β4GalT7 resembled each other, except that <i>Drosophila</i> β4GalT7 showed a less restricted specificity and was active at a wider range of temperatures.<i>Drosophila</i> β<i>4GalT7</i> is expressed throughout development, with higher expression levels in adults.

The physiological relevance of these findings is discussed with respect to the bioenergetic peculiarities of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria, which were also called blue-green algae, are primordial organisms evolving more than three billion years ago. These organisms form one of the main eubacterial phyla and one of the largest groups of Gram-negative bacteria. Through endosymbiotic processes ancient cyanobacteria were the progenitors of plant plastids. Today nearly 2000 cyanobacterial species are known with a variety of physiological, morphological, and developmental properties and colonizing a wide range of habitats. They are capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis and are clearly distinguished from the other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green bacteria because cyanobacteria use water as an electron donor thereby releasing molecular oxygen into the environment. Because of the high intracellular oxygen concentration produced during photosynthesis potentially damaging reactive oxygen species can be formed. Two pathways can lead to this toxic molecule. One pathway produces singlet dioxygen ( 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection O2) through interaction of molecular oxygen with excited triplet-state chlorophyll. This singlet dioxygen is especially harmful to polyunsaturated fatty acids leading to lipid peroxidation and membrane damage. Carotenoids are able to quench the formation of triplet-state chlorophyll (1Johnson E.A. Schroeder W.A. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1996; 53: 119-178PubMed Google Scholar). The second pathway of molecular oxygen activation results in the formation of the superoxide radical ( O2−⋅) by interaction with electron acceptors of photosystem I or reduced ferredoxin (2Asada K. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux Causes of Photooxidative Stress in Plants and Amelioration of Defense Systems. CRC Press, Boca Raton1994: 77-104Google Scholar). The superoxide radical is not very reactive in aqueous solution, but it is implicated in lipid peroxidation, protein inactivation (e.g. destruction of iron-sulfur proteins), and formation of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) by reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (2Asada K. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux Causes of Photooxidative Stress in Plants and Amelioration of Defense Systems. CRC Press, Boca Raton1994: 77-104Google Scholar). To prevent photooxidative damage both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical must be scavenged effectively by phototrophic organisms. In solution superoxide can react with a second molecule of superoxide thereby dismutating to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. This reaction can also be accomplished by an enzymatic process via proteins called superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection that lower the level of superoxide. Today four types of superoxide dismutase are known, each containing a different metal ion at the active site: iron (FeSOD), manganese (MnSOD), copper/zinc (CuZnSOD), and nickel (NiSOD). Whereas FeSOD and MnSOD are very similar in sequence and structure, the others show no correspondence. There are several papers that describe superoxide dismutase activities and localization in cyanobacterial cells (3Asada K. Yoshikawa K. Takahashi M. Maeda Y. Enmanji K. J. Biol.

These reports as well as genome analysis (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/) show that cyanobacteria possess either one or more SOD genes. The unicellular cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803 contains a single FeSOD gene,Plectonema boryanum contains one FeSOD gene as well as three additional MnSOD genes (12Campbell W.S. Laudenbach D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 964-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Nostoc punctiforme contains one FeSOD gene and two MnSOD genes. The few reports about the physiological role of cyanobacterial SODs suggest that these enzymes protect cellular components during oxidative stress or from the effects of chilling. In Nostoc commune a significant role for an extracellular FeSOD in response to desiccation has been proposed (10Shirkey B. Kovarcik D.P. Wright D.J. Wilmoth G. Prickett T.F. Helm R.F. Gregory E.M.

We chose the filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteriumAnabaena PCC 7120 (now renamed Nostoc PCC 7120) as a model to characterize the equipment for superoxide detoxification. Superoxide dismutase assays have shown that both membrane preparations and cytosolic extracts contain SOD activity. Screening of the genome ofAnabaena PCC 7120 revealed that there are two genes for SODs, one has a high homology to iron-containing (sodB gene) and the other to manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (sodA gene). In this paper we report localization of the MnSOD in both cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes. It is shown thatAnabaena MnSOD is unique in being a type 2 membrane-bound protein. Its heterologous overexpression is reported as well as its comprehensive biochemical and kinetic characterization including the determination of actual bimolecular rate constants at pH 7–10. Materials were acquired from the following sources: SigmaMarker (wide molecular weight range), cytochromec (from horse heart), xanthine, xanthine oxidase (from buttermilk grade I), 18-crown-6-ether, 3-Å molecular sieve, and potassium superoxide from Sigma; the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit, Gel Filtration LMW calibration kit, Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow, Superdex 200 prep grade, and PD-10 desalting columns from Amersham Biosciences; the Centriprep-30 concentrators from Amicon; alkaline phosphatase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; T4 DNA ligase, NdeI, BamHI, andBglII restriction enzymes from MBI Fermentas, and DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase from Finnzyme. All other reagents were of highest grade available. Axenic cultures of Anabaena PCC 7120 were grown photoautotrophically in BG-11 medium (14Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 35 °C for 1 week under illumination and bubbled with filtered air containing 1% (v/v) of CO2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice with Hepes-EDTA buffer (10 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa2EDTA) and resuspended in the same buffer to a cell density of 80 μl/ml packed cells. The suspension was made up to 20% (w/w) sucrose and 0.5% lysozyme, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Thereafter, the pellet was resuspended in Hepes-EDTA buffer containing 0.0075% DNase I, incubated on ice for 30 min, passed twice through a precooled French pressure cell (Aminco) at 40 and 70 megapascals, respectively, and centrifuged (5000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was used to separate membranes and cytosolic components by ultracentrifugation (250,000 × g, 50 min, 4 °C) or adjusted to 42% (w/w) with solid sucrose for density gradient centrifugation. This solution was overlaid with 35, 30, and 10% (w/w) sucrose in Hepes/NaOH buffer and centrifuged (Beckman SW-27 rotor, 131,500 × g, 16 h, 4 °C). All the fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation were recentrifuged severalfold to reduce cross-contamination, and all buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin (15Peschek G.A. Wastyn M. Trnka M. Molitor V. Fry I.V. Packer L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3057-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequence of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase was obtained from the CyanoBase, the genome data base for Anabaena PCC 7120, at www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Anabaena/. The following synthetic oligonucleotide primers were constructed and purchased from geneXpress (Maria Wörth, Austria): primer 1a (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGA AAT CAT CTC TGT GGC AA-3′), primer 1b (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG CAG CAA ATT CCC TGC CGA CTA AC-3′), primer 1c (5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG GTA CAA ATC CAG CCG AGT TAC CA-3′; all of these three primers contain an ATG start codon and an NdeI restriction site), and primer 2 (5′-GGA AGA TCT CTA ATG GTG GTG ATG GTG GTG AGA ATT ACT TTG CCG TGA AGC-3′; 51 bases with a TAG termination codon, a sequence coding for a hexa-histidine tag and a BglII restriction site). One of the first primers and primer 2, cell suspension from Anabaena as the template, and the DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase were used for PCR under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min (hot start); 30 cycles at 92 °C for 1 min, 49 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and finally at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, and the appropriate DNA was cut out and purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit. This DNA fragment was digested with the restriction enzymesNdeI and BglII and cloned into theNdeI- and BamHI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated expression vector pET-3a (16Studier W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The insert was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). CompetentEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with the expression vector by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad), positive clones carrying the recombinant plasmid were selected and grown overnight on an orbital shaker (180 rpm) at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After dilution of the cell suspension with M9ZB medium containing the same antibiotics and 5 mm MnCl2, expression of superoxide dismutase was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), frozen, and stored at –80 °C until used. Thawed cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mmEDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (5 μm), and pepstatin (5 μm) were added, and the cells were broken by sonication with short bursts. The suspension was centrifuged (21,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C), and from the supernatant the superoxide dismutase was purified. The supernatant was adjusted to 1m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole and loaded on a chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 10 cm) charged with 30 μmol Zn2+/ml gel and equilibrated with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mNaCl and 20 mm imidazole at 4 °C. The column was washed with 200 ml of the equilibration buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 ml of a gradient of 20–500 mm imidazole in 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mNaCl. The eluted proteins were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged with Centriprep concentrators. Proteins were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm KCl at room temperature. Active fractions were concentrated using Centriprep concentrators. For molecular mass determination the Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the Gel Filtration LMW calibration kit in the range of 13.7–67 kDa. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 15% slab gels as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) using SigmaMarkers and the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system. Proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. SOD activity was detected according to Beauchamp and Fridovich (19Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10013) Google Scholar) after gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Staining was also performed in the presence of azide, cyanide, and hydrogen peroxide. SOD activity was determined by the ferricytochrome c assay (20McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where xanthine and xanthine oxidase was used as the source of superoxide radicals and cytochromec as the indicating scavenger of the radical. The assay mixture (3.0 ml) contained 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm xanthine, 20 μm cytochrome c, and 50 μl of sample. The absorbance at 550 nm was monitored with a spectrophotometer after the addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 0.2 units/ml xanthine oxidase. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme, which inhibits the rate of cytochrome c reduction by 50% at pH 7.8 and 25 °C, calculated from the initial rate of reaction. The concentration of the enzyme solution was determined spectrophotometrically with the calculated molar absorbance coefficient ε280 = 50,420 m− 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collectioncm− 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection per subunit (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar). To follow the reaction of superoxide and SOD we used the model SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics equipped with a 1-cm observation cell at room temperature. Calculation of kinetic parameters from experimental traces was performed with the SpectraKinetic work station v4.38 interfaced to the instrument. The superoxide solution was prepared in a glove box; 133 mg of potassium superoxide and 800 mg of 18-crown-6-ether were dissolved in 6.7 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 3.3 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and filtered. Both aprotic organic solvents were dried over a 3-Å molecular sieve. The sequential mixing mode was utilized to follow the decrease of superoxide concentration. In the first step one part of superoxide solution was mixed with 10 parts of 5 mm buffer at pH 10. After a delay time of 10 ms, 10 parts of this mixture were combined with 10 parts of buffer at pH 7–10 with or without the enzyme. The following molar absorbance coefficient was used for recording of the superoxide decay (wavelength is shown in parentheses): 2250m− 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection cm− 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMF, dimethylformamide; CM, cytoplasmic or plasma membrane; ICM, intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane; ORF, open reading frame; PCC, Pasteur Culture Collection(245 nm) (22Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection for superoxide decay, several shots of the buffer with Me2SO/DMF mixture were used to determine the baseline. All stopped-flow determinations were measured in 90 mm of final buffer concentration at various pH values between pH 7 and 10, containing 100 μm EDTA, and at least three determinations were performed per substrate and enzyme concentration. The amino acid sequences used in this work were extracted from the protein entries in the Entrez Protein search and retrieval system of NCBI (athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?db = Protein), which includes data from Swiss-Prot, PIR, PRF, PDB, GenBankTM, and RefSeq. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX (23Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins M. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) and the following parameters: gap opening 10.0, gap extension 0.05, and the BLOSUM protein weight matrices. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the PHYLIP package, version 3.57 (24Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A hydrophathy plot was carried out using WinPep version 3.0 (25Hennig L. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1170-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the scale of Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17293) Google Scholar). The size of sliding window was fixed to 11, and the hydropathy threshold for transmembrane helices was set at 1.6. Secondary structure prediction for superoxide dismutase was performed using the program PSIPRED version 2.2 (27Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4499) Google Scholar) at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/. It contains the subprograms GenTHREADER for recognizing the fold of a protein and MEMSAT 2 to infer the topology of transmembrane proteins. To predict the localization site of the superoxide dismutase in cells the PSORT program, version 6.4 (28Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), was applied. It is available at psort.nibb.ac.jp/. The information of an amino acid sequence and its source origin, in this case Gram-negative bacteria, was used as input. The input sequence was analyzed by applying the stored rules for various sequence features of known protein sorting signals. Finally, the possibility for the input protein to be localized at each candidate site was reported. The genome ofAnabaena PCC 7120 was completely sequenced at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Anabaena/). Screening the genome shows that it possesses two potential genes that code for two distinct superoxide dismutases, namely one (sodA) coding for an iron-containing (FeSOD) and one (sodB) coding for a manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). To look for the localization of the corresponding active gene products, the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120 was grown under photoautotrophic conditions, and cells were harvested. French press extrusion produced whole cell extracts, and ultracentrifugation was used to separate crude membranes (cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes) and cytoplasmic components. The membranes were solubilized by incubation in 2% dodecyl maltoside. All fractions were tested for superoxide dismutase activity and used for nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with staining of SOD activity. Superoxide dismutase activity measured photometrically by the ferrocytochrome c assay can be related to the cytosolic fraction ((15.5 ± 2) units per mg of protein) and the membrane fraction ((3.1 ± 0.7) units per mg of protein). These specific activities are similar to that of SODs reported for other cyanobacteria (5Okada S. Kanematsu S. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1979; 103: 106-110Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as well as for crude extracts of aerated E. coli cells (13.5 units/mg protein (29Gregory E.M. Fridovich I. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 543-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), Bacillus subtilis (13.7 units/mg protein (30Gregory E.M. Fridovich I. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or rat liver (21 units/mg protein (31Reiss U. Gersham D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). In addition, the determined ratio of membrane-bound SOD activity to cytosolic activity (1:5) is similar to that determined for MnSOD activity to FeSOD activity in P. boryanum (1:7) andAnabaena variabilis (1:6) (5Okada S. Kanematsu S. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1979; 103: 106-110Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Native PAGE clearly shows two proteins with SOD activity when the whole cell extract was separated on native PAGE, whereas one distinct band was seen when either the solubilized crude membrane fraction (i.e. both cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes) (Fig.1, lane 4) or the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1, lane 5) were loaded on PAGE. Activity staining of cell extracts in the presence of high concentration of hydrogen peroxide demonstrated that the membrane-associated protein was still active, whereas the cytosolic SOD was inactive (not shown). This indicated that the membrane-associated SOD could be the manganese-containing enzyme. Addition of azide, but not cyanide inhibited both SOD activities (not shown). Since a typical cyanobacterium comprises two types of bioenergetically competent membrane systems, viz. the chlorophyll-containing intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane (ICM) and the cytoplasmic or plasma membrane (CM) (32Molitor V. Trnka M. Peschek G.A. Curr. Microbiol. 1987; 14: 263-268Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), CM and ICM were separated and purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Whereas cytoplasmic membranes gave an orange layer at 30% sucrose, thylakoid membranes form a dark green layer at 35/42% sucrose. Hydrogen peroxide-insensitive SOD activity could be assigned to both membrane fraction with 2.0 ± 0.7 units per mg of protein in ICM and 3.1 ± 0.5 units per mg of protein in CM, respectively. These results clearly show that the MnSOD is located in both cyanobacterial membranes in nearly equal concentrations. So it is tempting to speculate that there is no selective signal for targeting the protein to one of the two membranes. To clarify the mode of CM and ICM association of MnSOD, theAnabaena MnSOD was analyzed and aligned with FeSODs and MnSODs known from other organisms. Fig. 2depicts the nucleotide sequence of the sodB gene and the deduced amino acid sequence, including upstream and downstream elements. It shows a 810-bp open reading frame (ORF) from the start site at ATG to the termination codon TAA, coding for a polypeptide of 270 amino acids. Comparing the amino acid sequence with those from MnSODs where a high resolution x-ray structure is available (33Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A.

A hydropathy plot unequivocally demonstrated that the primary sequence of Anabaena MnSOD comprises a membrane-spanning domain at the N terminus (not shown). Interestingly, this seems to be a general st"

In an attempt to study the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine on proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells, we used AR42J cells as a model system. Here we demonstrate that cyclosporine inhibits growth of these cells by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest. This effect is mediated by the 5′ regulatory region of the cyclin D1 gene and leads to a reduction of cyclin D1 mRNA expression and protein abundance. We show that in AR42J cells the proximal cyclin D1 promoter contains a cis-regulated element, which is important for the maintenance of basal transcriptional activity. This element overlaps the described cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and confers cyclosporine sensitivity to the cyclin D1 promoter. Furthermore, the DNA binding activity of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) decreases through cyclosporine treatment and this is mediated by cyclosporine-induced reduction of CREB steady-state levels. These results demonstrate that cyclosporine can inhibit proliferation of acinar cells by targeting the cyclin D1 promoter at the proximal CRE via a reduction of CREB protein abundance.

Cyclin D1 and its catalytic partners CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (RB), resulting in the release of E2F transcription factors, which are required for the activation of S phase-specific genes (1Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cyclin D1 expression prevents transition of cells from G1 to S phase, whereas ectopic expression of cyclin D1 shortens the G1 interval in many cell types, suggesting that cyclin D1 may be rate-limiting for G1 progression (2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Robertson J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). The abundance of cyclin D1 is regulated transcriptionally and through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via protein degradation (4Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the cyclin D1 gene contains multiple cis-acting elements, including binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), for signal transducers and activators of transcription, for SP1, and for activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). The ATF/CREB-binding site is implicated in the activation of the cyclin D1 gene by pp60v-src(5Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S.

Furthermore, the estrogen-induced activation of the cyclin D1 promoter depends on the ATF/CREB site in which ATF-2 and c-Jun form heterodimers (6Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc.

Moreover, the integrin-linked kinase-dependent induction of the cyclin D1 promoter requires an intact ATF/CREB site, which is important for the maintenance of the basal transcriptional activity, but not for the induction of the cyclin D1 promoter activity in vascular endothelial cells (7D'Amico M.

In electrically stimulated cultured hippocampal neurons, calcineurin seems to be implicated in the negative regulation of CREB-mediated transcription (10Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In contrast, the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and FK506 inhibit CRE-mediated transcription stimulated by membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx in pancreatic islet cells (11Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Lux G. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23111-23115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence for a direct involvement of the serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin in CRE-directed transcription. The effect of calcineurin on CREB-mediated transcription seems to be cell type-specific and modulated through the promoter context. In contrast, the natural CRE-dependent promoters of the rat glucagon, rat somatostatin, and human c-Fos genes negatively respond to cyclosporine treatment in HIT cells; the rat insulin gene promoter is not affected (12Siemann G.

On the other hand, growth of interleukin-3-dependent mast cells, human lung-cancer cells, tubular kidney cells, cultured pituitary cells, T-cells, and keratinocytes seems to be inhibited by cyclosporine (16Schreiber S.L.

Pathol. 1988; 131: 12-18PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo, cyclosporine interferes with the reparative process activated after experimental pancreatitis, at least in part, by inhibiting acinar cell proliferation (31Vaquero E. Molero X. Tian X. Salas A. Malagelada J.R. Gut. 1999; 45: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because of the short lifetime of dispersed nonimmortalized pancreatic acinar cells, we used AR42J cells, an established model system, to investigate the biology of isolated pancreatic acinar cells (32Christophe J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G963-G971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that cyclosporine treatment of the pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J leads to the inhibition of cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression in the G1 phase, which is mediated through transcriptional inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. We mapped a cyclosporine-responsive cis regulatory element in the proximal cyclin D1 promoter, which overlaps the described CREB/ATF-2 binding site. Furthermore, we show that the cyclosporine sensitivity of the cyclin D1 promoter is mediated by a reduction of CREB steady-state levels.DISCUSSIONHere we show that cyclosporine inhibits proliferation of AR42J cells, a pancreatic acinar cell line, by inducing a G1arrest through reduction of cyclin D1 levels. A similar effect has been reported for psoriatic skin lesions, where a reduced cell turnover and a reduced expression of cyclin D1 after cyclosporine treatment were shown in vivo. In vitro, FK506 and cyclosporine induced a G1 phase arrest in growth factor-stimulated cultured human keratinocytes (44Miracco C. Pellegrino M. Flori M.L. Vatti R. Materno M. Andreassi L. Br. J. Dermatol. 2000; 143: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 45Karashima T. Hachisuka H. Sasai Y. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1996; 12: 246-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The G1 phase arrest induced by cyclosporine was also observed in the tubular kidney cell line LLC-PK1. Cyclosporine treatment of LLC-PK1 cells increased the fraction of cells in the G1 phase from 62 to 78% (46Lally C. Healy E. Ryan M.P. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1254-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cyclosporine has been shown to stimulate TGF-β expression, which is known to exert an inhibitory effect on proliferation of acinar cells (47Logsdon C.D. Keyes L. Beauchamp R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G364-G368PubMed Google Scholar, 48Zhang L. Graziano K. Pham T. Logsdon C.D. Simeone D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1247-G1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of cyclosporine on cell proliferation of AR42J cells most likely is independent of TGF-β, because protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4b and p21CIP1/WAF1, known targets of TGF-β, are not altered in cyclosporine-treated AR42J cells (49Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 50Khanna A.K. Hosenpud J.D. Transplantation. 1999; 67: 1262-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by the unaltered expression of CDK4, which is drastically reduced upon TGF-β treatment of TGF-β-responsive cells (51Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).In AR42J cells cyclin D1 is down-regulated at the transcriptional level by cyclosporine. Previous reports have shown that the proximal cyclin D1 promoter is controlled by a CREB/ATF/AP-1 and an NF-κB binding site (33Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 41Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.W. Karnezis A.N. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although binding of the AP-1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos was demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells, we did not detect AP-1 binding to the cyclin D1 CRE in AR42J cells (6Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 43Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J., Ye, H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that members of the CREB/ATF protein family, mainly CREB, bind the CRE site within the cyclin D1 promoter. First, in EMSA competition analysis, the formed complexes are completely competed with the cyclin D1 CRE and the c-Fos CRE, whereas the mutated cyclin D1 CRE had no effect on complex formation. Second, all three complexes were supershifted by an antibody, which recognizes CREB, ATF-1, and CREM. Third, Western blot analysis revealed that CREB has the highest abundance among the three different proteins recognized by the antibody (results not shown).In line with our data in AR42J cells, CREB has been found to be important for the maintenance of the basal cyclin D1 promoter activity in vascular endothelial cells (8Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 is crucial for its ability to trans-activate target genes and its ability to bind to CBP (9Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that CREB is constitutively phosphorylated at serine 133 in AR42J cells. This would explain the observed CREB- dependent basal cyclin D1 promoter activity (52Thommesen L. Norsett K. Sandvik A.K. Hofsli E. Laegreid A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to maintenance of basal cyclin D1 promoter activity, CREB also confers cyclosporine sensitivity to the proximal promoter part. Transcriptional activation of CREB by depolarization was shown to be inhibited by cyclosporine and FK506 in non-immune cells (13Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kruger M. Lux G. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8860-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 53Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Knepel W. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The mechanisms leading to loss of CREB transcriptional activity are largely unknown and seem to be independent of CREB phosphorylation at serine 119 (in CREB-327, corresponding to serine 133 in CREB-341) (13Schwaninger M. Blume R. Kruger M. Lux G. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8860-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In AR42J cells, treatment with cyclosporine leads to a nearly complete loss of CREB protein expression, which is different from the results reported by Schwaninger et al. (53Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Knepel W. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reduction of CREB expression is a specific effect because protein abundance of ATF2 is unaltered. Recently, Taylor et al. (54Taylor C.T. Furuta G.T. Synnestvedt K. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have demonstrated phosphorylation-dependent targeting of CREB to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In epithelial cells hypoxia led to hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of CREB. This has been correlated with the degradation of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP1, a phosphatase involved in CREB dephosphorylation and regulation of transcriptional activity (54Taylor C.T. Furuta G.T. Synnestvedt K. Colgan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12091-12096Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 55Alberts A.S. Montminy M. Shenolikar S. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A similar regulation might be relevant in our cellular system because the molecular target of cyclosporine calcineurin is known to stimulate PP1 activity (56Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar).The cyclosporine-induced targeting of CREB to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is an attractive model, but we cannot exclude a transcriptional mechanism responsible for the diminished CREB protein abundance. Loss of the transcriptional activity of CREB, as observed by Schwaningeret al. (53Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Knepel W. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), could lead to down-regulation of the CREB promoter, which is known to be autoregulated (57Meyers T.E. Waeber G. Lin J. Beckmann W. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we cannot exclude destabilization of the CREB mRNA by cyclosporine, as demonstrated for cytokines like interleukin-3 (26Nair A.P. Hahn S. Banholzer R. Hirsch H.H. Moroni C. Nature. 1994; 19: 239-242Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This regulation will be subject to further experiments.CREB is a potential candidate for mediating the observed effects of cyclosporine on cell cycle regulation. CRE transcription factor decoy oligonucleotides are able to block growth of a broad spectrum of cancer cells (58Cho-Chung Y.S. Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Lee Y.N. Cho Y.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 212: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Park et al. (59Park Y.G. Park S. Lim S.O. Lee M.S. Ryu C.K. Kim I. Cho-Chung Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated an inhibition of cyclin D1 expression in MCF-7 cells upon treatment with a CRE decoy oligonucleotide. They found transcriptional down-regulation of cyclin D1 with consecutive decreased cyclin D/CDK4 activity and RB hypophosphorylation. These data suggest an important role for CREB in controlling cyclin D1 levels.In summary, here we identify an important role for the CRE for cyclin D1 promoter activity in AR42J cells. CREB mediates basal promoter activity and confers cyclosporine sensitivity to the cyclin D1 promoter. These data might explain the proliferative defect of acinar cells induced by cyclosporine in the regenerative phase after acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, this pathway could be an attractive target to inhibit growth of certain kinds of cancer. Mammalian cell proliferation is regulated in mid- to late G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Cyclin D1 and its catalytic partners CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (RB), resulting in the release of E2F transcription factors, which are required for the activation of S phase-specific genes (1Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cyclin D1 expression prevents transition of cells from G1 to S phase, whereas ectopic expression of cyclin D1 shortens the G1 interval in many cell types, suggesting that cyclin D1 may be rate-limiting for G1 progression (2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Robertson J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar). The abundance of cyclin D1 is regulated transcriptionally and through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via protein degradation (4Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the cyclin D1 gene contains multiple cis-acting elements, including binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), for signal transducers and activators of transcription, for SP1, and for activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). The ATF/CREB-binding site is implicated in the activation of the cyclin D1 gene by pp60v-src(5Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7341-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the estrogen-induced activation of the cyclin D1 promoter depends on the ATF/CREB site in which ATF-2 and c-Jun form heterodimers (6Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, the integrin-linked kinase-dependent induction of the cyclin D1 promoter requires an intact ATF/CREB site, which is important for the maintenance of the basal transcriptional activity, but not for the induction of the cyclin D1 promoter activity in vascular endothelial cells (7D'Amico M.

Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The basic leucine zipper transcription factor CREB is ubiquitously expressed and activated by phosphorylation at serine 133 in response to elevated levels of cAMP, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, and growth factors (9Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). In electrically stimulated cultured hippocampal neurons, calcineurin seems to be implicated in the negative regulation of CREB-mediated transcription (10Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In contrast, the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine and FK506 inhibit CRE-mediated transcription stimulated by membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx in pancreatic islet cells (11Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Lux G. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23111-23115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides evidence for a direct involvement of the serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin in CRE-directed transcription. The effect of calcineurin on CREB-mediated transcription seems to be cell type-specific and modulated through the promoter context. In contrast, the natural CRE-dependent promoters of the rat glucagon, rat somatostatin, and human c-Fos genes negatively respond to cyclosporine treatment in HIT cells; the rat insulin gene promoter is not affected (12Siemann G.

The cyclic peptide cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin and inhibits the serinethreonine phosphatase calcineurin (14Cardenas M.E. Sanfridson A. Cutler N.S. Heitman J.

The major, so-called canonical pathway leading to the synthesis of these two PIs begins with phosphorylation of PtdIns on the D-4 hydroxyl by PtdIns 4-kinases.

They are distinguished primarily by differences in their enzymatic properties; Type II kinases have 3–7-fold lower K m values for PtdIns and ATP than Type III kinases, they are about 20-fold more sensitive than Type III kinases to inhibition by adenosine, and they are insensitive to inhibition by wortmannin, a drug that inhibits the Type III kinases at submicromolar concentrations (for reviews, see Refs. 7Gehrmann T.

J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In 1993 Flanagan et al. (10Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reported the first sequence of a PtdIns 4-kinase, a 125-kDa enzyme purified a year earlier fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (11Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of this yeast kinase, now known as Pik1p, placed it in the Type III class. Shortly thereafter, a 216-kDa Type III kinase, Stt4p, was also cloned from yeast (12Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian orthologs of Stt4p and Pik1p, sometimes designated PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ, respectively, were soon cloned and sequenced (13Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer H.E. Varsanyi M.

The two forms of PI4KIII contain two regions of homology, the C-terminal catalytic domain and an internal “lipid kinase unique” domain. Homologous domains are also found in PI 3-kinases and in a group of related Ser/Thr protein kinases, including RAFT, TOR, ATM, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (19Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, Type III PtdIns 4-kinase have been classified as members of the PI3/PI4-kinase family. Type II PtdIns 4-kinase, hereafter PI4KII, was purified from several mammalian cells and tissues more than 10 years ago (20Walker D.H. Dougherty N. Pike L.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6504-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Husebye E.S. Letcher A.J. Lander D.J. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys.

Analysis of sequence data bases revealed the presence of two mammalian isoforms, now termed α and β (24Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Waugh M.G. dos Santos M. Corless S. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, mammalian PI4KIIs are the founding members of a new and distinct branch of the kinase superfamily. Aside from the aforementioned biochemical properties, nearly nothing is known about the Type II PtdIns 4-kinases. As a first step toward their characterization, we have identified and characterized the minimal catalytic domain of rat PI4KIIα. Analysis of proteolytic fragments and expressed truncation mutants demonstrate that this domain is located in the C-terminal portion of the kinase, a region that is highly conserved among all known and putative PI4KII family members. Using multiple sequence alignment we have identified key residues conserved among most protein and lipid kinases that are predicted to participate in substrate binding and catalysis. In addition, we have examined the effects on catalytic activity of mutating residues conserved within the Type II PtdIns 4-kinase family but without obvious parallels in other kinases. Finally, we localized the expressed catalytic domain to membrane rafts, which contain a major portion of the agonist-sensitive pool of PtdIns 4,5-biphosphate (26Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-222304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Before the cloning of rat PI4KIIα and the identification of homologous sequences in many eukaryotic species (see the phylogenetic tree in Ref. 23Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) there was no evidence for the existence of Type II kinases in non-mammalian sources. To confirm that the PI4KII family extends beyond mammals, we cloned and expressed a putativeDrosophila PI4KII. A C-terminal fragment containing the catalytic domain of Drosophila PI4KII was characterized, and the contribution of this enzyme to PtdIns 4-kinase activity inDrosophila cells was examined. l-α-Phosphatidylinositol was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Primers were obtained from Sigma/Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Restriction enzymes, polymerases, and ligase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Vectors and reagents (BakPak) for baculovirus formation in Sf9 cells were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). TOPO TA vector was from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN), and monoclonal anti-PI4KII antibody 4C5G was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents, including ATP, papain, chymotrypsin, and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. PI4KIIα was subcloned from the pCMV5myc1 vector (23Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) into a pBacPak9 vector (Clontech) using the flanking EcoRI (5′) and PstI (3′) restriction sites. A new start codon and six histidines (amino acid sequence MHHHHHHGGEF) were added to the N terminus of the protein by inserting the corresponding DNA sequence between the EcoRI site and an upstream BamHI site (from the vector) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGG ATC CAT GCA TCA CCA TCA CCA TCA CGG AGG TGA ATT CCG-3′ and 5′-CGG AAT TCA CCT CCG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGC ATG GAT CCG-3′. Baculovirus was produced according to the manufacturer's protocols (Clontech), and plaque was purified by standard procedures (27O'Reill D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 124-138Google Scholar). Production of the His-tagged PI4KIIα was monitored by Western blotting with antibodies specific to the His tag (monoclonal, Clontech). Protein was produced by infecting Sf9 cells with amplified baculovirus. Fifty hours after infection the cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100 (v/v), protease inhibitors, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/liter eachN a-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ester,N a-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester,N a-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, and pepstatin A and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors until no protein eluted from the resin. His-tagged PI4KIIα was eluted from the resin with 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After dialysis, small aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C for several months without significant loss of activity. Mutations were introduced into cDNA encoding residues 92–478 of rat PI4KIIα (23Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) by the overlap extension method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Complementary forward and reverse primers that contain the desired mutation and flanking, external primers were used to amplify (by PCR) fragments of template upstream and downstream from the target site. The resulting products were treated withDpnI for 2 h to digest the remaining template. Then both reactions were mixed, and the third PCR reaction was performed using flanking primers only. The product of the third PCR was cloned into the TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), subcloned into the pCMV5myc1 vector, and sequenced. Three truncation mutants, all starting from residue 92 (92–471, 92–451, and 92–431), were prepared by PCR using the full-length PI4KIIα sequence as template. The forward primer was 5′-GCG AAT TCC ACG CCG TTC AGA CCA CCG CGA G-3′. Reverse primers were: 92–471, 5′-CGC TGC AGT TAC CGA CTC TGG AAG CTC TGT GTG TAG-3′; 92–451, 5′-CGC TGC AGT TAC TCA ACA ATC ACG GGT GGT ATC TG-3′; 92–431, 5′-CGC TGC AGT TAC TGG GTC AAA TTT AGG ATC TGA CCT CTC-3′. The products were cloned into Topo vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into EcoRI/PstI sites of pCMV5myc1vector. Using similarity searches (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60189) Google Scholar) on theDrosophila genome, we found a predicted protein sequence (CG2929, chromosome 3R) that had high similarity to the rat PI4KIIα. Using RT-PCR, it was determined that, whereas the predicted sequence had the proper start site, the stop codon lay just outside of the predicted coding sequence (data not shown). Based on this information, primers were designed to the expected N- and C-terminal portions of the protein inserting EcoRI (5′) and XbaI (3′) sites as follows: 5′-CGG AAT TCA TGA GCG GCG CTC GGG ATC AGA CG-3′ (N-terminal) and 5′-gct cta gac tac cac caa gag aag aaa ggg c-3′ (C-terminal). The Drosophila homolog of PI4KII was cloned by PCR from a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA library (donated by Dr. D. McKearin, University of Texas Southwestern), yielding a 2000-bp band. This band was subcloned into a pCMV5myc1 vector using standard techniques, sequenced, and expressed in COS or HEK 293 cells. The expressed protein was found to be an active PtdIns 4-kinase, but the cloned sequence did not completely match the predicted sequence (see “Results” and Fig. 8). However, the cloned sequence did match the Drosophila genomic sequence at the CG2929 gene (30Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4851) Google Scholar) and matched the rat PI4KIIα sequence more closely than the predictedDrosophila sequence. The sequence was deposited in the EMBL data base (accession number AJ440722) and in GenBankTM(accession number AF498318). Based upon sequence similarity to rat PI4KIIα, an N-terminally truncated Drosophila PI4KII (starting from Met-216) was also produced by PCR using the same restriction sites and C-terminal primer given above and the primer 5′-cgg aat tca tgt cca cgg acg ccg gca gcg aca acc-3′ for the N terminus. Expression ofDrosophila PI4KII was reduced in Schneider S2 cells using the RNAi method according to Clemens et al. (31Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Briefly, a region (corresponding to 760–1440 bp in the DrosophilaPI4KII cDNA) was amplified by PCR using DrosophilaPI4KII cDNA as a template and primers DPI4K_c_RNAi_F (5′-TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG GAT CAC GTG GAG TTT GTA TCG-3′) and DPI4K_c_RNAi_R (5′-TTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG GAT CTT AGG GGC CAC GTA CCT G-3′). The PCR product was used to produce complementary double-stranded RNA using Ambion Megascript T7 kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Synthesized double-stranded RNA was stored at −20 °C for use in all experiments. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in serum-free DS-2 medium (Cellgro) at room temperature in a humidified incubator for all experiments. For RNAi treatments, cells were suspended in fresh medium at 1 × 106/ml and plated into 6-well plates (1 ml/well). Double-stranded RNA was added (15 μg/well) for 1 h. After that, DS-2 medium (2 ml) was added to each plate, and cells were incubated for 4 days. Harvested cells were lysed either in sucrose for activity assay or in Trizol for RNA extraction and RT-PCR. RNA (2 μg) was used for RT-PCR using primers PCR-PI4K-dr5 (5′-GCT GTG CTG CCC GTG TTG TTT TGG CC-3′) and PCR-PI4K-dr3 (5′-GGG CAA TTT GGG GGT CAC AAC-3′), which generated a 520-bp product (corresponding to 993–1513 bp in the Drosophila PI4KII cDNA). Products of PCR were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after 25 PCR cycles. Detected levels of actin RNA (used as a standard for RT-PCR) were the same in all samples. Rat PI4KIIα purified from Sf9 cells was digested with papain and chymotrypsin for various times at 25 °C at a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme:PI4KII ratio. Before digestion papain was activated by incubation on ice for 15 min in a solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT. Digestion was terminated by adding iodoacetic acid to a final concentration of 4 mm(to inhibit papain) or by adding phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mm (to inhibit chymotrypsin), and samples were either used for enzymatic assay or boiled with SDS sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To obtain the N-terminal amino acid sequence of proteolytic fragments, the digests were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto PVDF-PLUS membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the desired bands were cut out and submitted for sequencing (Argo BioAnalytica, Inc.). HEK 293 cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with wild type or mutant forms of PI4KIIα or with Drosophila PI4KII or its N-terminal truncated fragment. Cells were resuspended in solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors and permeabilized by freezing and thawing and passing through a 27.5-gauge needle. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g to obtain post-nuclear supernatant, which was subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 200,000 × gto obtain cytosol (C) and membrane pellet. Pellets were extracted with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation as above, and the supernatants represented the membrane fraction (M). PtdIns 4-kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of PtdIns/Triton X-100 micelles using [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) as phosphate donor. Routinely, kinase in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0,1% Triton X-100, 1 mmDTT, and protease inhibitors was preincubated for 10 min with PtdIns prepared by sonication with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In one experiment (Fig. 1 C), the molar ratios of PtdIns and Triton X-100 in the assays were varied. Reaction was initiated by adding ATP and MgCl2 at final concentrations of 0.5 and 15 mm, respectively, and carried out at room temperature for the times indicated in the figure legends. Phospholipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43088) Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an n-propyl alcohol/H2O/NH4OH (65:20:15) solvent system. Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography, scraped, and quantified for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Assay of PI4KIIα and its proteolytic fragments after separation by SDS gel electrophoresis was performed according to Walker et al.(20Walker D.H. Dougherty N. Pike L.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6504-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel lanes were cut into equal slices, which were then renatured by incubation with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 2 mm DTT to remove SDS and assayed for 5 h in the presence of 1 mm PtdIns and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol). Lipid extraction and analysis were performed as described above. Membrane rafts were prepared using the sodium carbonate method of Song et al. (33Song K.S. Shengwen L. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells, control or transfected, were lysed in a solution containing 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were sonicated (3 × 50-Joule bursts at 10 watts each), adjusted to 40% sucrose prepared in 0.1 m Mes buffer, pH 6.5, and overlaid with 35% sucrose and 5% sucrose prepared in 0.1 m Mes and 0.15m NaCl. Samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 210,000 × g in a swinging bucket (SW40) rotor. One-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes, and equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed for the presence of endogenous PI4KIIα by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 16-amino acids residues of the kinase or for the presence of overexpressed kinase using anti-Myc antibody 9E10. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using a calcium phosphate procedure (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown in suspension in IPL-41 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Pluronic F-68. Protein concentrations were determined using the modified Lowry method (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to Peterson (35Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was carried out by the method of Towbinet al. (37Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar) (as described previously (23Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)).125I-Labeled secondary antibodies were used to quantify relative amounts of expressed PI4KII in Triton X-100 extracts, and the blots were scanned with phosphorimaging (Fujifilm BAS 1500). Sequence similarities were determined using BLASTP 2.2.2 (matrix: Blosum62) according to Tatusova and Madden (38Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize rat PI4KIIα, we expressed a (His)6-tagged form of the protein in Sf9 cells and purified it by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Fig.1 A). Recombinant PI4KIIα has the enzymatic properties previously reported for native Type II kinases, i.e. relatively low K m values for ATP and PtdIns and sensitivity to inhibition by adenosine but not wortmannin (data not shown). The maximal activity of expressed PI4KIIα varied from preparation to preparation, but generally ranged from 150 to 250 min−1. As expected for a surface-active enzyme, activity depends not only on the absolute concentration of PtdIns (Fig. 1 B) but also on the PtdIns to detergent molar ratio (Fig. 1 C). The value of [PtdIns]/{[PtdIns] + [Triton X-100]} that gives half maximal activity is ∼0.006 (Fig. 1 C, inset). Activities obtained with our Sf9-expressed kinase are comparable with the highest values previously obtained using highly purified native kinases (see “Discussion”). To locate the catalytic domain within rat PI4KIIα, we subjected expressed PI4KIIα to limited proteolysis with papain and chymotrypsin. As shown in Fig.2 A, both proteases gave essentially identical digestion patterns, suggesting that the kinase contains several exposed, highly susceptible cleavage sites. The full-length 55-kDa protein was rapidly cleaved to a 50-kDa fragment and then to more stable fragments of 45 and 43 kDa. Upon prolonged digestion, these fragments were further broken down to 26- and 17-kDa polypeptides. The full-length kinase as well as its 50-, 45-, and 43-kDa breakdown products were recognized by monoclonal antibody 4C5G, which inhibits PtdIns 4-kinase activity (9Endemann G.C. Graziani A. Cantley L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The epitope is lost upon further digestion of the 43-kDa fragment. The major proteolytic fragments were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Both the 43- and 17-kDa fragments initiate at Ala-93, whereas the 26-kDa fragment initiates at Gln-245 (Fig. 2 B). If the 43-kDa fragment were to extend to the C terminus of the native enzyme (residue 478) it would have a calculated molecular weight of 45,012, similar to the value predicted based on its electrophoretic mobility. Thus, the 43-kDa polypeptide contains essentially the entire C-terminal portion of rat PI4KIIα, and the 17- and 26-kDa fragments represent its N- and C-terminal segments, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the fragments produced in the early stages of papain or chymotrypsin digestion,i.e. the 50-, 45-, and 43-kDa polypeptides, express essentially the same level of enzymatic activity as the undigested kinase. Loss of activity correlates well with reduction of the 43-kDa fragment and appearance of the 17- and 26-kDa fragments. Using a gel renaturation assay, we confirmed that the 43-kDa polypeptide is active and that the 26-kDa and 17-kDa fragments are inactive (Fig.3 B). To further define the catalytic domain we compared the activity of expressed full-length PI4KIIα with those of a series of truncation mutants initiating at His-92. Myc-tagged wild-type kinase (1–478) and mutants 92–478, 92–471, and 92–451 were all associated with membranes and could be solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 (Fig.4 A). Another mutant, 92–431, was mainly in detergent-insoluble aggregates, although a small portion (<10%) was soluble even in the absence of detergent. As expected from the results of our limited proteolysis experiments, mutant 92–478 has essentially the same activity as full-length PI4KIIα (Fig.4 B). Thus, the N-terminal domain of the kinase is not required for catalysis. Surprisingly, deletion of only 7 amino acids from the C terminus reduced activity by ∼70%, whereas deletion of an additional 20 residues had no further effect. The soluble portion of mutant 92–431 had no detectable activity. Within the minimal catalytic domain of rat PI4KIIα there is a clearly defined kinase core, as determined by multiple alignment constructed on the basis of PSI-BLAST high scoring sequence segments (Fig. 5). This core, extending from residues 123 to 351 of the rat PI4KIIα sequence, is highly conserved among all PI4KII orthologs and contains 7 of the 11 conserved kinase sequence motifs defined by Hanks and Hunte"

However, much still remains to be uncovered on the specific downstream pathways influenced by this important activator/repressor of transcription. This study investigated the effects of a p53 null genotype on the transcriptome of ‘normal’ mouse mammary epithelium using a unique in vivo model of preneoplastic transformation. We used SAGE for the comparative analysis of p53 wild type (wt) and null mammary epithelium unexposed and exposed to hormonal stimulation. Analysis of the hormone exposed samples provided a comprehensive view of the dramatic changes in gene expression as consequence of the functional differentiation of the mammary epithelium in an in vivo system. We detected the dysregulation in p53null epithelium of <1% of the transcriptome. Changes in expression affected not only known p53 target genes, but also several unexpected genes such as Expi (Wdnm1), Cyp1b1, Gelsolin, Ramp2 and class I MHC genes. The dysregulation of specific genes and their potential use as preneoplastic markers was further validated using an independent model of premalignant mammary outgrowth lines. This is the first study to examine the transcriptome of very early stages of preneoplastic progression in an in vivo model that mimics human breast cancer."

We show here that, in response to osmotic shock, Gab-1 acts as a docking protein for phospholipase Cγ1, the p85 subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Crk-II. It has been shown that the adapter Crk-II is constitutively associated with C3G, a GDP to GTP exchange factor for several small GTP-binding proteins. We found that inhibition of the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or phospholipase C did not prevent the stimulation of glucose transport by osmotic shock, whereas inactivation of Rho proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B severely inhibited glucose uptake. Among the Rho family members, overexpression of dominant-interfering TC10/T31N mutant inhibited osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation suggesting that TC10 is required for this process. Further, disruption of cortical actin integrity by latrunculin B or jasplakinolide severely impaired osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. In contrast, osmotic shock increased the amount of cortical actin associated with caveolin-enriched plasma membrane domains. These data provide the first evidence that activation of TC10 and remodeling of cortical actin, which could occur through the TC10 signaling, are required for osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake.

These data provide the first evidence that activation of TC10 and remodeling of cortical actin, which could occur through the TC10 signaling, are required for osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake. Glut 4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform, is expressed primarily in muscle and adipose tissue. In the basal state, Glut 4-containing vesicles cycle slowly between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, with the vast majority of the Glut 4 sequestrated within intracellular compartments. Insulin triggers a large increase in the rate of Glut 4-containing vesicles exocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of the transporter at the cell surface and concomitant increase in glucose uptake (1Thurmond D.C.

However, some data indicate that insulin should also activate a PI3K-independent pathway to produce its full effect (4Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E.

Indeed, in adipocytes, the Cbl proto-oncogene, associated with CAP (Cbl-associated protein) and APS (adapter protein containing PH andSH2 domain) is phosphorylated in response to insulin and regulates glucose uptake (4Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 6Ahmed Z. Smith B.J. Pillay T.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, Cbl recruits the adapter protein Crk-II in a complex with C3G, a GDP to GTP exchange factor for TC10, a Rho-family GTPase, allowing for its activation, which regulates the traffic of Glut 4-containing vesicles (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A.

However, it has not been determined yet whether the Glut 4 translocation induced by other stimuli, such as osmotic shock, also required the activation of the Crk-II/TC10 pathway. Osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation is not due to IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and is largely PI3K/protein kinase B-independent (7Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it requires the activation of a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway (9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Among the proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine following osmotic shock stimulation, Gab-1 (Grb2-associatedbinder-1) seems to play a key role, because microinjection of anti-Gab-1 antibodies strongly inhibits osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation without altering insulin effect (10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gab-1 is an adapter protein that possesses an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and 16 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (11Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K.

Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, some of them could generate binding sites for SH2-containing proteins such as PI3K, SHPTP-2 (SH2-containing phosphotyrosinephosphatase-2), Crk-II, and PLCγ1 (13Holgado-Madruga M.

However, there are few insights into signaling pathways downstream of Gab-1 involved in osmotic shock-induced glucose uptake. In the present study, we show that in response to osmotic shock, Gab-1 acts as a docking protein for PLCγ1, the p85 subunit of PI3K, and Crk-II. Although PI3K and PLCγ1 activation are not required for glucose transport, we found that the newly identified Crk-II/TC10 signaling pathway plays an important role in osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation and glucose transport. Further, our data suggest that the regulation of cortical actin remodeling is also necessary for Glut 4 translocation in response to osmotic shock.

Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in 35- or 100-mm dishes in DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% calf serum and induced to differentiate in adipocytes as described previously (19Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after confluence, medium was changed for DMEM, 25 mmglucose, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with isobutylmethylxanthine (0.25 mm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), Thiazolidinediones (10 μm) (compound 57135; Servier, Suresnes, France) and insulin (5 μg/ml). The medium was removed after 2 days and replaced with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin for 2 more days. Then, the cells were fed every 2 days with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 8–15 days after the beginning of the differentiation protocol. Sixteen h before each experiment, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After serum starvation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with sorbitol (600 mm) for different periods of times. Cells were washed subsequently with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) before solubilization for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, proteases inhibitors, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates obtained after centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose (4 μg of antibodies/sample). Following washes with lysis buffer, immune pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5 or 10% resolving gel, before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with saline buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature and blotted overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against phosphotyrosine, PLCγ1, Gab-1, Crk-II, or the p85 subunit of PI3K at the dilution indicated by the manufacturer's instructions. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases, the membrane was stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62 mmTris, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS and reprobed with the indicated antibodies. After serum starvation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated or not with the different inhibitors at the concentration and for the time indicated in the legend to figures. Cells were then washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl) and incubated without or with sorbitol (600 mm) for 20 min in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Glucose transport was determined by the addition of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (0.1 mm, 0.5 μCi/ml) as described previously (20Tanti J.F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped after 3 min by aspiration, and cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in Krebs-Ringer phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and glucose uptake was assessed by scintillation counting. Results were normalized for protein measured by BCA assay. Nine to ten days post-differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with plasmid coding for Glut 4-EGFP (50 μg) and empty plasmid (200 μg) or plasmid coding for Myc-tagged wild-type TC10, constitutively active TC10/Q75L, or dominant-negative TC10/T31N (200 μg) using a low voltage electroporation technique as described previously (21Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After 18 h, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were placed in DMEM, 25 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were incubated with or without insulin (100 nm) or sorbitol (600 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 10 min at room temperature. After being washed, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min and blocked with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum. The cells expressing Myc-tagged TC10/T31N were detected following incubation with anti-c-Myc antibodies for 90 min at 37 °C and Texas Red-conjugated donkey secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlington, CA) and examined by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Quantification of the number of cells displaying Glut 4-EGFP plasma membrane fluorescence was determined from the counting of 80 cells that were co-expressing both Myc-tagged TC10/T31N and Glut 4-EGFP in three independent experiments. Cells with a continuous fluorescent rim are considered as positive for Glut 4 translocation. By contrast, they are considered as negative when the labeling is absent, discontinuous, or when it appears as punctate structures. Because Gab-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to osmotic shock and plays an important role in the stimulation of Glut 4 translocation and glucose transport (10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated which proteins were associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab-1. Gab-1 was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated or not with 600 mm sorbitol for various periods of time, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, sorbitol treatment induced a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, which was maximal between 10 and 20 min and declined thereafter. We also detected the tyrosine phosphorylation of one protein at 145 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with Gab-1. Because Gab-1 possesses several potential docking sites for the p85 subunit of PI3K and PLCγ1, we investigated whether both proteins bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab-1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, sorbitol stimulation induced a large increase in the coimmunoprecipitation of both p85 and PLCγ1 with Gab-1 indicating that this association is a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent process. Because PLCγ1 activation is correlated with its phosphorylation (22Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we then determined whether PLCγ1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to sorbitol. As shown in Fig. 1 B, we observed an increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 upon sorbitol stimulation. Therefore, the protein with a molecular mass of 145 kDa associated with Gab-1 and phosphorylated on tyrosine residue in response to sorbitol likely corresponds to PLCγ1. We then tested whether PI3K or PLCγ1 activation was required for osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin 100 nm) or a PLC inhibitor (U73122; 10 μm) before stimulation with sorbitol (600 mm) for 30 min. Deoxyglucose uptake was then measured. We observed that inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin did not block the effect of sorbitol on glucose uptake as described previously (9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,23Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PLC by U73122 did not affect sorbitol-induced glucose transport (Fig. 2 A) although the sorbitol-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was inhibited (Fig. 2 B) as reported previously for insulin (24Kayali A.G. Eichhorn J. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13808-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To demonstrate further that PLCγ1-dependent pathways are not required for this biological response, we prevented the activation of either protein kinase C by staurosporine (214 nm) or α-diacylglycerol kinase by R59949 (10 μm) before the glucose uptake assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with these inhibitors did not modify the sorbitol effect on glucose transport. Further, ERK pathways are not involved in osmotic shock-induced glucose transport, because both a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 inhibitor (PD98059) and U73122 did not prevent sorbitol-induced glucose transport (Fig. 2 A). Taken together, these data indicate that PI3K, PLCγ1, and ERK pathways are not involved in osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. The above data led us to search for other proteins that could bind to Gab-1 and play a role in this metabolic effect. Gab-1 possesses binding sites for the SH2-containing protein Crk-II (14Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Zeh K. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is involved in the stimulation of Glut 4 translocation in response to insulin (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Crk-II could form a complex with Gab-1 in response to sorbitol, Crk-II was immunoprecipitated from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated or not with sorbitol (600 mm) for various periods of time, and the presence of Gab-1 was detected with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 A, upon osmotic shock stimulation, an association between Gab-1 and Crk-II was detected, which correlated directly with the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab-1 shown previously. It should be noted that sorbitol stimulation also led to a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of Crk-II (Fig.3, A and B), which could be because of an increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Moreover, the time course of Gab-1/Crk-II association is compatible with glucose uptake induced by osmotic shock (Fig. 3 C), because this association was maximal already after 10 min of stimulation. The Gab-1-Crk signaling complex formation has been involved in the activation of small GTP-binding proteins in response to growth factor (14Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Zeh K. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Sakkab D. Lewitzky M. Posern G. Schaeper U. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10772-10778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, Crk-II is associated constitutively with C3G (26Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), a GDP to GTP exchange factor for several small GTP-binding proteins including some members of the Rho family (27Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because the Rho family plays a role in insulin-induced Glut 4 translocation (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we investigated whether glucose transport induced by osmotic shock is dependent on these proteins. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with C. difficile toxin B (1 μg/ml), which inactivates members of the Rho family proteins (16Just I. Fritz G. Aktories K. Giry M. Popoff M.R. Boquet P. Hegenbarth S. von Eichel-Streiber C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10706-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Just I.

Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), before measuring glucose uptake in response to sorbitol (600 mm). As shown in Fig.4, inactivation of the Rho family proteins partially inhibited osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. These results suggest that at least one small GTP-binding protein of the Rho family is involved in osmotic shock signaling for glucose transport. We next attempted to identify the member of the Rho GTPase family involved in osmotic shock-mediated glucose transport. Because activation of the Rho GTP-binding protein TC10 is required for insulin-induced Glut 4 translocation (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we investigated its role in osmotic shock-mediated Glut 4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing Glut 4-EGFP alone or with various Myc-tagged TC10 proteins were left untreated or stimulated with sorbitol (600 mm) or insulin (100 nm) for 30 min. The cell expressing Myc-tagged TC10/T31N, the dominant interfering mutant of TC10, were then identified by immunofluorescence with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.5), and the subcellular localization of Glut 4-EGFP was evaluated by confocal fluorescent microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, in both cell lines, Glut 4-EGFP was localized mainly inside the cells in control conditions. In cells expressing Glut 4-EGFP alone, insulin and sorbitol induced the appearance of a plasma membrane Glut 4-EGFP rim fluorescence, indicative of translocation of Glut 4-EGFP. However, quantification of the number of cells displaying a continuous cell surface Glut 4-EGFP fluorescence rim demonstrated that sorbitol treatment was less effective than insulin in stimulating Glut 4-EGFP translocation (Fig. 6 A). This is in agreement with the fact that osmotic shock is less efficient than insulin to mediate glucose uptake (8Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

In cells expressing both Glut 4-EGFP and TC10/T31N, osmotic shock-induced Glut 4-EGFP translocation was inhibited substantially as visualized by the absence of cells showing a continuous cell surface Glut 4-EGFP fluorescence rim (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). The same method was used to assess the effect of wild-type or constitutively active form (TC10/Q75L) of TC10 on osmotic shock-induced Glut 4-EGFP translocation. In contrast to TC10/T31N, wild-type TC10 or TC10/Q75L only had a small inhibitory effect on osmotic shock-stimulated Glut 4-EGFP translocation (Fig.6 B). By contrast, and as described previously (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), insulin-induced Glut 4 translocation was inhibited by 60% in cells expressing TC10/T31N compared with control cells (see Fig. 5 and Fig.6 A). These data are consistent with a requirement of the TC10 signaling pathway in the osmotic shock stimulation of Glut 4 translocation.Figure 6Effect of different forms of TC10 on osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as described in the legend for Fig. 5. A, quantification of the number of cells displaying Glut 4-EGFP plasma membrane fluorescence was determined from the counting of 80 cells that were coexpressing both Myc-tagged TC10/T31N and Glut 4-EGFP in three independent experiments. B, quantification of the number of cells displaying Glut 4-EGFP plasma membrane fluorescence was determined from the counting of 80 cells that were coexpressing both Glut 4-EGFP and Myc-tagged wild-type TC10 (TC10 wt) or TC10/T31N or TC10/Q75L in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TC10 activation could be involved in cortical actin remodeling, which seems essential for the insulin-stimulated Glut 4 translocation process (28Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To assess a possible involvement of actin in the Glut 4 translocation in response to osmotic shock, we preincubated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with either latrunculin B (10 μm), an agent that sequesters actin monomers, or jasplakinolide (10 μm), a stabilizer of filamentous actin. As shown in Fig. 7 A, latrunculin B or jasplakinolide decreased osmotic shock-stimulated glucose transport by 57 and 51%, respectively. It is important to note that latrunculin B did not alter the ability of osmotic shock to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1 (Fig. 7 B) and its association with Crk-II (Fig. 7 C), thus ruling out an early inhibition of proximal osmotic shock signaling events. The previous series of experiments indicate that cortical actin integrity is necessary for osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. It has been described recently (29Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that unique cortical filamentous actin structures, designated Cav-actin (for caveolin-associated F-actin) are present in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These structures are visible in the merged image of Fig.8 (top panel) on the bottom of the cell. Individual caveolae are clustered into ring-like arrays (“caveolae-rosettes”), and these structures are also positive for actin, which is labeled with phalloidin. Osmotic shock markedly increased cortical actin, particularly visible at the bottom of the cell, in contact with the substratum. This effect was sensitive to toxin B and latrunculin but not wortmannin (data not shown). Further, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of F-actin associated with caveolin in these large Cav-actin structures (Fig. 8,lower panel). These results show that osmotic shock regulation of cortical actin rearrangements appears necessary for glucose transport, which could occur through a TC10- dependent pathway. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, osmotic shock triggers the cell surface accumulation of Glut 4 leading to glucose uptake by mechanisms, which have not yet been elucidated fully. It has been shown that this process is largely PI3K/protein kinase B-independent (7Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Chen D.

Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Osmotic shock induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab-1, which plays a major role in osmotic shock signal transduction pathways involved in glucose transport (10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the role of different signaling pathways downstream of Gab-1 in the induction of this biological response. Gab-1 contains several potential binding sites for SH2-containing proteins including the p85 subunit of the PI3K, PLCγ and Crk-II. We show that the association between tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab-1 and these proteins is increased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upon osmotic shock stimulation. Further, we observe an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, which is linked to its activation (22Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to recent data (31Ueno E. Haruta T. Uno T. Usui I. Iwata M. Takano A. Kawahara J. Sasaoka T. Ishibashi O. Kobayashi M. Horm. Metab. Res. 2001; 33: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), our results are not in favor of a role of PLCγ in osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. Indeed, inhibition of PLC by U73122 did not change the effect of osmotic shock on glucose transport, whereas activation of ERK was prevented as reported previously for insulin (24Kayali A.G. Eichhorn J. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Olefsky J.M. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13808-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This indicates that this inhibitor effectively blocks PLC activity. Further, we show that inhibition of signaling pathway downstream of PLCγ, including protein kinase C and α-diacylglycerol kinase activity, has no effect on osmotic shock-induced glucose uptake. Although PI3K and PLCγ do not seem to be involved in glucose transport, they could be implicated in other effects of hyperosmolarity. For instance, PI3K activation is required for osmotic shock-induced membrane ruffling (10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PLCγ mediates ERK activation in response to sorbitol treatment, it is also likely that hyperosmolarity-induced PLCγ activation is involved in modification of gene expression (32Kultz D. Chakravarty D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 130: 421-428Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Osmotic shock also promotes the association between Gab-1 and Crk-II. Thus, we investigated the significance of this complex formation in osmotic shock signaling. Crk-II is an adapter protein that can constitutively bind C3G (26Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), a GDP to GTP exchange factor for several small GTP-binding proteins including members of the Rho family (27Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Further, several reports have demonstrated that the Gab-1-Crk signaling complex formation in response to growth factor correlates directly with activation of small GTP-binding proteins (14Garcia-Guzman M. Dolfi F. Zeh K. Vuori K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Sakkab D. Lewitzky M. Posern G. Schaeper U. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10772-10778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of Crk-II to Gab-1 in response to osmotic shock could thus lead to an accumulation of C3G near the plasma membrane where it may exert its effect on small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family. It has been shown recently that C3G efficiently catalyzes the exchange of GDP to GTP on TC10, a member of the Rho family. Activation of this GTPase plays a critical role in insulin-induced Glut 4 translocation (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether TC10 was also involved in osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. We found that (i) inactivation of the Rho family proteins by C. difficile toxin B inhibited osmotic shock-stimulated glucose uptake, and (ii) the overexpression of the dominant-interfering TC10/T31N blocked the accumulation of Glut 4 to the cell membrane, whereas wild-type or constitutively active TC10 had a small, if any, inhibitory effect. Taken together, these results are in favor of a role of TC10 in the regulation of Glut 4 trafficking in response to osmotic shock. Glut 4 accumulation at the cell surface is because of the stimulation of its translocation from its sequestration compartment and/or from an inhibition of its endocytosis. In L6 muscle cells, the increase in Glut 4 amount at the cell surface in response to osmotic shock results from the prevention of its endocytosis and the stimulation of its exocytosis. The former is tyrosine kinase-independent, whereas the latter is a tyrosine kinase-dependent process (33Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity completely blocks hyperosmolarity-induced glucose uptake (9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that Glut 4 endocytosis is not blocked by osmotic shock in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and Gab-1 and TC10 could regulate Glut 4 exocytosis rather than its endocytosis. Our results also demonstrate that osmotic shock and insulin share the TC10 signaling pathway to stimulate glucose uptake. Activation of TC10 in response to insulin requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in complex with CAP, which in turn binds the Crk-II-C3G complex (5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to osmotic shock (9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and forms a complex with Crk-II (data not shown), we cannot rule out that Cbl could be also involved in osmotic shock-induced TC10 activation. However, signaling pathways downstream of Gab-1 seem to play a major role in osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. Indeed, microinjection of Gab-1 antibodies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes markedly inhibits Glut 4-translocation (10Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major difference between osmotic shock and insulin in the regulation of glucose uptake is that insulin activates both a PI3K/protein kinase B and a TC10 pathway to fully stimulate Glut 4 translocation. This could explain why overexpression of TC10/T31N only partly inhibited Glut 4 translocation in insulin-treated cells (see Fig. 5 and Ref. 5Chiang S., H Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and why inhibition of insulin-induced protein kinase B activation by sorbitol induced an insulin-resistant state for glucose transport (8Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus propose that the TC10 signaling pathway could be shared by different stimuli, which mediate Glut 4 translocation, whereas the PI3K/protein kinase B-dependent pathway would be more specific for insulin action. Because both osmotic shock and insulin appear to require TC10 activation to stimulate Glut 4 translocation, it is tempting to assume that the signaling pathways downstream of TC10 are also shared by these two stimuli. Cortical actin must undergo an active insulin-stimulated remodeling to allow for Glut 4 translocation, which appears to be regulated by TC10 (28Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49331-49336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our data are in favor of a similar regulation for osmotic shock-induced glucose transport. Indeed, disruption of cortical actin integrity by latrunculin B or stabilization of polymerized actin by jasplakinolide inhibits osmotic shock-stimulated glucose transport. Further, osmotic shock increased the appearance of the caveolin-associated filamentous actin structures, which could play a role in Glut 4 translocation (29Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25867-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, cortical actin remodeling, which could be mediated by TC10, appears to be a necessary event induced by different stimuli for Glut 4 translocation and glucose transport. It should be noted that expression of a dominant-interfering mutant of TC10 evoked a greater inhibition of osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation than disruption of cytoskeleton. It is possible that TC10, in addition to its role on cortical actin remodeling, regulates other steps required for Glut 4 translocation. An attractive hypothesis is that TC10 could also regulate the interaction between v-SNARE present on Glut 4-containing vesicles and t-SNARE at the plasma membrane. Indeed, it has been proposed that actin reorganization modulates the redistribution of both Glut 4-containing vesicles and t-SNARE proteins (Syntaxin-4 and SNAP 23 (solubleNSF attachment protein23)) to the same cellular location below the cell surface (35Tong P. Khayat Z.A. Huang C. Patel N. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The actin network could thus serve as scaffolding structures to facilitate the interaction between the Glut 4-containing vesicles and the t-SNARE proteins allowing for the insertion of Glut 4 into the plasma membrane. It has also been proposed that small GTP-binding proteins could regulate the interaction between v- and t-SNARE (36Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,37Zhang X., Bi, E. Novick P., Du, L. Kozminski K.G. Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46745-46750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, TC10, by regulating both processes (cortical actin remodeling and v-/t-SNARE interaction), could ensure a proper timing allowing for a correct insertion of Glut 4 into the plasma membrane in response to both insulin and osmotic shock stimulation. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown that the t-SNARE protein syntaxin-4 is required for docking/fusion of Glut 4-containing vesicles in response to both osmotic shock and insulin (9Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L., Li, X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In summary, our data demonstrate that osmotic shock induces the formation of a signaling complex between Gab-1 and Crk-II, which could lead to the activation of the small GTPase TC10. The activation of TC10 and remodeling of actin structure are required for osmotic shock-induced Glut 4 translocation. Revealing how the TC10 signaling pathway regulates Glut 4 translocation is an important issue for future investigation. We are grateful to Dr. I.

The ATM-dependent pathway plays an important role in the S phase checkpoint response following ionizing irradiation. We report that there is a stronger S phase checkpoint response in irradiated Ku80(-/-) cells as compared with their wild-type counterparts, which has no relationship to DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity but correlates with a higher ATM activity and with more ATM bound to chromatin DNA in such cells. Wortmannin, a nonspecific inhibitor of ATM, not only reduces the higher activity of ATM kinase, but also abolishes the stronger S phase checkpoint response in Ku80(-/-) cells. Furthermore, a specific ATM antisense oligonucleotide abolishes the stronger S checkpoint response in Ku80(-/-) cells and renders these cells practically indistinguishable from Ku80(+/+) cells for this endpoint. These results in aggregate indicate that the stronger S checkpoint in irradiated Ku80(-/-) cells is due to the higher ATM kinase activity."

NF-κB is an essential transcription factor for the production of endogenous NO and acts by mediating the gene expression of iNOS (16Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol.

HeLa-80 cells, derived from HeLa cells, a cervical epithelial cell line, are capable of stable proliferation in 80% O2, a lethal dose to many other cell types (23Joenje H. Gille J.J. Oostra A.B.

In this study, we examined the cytotoxicity resulting from the exposure to NO ± O2 in HeLa-80 cells, determined the mode of cell death, and examined the role of NF-κB regulation in the cytotoxicity of NO/O2. HeLa-80 cells and human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C as described previously (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y.

Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 95% room air and 5% CO2. Cells were exposed to 0.5–7.5 mm DETA NONOate, a NO donor from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, in the presence or absence of 80% O2 for up to 6 days as previously described (4Narula P., Xu, J. Kazzaz J.A. Robbins C.G. Davis J.M. Horowitz S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L411-L416PubMed Google Scholar, 25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Media and gases were refreshed daily. Cell death/viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays (27Carmichael J. de Graff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed independently and at least twice. The data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed for statistical significance using the unpaired Student's ttest and analysis of variance with p < 0.05 considered significant. The Annexin V incorporation assay, which detects the flipping of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the cytosolic surface to the extracellular surface, was performed as previously described (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and combined with cells detached during the exposure. After centrifugation, cells were stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) according to the vendor's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Ten thousand cells from each sample were analyzed on a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. Both Annexin V binding and cell shrinkage were used to characterize apoptosis (Cell Quest software, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Relative fluorescence units (FITC) higher than 210 or cell sizes smaller than 502 relative units (the Forward Scatter) were considered positive for apoptosis, whereas cells with relative fluorescence units (PI) higher than 250 were deemed necrotic. To assess caspase activation, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold cell lysis buffer at 25 μl per 1 × 106 cells according to the vendor's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). At least 5 × 106cells were collected for the caspase-3-like activity assay for each sample. Equal volumes of cell lysate and 2× reaction buffer were mixed with DEVD-pNA for 2 h at 37 °C. Colorimetric reactions were analyzed at 405 nm. Results were normalized to total protein content of each sample. After cell lysates were collected, protein concentrations were determined, and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of protein of each sample were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for electrophoresis. Polyclonal antibodies directed against IκBα, NF-κB p65 subunit, actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and nitrotyrosine (Cayman Chemical) were used for Western blot analysis. Modification of NF-κB p65 subunit was assessed by determining the presence of carbonyl groups using a standard kit (Oxy-blot, Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) following derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid according to the vendor's protocol. Five micrograms of each derivatized protein sample were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blots were probed with the primary and secondary antibodies supplied in the kit and developed as Western blots. To determine whether some protein carbonyl bands contain NF-κB p65 subunit, blots were stripped and reprobed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p65 polyclonal antibody. To further confirm protein carbonyl modification of NF-κB p65 subunit, total p65 protein from cell lysates was immunoprecipitated by agarose conjugated with anti-p65 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the vendor's protocol. Protein carbonyl formation was then determined as described above in the resulting immunopurified p65. Cells grown on chamber slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 10 min in 10% buffered formalin as previously described (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated in a 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS solution (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-p65 NF-κB polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Subsequently, the slides were washed and incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were then stained with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 10 min. Nuclear extracts from HeLa-80, and A549 cells were prepared as described previously (28Dignam J.R. Lebovitz M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) from at least 4 × 107 cells per sample. To prepare mitochondrial extracts, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted at 1500 ×g. Cells were then washed and homogenized in cold fractionation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm sodium succinate) using a Dounce homogenizer. Disruption of the plasma membrane was monitored by trypan blue staining. Lysates were centrifuged twice for 5 min at 2,000 ×g to pellet nuclei and other debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The remaining pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, and collected as the mitochondrial extracts. To determine the levels of NF-κB transactivation activity, a reporter gene expression assay was performed as described (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa-80 cells were transiently cotransfected with pCMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase, pBlue, and a reporter plasmid containing 5 NF-κB binding sites inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were exposed to NO and 80% O2 24 h post-transfection. NF-κB activity was determined by luciferase activity (luminescence) with a Lumat LB9501 luminometer and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. 3T3 RelA−/− cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the gene encoding NF-κB p65 subunit. Transient transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the vendor's protocol. Double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) using T4 polynucleotide kinase in a Invitrogen labeling buffer at 37 °C for 60 min. Binding reactions were performed by mixing 100,000 cpm of the above 32P-labeled probe with 5 μg of nuclear proteins, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1 μg of poly-l-lysine, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Tween 20 (w/v), 30 mm KCl in a volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before electrophoretic analysis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Supershift analyses were performed by incubating nuclear proteins with polyclonal antibodies against NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to adding 32P-labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography at −80 °C for 12–24 h. To determine if the synergistic cytotoxicity induced by the exposure to NO/O2 is primarily due to oxygen toxicity, HeLa-80 cells were exposed to 80% O2 and 0.5 mm DETA NONOate either separately or in combination. These cells were viable and proliferated for 6 days when cultured either in room air or 80% O2 (Fig.1 A). However, a decrease of cell viability was observed in cells exposed to NO/O2 after 5 days, whereas cells exposed to NO alone were alive after 6 days (Fig.1 A). To determine whether there is an increase in cell death in cells exposed to NO/O2 than to NO, we determined the cytotoxicity of DETA NONOate in HeLa-80 cells. Exposure to up to 2.5 mm DETA NONOate for 24 h caused little or no significant cell death, whereas 5–7.5 mm DETA NONOate induced marked cell death (data not shown). We therefore used 5 mm DETA NONOate in the subsequent experiments. After 24-h exposure to 5 mm NO, the amount of cell death was increased to 24 ± 3.6%, whereas 81 ± 8.1% (p < 0.05) cells exposed to both 80% O2 and 5 mmDETA NONOate were dead (Fig. 1 B). Results derived from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis further validated these results (data not shown). Because HeLa-80 cells tolerate 80% O2, these data demonstrate that synergistic cytotoxicity of NO and hyperoxia is not due to pleiotropic oxygen toxicity. Stress from both ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have been shown to induce either apoptosis or necrosis in a dose- and cell type-dependent manner (29Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar,30Davies K. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mode of cell death in HeLa-80 cells exposed to 5 mm DETA NONOate, either alone or in combination with 80% O2, Annexin V incorporation, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and caspase activation were measured as indicators of apoptosis. Externalization of PS from the cytosolic surface to the extracellular surface is an early event in apoptosis (31Martin S. Reutelingsperger C. McGahon A. Rader J. van Schie R. LaFace D. Green D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Using FITC-conjugated Annexin V to detect PS translocation and PI exclusion to detect membrane permeability, we analyzed the mode of cell death. More than 90% of the cells cultured in room air or hyperoxia were alive based on PI exclusion and Annexin V incorporation analyses (TableI). Exposure to NO, either alone or in combination with hyperoxia, led to increased apoptosis (Table I). At 24 h, NO induced apoptosis in 18 ± 3.1% of the exposed cells, while NO/O2 increased apoptosis to 79 ± 3.8%. After 2 days, 68 ± 0.5% and 95 ± 1.4% of cells exposed to NO alone, or with O2, respectively, were apoptotic. To demonstrate that apoptosis can be distinguished from necrosis, cells were exposed to 0.01% Nonidet P-40 for 0.5 min, and 73% were found to die by necrosis (Table I).Table IFlow cytometry analysis of HeLa-80 cells exposed to NO±O2RAO2NONO/O2NP4024 h16 h24 h48 h16 h24 h48 h%%%%%%%%%Normal95 ± 0.290 ± 0.282 ± 2.374 ± 5.028 ± 1.169 ± 1.412 ± 3.41.6 ± 0.626 ± 8Apoptotic3 ± 0.16 ± 0.114 ± 1.718 ± 3.168 ± 0.525 ± 0.579 ± 3.895 ± 1.411 ± 1.0Necrotic2 ± 0.24 ± 0.24 ± 0.78 ± 1.94 ± 0.96 ± 0.99 ± 0.53.4 ± 0.763 ± 5.9Annexin V incorporation and PI incorporation was measured by flow cytometry to assess the mode of cell death. Relative fluorescence units represents the intensity of Annexin V incorporation or PI incorporation.

(n = 6). Open table in a new tab Annexin V incorporation and PI incorporation was measured by flow cytometry to assess the mode of cell death. Relative fluorescence units represents the intensity of Annexin V incorporation or PI incorporation. The percent cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells treated with NP-40 were used as controls for necrosis. Values are means ± S.E. (n = 6). To further characterize the mode of cell death, we examined cell size and nuclear morphology. Fig.2 A shows the nuclear morphology of exposed cells visualized with DAPI staining. Condensed chromatin was evident in the nuclei of cells exposed to NO ± O2 (Fig. 2 A). In addition, apoptotic bodies were apparent in cells exposed to NO/O2 for 24 h (Fig.2 A). As expected, cells cultured in room air or in hyperoxia alone showed no signs of nuclear condensation (Fig. 2 A). Cell shrinkage was quantified by flow cytometry analysis as illustrated in Fig. 2 B. Cell shrinkage was apparent in cells exposed to NO/O2 (79% at 24 h, 97% at 48 h) compared with those exposed to NO alone (25% at 24 h, 71% at 48 h). Fig.2 C demonstrates the activation of caspase-3-like caspases using synthetic substrates. Caspase activity was induced in cells exposed to NO alone for 24 h, whereas such an increase in caspase activity was detected much earlier in NO/O2-exposed cells (6 h). To test whether caspase activation plays a causal role in cell death induced by these exposures, cells were pretreated for 60 min with 50 μm Z-DEVD-FMK (Calbiochem), a cell-permeable caspase-3-like inhibitor, prior to the exposure to NO ± O2. 99% (±1.0%) or 90 ± 1.6% of cell death, induced by either exposure to NO alone or to NO/O2, respectively, was prevented or delayed with this pre-treatment, suggesting that caspase activation is necessary for NO ± O2-induced cell death. These data demonstrate that 5 mm DETA NONOate induces significant amounts of apoptosis in HeLa-80 cells, which is significantly enhanced with hyperoxia, even though hyperoxia alone is not toxic to these cells. NF-κB has been shown to play a crucial role in mediating cell survival under nitrosative stress (11Ibe W. Bartels W. Lindemann S. Grosser T. Buerke M. Boissel J.P. Meyer J. Darius H. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12D'Acquisto F. de Cristofaro F. Maiuri M.C. Tajana G. Carnuccio R. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB activity is regulated upon exposure to NO ± O2, we assayed for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB using a luciferase reporter assay as described previously (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Constitutive NF-κB activity was detected in HeLa-80 cells (Fig.3). There was a moderate decrease in NF-κB activity when cells were grown in 80% O2 compared with basal levels in room air (Fig. 3 A). However, NF-κB activity was significantly suppressed in cells exposed to NO. This NO-induced suppression of NF-κB activity was further pronounced by the addition of hyperoxia. Fig. 3 A shows that the synergistic suppression of NF-κB activity was apparent by 6 h (p < 0.05). By 24 h, most of the NF-κB activity was inhibited in cells exposed to NO either alone or in combination with hyperoxia. In addition, NF-κB binding activity in nuclei of HeLa-80 cells was determined by EMSA. As a positive control, A549 cells were treated with TNFα for 30 min to induce NF-κB activation (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A similar NF-κB DNA binding complex was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from cells cultured in room air. Exogenous addition of anti-p65 antibodies supershifted this band, suggesting that p65 is one of the components of this complex. Exposure to NO/O2 for 16 h significantly reduced this binding activity (Fig.3 B). We have previously demonstrated that NF-κB provides a protective role in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells (25Franek W.R. Horowitz S. Stansberry L. Kazzaz J.A. Koo H.C., Li, Y. Arita Y. Davis J.M. Mantell A.S. Scott W. Mantell L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate any causal effects of NF-κB suppression in NO/O2-induced cell death, we exposed fibroblasts lacking a functional NF-κB p65 subunit, RelA(p65)−/−, to 95% O2 and 0.5 mm DETA NONOate. Similar to the observations in HeLa-80 cells and lung epithelial A549 cells, exposure of fibroblasts to the combination of 0.5 mm DETA NONOate and 95% O2induces a synergistic cytotoxicity (data not shown). Fig.4 shows that mutant cells lacking functional NF-κB were hypersensitive to NO/O2 exposure relative to their wild type counterparts. After 2 days of exposure to NO/O2, 46 ± 2.9% of wild type cells died compared with 96 ± 1.2% of the mutant cells (Fig. 4). This difference in cytotoxicity in response to the exposure to NO/O2 is not due to a difference in their growth rate, because mutant cells proliferate at a similar rate as the wild type fibroblasts (data not shown). To test whether the addition of functional p65 can rescue such injury, RelA−/− cells were transfected with a p65 expression construct. This resulted in the rescue of (36 ± 5% after 1 day and 37 ± 4% after 2 days, p < 0.05) from injury caused by exposure to NO/O2. These data indicate that repression of NF-κB increases susceptibility to the cytotoxicity induced by NO/O2. Inactive NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins, the inhibitors of NF-κB. Upon activation, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded (32Baldwin A.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). NF-κB is then released and translocates to the nucleus, regulating gene expression. It has been shown that NO regulates NF-κB activity by increasing the steady-state levels of IκB by enhancing its mRNA stability or reducing its phosphorylation (21Matthews J.R. Botting C.H. Panico M. Morris H.R. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2236-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 22Spiecker M. Peng H.B. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30969-30974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine the status of IκB in cells exposed to NO ± O2, we examined the steady-state levels of IκBα by Western blots. As illustrated in Fig.5, IκBα levels were decreased in cells exposed to NO for 24 h. This reduction was more pronounced in cells exposed to NO/O2 for 24 h. Therefore, a lack of degradation of IκB is clearly not responsible for the reduction of NF-κB activity. We then examined if the reduced activity is due to decreased NF-κB expression. While the protein level of NF-κB p65 subunit was maintained upon exposure to NO/O2 for up to 16 h, a decrease was detected in cells exposed to NO/O2 for 24 h (Fig. 5). However, the decrease was only moderate, compared with the 85 ± 2% reduction of NF-κB activity observed after only 6-h exposure (Fig. 3). As a loading control, the steady-state levels of actin were examined. Fig. 5 shows that there was no substantial changes in the levels of actin upon exposure to NO ± O2, suggesting that the effects of NO ± O2 on IκBα and p65 are specific. These data suggest that the reduction of NF-κB activity upon exposure"
https://openalex.org/W2022247770,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated member of the basic helix-loop-helix period aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator single-minded (PAS) transcription factor family. This receptor has been shown to be important in various aspects of growth and development as demonstrated by AhR-null mice. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic day 11 library for AhR-interacting proteins revealed Nedd8 as a candidate. The interaction was confirmed in a cell-free system and in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation; however, in vitro neddylation assays showed that Nedd8 does not covalently modify AhR. Transfection of Nedd8 into a cell line stably transfected with a dioxin response element linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene demonstrated that Nedd8 amplified ligand-induced transcription. Deletion of the Gly-76 residue in the carboxyl terminus of Nedd8 abolished this effect and prevented AhR-Nedd8 interaction. Nedd8 overexpression also resulted in accumulation of AhR protein in the nucleus, independent of exogenous ligand. These studies demonstrate that the AhR interacts with Nedd8 and suggest that this interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of the receptor, perhaps involving increased nuclear accumulation or retention. Immunohistochemistry performed on embryonic day 11.5 mouse sections indicated Nedd8 and AhR localize to overlapping areas in the heart and spinal ganglia, raising the possibility that this interaction may play a role in organogenesis.

The biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-(p)-dioxin (TCDD) and related environmental contaminants are mediated by AhR and promote carcinogenesis, immune suppression, hepatotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, and impairment of reproductive function (as reviewed by Hankinson (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar)). Unliganded AhR resides in the cytoplasm as part of an inactive multiprotein complex that contains 90-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP90), immunophilin-like protein XAP2 (also known as AhR-associated protein 9 (ARA9) or AhR-interacting protein (AIP)), and p23 (2Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Upon binding ligand, the two HSP90 molecules dissociate, and the receptor translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with another bHLH member protein, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. This protein complex then binds to cognate regulatory elements, referred to as dioxin-responsive elements (DREs), located in the promoter region of a number of known target genes, which include the phase I cytochromes P4501A1,P4501A2, and P4501B1. Activated AhR is exported from the nucleus for degradation in the cytosol by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (4Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36351-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).The molecular events leading to the activation of AhR in the presence of TCDD are generally well understood in a toxicological context. However, AhR signaling pathways in the absence of exogenous ligands remain relatively unknown. The phenotypes of three independent mouse strains with targeted disruption of the AhR strongly suggest a physiological role for this receptor in homeostasis, liver development, and immune system function as well as a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (5Fernandez-Salguero P.

Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The AhR is highly conserved in a number of species including fruit flies, zebrafish, worms, chickens, mice, and humans. The function and regulation of AhR during development are currently being addressed in each of these model systems.In an effort to identify proteins that are a part of the AhR complex and that might modulate its activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with the AhR. Studies of the developmental expression of AhR in C57BL/6 mouse embryos using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemical analysis have shown that AhR expression is not detectable until embryonic day (E) 10 onward, suggesting that this is the first time during development that AhR protein is expressed (7Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Perdew G.H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We therefore used a mouse E11 cDNA library in our yeast two-hybrid screen. We report here the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding Nedd8 (neurally expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8) that interacts with AhR in a ligand-independent manner.Nedd8 is a ubiquitin-like protein, initially identified by Kumaret al. (8Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) in a subtractive cloning approach to identify genes involved in the development of the mammalian central nervous system, that covalently modifies target proteins that reside in the nucleus. Known targets of Nedd8 modulation include p27kip1and all members of the human cullin family of proteins (9Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this study we provide novel evidence showing that Nedd8 enhances the action of the AhR.DISCUSSIONThis study identifies Nedd8 as a novel interacting partner of the AhR. This interaction, initially identified by our yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed both in a cell-free system and in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation and occurred independent of exogenous ligand. Moreover, the demonstration that endogenously expressed Nedd8 and AhR interact in T47D human breast cancer cells clearly establishes this ubiquitin-like protein as a physiologically relevant partner and potential modulator of AhR.Nedd8 is the mammalian functional homologue of Rub1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ligation of Nedd8/Rub1 to proteins is likely to have important growth-regulatory roles in plants, mammals, and presumably many other organisms (18Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nedd8 conjugation involves a pathway that parallels that of ubiquitination, including activation by a distinct E1-like enzyme and conjugation mediated by a dedicated E2 enzyme (20Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Nedd8 modification (neddylation) pathway utilizes a unique activating enzyme complex (UBA3/APP-BP1) and conjugation enzyme (UBC12). In mammalian cells, Nedd8 has been shown to modify a limited subset of cellular proteins in vivo, all of which belong to the cullin family. Human cul-1 is a major component of the SCF complex that is responsible for ubiquitination of a multitude of proteins that regulate various biologically important processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction (21Deshaies R.J. Jacks T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These include Iκβα, β-catenin, and p27 (23Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).One of the speculated functions of AhR is to regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion; therefore, we investigated the effect of overexpression of Nedd8 on the transcriptional activity of AhR. Our data demonstrate Nedd8 overexpression enhanced AhR-mediated transactivation of a DRE-tk-CAT reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner in cells exposed to TCDD. Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed in the absence of TCDD treatment, suggesting that NEDD8 may promote AhR action in the absence of ligand or enhance its action in the presence of ligand endogenous to the culture system. The mechanism by which Nedd8 amplifies the transcriptional activity of AhR remains to be determined. One possibility is that it functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator, bridging the AhR complex with general transcriptional factors and/or histone acetyltransferases. Alternatively, association with Nedd8 could influence the nuclear localization and/or stability of the receptor complex and prolong the action of the AhR complex at the DRE.Interaction of Nedd8 has not been reported previously for any of the nuclear receptors or bHLH/PAS family members. However, UBA3 was recently shown to interact directly with both estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β in a ligand-dependent manner and to suppress ER-mediated transactivation in mammalian cells (25Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Neddylation has been shown to enhance targeting of proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation at the proteasome (26Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fanet al. (25Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) therefore suggest that neddylation may play a role in attenuating ER action by promoting receptor turnover; however, association of ER with Nedd8 was not demonstrated. Two studies have independently shown that AhR degradation is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (4Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36351-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ligand binding enhances down-regulation of AhR and is a typical occurrence for a number of nuclear receptors (28Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 241-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Nedd8 decreased overall levels of AhR protein. Nonetheless, Nedd8 overexpression also increased the accumulation of nuclear AhR. Thus, it is possible that the interaction between AhR and Nedd8 prolongs nuclear localization of the receptor, perhaps at the DRE, and subsequently facilitates receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Nuclear accumulation was also observed in the absence of exogenous ligand and is therefore consistent with the effects of Nedd8 overexpression on CAT reporter gene activity in the absence of TCDD treatment.The results of our in vitro neddylation assay demonstrate that AhR is not covalently modified by Nedd8. Whereas the interaction between these two proteins may be noncovalent, the possibility that the interaction is mediated through an association with a common protein partner that is constitutively present in coupled reticulocyte lysate, yeast, and T47D cells cannot be excluded. Interestingly, it has been suggested that neddylation of Cul-2 may affect the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (29Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is also a bHLH protein family member that heterodimerizes with ARNT. HIF-1α is rapidly degraded in the presence of oxygen, and Maxwell et al. (30Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this degradation can be directed by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). The pVHL complex associates with Cul-2 that is directly modified by Nedd8. The degradation of HIF-1α may serve as an example of how neddylation of an accessory protein, in this case a cullin family member, may affect the transcriptional activity of the HIF-1α·ARNT heterodimeric complex. It remains to be determined whether such accessory proteins exist in the AhR·ARNT heterodimeric complex and whether they include any members of the cullin family. Research into the identification of these proteins is currently under way.Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a mutant clone of Nedd8 lacking the carboxyl-terminal amino acids including Gly-76 indicate that one or more of these residues is critical for interaction with AhR. Overexpression of this mutant also failed to enhance AhR transactivation. Previous studies have shown that Gly-76 plays a key role in the neddylation pathway, forming a thiol-ester linkage with a cysteine residue of UBA3/APP-BP1 (31Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that the absence of Gly-76 in the Nedd8 mutant construct is responsible for the loss of AhR interaction.Involvement of bHLH-containing proteins, such as AhR, ARNT, and HIF-1α, in embryo development is well established (32Lin T.M., Ko, K. Moore R.W. Buchanan D.L. Cooke P.S. Peterson R.E. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 2001; 64: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar).AhR-null mice are resistant to TCDD toxicity but display severe abnormal phenotypes, including liver defects, immune system impairment, and reproductive defects (6Schmidt J.V., Su, G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 33Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that AhR influences normal cell proliferation and differentiation. There is recent evidence suggesting that Nedd8 also plays a regulatory role in cell proliferation and development (34Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).UBA3-deficient mice, generated to investigate the role of Nedd8 in mammals, die in utero at the periimplantation stage (E6−E7). The inner mass cells of these embryos undergo apoptosis, and the trophoblast cells fail to enter the S phase of the endoreduplication cycle, suggesting that Nedd8 is essential for mitotic spindle function and endoreduplicative cell cycle progression (34Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The function of Nedd8 during Caenorhabditis elegansembryogenesis was similarly determined to be important for cytoskeletal regulation during pronuclear migration and cytokinesis (35Kurz T. Pintard L. Willis J.H. Hamill D.R. Gonczy P. Peter M. Bowerman B. Science. 2002; 295: 1294-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In the mouse embryo, the pattern of AhR expression has been shown to be time- and tissue-specific (7Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Perdew G.H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Jain S. Maltepe E., Lu, M.M. Simon C. Bradfield C.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Nedd8 mRNA is expressed at its highest level at embryonic day 11, and transcript levels decrease thereafter as development continues. Characterization of the tissue distribution of Nedd8 suggests that nuclear proteins expressed in heart and skeletal muscle or in early development would be candidate proteins for Nedd8 modification (17Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction of Nedd8 and AhR was identified in screening a mouse day E11 library. At this point of development, AhR is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Nedd8 protein appears to have a more restricted pattern of expression. The expression of AhR in tissues without Nedd8 expression indicates that interaction with Nedd8 is not essential for the actions of this transcription factor. However, the overlap of expression in the heart and spinal ganglia at E10−E12 suggests that the interaction of these two proteins may play an important role in cardiogenesis and neural development.At present, the function of the AhR and Nedd8 interaction during development is not clear. Based on our data, we propose that Nedd8 regulates the activation of AhR and AhR-mediated signal transduction by enhancing accumulation of the receptor in the cell nucleus. Additionally, by acting to facilitate ubiquitination, this association could assist in receptor turnover. Thus the interaction with Nedd8 could represent a developmentally important, tissue-specific posttranslational modification of the AhR. Moreover, this interaction may be involved in modulating the toxicological effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additional studies of the functional interaction of Nedd8 with AhR should enhance our understanding of AhR functionin vivo.

The biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-(p)-dioxin (TCDD) and related environmental contaminants are mediated by AhR and promote carcinogenesis, immune suppression, hepatotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, and impairment of reproductive function (as reviewed by Hankinson (1Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar)). Unliganded AhR resides in the cytoplasm as part of an inactive multiprotein complex that contains 90-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP90), immunophilin-like protein XAP2 (also known as AhR-associated protein 9 (ARA9) or AhR-interacting protein (AIP)), and p23 (2Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Upon binding ligand, the two HSP90 molecules dissociate, and the receptor translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with another bHLH member protein, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. This protein complex then binds to cognate regulatory elements, referred to as dioxin-responsive elements (DREs), located in the promoter region of a number of known target genes, which include the phase I cytochromes P4501A1,P4501A2, and P4501B1. Activated AhR is exported from the nucleus for degradation in the cytosol by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (4Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36351-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The molecular events leading to the activation of AhR in the presence of TCDD are generally well understood in a toxicological context. However, AhR signaling pathways in the absence of exogenous ligands remain relatively unknown. The phenotypes of three independent mouse strains with targeted disruption of the AhR strongly suggest a physiological role for this receptor in homeostasis, liver development, and immune system function as well as a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (5Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 6Schmidt J.V., Su, G.H.

The AhR is highly conserved in a number of species including fruit flies, zebrafish, worms, chickens, mice, and humans. The function and regulation of AhR during development are currently being addressed in each of these model systems.

We report here the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding Nedd8 (neurally expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8) that interacts with AhR in a ligand-independent manner. Nedd8 is a ubiquitin-like protein, initially identified by Kumaret al. (8Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Known targets of Nedd8 modulation include p27kip1and all members of the human cullin family of proteins (9Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this study we provide novel evidence showing that Nedd8 enhances the action of the AhR. DISCUSSIONThis study identifies Nedd8 as a novel interacting partner of the AhR. This interaction, initially identified by our yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed both in a cell-free system and in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation and occurred independent of exogenous ligand. Moreover, the demonstration that endogenously expressed Nedd8 and AhR interact in T47D human breast cancer cells clearly establishes this ubiquitin-like protein as a physiologically relevant partner and potential modulator of AhR.Nedd8 is the mammalian functional homologue of Rub1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ligation of Nedd8/Rub1 to proteins is likely to have important growth-regulatory roles in plants, mammals, and presumably many other organisms (18Hochstrasser M.

Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).One of the speculated functions of AhR is to regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion; therefore, we investigated the effect of overexpression of Nedd8 on the transcriptional activity of AhR. Our data demonstrate Nedd8 overexpression enhanced AhR-mediated transactivation of a DRE-tk-CAT reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner in cells exposed to TCDD. Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed in the absence of TCDD treatment, suggesting that NEDD8 may promote AhR action in the absence of ligand or enhance its action in the presence of ligand endogenous to the culture system. The mechanism by which Nedd8 amplifies the transcriptional activity of AhR remains to be determined. One possibility is that it functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator, bridging the AhR complex with general transcriptional factors and/or histone acetyltransferases. Alternatively, association with Nedd8 could influence the nuclear localization and/or stability of the receptor complex and prolong the action of the AhR complex at the DRE.Interaction of Nedd8 has not been reported previously for any of the nuclear receptors or bHLH/PAS family members. However, UBA3 was recently shown to interact directly with both estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β in a ligand-dependent manner and to suppress ER-mediated transactivation in mammalian cells (25Fan M.

Neddylation has been shown to enhance targeting of proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation at the proteasome (26Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fanet al. (25Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M.

Two studies have independently shown that AhR degradation is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (4Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol.

Ligand binding enhances down-regulation of AhR and is a typical occurrence for a number of nuclear receptors (28Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 241-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Nedd8 decreased overall levels of AhR protein. Nonetheless, Nedd8 overexpression also increased the accumulation of nuclear AhR. Thus, it is possible that the interaction between AhR and Nedd8 prolongs nuclear localization of the receptor, perhaps at the DRE, and subsequently facilitates receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Nuclear accumulation was also observed in the absence of exogenous ligand and is therefore consistent with the effects of Nedd8 overexpression on CAT reporter gene activity in the absence of TCDD treatment.The results of our in vitro neddylation assay demonstrate that AhR is not covalently modified by Nedd8. Whereas the interaction between these two proteins may be noncovalent, the possibility that the interaction is mediated through an association with a common protein partner that is constitutively present in coupled reticulocyte lysate, yeast, and T47D cells cannot be excluded. Interestingly, it has been suggested that neddylation of Cul-2 may affect the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (29Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is also a bHLH protein family member that heterodimerizes with ARNT. HIF-1α is rapidly degraded in the presence of oxygen, and Maxwell et al. (30Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this degradation can be directed by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). The pVHL complex associates with Cul-2 that is directly modified by Nedd8. The degradation of HIF-1α may serve as an example of how neddylation of an accessory protein, in this case a cullin family member, may affect the transcriptional activity of the HIF-1α·ARNT heterodimeric complex. It remains to be determined whether such accessory proteins exist in the AhR·ARNT heterodimeric complex and whether they include any members of the cullin family. Research into the identification of these proteins is currently under way.Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a mutant clone of Nedd8 lacking the carboxyl-terminal amino acids including Gly-76 indicate that one or more of these residues is critical for interaction with AhR. Overexpression of this mutant also failed to enhance AhR transactivation. Previous studies have shown that Gly-76 plays a key role in the neddylation pathway, forming a thiol-ester linkage with a cysteine residue of UBA3/APP-BP1 (31Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that the absence of Gly-76 in the Nedd8 mutant construct is responsible for the loss of AhR interaction.Involvement of bHLH-containing proteins, such as AhR, ARNT, and HIF-1α, in embryo development is well established (32Lin T.M., Ko, K.

The inner mass cells of these embryos undergo apoptosis, and the trophoblast cells fail to enter the S phase of the endoreduplication cycle, suggesting that Nedd8 is essential for mitotic spindle function and endoreduplicative cell cycle progression (34Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The function of Nedd8 during Caenorhabditis elegansembryogenesis was similarly determined to be important for cytoskeletal regulation during pronuclear migration and cytokinesis (35Kurz T. Pintard L. Willis J.H. Hamill D.R. Gonczy P. Peter M. Bowerman B. Science. 2002; 295: 1294-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In the mouse embryo, the pattern of AhR expression has been shown to be time- and tissue-specific (7Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Perdew G.H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Jain S. Maltepe E., Lu, M.M. Simon C. Bradfield C.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Nedd8 mRNA is expressed at its highest level at embryonic day 11, and transcript levels decrease thereafter as development continues. Characterization of the tissue distribution of Nedd8 suggests that nuclear proteins expressed in heart and skeletal muscle or in early development would be candidate proteins for Nedd8 modification (17Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction of Nedd8 and AhR was identified in screening a mouse day E11 library. At this point of development, AhR is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Nedd8 protein appears to have a more restricted pattern of expression. The expression of AhR in tissues without Nedd8 expression indicates that interaction with Nedd8 is not essential for the actions of this transcription factor. However, the overlap of expression in the heart and spinal ganglia at E10−E12 suggests that the interaction of these two proteins may play an important role in cardiogenesis and neural development.At present, the function of the AhR and Nedd8 interaction during development is not clear. Based on our data, we propose that Nedd8 regulates the activation of AhR and AhR-mediated signal transduction by enhancing accumulation of the receptor in the cell nucleus. Additionally, by acting to facilitate ubiquitination, this association could assist in receptor turnover. Thus the interaction with Nedd8 could represent a developmentally important, tissue-specific posttranslational modification of the AhR. Moreover, this interaction may be involved in modulating the toxicological effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additional studies of the functional interaction of Nedd8 with AhR should enhance our understanding of AhR functionin vivo. This study identifies Nedd8 as a novel interacting partner of the AhR. This interaction, initially identified by our yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed both in a cell-free system and in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation and occurred independent of exogenous ligand. Moreover, the demonstration that endogenously expressed Nedd8 and AhR interact in T47D human breast cancer cells clearly establishes this ubiquitin-like protein as a physiologically relevant partner and potential modulator of AhR. Nedd8 is the mammalian functional homologue of Rub1 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ligation of Nedd8/Rub1 to proteins is likely to have important growth-regulatory roles in plants, mammals, and presumably many other organisms (18Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nedd8 conjugation involves a pathway that parallels that of ubiquitination, including activation by a distinct E1-like enzyme and conjugation mediated by a dedicated E2 enzyme (20Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Nedd8 modification (neddylation) pathway utilizes a unique activating enzyme complex (UBA3/APP-BP1) and conjugation enzyme (UBC12). In mammalian cells, Nedd8 has been shown to modify a limited subset of cellular proteins in vivo, all of which belong to the cullin family. Human cul-1 is a major component of the SCF complex that is responsible for ubiquitination of a multitude of proteins that regulate various biologically important processes such as cell cycle progression and signal transduction (21Deshaies R.J. Jacks T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 705-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These include Iκβα, β-catenin, and p27 (23Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). One of the speculated functions of AhR is to regulate gene expression in a ligand-dependent fashion; therefore, we investigated the effect of overexpression of Nedd8 on the transcriptional activity of AhR. Our data demonstrate Nedd8 overexpression enhanced AhR-mediated transactivation of a DRE-tk-CAT reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner in cells exposed to TCDD. Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed in the absence of TCDD treatment, suggesting that NEDD8 may promote AhR action in the absence of ligand or enhance its action in the presence of ligand endogenous to the culture system. The mechanism by which Nedd8 amplifies the transcriptional activity of AhR remains to be determined. One possibility is that it functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator, bridging the AhR complex with general transcriptional factors and/or histone acetyltransferases. Alternatively, association with Nedd8 could influence the nuclear localization and/or stability of the receptor complex and prolong the action of the AhR complex at the DRE. Interaction of Nedd8 has not been reported previously for any of the nuclear receptors or bHLH/PAS family members. However, UBA3 was recently shown to interact directly with both estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β in a ligand-dependent manner and to suppress ER-mediated transactivation in mammalian cells (25Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Neddylation has been shown to enhance targeting of proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation at the proteasome (26Kamitani T. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46655-46660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fanet al. (25Fan M. Long X. Bailey J.A. Reed C.A. Osborne E. Gize E.A. Kirk E.A. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) therefore suggest that neddylation may play a role in attenuating ER action by promoting receptor turnover; however, association of ER with Nedd8 was not demonstrated. Two studies have independently shown that AhR degradation is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (4Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36351-36356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ligand binding enhances down-regulation of AhR and is a typical occurrence for a number of nuclear receptors (28Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 241-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Nedd8 decreased overall levels of AhR protein. Nonetheless, Nedd8 overexpression also increased the accumulation of nuclear AhR. Thus, it is possible that the interaction between AhR and Nedd8 prolongs nuclear localization of the receptor, perhaps at the DRE, and subsequently facilitates receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Nuclear accumulation was also observed in the absence of exogenous ligand and is therefore consistent with the effects of Nedd8 overexpression on CAT reporter gene activity in the absence of TCDD treatment. The results of our in vitro neddylation assay demonstrate that AhR is not covalently modified by Nedd8. Whereas the interaction between these two proteins may be noncovalent, the possibility that the interaction is mediated through an association with a common protein partner that is constitutively present in coupled reticulocyte lysate, yeast, and T47D cells cannot be excluded. Interestingly, it has been suggested that neddylation of Cul-2 may affect the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (29Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is also a bHLH protein family member that heterodimerizes with ARNT. HIF-1α is rapidly degraded in the presence of oxygen, and Maxwell et al. (30Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar) demonstrated that this degradation can be directed by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). The pVHL complex associates with Cul-2 that is directly modified by Nedd8. The degradation of HIF-1α may serve as an example of how neddylation of an accessory protein, in this case a cullin family member, may affect the transcriptional activity of the HIF-1α·ARNT heterodimeric complex. It remains to be determined whether such accessory proteins exist in the AhR·ARNT heterodimeric complex and whether they include any members of the cullin family. Research into the identification of these proteins is currently under way. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a mutant clone of Nedd8 lacking the carboxyl-terminal amino acids including Gly-76 indicate that one or more of these residues is critical for interaction with AhR. Overexpression of this mutant also failed to enhance AhR transactivation. Previous studies have shown that Gly-76 plays a key role in the neddylation pathway, forming a thiol-ester linkage with a cysteine residue of UBA3/APP-BP1 (31Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that the absence of Gly-76 in the Nedd8 mutant construct is responsible for the loss of AhR interaction. Involvement of bHLH-containing proteins, such as AhR, ARNT, and HIF-1α, in embryo development is well established (32Lin T.M., Ko, K. Moore R.W. Buchanan D.L. Cooke P.S. Peterson R.E. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 2001; 64: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar).AhR-null mice are resistant to TCDD toxicity but display severe abnormal phenotypes, including liver defects, immune system impairment, and reproductive defects (6Schmidt J.V., Su, G.H.

Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that AhR influences normal cell proliferation and differentiation. There is recent evidence suggesting that Nedd8 also plays a regulatory role in cell proliferation and development (34Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J.

Despite the immunological relevance of the LIGHT protein, little knowledge is available as to how light gene expression is regulated. In T-lymphocytes, most LIGHT surface expression and transcript accumulation occurs after T cell activation. In this study, we have shown that these events are blocked at the transcriptional level by cyclosporin A, an immuno-suppressive drug. Besides, we identified a role for Ca2+-signaling pathways and NFAT transcription factors in T cell activation-induced LIGHT expression. To further investigate this process, we have identified, cloned, and characterized a 2.1-kilobase 5′-flanking DNA genomic fragment from the human light gene. We have shown the transcriptional activity of the herein-identified minimal 5′ regulatory region of human light gene parallels the endogenous expression of light in T cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that induced LIGHT promoter activity can be equally blocked by cyclosporin A treatment or dominant negative NFAT overexpression and further identified by site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility supershift analysis of a NFAT transcription factor binding site within the human light minimal promoter. Finally, Sp1 and Ets1 binding sites were identified and shown to regulate light basal promoter activity. Thus, the present study establishes a molecular basis to further understand the mechanisms governing human light gene expression and, consequently, could potentially lead to novel therapeutic manipulations that control the signaling cascade, resulting in LIGHT production in conditions characterized by immunopathologic activation of T cells.

Recently, the mouselight cDNA (18Misawa K. Nosaka T. Kojima T. Hirai M. Kitamura T. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 89: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the genomic organization of the human light gene (17Granger S.W. Butrovich K.D. Houshmand P. Edwards W.R. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5122-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been partially elucidated, but the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) were not characterized. In T-lymphocyte, most LIGHT surface expression and transcript accumulation occurs after T cell activation (6Morel Y. Schiano D.C.J. Harrop J. Deen K.C. Holmes S.D. Wattam T.A. Khandekar S.S.

In this report, we show that these events are blocked at the transcriptional level by cyclosporin A (CsA), an immuno-suppressive drug acting on the phosphatase calcineurin. We identified a role for Ca2+-signaling pathways and NFAT transcription factors in T cell activation-induced light transcription and a role for both Ets and Sp1 families of transcription factors in basal constitutive expression of light in T cells. The Jurkat T cell line (JA16 clone (19Bagnasco M. Nunes J. Lopez M. Cerdan C. Pierres A. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were isolated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (20Costello R. Cerdan C. Pavon C. Brailly H. Hurpin C. Mawas C. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). T-lymphocytes were isolated as the CD2-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cell population, corresponding to cells that adhere to sheep erythrocytes in the E-rosetting technique but fail to adhere to plastic dishes after overnight incubation in medium and 30% fetal calf serum. T-lymphocytes and the Jurkat T cell line were stimulated with 1 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml PMA (Sigma), respectively, and/or 1 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml ionomycin (Calbiochem), respectively, either in the presence or absence of CsA at 5–100 ng/ml (Calbiochem). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 289 (kindly gift by Alessandro Moretta) recognizes the CD3ε chain of the T cell receptor complex and was immobilized on plastic culture dishes for TCR stimulation. The expression of light mRNA and protein was analyzed by RT-PCR and cyto-fluorometry, respectively, using the previously described primers pair and anti-LIGHT 2C8 monoclonal antibody (6Morel Y. Schiano D.C.J. Harrop J. Deen K.C. Holmes S.D. Wattam T.A. Khandekar S.S. Truneh A. Sweet R.W. Gastaut J.A. Olive D. Costello R.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4397-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The transcription start site of the human lightgene was mapped in T-lymphocytes by using the 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends, version 2.0 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, total RNA from T-lymphocytes stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 16 h was reversed-transcribed using the primer GSP1. PCR was performed on dC tailed with the 5′-RACE-abridged anchor primer associated with GSP2. The nested amplification was performed with the 5′-RACE-abridged universal amplification and GSP3 primers. The three GSP1, -2, and -3 primer sequences are shown in Fig.1. The amplified products were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The genomic sequence (−2186pb/+1) lying upstream to the human lightgene was isolated by PCR using the following primers: light/sense 5′-GAGTCAAGACGCAGATGAGCAGGGGGAGCC-3′ and light/antisense 5′-CCGAAGCTTGCCCAAGGTGTCTGGAGCAGGGCTGACACGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector. The fragments generated by enzymatic restrictions of pGEM-T/pLIGHT(2148) with BglII,NdeI, and KpnI, respectively, for the 5′ site andHindIII for the 3′ site were cloned into the reporter vector pGL2-Basic (Promega); these reporter constructs are called pLIGHT(2148)-luc, pLIGHT(1033)-luc, and pLIGHT(175)-luc, respectively. The primers used for the other light promoter constructs were: LIGHT(441)-luc, 5′-CTACTCGAGCTTGTCTCTCTGGCTCCACCAG-3′; LIGHT(124)-luc, 5′-CTACTCGAGCTCTAAAGGCGGCCCACGGGTG-3′, and LIGHT(91)-luc, 5′-CTACTCGAGCGTGCACAGCCCAGGAGTGTTGAG-3′ and the 3′ primer described above. The XhoI and HindIII sites in these primers are underlined. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites in pGL2Basic. Whole nucleotide sequences from these constructs were confirmed by sequencing. pLIGHT(441)-luc and pLIGHT(175)-luc were used as templates for mutagenesis performed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The primers used are: M1, 5′-GGCTCCACCAGAAGACTCGCAGGGACCCTTCTTGC-3′; M2, 5′-GAAGCATCCAAGAAGCTCAAGCTGGGGGCTCCC-3′; M3, 5′-CATTTTCAGAAGCCTCTCTCAAGTGTGAGAGTCTG-3′; M4, 5′-GCGGCGGGTACCGGACTCAGAGGAGGGTGAGTG-3′; M5, 5′-GAGCAATTTCGGTTGAGTCTGAGGTTGAAGGACCC-3′; Sp1mut, 5′-GAGGAGGGTGAGTGGTTGAAGTTGTGTTGCTGAACCCCAGCTC-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The pDN-NFAT expression construct was previously described (21Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The calcineurin phosphatase (CN) cDNA (22Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar) was subcloned from pBJ5 into the BamHI-digested BDNA4 expression vector (23Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Castellano R. Collette Y. Auphan N. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 107Jurkat T cells were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 250 V using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with 25 μg of pGL2/basic or the variouslight promoter-driven luciferase firefly constructs (pLIGHT-luc) together with 5 μg of thymidine kinase-luciferaseRenilla plasmid. The cells were incubated for 2 h, then left unstimulated or stimulated for 16 h as previously described (23Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Castellano R. Collette Y. Auphan N. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed to determine the luciferase activity by using the dual luciferase reporter assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and read using a luminometer (Dynex). The transfection efficiency was normalized to luciferase Renilla activity and corrected for protein content as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The reported values represent the average of three independent transfections, with standard deviation as error bars. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells were prepared as previously described (24Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed with 10 μg of nuclear protein extract or 0.25–1 ng of recombinant protein in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μg of DNase-free bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (AmershamBiosciences) as nonspecific DNA competitor, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.3, and 10% (V/V) glycerol. The binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 10,000–24,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction mixture was loaded directly onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at room temperature in 1× TGE buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used were as follows: for the wild-type NFAT binding site in the light promoter (M3wt), 5′-CAGAAGCCTCTGGAAAGTGTGAGAGTC-3′, and its mutated homologue (M3mut), 5′-CAGAAGCCTCTCTCAAGTGTGAGAGTC-3′; for the control NFAT binding site in the FasL promoter (FasLwt), 5′-TAGCTATGGAAACTCTATA-3′; for the oligonucleotide containing the Ets binding site (M4wt), 5′-GCGGGTACCGGAAGAAGAGGAGGGTG-3′ and its mutated version (M4mut), 5′-GCGGGTACCGGACTCAGAGGAGGGTG-3′; finally, for the oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 binding site (Sp1wt), 5′-GAGTGGGGGAAGGGGTGGGGCTGAA-3′, and its mutated version (M4mut), 5′-GAGTGGTTGAAGTTGTGTTGCTGAA-3′, and the Sp1 consensus 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (Promega). For supershift assays, 1 μl of monoclonal antibodies against NFATc (sc-7294), NFATp (sc-7295), or CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein; sc-271) as a negative control or 1 μl of polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 (sc-059x), Sp2 (sc-643x), Sp3 (sc-644x), or Sp4 (sc-645x) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding reaction mixture at the end of the binding reaction for an additional 30 min of incubation at room temperature before electrophoresis. For blocking assays, antibodies against Ets-1 (sc-350) and Ets-2 (sc-351) or MEF-2 (sc-313x) as a negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added at the beginning of the binding reaction before the nuclear extracts. When indicated, a 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide (Ets, 5′-tcgggctcgagataaacaggaagtggtctcgg-3′) or heterologous oligonucleotide (Ebox, 5′-AGCTTCAGACCACGTGGTCGGG-3′ or Oct, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′) oligonucleotide was used as competitor. The induction oflight in T cells requires cellular activation by the TCR/CD3 (8Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.L., Yu, G.L., Ni, J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.W., Lu, J. Tan J. Ugustus M. Carter K. Rojas L. Zhu F.

A common feature to ionomycin- and CD3-initiated signal transduction is the increase of [Ca2+]i followed by the nuclear translocation of the NFAT transcription factors. The CsA immuno-suppressive drug blocks induced transcription of several cytokines (for review, see Ref. 25Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) by inhibiting the phosphatase CN, a second messenger protein activated by [Ca2+]i and controlling the nuclear translocation of NFAT. Moreover, several TNS SF members such as TNFα, FasL, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and CD40L are regulated by NFAT and inhibited by CsA (26Goldfeld A.E. Tsai E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To get insight into the mechanisms of light gene expression, we performed experiments with CsA. As shown in Fig.1, panels A and B, LIGHT was absent from the cell surface of activated lymphocytes incubated in the presence of CsA. To specify whether the effect of CsA on expression was transcriptional, we also analyzed thelight RNA expression. As shown in panel C, a faint signal was detected in unstimulated T-lymphocytes at 30 and 33 PCR cycles. In contrast, light messenger was detected at 27 PCR cycles in PMA plus ionomycin-stimulated lymphocytes with a quantitatively more significant signal. In contrast, the presence of CsA during T cell stimulation significantly decreased lightRNA expression, which remained undetectable at 27 PCR cycles and produced a faint signal at 30 PCR cycles. To normalize both quantity and quality of the RT products, we used the β-actin housekeeping gene as a control. Results from these experiments demonstrate that the induction of light transcription by PMA plus ionomycin is prevented by CsA and hint to the likely involvement of the NFAT family of transcription factors. To investigate the regulation by CsA of the LIGHT transcription, we identified the promoter region in the human light gene by multiple BLAST analysis between human light cDNA sequence (accession number NM_003807) compared with a genomic sequence data base. Wholelight cDNA sequences matched the chromosome 19p13.3 (accession number NT_0111458.12) at nt 366054–371642 (including intron sequences) with 100% identity. These results were confirmed by Grangeret al. (17Granger S.W. Butrovich K.D. Houshmand P. Edwards W.R. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5122-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) during the preparation of this manuscript. To identify the transcription initiation site of humanlight, we used a 5′-RACE approach. Using downstream oligonucleotide sequences present in the first exon, a single PCR product was amplified. Sequence analysis revealed that the major start site maps 91 bp upstream to the ATG. To confirm this result, RT-PCR reactions were performed with two 5′ primers located near the identified transcription start site (Primers A andB, see Fig. 2 A) and the same 3′ primer within exon 1 (primer GSP2). Using T cell-derived reverse-transcribed mRNA as a template, the B/GSP2 but not the A/GSP2 primer pairs allowed amplification of the expected 128-bp fragments (Fig. 2 B), thereby confirming the preferential usage of the transcription initiation start site located 91 bp upstream to the ATG. Next, homologies to known cis-regulatory elements were determined using the MatInspector (Genomatix Software, Munich, Germany) and TESS (Transcription Element Search System, CBIL, US) programs. A TATA motif (nt −116 to −121) and GC-rich domains were identified close to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the proximal promoter region of light resembles other known cytokine gene promoters, particularly promoters controlling TNFSF gene products, in that it possesses several potential binding sites for TCR-inducible transcription factors such as NFAT (Fig.3 A).Figure 3light promoter/reporter deletional analysis. A, nucleotide sequence of the potential promoter and of the first exon of the human light gene (AF542509). The ATG site is boldface (was assigned the position nucleotide +1). Three gene-specific primers (GSP1, -2, and -3) used in 5′-RACE procedure and mapping of the 5′ end of lightmRNA are underlined. Two primers (A and B) used in PCR to map the transcription start site are underlined (see “Results”). The first nucleotide of the 5′-RACE product is indicated by an arrow. Putative cis-acting motifs areunderlined or boxed. The constructs were generated by cloning progressively 5′-truncated human lightpromoter fragments into the pGL2/basic luciferase vector.Negative numbers denote bp distances from translational start codon (panel B). Jurkat cells were transiently cotransfected with these reporter constructs and pRL-TK to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were either left unstimulated (panel C) or stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin (panel D) for 16 h. RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate promoter activity of the 5′-UTR regions of the humanlight gene, the 2148 bp of genomic DNA immediately 5′ to the translational start site were cloned in pGL2/Basic. Promoter activity of the construct pLIGHT(2148)-luc was assayed by measuring firefly luciferase activity after transient transfection into the JA16 Jurkat T cell line, which expresses light mRNA (Fig.2 C) and protein (data not shown) after T-cell activation. Similarly, treatment of Jurkat T cells with PMA plus ionomycin or CD3-immobilized antibody significantly enhanced the exogenous luciferase activity by ∼200- and 20-fold for PMA plus ionomycin and CD3, respectively (Fig. 2 D). To map the minimal promoter region in the light gene required for initiation and induction of gene transcription, luciferase reporter constructs containing progressive deletions of the 2148-bp genomic DNA fragment were generated (Fig. 3 B). Each construct as well as the control vector pGL2/Basic were transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells and assayed for reporter activity. Our results show that the 2148-bp fragment induces a large increase in basal luciferase activity and that deletions of DNA regions upstream to nt −175 (relative to the ATG) did not significantly decrease basal luciferase expression as compared with the full-length 2148-bp fragment (Fig. 3 C). However, deletion of an additional 53 bp (from nt −175 to −122) reduced reporter activity to a level similar to that obtained with the promoterless luciferase construct (pGL2/Basic) (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that the cis-regulatory elements required for the basal transcription of the light gene are located in a 175-bp region upstream to the ATG and containing the transcription initiatio"

This study was undertaken to identify additional RNA species that bind p190RhoGEF and could affect interactions of the exchange factor with NF-L transcripts. The C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF, containing the RNA-binding site, was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and was used as an affinity probe to isolate interactive RNAs in rat brain extracts. As expected, NF-L mRNA was identified as an RNA specie eluted from the affinity column. In addition, BC1 RNA was also found enriched in the bound RNA fraction. BC1 is a 152-nucleotide RNA that is highly expressed but untranslated in differentiated neurons. We show that BC1 and NF-L mRNA bind to a similar site in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF, and their bindings to p190RhoGEF are readily cross-competed. Moreover, we identify a novel binding site in BC1 to account for its interaction with p190RhoGEF. The findings suggest a novel role of BC1 in differentiated neurons involving RNA-protein interactions of p190RhoGEF.

Crawford T.O., Xu, Z. Hsieh S.T. Griffin J.W. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A more severe form of motor neuron degeneration occurs in mice expressing low levels of an NF-L transgene with a leucine-to-proline mutation in the rod domain and a c-Myc tag appended to the C-terminal end of the protein (4Lee M.K. Marszalek J.R. Cleveland D.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 975-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A severe form of motor neuron degeneration also occurs from low level expression of an NF-L transgene lacking the point mutation but with the c-Myc tag at the end of the coding region (5Canete-Soler R. Silberg D.G. Gershon M.D. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1273-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter finding raised the possibility that neuropathic effects result from expression of a mutant mRNA by the transgene. This interpretation is based on the location of the c-Myc tag in a major destabilizing element in NF-L mRNA and the ability of the c-Myc insert to stabilize the transcript as well as alter the binding of cognate binding factors in brain extracts to the NF-L mRNA destabilizing element by gel-shift and cross-linking assays (5Canete-Soler R. Silberg D.G. Gershon M.D. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1273-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, motor neuron degeneration was reproduced in transgenic mice when the destabilizing element of NF-L mRNA was placed in the 3′-untranslated region of an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter transgene (6Nie Z., Wu, J. Zhai J. Hong L., Ge, W. Schlaepfer W.W. Canete-Soler R. J.

More recently, we have shown that overexpression of p190RhoGEF protects Neuro-2a cells from stress-induced apoptosis, possibly by interacting in the JIP-1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. 2R. Cañete-Soler, unpublished observations. Moreover, p190RhoGEF is a neuronal enriched exchange factor that is up-regulated during postnatal development and highly expressed in large differentiated neurons, including motor neurons in mouse spinal cord.2 A similar expression profile is exhibited by NFs (11Schlaepfer W.W.

The involvement of the NF-L-destabilizing element in RNA-mediated motor neuron degeneration raised the possibility that additional RNA-protein interactions of the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF may be instrumental in modulating RNA-mediated neuropathic effects. To pursue this line of study, the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF (p190RhoGEF-C) containing the RNA-binding site was fused to GST protein and used as affinity matrix for identifying additional interactive RNA species in soluble brain extracts. To our surprise, we identified BC1 as an RNA with high affinity for the RNA-binding site in p190RhoGEF. BC1 is an untranslated 152-nucleotide polymerase III transcript that is up-regulated during postnatal development (16McKinnon R.D. Danielson P. Brow M.A. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2148-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and highly expressed in large neurons of rat brain and spinal cord (17DeChiara T.M. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of BC1 in neuronal function is not yet fully defined, but the favored view is that BC1 serves as a molecular scaffold for regulating transport and translation of neuronal mRNAs at dendritic sites (19Tiedge H. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Weinstock P.H. Arancio O. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S.

The binding of BC1 and NF-L mRNA to the same binding site in p190RhoGEF, as reported herein, suggests that BC1 may play a role in RNA-protein interactions of p190RhoGEF and in modulating the effects of the exchange factor in large differentiated neurons. A cDNA-encoding sequence between amino acids (aa) 1276–1582 in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF was fused in-frame to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences) and is referred to as GST/p190RhoGEF-C. The same cDNA was cloned into pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for HA tagging and was modified by PCR to generate N- and C-terminal truncations. All cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST/p190RhoGEF-C and unfused GST proteins (100 μg) were bound to 40-μl glutathione-Sepharose beads and equilibrated with RNA-binding buffer (RBB) containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. High speed supernatant (200 μl) of rat brain homogenate was precleared by passage through an unfused GST column and then applied to a column of immobilized GST fusion proteins. The column was washed with RNA-binding buffer containing heparin (1 mg/ml), and RNA was recovered by boiling the beads in 0.1% SDS. Supernatants were phenol/chloroform-extracted, and RNAs were ethanol-precipitated. cDNA libraries were constructed from total RNA (50 ng) using the SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech). Individual phage plaques were amplified, λ DNAs extracted, and cDNAs sequenced. RNA polymerase templates for full-length and truncated BC1 probes were prepared as PCR products by incorporating T7 promoter sequence into the upstream primer. A probe to the 68-nucleotide destabilizing element in NF-L (NF68) was obtained from a linearized pSK+ plasmid (7Canete-Soler R., Wu, J. Zhai J. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Probes were uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP and fractionated by electrophoresis, and gel-excised probes were diluted in RBB to 5 × 104cpm/μl immediately prior to use. Fused or unfused GST proteins or BSA (150 pmol) were spotted onto nylon membrane, preincubated in hybridization buffer (1 m Denhardt's, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml heparin) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated for 1 h following the addition of32P-labeled probes (5 × 104 cpm/ml). Membranes were washed extensively with hybridization buffer and subjected to autoradiography. Gel-shift studies were conducted by incubating 10 μg of protein and 5 × 104 cpm/ml radioactive probe in 20 μl of RBB at room temperature for 10 min, then adding 2 μl of RNase T1 (2 units/μl), and incubating for an additional 10 min. Five μl of heparin (50 mg/ml in 50% glycerol) was added, and the total sample was loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 100 V in 0.5× TBE. Neuro-2a cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell transfections were performed using the FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected N2a cells in 100-mm cell culture plates were detached and collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and suspended in 0.6 ml of cell lysis buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) of Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma), dispersed by centrifugation in a QIA shredder Mini column (Qiagen). Extracts were mixed with 20 μl of anti-HA antibody-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C, and beads were precipitated by centrifugation, washed 4 times with PBS, suspended in 20 μl of 0.1% SDS, and boiled for 3 min to release bound components. The supernatant was then used as a template for RT-PCR detection of BC1 RNA. GST fusion proteins (10 μg) were electrophoresed in 8% SDS-PAGE gel and electroblotted to Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Life Science). Membranes were preincubated with Blotto A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% milk) on shaker at 4 °C overnight and incubated with 5 × 104 cpm/ml probe in hybridization buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were extensively washed with hybridization buffer, and dried membranes were subjected to overnight exposure for autoradiography. The C terminus of p190RhoGEF (p190 RhoGEF-C) was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library by virtue of its binding to a 68-nucleotide RNA probe (NF68) comprising a destabilizing element in mouse NF-L mRNA (7Canete-Soler R., Wu, J. Zhai J. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To identify additional RNA targets of p190RhoGEF-C, the cDNA was fused to GST, and fusion protein was used as an affinity matrix to screen a high speed supernatant fraction of rat brain. Bound RNAs were recovered from the beads, reverse-transcribed into cDNAs, and the cDNAs cloned and sequenced. The resulting cDNAs not only included NF-L but also revealed more frequent recovery of short elements matching the sequence of BC1. The structure and partial sequence of BC1 is shown in Fig. 1. To verify the binding of BC1 to p190RhoGEF-C, GST/p190RhoGEF-C (150 pmol) was spotted on nylon membrane, along with equimolar amounts of unfused GST protein (GST) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), and reacted with uniformly labeled full-length BC1 probe (Fig.2). BC1 bound to p190RhoGEF-C but not to BSA or to unfused GST protein. A similar-sized RNA probe to sequence adjoining the T7-binding site in pSK+ (SK+) did not bind to GST/p190RhoGEF-C, GST, or BSA. Moreover, binding of BC1 was more than 10-fold greater than binding of NF68 to p190RhoGEF-C by comparing the respective amounts of bound radioactivities. Similar disparity in binding affinities were observed using probe to the ID sequence of BC1 (data not shown), suggesting that the binding site on BC1 was situated within the ID region of BC1 RNA (see below). Gel retardation assays were undertaken to assess the abilities of BC1 and NF68 probes to alter the electrophoretic migration of GST/p190RhoGEF. Fig. 3 shows that incubation of GST/p190RhoGEF-C with 32P-labeled NF68 or BC1 probes generates similar radioactive bands (arrow). The radioactive gel-retarded band formed with NF68 (3rd lane) was competed by 100-fold excesses of unlabeled NF68 (4th lane) or unlabeled BC1 (5th lane) but not by an unlabeled nonspecific SK+ probe (data not shown). Likewise, the gel-retarded band formed with BC1 (6th lane) was competed by 100-fold excesses of unlabeled NF68 (7th lane) or unlabeled BC1 (8th lane) but not by an unlabeled SK+ probe (data not shown). Incubation of GST/p190RhoGEF with 32P-labeled SK+ probe did not generate a gel-retarded band (9th lane). Lysates from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA-tagged p190RhoGEF-C protein or pHM6 vector alone were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and solubilized by boiling in 0.1% SDS. RT-PCR assays were conducted on the solubilized fractions to assess the presence of BC1 RNA in the respective immunoprecipitates. Fig. 4shows that BC1 RNA (arrow) was recovered from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA-tagged p190RhoGEF-C (lane 1) but not from Neuro-2a cells transfected with the empty pHM6 vector (lane 2). The size of the BC1 RT-PCR fragment was 175 bp, including T7 promoter sequence in upstream primer, and had the appropriate electrophoretic migration when compared with the 100-bp electrophoretic standard markers (lane M). Full-length and truncated GST/p190RhoGEF-C were constructed for localizing the NF68-binding site by Northwestern blots. 3J. Wu, unpublished data. The same full-length and truncated GST fusion proteins were used to localize and compare the BC1- and NF68-binding site (Fig.5 A). GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 B) and transferred to nylon membranes, and replicates of transferred proteins were hybridized with BC1 (Fig. 5 C) and NF68 (Fig. 5 D) probes by Northwestern blots. Full-length and N-terminal truncations (M4 and M5 constructs) of GST/p190RhoGEF-C bound 32P-labeled BC1 (Fig. 5 C) and NF68 (Fig.5 D) probes. Binding of both BC1 and NF68 probes was lost in C-terminal truncations of GST/p190RhoGEF-C. Whereas binding was retained when the C terminus of GST/p190rhoGEF-C was truncated from aa 1582 to 1524 (M3 construct), binding of NF68 and BC1 probes was eliminated upon C-terminal truncations to aa 1493 (M2 construct) and 1461 (M1 construct). The findings indicate that BC1 and NF68 bind to similar sites in GST/p190RhoGEF and that sequence encoded between aa 1493 and 1524 (QLQEYQQSLERLREGQRMVERERQKMRVQQGL) is required for the binding of both RNA probes. GST/p190RhoGEF-C was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nylon membrane for Northwestern blots to determine the sequence in BC1 required for binding to the fusion protein. Membrane containing fusion protein was hybridized with full-length BC1 and with a series of truncated probes lacking 5′ or 3′ sequences (Fig.6 A). 32P-Labeled probes to full-length BC1 (BC1), to ID sequence (ID), and to the full-length BC1 probe lacking the initial 10 nucleotides of the dendrite-targeting motif or DTM (BC1ΔDTM) bound to the fusion protein (Fig. 6 B). Binding of 32P-labeled probes to the fusion protein was lost when the 5′ deletion was extended to include the initial 25 (BC1ΔID-A) or 50 (BC1ΔID-A/B) nucleotides of BC1. The findings indicated that sequence within the ID element of BC1 was sufficient for binding and that sequences in the initial 25 nucleotides of BC1, excluding the DTM, are necessary for binding of BC1 to GST/p190RhoGEF-C. Novel binding features of BC1 are herein identified which expand the prospective role of BC1 in neuronal metabolism. Binding of BC1 and the destabilizing element in NF-L mRNA to a similar site in the C-terminal domain of p190RhoGEF links BC1 to NF-L expression and to RNA-mediated motor neuron degeneration (7Canete-Soler R., Wu, J. Zhai J. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32046-32050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The recognition of p190RhoGEF as an RNA-binding protein also links NF-L expression with signal transduction pathways and with potential modifications of the neuronal cytoskeleton in differentiated neurons (21Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li Z. Van Aelst L. Cline H.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the identification of a novel binding site outside of the dendrite-targeting motif (DTM) supports the likelihood that BC1 has additional functional properties beyond its putative role in regulating movement, localization, and translation of neuronal transcripts in the dendritic compartment (19Tiedge H. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Weinstock P.H. Arancio O. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Ohashi S. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Ohara S. Omae A. Muramatsu T., Li, Y. Anzai K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is presently much more information as to the derivation than function of BC1. For example, BC1 is recognized as a master gene for generating and amplifying short interspersed repetitive elements in the rodent genome (24Kim J. Kass D.H. Deininger P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Deininger P.L. Tiedge H. Kim J. Brosius J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) analogous to the Alu repeats in the primate genome (27Mighell A.J. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Tomilin N.V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roy A.M. Carroll M.L. Nguyen S.V. Salem A.H. Oldridge M. Wilkie A.O. Batzer M.A. Deininger P.L. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). BC1 and other progenitor genes are believed to have arisen by reverse transcription and by fortuitous integration of cDNAs into a favorable site of the genome downstream of a pol III promoter sequence. BC1 is, however, an atypical pol III transcript in that it is highly and exclusively expressed in differentiated neurons (30Tiedge H. Chen W. Brosius J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2382-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuron-specific transcription is regulated by positive and negative upstream elements that react with brain-specific and nonspecific factors (18Martignetti J.A. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9698-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Competitive binding of Pur protein to the BC1 transcript and to cis-acting enhancer elements in theBC1 gene provides a potential feedback mechanism for regulating BC1 transcription by its own gene product (31Kobayashi S. Agui K. Kamo S., Li, Y. Anzai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of BC1during the late phase of neuronal differentiation and high level expression in large differentiated neurons (16McKinnon R.D. Danielson P. Brow M.A. Bloom F.E. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2148-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) coincides with the expression profiles of NF-L (11Schlaepfer W.W. Bruce J. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and p190RhoGEF2 and is consistent with a functional interaction of these components in large differentiated neurons. A similar expression profile is also characteristic of interactive partners of p190RhoGEF, including neuron-enriched isoforms of JIP-1 (12Pellet J.B. Haefliger J.A. Staple J.K. Widmann C. Welker E. Hirling H. Bonny C. Nicod P. Catsicas S. Waeber G. Riederer B.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and 14-3-3 (13Watanabe M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Watanabe M. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Kondo H.

Brain Res. 1994; 25: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is possible that binding of one or more of the interactive partners to the C-terminal domain could be responsible for unmasking inherent GDP/GTP activity required for activation of p190RhoGEF in vivo (9van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is also possible for interaction of BC1 with p190RhoGEF to account for axonal transport or localization of BC1 in discrete sites along the surface membrane of goldfish Mauthner axons (32Muslimov I.A. Titmus M. Koenig E. Tiedge H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4293-4301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, there are still large regions in the N-terminal half of p190RhoGEF containing potential interactive sites of unknown function, including zinc finger and leucine-rich motifs (33Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The putative function of BC1 in regulating dendritic expression is based on the properties of specific BC1-bound proteins. Likewise, our fortuitous identification of additional BC1-binding proteins suggests that BC1 may have additional interactive roles in neuronal gene expression. In both instances, it is proposed that BC1 functions as a RNA-protein complex and that RNA binding confers, alters, or modifies properties of the complex. Such RNA-protein interactions resemble the interactions of multiple RNAs and proteins in RNP complexes that mediate the processing of RNA (34Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 35Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). More recently, it is also recognized that short single-stranded RNAs can regulate gene expression by hybridizing with specific mRNAs as small interfering or small temporal RNAs (36Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar, 37Lau N.C. Lim L.P. Weinstein E.G. Bartel D.P.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The potential involvement of p190RhoGEF in RNA-mediated motor neuron degeneration is quite unexpected because the function of p190RhoGEF has been attributed to regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton (8Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that another GEF,i.e. RCC1, plays a critical role in regulating the translocation of protein and RNA across the nuclear pore complex by promoting the formation of Ran-GTP on the nuclear face of the complex (39Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 217: 41-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, a GEF protein with close homology to RCC1 was identified as the mutant gene product in a recessive form of familial motor neuron degeneration (40Yang Y. Hentati A. Deng H.X. Dabbagh O. Sasaki T. Hirano M. Hung W.Y. Ouahchi K. Yan J. Azim A.C. Cole N. Gascon G. Yagmour A. Ben-Hamida M. Pericak-Vance M. Hentati F. Siddique T. Nat.

Genet. 2001; 29: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Why dysfunction of a GEF should lead to motor neuron degeneration is also unexpected. The role of RNA-protein interactions on p190RhoGEF and their potential linkage to RNA-mediated motor neuron degeneration could provide some insights into the nature of motor neuron disease."

To establish a melatonin rhythm, AA-NAT activity is precisely regulated through several signaling pathways. Here we show novel regulation of AA-NAT activity, in which an intramolecular disulfide bond may function as a switch for the catalysis. Recombinant AA-NAT activity was irreversibly inhibited byN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in an acetyl-CoA-protected manner. Oxidized glutathione or dissolved oxygen reversibly inhibited AA-NAT in an acetyl-CoA-protected manner. To identify the cysteine residues responsible for the inhibition, AA-NAT was first oxidized with dissolved oxygen, treated with NEM, reduced with dithiothreitol, and then labeled with [14C]NEM. Cys61 and Cys177 were specifically labeled in an acetyl-CoA-protected manner. The AA-NAT with the Cys61to Ala and Cys177 to Ala double substitutions (C61A/C177A-AA-NAT) was fully active but did not exhibit sensitivity to either oxidation or NEM, whereas the AA-NATs with only the single substitutions retained about 40% of these sensitivities. An intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177 formed upon oxidation and cleaved upon reduction was identified. Furthermore, C61A/C177A-AA-NAT expressed in COS7 cells was relatively insensitive to H2O2-evoked oxidative stress, whereas wild-type AA-NAT was strongly inhibited under the same conditions. These results indicate that the formation and cleavage of the disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177 produce the active and inactive states of AA-NAT. It is possible that intracellular redox conditions regulate AA-NAT activity through switching via an intramolecular disulfide bridge.

Melatonin is a hydrophobic hormone in pineal glands and plays important roles in many biological processes, especially in circadian rhythm and seasonal reproduction (1Axelrod J.

In mammals, the synthesis of melatonin is under photoperiod control through the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, acting an oscillator for the biological clock. At night, the suprachiasmatic nuclei send stimulatory signals to the pineal glands by way of sympathetic neurons (1Axelrod J.

Norepinephrine released from the nerve endings binds to the receptors of pinealocytes and activates adenylate cyclase, resulting in an increased content of cAMP, an important second messenger in the regulation of melatonin synthesis.

For instance, an increase in the cAMP level activates protein kinase A so as to phosphorylate the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. Then, the phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein triggers AA-NAT gene expression, causing increases in AA-NAT mRNA and protein, which in turn results in increased synthesis and secretion of melatonin (5Borjigin J.

It is also known that various chemical transmitters includingl-glutamate and acetylcholine decrease the cAMP level through activation of the Gi protein, causing a blockade of AA-NAT mRNA synthesis (15Moriyama Y.

AA-NAT is a globular protein with a molecular mass of 23 kDa consisting of eight-stranded β sheets containing acetyl-CoA binding sites (16Hickman A.B. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Mol.

Recent structural and biochemical studies involving three-dimensional crystals of a truncated AA-NAT, AA-NAT 28–201, in the presence and absence of CoA-S-acetyltryptamine, a potent inhibitor that may bind to the catalytic domain (17Khalil E.M.

In parallel, site-directed mutagenesis of AA-NAT revealed the presence of important histidine residues (21Zhan-Poe X. Craft C.M. J.

Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). AA-NAT activity has been shown to be regulated through thiol/disulfide exchange involving such sulfhydryl reagents as cysteamine and insulin (24Namboodiri M.A.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6032-6035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Namboodiri M.A.A. Favilla J.T. Klein D.C. Science. 1981; 213: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although thiol/disulfide exchange is believed to be one of the potential regulatory mechanisms for AA-NAT activity, the molecular basis of its sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents is less understood. Recently, Craft and Zhan-Poe (22Craft C.M. Zhan-Poe X. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) suggested the involvement of Cys61 in the sensitivity to NEM with recombinant mutated AA-NATs. In the present study, we attempted to determine which cysteine residues are responsible for the sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents using combined biochemical and molecular biological approaches. Here we report the identification of two cysteine residues conferring sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents and present evidence that an intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues acts as a switch for the catalysis. The expression of AA-NAT and its purification were performed according to previously published procedures (26Ferry G. Loyne A. Kucharczyk N. Bertin S. Rodriguez M. Delagrange P. Galizz J.P. Jacoby E.

Escherichia coli strain JM109 cells (Promega) harboring a plasmid were grown at 37 °C for 5 h to anA 600 nm of ∼0.6 in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm)was added to induce AA-NAT, and the culture was continued at 37 °C for 3 h. Then, the cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 6 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml DNase, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The cells were disrupted with a Tomy Ultrasonic Disruptor at 20 kHz and 80 W for 30 s. The sonicated solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove particulate structures. Then, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (2 ml) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, AA-NAT was eluted as a GST fusion protein with 10 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm GSH. The fractions containing AA-NAT activity were pooled and stored at −85 °C until use. AA-NAT activity was assayed according to the previously published procedure (27Thomas K.B. Zawilska J. Iuvone P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified enzyme (5 μg protein/assay) was added to an assay mixture comprising 0.25 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA and 2 mmtryptamine. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was terminated with 1 ml of ice-cold toluene/isoamyl alcohol/1m HCl (99:0.66:0.33). The mixture was vigorously vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The organic phase was carefully collected, evaporated to dryness, and suspended in 0.1 ml of a mobile phase solution consisting of 0.1m citric acid, 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 33% methanol (pH 4.1). N-Acetyltryptamine in the samples was determined by HPLC on a reverse-phase column (CAPCELL PAK C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To label cysteine residues causing NEM-evoked inactivation with [14C]NEM, AA-NAT (0.1 mg of protein) was first oxidized by dialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 5 h, as described in the Fig. 2 legend. Under the conditions used, about 90% of the activity disappeared. The oxidized AA-NAT was treated with 0.1 mm NEM at 4 °C for 30 min to block the cysteine residues that are not involved in NEM inactivation. The enzyme was reduced by the addition of 10 mm DTT and incubated further at 23 °C for 1 h. The mixture was dialyzed at 4 °C for 1 h to remove excess DTT. Successively, AA-NAT (10 μg) was incubated in 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in the absence or presence of 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA for 1 h and then treated with 0.25 mm [14C]NEM (3 μCi/μmol) at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were immediately denatured by the addition of sample buffer containing 10% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol, applied to a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed in the presence of SDS. Fluorography was performed in the presence of Amplify (Amersham Biosciences). AA-NAT (10 μg of protein) labeled with [14C]NEM as described above was digested with V8 protease (2 μg of protein) at 37 °C for 18 h. The resultant peptides were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Phenomenex column (C18, 4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) equilibrated with H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The UV absorption and radioactivity of all fractions were monitored. The amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides were determined with a gas-phase protein sequencer (492 Protein Sequencer; PE Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's manual. AA-NAT (20 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.1 mm NEM at 4 °C in the presence of acetyl-CoA (1.5 mm) for 30 min to block cysteines residues that are not related to the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond. AA-NAT was oxidized by dialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 5 h. The oxidized AA-NAT was divided into two portions: one was kept on ice, and the other was reduced again with 10 mm DTT at 23 °C for 1 h. The resultant oxidized AA-NAT and reduced AA-NAT were separately digested with V8 protease, and the resultant polypeptides were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The elution profiles in the two experiments were compared, and the peak materials derived from the oxidized AA-NAT (but not reduced AA-NAT) were isolated, and their amino acid sequences were determined with a 492 Protein Sequencer. The molecular masses of the peptides were also determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with a Voyager-DE (PE Biosystems). Point mutations were introduced into wild-type AA-NAT cDNA by the overlap extension method according to the previously published procedure (28Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides encoding mutations were used: C37A, CGTGAGGGCGCGGAACTCACT; C61A, GGAGGGGGGCGGTACCCGAG; C75A, CTCTGGAGCCAGGGTGAGGAAGT; C158A, CAGGGCGTTCTCGGCCATGAGCA; and C177A, ATGGTGATGGCGGCCGGGCCCATGGC. The identity of the mutated cDNAs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The absence of additional mutations in the parental cDNAs was also verified. The isolated peptides were dissolved in 4% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid containing 0.3% trifluoroacetate in a mixture of water/acetonitrile (1:1). The molecular masses of the isolated peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with a Voyager-DE (PE Biosystems) operated at 25,000 V with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the desorption matrix compound. Wild-type or C61A/C177A double mutant AA-NAT cDNA, as described above, was subcloned into the EcoRV andXhoI sites of expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmids, AA-NATpcDNA3.1 and C61A/C177A-AA-NATpcDNA 3.1 (2 μg each), were transfected into COS7 cells (4 × 105 cells/dish) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 by the lipofection method using Trans IT reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). After Geneticin (0.8 mg/ml) selection, cells in which AA-NAT or mutated AA-NAT was stably expressed were selected for expansion based on AA-NAT activity and cloned. The cell lines were established after three rounds of subcloning and are abbreviated as SYN-8 for AA-NAT and SYM-12 for mutated AA-NAT, respectively. The cells (4 × 105 cells/dish) were cultured for 2 days, and H2O2 was added to the medium to give a final concentration of 1 or 2 mm. After incubation for an additional 10 min, the cells were rinsed with 0.25 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), collected, homogenized in 0.25m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.5 mm acetyl-CoA, and used for the experiment. GSH and GSSG were quantified by HPLC according to previously published procedures (29Toyo'oka T. Imai K. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 282: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Toyo'oka T. Uchiyama S. Saito Y. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1988; 205: 29-41Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PAGE in the presence of SDS, fluorography in the presence of Amplify, and Western blotting with ECL amplification were performed as described previously (31Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14723-14729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Pierce protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. [14C]NEM (1.3 GBq/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. V8 protease (P 2922) was from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Fig. 1 A depicts the strategy used for construction of the expression vector and the amino acid sequence of the GST-AA-NAT fusion protein. After expression in E. coli, GST-AA-NAT was purified by affinity column chromatography as a 47-kDa polypeptide, and its specific activity was 9.12 ± 0.56 μmol/min/mg protein (n = 8) (Fig.1 B, arrowhead). The upper polypeptide with a molecular mass of 58 kDa on the SDS gel is a chaperone, as shown previously (26Ferry G. Loyne A. Kucharczyk N. Bertin S. Rodriguez M. Delagrange P. Galizz J.P. Jacoby E. Volland J.P. Lesieur D. Renard P. Canet E. Fauchere J.L. Boutin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8794-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the preparation is lower than those of purified AA-NAT published elsewhere (20Angelis J.D. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Coon S.L. Weller J.L. Korf H.W. Namboodiri M.A.A. Rollag M. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24097-24107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) because our preparation contained the contaminating chaperone. The chaperone did not interfere with the following experiments. We refer to GST-AA-NAT simply as AA-NAT in this paper. As the first step of the study, we examined the sensitivities of AA-NAT to NEM and GSSG. NEM inhibited AA-NAT activity, with an IC50 of 50 μm (Fig.2 A). Complete inhibition was attained with more than 0.5 mm NEM. This inhibition was irreversible because no activity was restored on extensive dialysis of the NEM-treated enzyme or on the addition of DTT (Fig. 2 B). GSSG also inactivated AA-NAT (Fig. 2 A). The GSSG-evoked inactivation is reversible because DTT or GSH at 10 mmcaused significant recovery of the activity (Fig. 2 B). When AA-NAT was dialyzed against the buffer with dissolved oxygen for 5 h at 4 °C, the activity significantly decreased but was fully recovered on subsequent addition of DTT, indicating that oxidation by dissolved oxygen had essentially the same effect as GSSG (Fig.2 C). Successively, the oxidized AA-NAT was treated with NEM at 0.1 mm and then reduced by the addition of DTT. The resultant oxidized AA-NAT exhibited restored activity comparable with that of the native enzyme (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results indicate that a cysteine residue(s) is involved in the NEM-evoked inactivation and that thiol/disulfide exchange is important for the catalysis. Subsequently, we examined whether or not substrates of AA-NAT can prevent the NEM-evoked inactivation. Acetyl-CoA prevented the NEM-evoked inactivation, whereas neither tryptamine norN-acetyltryptamine was effective (TableI). Essentially the same results were obtained for oxidation-evoked inactivation (data not shown). These results suggested that the cysteine residue(s) conferring NEM sensitivity is located near the acetyl-CoA binding site, but not in the serotonin binding site.Table IAcetyl-CoA protects AA-NAT activity against NEM-evoked inactivationTreatmentConcentrationActivityRelative activity(mm)(μmol/min/mg protein)No addition9.12 ± 0.56100NEM2.61 ± 0.2728.6+ Acetyl-CoA0.54.20 ± 0.1946.11.08.08 ± 0.3688.61.59.22 ± 0.47101+ Tryptamine1.52.26 ± 0.2624.8+N-Acetyltryptamine1.52.17 ± 0.1023.8Results are the means ± S.E. for five independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Results are the means ± S.E. for five independent experiments. To specifically label the cysteine residue(s) conferring NEM sensitivity, we incubated AA-NAT with [14C]NEM in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. Although acetyl-CoA protects the NEM-evoked inactivation under these labeling conditions (Table I), acetyl-CoA treatment did not reduce the incorporation of [14C]NEM (Fig.3 A), suggesting masking of the specific binding of cysteine residues with [14C]NEM by the nonspecific labeling. Next, following the procedure shown in Fig.2 C, AA-NAT was first dialyzed against the buffer containing oxygen to oxidize the functional cysteine residue(s). Then the resultant AA-NAT was treated with cold NEM to block the nonspecific cysteine residues, and the NEM-treated AA-NAT was reduced by the addition of DTT. Subsequently, the resultant AA-NAT, whose activity was recovered (see Fig. 2 C), was labeled with [14C]NEM in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. It was found that incorporation of [14C]NEM is fully prevented by acetyl-CoA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and4). When the DTT treatment was omitted, incorporation of [14C]NEM was not observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). Overall, we concluded that the cysteine residue(s) conferring NEM sensitivity is reduced by DTT and then selectively labeled by [14C]NEM with the labeling procedure employed. The [14C]NEM binding site was determined as follows. [14C]NEM-labeled AA-NAT prepared as described above was digested with V8 protease. The resultant polypeptides were separated by HPLC on a reverse-phase column (Fig.4 A). Radioactivity was found in several peaks (Fig. 4 B). Among them, only two peaks (peaks 23 and 25) were found to be acetyl-CoA-protected. Amino acid sequencing of these peak materials revealed sequences of MGPXAITMGSLT (residues 174–185) and GTXPLHLD (residues 59–66) (X indicates the complex of cysteine and radiolabeled NEM), respectively. The molecular weights of the polypeptides in peaks 23 and 25 were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to be 1,286.15 and 962.70, respectively, which are consistent with those of the corresponding polypeptides (1,287.64 and 961.51, respectively). We concluded that Cys61 and Cys177 are responsible for the sensitivity to NEM. To support the above conclusion, recombinant AA-NATs in which the Cys at each position was substituted with Ala were prepared, and their sensitivities to NEM were measured (TableII). All the recombinant AA-NATs showed activity comparable with or higher than that of the wild-type. Upon the addition of 0.1 mm NEM, the AA-NATs with C37A, C75A, and C158A were inhibited by NEM, as in the case of the wild-type. On the other hand, the AA-NAT with C61A or C177A became partially resistant, with about 60% of the activity remaining. The double mutant AA-NAT with C61A/C177A was totally insensitive to NEM (Table II) and to GSSG (data not shown). These results are consistent with the idea that both Cys61 and Cys177 confer sensitivity to NEM but that these cysteine residues are not essential for the activity.Table IIEffect of NEM on mutated AA-NATSubstitutions− NEM+ NEM% InhibitionWild10018.7 ± 3.281.3C37A111 ± 7.920.3 ± 2.181.7C61A208 ± 10.5122 ± 6.741.3C75A110 ± 8.816.5 ± 2.485.0C158A93.9 ± 6.513.1 ± 1.886.0C177A189 ± 9.9114 ± 5.139.7C61A/C177A186 ± 8.3177 ± 7.34.8AA-NAT activity was assayed in the presence or absence of NEM at 0.1 mm. The results are expressed as relative activity, with 100% = 9.25 ± 0.56 μmol/min/mg protein. Results are the means ± S.E. for five independent experiments. Open table in a new tab AA-NAT activity was assayed in the presence or absence of NEM at 0.1 mm. The results are expressed as relative activity, with 100% = 9.25 ± 0.56 μmol/min/mg protein. Results are the means ± S.E. for five independent experiments. The oxygen- or GSSG-evoked inactivation of AA-NAT is fully reversible. Because two cysteine residues are involved in the inhibition, as described above, these results suggest that the formation and cleavage of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177 regulate AA-NAT activity. Subsequently, we investigated whether or not such an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177 is actually formed under oxidized conditions. After protection of Cys61 and Cys177 upon incubation with acetyl-CoA, AA-NAT was oxidized by dialysis for 5 h at 4 °C and then digested with V8 protease, and the resultant polypeptides were fractionated. In comparison with the fraction pattern in Fig. 4, the amounts of polypeptides corresponding to fractions 23 and 25 had significantly decreased, whereas a newly generated major peak had appeared (Fig. 5 A). The peaks marked with asterisks were derived from DTT. The newly generated peak (peak 1), which was expected to contain the intramolecular disulfide bond, was isolated by HPLC (Fig.5 B) and then reduced by the addition of DTT at 10 mm. The resultant mixture was further fractionated by HPLC, and the two different peptides (peaks 2 and 3) originating from the peak 1 material were collected (Fig.5 C). Amino acid sequencing of the peak 2 and 3 peptides revealed FQAMGPCAITMGSLTFT and AFISVSGTCPLH, which correspond to amino acid residues 171–187 and 53–64, respectively. The cysteine residue was identified as an S-ethylsuccinimido derivative. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicated the molecular weights of these polypeptides were 1,756.8 (1,757.19 expected) and 1,212.59 (1,211.39 expected), respectively. Furthermore, amino acid analysis indicated that the peak 1 material comprises a mixture of the peak 2 and 3 ones (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that the peak 1 material corresponds to the nonreduced peak 2 and 3 peptides conjugated through a disulfide bond. Thus, the formation and cleavage of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys61and Cys177 may directly yield the active (reduced) and inactive (oxidized) states of AA-NAT. Finally, we examined whether or not oxidative stress affects AA-NAT activity through an intramolecular disulfide bond in vivo. For this purpose, we established COS7 cells (SYN-8 and SYM-12) in which either AA-NAT or mutated AA-NAT is constitutively expressed. The specific activity of AA-NAT is 2.59 ± 0.04 nmol/min/mg protein (n = 5), which is comparable to that reported elsewhere (32Coon S.L. Weller J.L. Korf H.W. Namboodiri M.A.A. Rollag M. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24097-24107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). H2O2 at either 1 or 2 mm was added to the COS7 cells for a short time to exert oxidative stress without affecting cell viability according to previous reports (33Aslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 34DeWit R. Makkinje M. Boonstra J. Verkleiji A.J. Post J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Upon this treatment, the cellular GSSG/GSH ratio significantly increased, confirming exertion of oxidative stress (Fig. 6 A). Under the conditions used, wild-type AA-NAT activity rapidly disappeared, whereas C61A/C177A-AA-NAT activity did not significantly change and was maintained at the control level (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that oxidative stress affects AA-NAT activity in vivo through the formation and cleavage of a disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177. In the present study, we studied the mechanism by which sulfhydryl reagents inhibit AA-NAT, and we found that the Cys61 and Cys177 residues are responsible for the inhibition. Judging from the three-dimensional structure of the active (reduced) enzyme, there are three polypeptide loops (loops 1–3) converging on the acetyl-CoA binding site, creating a hydrophobic funnel containing the catalytic site as well as binding sites for cofactors (16Hickman A.B. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F.

In particular, Phe56 and Pro64 in loop 1 and Met159, Val183, Leu186, and Phe188 in loop 3 are suggested to contribute to the formation of active sites and binding sites for acetyl-CoA in the hydrophobic funnel (19Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). His110, His118, His120, and Tyr168, important residues for catalysis (21Zhan-Poe X. Craft C.M. J. Pineal Res. 1999; 27: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Scheibner K.A. Angelis J.D. Burley S.K. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18118-18126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), are also present in the hydrophobic funnel. Cys61 and Cys177 are localized near these amino acid residues in loops 1 and 3, respectively. Thus, the binding of NEM to these cysteine residues may prevent acetyl-CoA from gaining access to the catalytic domain. In this context, Cys61 and Cys177 are not essential for the catalysis, which is fully supported by the results of site-directed mutagenesis in Table II. We demonstrated that these cysteine residues form a disulfide bond upon dialysis or treatment with GSSG. Judging from the three-dimensional structure (19Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), Cys61 and Cys177 are about 17 Å apart. Thus, upon formation of the disulfide bond, several conformational changes of AA-NAT should take place. With molecular modeling software (InsightII/Discover 95.0; Molecular Simulator Inc.), the changes in the three-dimensional structure of the oxidized AA-NAT is simulated. For instance, residues 55–58, which form a short helix (19Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), become looped out, and residues 54–64 become flexible. It is obvious that the disulfide bond may close the hydrophobic funnel containing the catalytic site and acetyl-CoA binding site and can therefore be expected to prevent acetyl-CoA from gaining access to the catalytic site. It seems likely that this disulfide bond behaves as a switch that opens and closes the gateway to the catalytic site. The formation and cleavage of the disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys177 may explain the molecular mechanism by which AA-NAT is regulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as cysteamine and insulin (24Namboodiri M.A.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6032-6035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Namboodiri M.A.A. Favilla J.T. Klein D.C. Science. 1981; 213: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and may constitute a hint as to a novel regulatory mechanism for melatonin synthesis in pineal gland. In COS7 cells, oxidative stress significantly inhibited AA-NAT, but not C61A/C177A-AA-NAT (Fig. 6), suggesting that the production of reduced AA-NAT (active form) and oxidized AA-NAT (inactive form) through the formation and cleavage of a disulfide bond may even occur in living cells. Thus, it is possible that the intracellular redox conditions regulate AA-NAT in pineal glands. GSH, a physiological cellular thiol/disulfide redox buffer (35Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Functions of Glutathione: Biochemical, Physiological, Toxicological, and Clinical Aspects. Raven Press, New York1983: 307-315Google Scholar), might be involved in the regulation of AA-NAT in vivo. Our preliminary results with regard to the intracellular concentrations of GSH and GSSG in pineal glands are 3.4 and 0.41 mm, respectively, 2S. Tsuboi and Y. Moriyama, unpublished observation. and these values are within the range that triggers the formation and cleavage of the disulfide bond in AA-NAT. Besides GSH, oxidants and reductants that can interact specifically with a disulfide bond will regulate AA-NAT. Additional studies are necessary to reveal all the features of redox regulation of AA-NAT activity in pineal glands. In conclusion, we identified an intramolecular disulfide bond that is involved in the regulation of AA-NAT activity. It is possible that the intracellular redox conditions participate in the regulation of AA-NAT activity in vivo through opening and closing of the catalytic funnel."

https://openalex.org/W2031100510,"Earlier studies have shown that Tvl-1 gives rise to at least two differentially spliced mRNAs, one of which (Tvl-S) encodes a protein that lacks amino acids 91–112. DNA binding of RFX complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S is impaired. As a result, Tvl-S does not support the expression of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Here, we show that the reason Tvl-S is inactive as a transcriptional regulator of Class II MHC genes is that the RFX complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S are unstable. Additionally, we show that interferon-γ, which induces Class II MHC gene expression in 293 cells, promotes a shift in the splicing pattern of RFXANK/Tvl-1 toward the transcriptionally active Tvl-L isoform, suggesting that differential splicing of Tvl-1 is a signal-regulated process. Finally, we show that Tvl-1 regulates the expression of non-MHC genes. One such gene encodes the ephrin receptor EphA3. Since both Tvl-L and Tvl-S are identical in their ability to induce the expression of EphA3, we conclude that Tvl-1 regulates the expression of non-MHC genes by RFX-independent mechanisms.

Peptides derived from antigens processed by antigen-presenting cells are presented to lymphocytes in association with the components of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; BLS, bare lymphocyte syndrome; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. CD4+helper T-cells recognize antigens presented in association with Class II MHC molecules. Such molecules, therefore, are essential for antigen presentation. Class II MHC genes are expressed in antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B-cells (1Hammerling G.J. McDevitt H.O. Isr. J. Med.

Expression of Class II MHC depends on transcription factors encoded by the genes that define the four complementation groups of BLS. CIITA, a transcriptional co-activator that binds the acetyltransferase p300/CBP and stimulates transcription by promoting histone acetylation (24Harton J.A. Zika E. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38715-38720Google Scholar, 25Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Google Scholar, 26Magner W.J. Kazim A.L. Stewart C. Romano M.A. Catalano G. Grande C. Keiser N.

This is underscored by observations showing that the induction of CIITA by IFN-γ in cells that do not normally express CIITA is sufficient to induce expression of Class II MHC genes (28Chin K.C.

Med. 2000; 6: 1399-1402Google Scholar). RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXANK/Tvl-1 form a complex that binds a specific site in the Class II MHC promoter (21Steimle V. Durand B. Barras E. Zufferey M. Hadam M.R. Mach B. Reith W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1021-1032Google Scholar, 32Reith W. Satola S. Sanchez C.H. Amaldi I. Lisowska-Grospierre B. Griscelli C. Hadam M.R. Mach B.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 5841-5848Google Scholar). DNA binding is mediated by RFX5 (35Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 803-807Google Scholar, 36Emery P. Strubin M. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4486-4494Google Scholar, 37Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that RFXAP and RFXANK/Tvl-1 may also contact DNA (38Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1635-1641Google Scholar). The RFX complex also interacts with CIITA and other transcription factors that bind the Class II MHC promoter (6Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Google Scholar, 8Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Google Scholar). Molecular interactions involved in the assembly of the RFX complex are somewhat controversial. Published studies suggest that RFXAP binds both RFX5 and RFXANK/Tvl-1 and that it serves as a bridge between these two proteins (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar, 40Nekrep N. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4455-4461Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that similar to RFXAP, Tvl-1 also interacts with the other two proteins in the complex, suggesting that complex formation depends on three way interactions between all the proteins in the complex. The finding that Tvl-1 contributes to the assembly of the RFX complex is in agreement with studies suggesting that RFXANK/Tvl-1 functions as a scaffold that controls the assembly of other multiprotein complexes (41Patriotis C. Russeva M.G. Lin J.H. Srinivasula S.M. Markova D.Z. Tsatsanis C. Makris A. Alnemri E.S. Tsichlis P.N. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 176-187Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that RFXANK/Tvl-1 gives rise to two differentially spliced mRNAs (19Nagarajan U.M. Louis-Plence P. DeSandro A. Nilsen R. Bushey A. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 153-162Google Scholar), which, in this report, are referred to as Tvl-L (L for long) and Tvl-S (S for short). The protein encoded by Tvl-S lacks amino acids 91–112 and fails to induce expression of Class II MHC genes (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that this failure is caused by the instability of the RFX complex assembled in the presence of Tvl-S. We also show that IFN-γ, which induces CIITA and Class II MHC expression in 293 cells, promotes a shift in the splicing pattern of RFXANK/Tvl-1 toward the Tvl-L form. Finally, we show that Tvl-1 also regulates the expression of non-MHC genes and that Tvl-L and Tvl-S are identical in their ability to induce the expression of the ephrin receptor EphA3, which is encoded by one of these genes. The fact that both Tvl-L and Tvl-S induce the expression of EphA3 suggests that the role of Tvl-1 in the expression of this, and perhaps other non-MHC genes, is RFX-independent. FLAG epitope-tagged Tvl-L (FLAG-Tvl-L) and Tvl-S (FLAG-Tvl-S) constructs were generated by inserting Tvl-L and Tvl-S in-frame with the FLAG epitope tag into the pcDNA3 or pREP4 expression vectors (Invitrogen). RFXAP-HA and GST-RFX5 were cloned in pcDNA3. GST-Tvl-L and GST-Tvl-S were cloned in pGEX5X3 (AmershamBiosciences). BLS-1 is a Class II MHC-deficient B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with a mutation in RFXANK/Tvl-1. The BLS-1 mutation consists of a 58-bp deletion that removed the last 23 nucleotides of exon 6 and the adjacent splice donor site (18Masternak K. Barras E. Zufferey M. Conrad B. Corthals G. Aebersold R. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Mach B. Reith W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 273-277Google Scholar). BLS-1 cells transfected with pREP4-based constructs were selected with hygromycin (200 μg/ml). BLS-1 and its derivative cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. 293 cells were treated with recombinant human IFN-γ (500 units/ml) (Endogen) for 24 h. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using the RETROscript kit (Ambion Inc.). To check the expression of Tvl-L and Tvl-S, we used the primer pair: 5′-CCG GCA GCG AGG GAA CGA CGT GT-3′ and 5′-CGC TCG TCT GGC TTG TTG ACG AG-3′ from exons 4 and 6 of Tvl-1, respectively. Primer pairs for HLA-DRA (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGG CCA TAA GTG GAG TC-3′ and 5′-CGG AAT TCT TAC AGA GGC CCC CTG CGT T-3′) and for β-actin (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGG ATG ATG ATA TCG CC- 3′ and 5′-CGG AAT TCC TAG AAG CAT TTG CGG TG-3′) were used to amplify these genes as controls. To check the expression of EphA3, we used the primer pair: 5′-GCT GAG AAC AAA CTG GGT CCC CAG-3′ and 5′-GAG GCG GGC ACT TAG CAC ACT TC-3′. pcDNA3-based constructs were transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TnT® T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with GST-Tvl-L and GST-Tvl-S constructs were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h. Cells were sonicated in GST lysis and binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following washing with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg of bead-bound GST-Tvl-L, GST-Tvl-S, or GST were incubated with 10 μl ofin vitro translated RFX5 and/or RFXAP at 30 °C for 1 h. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the electrophoresis sample buffer. BLS-1 cells stably transfected with either the empty pREP4 vector, pREP4-FLAG-Tvl-L, or pREP4-FLAG-Tvl-S were mounted on glass slides using a cytospin centrifuge. Cells were fixed on the slides using ice-cold acetone. Following blocking with 5% goat serum for 30 min, slides were incubated with polyclonal anti-Tvl-1 primary antibody (1:200 dilution in the blocking buffer) at 4 °C overnight. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:150 dilution) for 1 h. Slides were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and they were analyzed by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Non-transfected Raji cells stained with the same antibody were used as a control. EMSA was carried out following standard procedures (40Nekrep N. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4455-4461Google Scholar). The X1-box oligonucleotide used as the EMSA probe contained sequences that extend from −144 to −69 base pairs of the DRA promoter. 5′-Biotinylated X1-box oligonucleotides with 6C spacer arms were custom synthesized by Midland Laboratories, and they were attached to streptavidine-coated magnetic beads (streptavidine M280, Dynal laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein binding to bead-associated DNA was carried out following standard procedures (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar, 40Nekrep N. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4455-4461Google Scholar). 10 μl each of in vitro translated RFX5 and RFXAP were incubated on ice with bacterially produced GST-Tvl-L or GST-Tvl-S (20 μg each) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for the indicated time points (Fig. 6). Alternatively, nearly equimolar concentrations ofin vitro translated RFX5, RFXAP, FLAG-Tvl-L, or FLAG-Tvl-S were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein complexes were pulled down by binding to either glutathione-Sepharose beads or anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma). All the in vitro translated proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Bead-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine complex stability, complexes were assembled using 50 μl each of in vitro translated GST-RFX5 and RFXAP and in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Tvl-L or Tvl-S. Complexes were pulled down by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The washed beads were incubated at 4 °C in 50 μl of binding buffer (40Nekrep N. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4455-4461Google Scholar). Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In parallel experiments, the amounts of Tvl-L and Tvl-S that remained bound to the beads at the 0 h and the 6 h time points were also examined. To further analyze the stability of the Tvl-L- and Tvl-S-containing complexes, we examined whether Tvl-L can compete Tvl-S and whether Tvl-S can compete Tvl-L out of the assembled complexes. To this end, 50 μl each of in vitro translated RFX5 and RFXAP were first incubated with 50 μl of in vitrotranslated FLAG-Tvl-L or FLAG-Tvl-S at room temperature. One hour later, 25 μg of bacterially produced GST-Tvl-S or GST-Tvl-L were added to the complexes and they were incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The final protein complexes were pulled down with anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads, and they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. DNA microarray experiments were carried out using Affimatrix chips (U133A-Affimatrix Inc.). Specifically, cRNAs from BLS-1 cells stably transfected with pREP4, pREP4-Tvl-L, or pREP4-Tvl-S constructs were hybridized to a microarray of 12,000 clones, which includes both known genes and expressed sequence tags. Comparison of gene expression in the three cell lines allowed us to identify genes whose expression was altered in pREP4-Tvl-L and pREP4-Tvl-S, relative to the pREP4-transfected BLS-1 cells. Earlier studies have shown that Tvl-1 gives rise to two differentially spliced mRNAs (19Nagarajan U.M. Louis-Plence P. DeSandro A. Nilsen R. Bushey A. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 153-162Google Scholar), Tvl-L andTvl-S (Fig. 1 A). Exon 5, which is spliced out in Tvl-S, encodes amino acids 91–112. Tvl-S, the protein encoded by Tvl-S, failed to induce expression of Class II MHC genes. In this report we addressed the molecular defect responsible for the inability of Tvl-S to support Class II MHC expression. In addition, we examined whether differential splicing of Tvl-1 in cells that do not normally express Class II MHC genes is regulated by Class II MHC-inducing signals, and we addressed the function of Tvl-S. Earlier studies have shown that, although Tvl-L restores Class II MHC expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from bare lymphocyte syndrome patients, Tvl-S does not (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar). To confirm these results, we stably expressed Tvl-L or Tvl-S in one of these cell lines (BLS1). The cells expressing the two Tvl-1 isoforms were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DP antibody, and they were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 B). The inability of Tvl-S to support Class II MHC expression may result from its inability to translocate into the nucleus. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the subcellular localization of Tvl-L and Tvl-S by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Previous studies have shown that Tvl-1 expressed in transiently transfected 293 cells can be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (42Lin J.H. Makris A. McMahon C. Bear S.E. Patriotis C. Prasad V.R. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14706-14715Google Scholar). The significance of this finding, however, was questioned because it is possible that the subcellular localization of a given protein may be artificially altered if the protein is expressed at high levels from a transiently transfected construct. Here, we examined the subcellular localization of Tvl-L expressed at physiological or near physiological levels. In addition, we compared the subcellular localization of Tvl-L with that of similarly expressed Tvl-S. Since transcription of the endogenous gene gives rise to mRNAs that encode both proteins, we stably expressed Tvl-L and Tvl-S constructs separately in Tvl-1-null BLS-1 cells. The level of expression of these proteins in the stably transfected cells was similar to the level of expression of endogenous Tvl-1 in Raji cells. Immunofluorescence staining with a polyclonal anti-Tvl-1 antibody, followed by confocal microscopy, confirmed that Tvl-L can be detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and showed that the highest concentration of the protein was in the perinuclear region (Fig.2). The same analysis showed that Tvl-L and Tvl-S exhibit similar subcellular distributions. Therefore, the subcellular localization of Tvl-S does not explain its inability to induce Class II MHC expression. Previous studies have shown that complexes containing Tvl-1, RFX5, and RFXAP can be pulled down from nuclear extracts of Raji cells with an RFX5-specific antiserum (19Nagarajan U.M. Louis-Plence P. DeSandro A. Nilsen R. Bushey A. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 153-162Google Scholar). The inability of Tvl-S to support the expression of Class II MHC genes could be caused by its inability to bind the other components of the RFX complex. To address this question, we addressed its binding to RFX5 and RFXAP in vitro. Earlier studies had investigated the binding of Tvl-L but not Tvl-S to these proteins. Some of these earlier studies have shown that bacterially produced GST-Tvl-L interacts within vitro translated RFX5 and RFXAP (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar). However, other studies had found that Tvl-L interacts only with RFXAP and not with RFX5 (40Nekrep N. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4455-4461Google Scholar). Here, we revisited the interactions between Tvl-L and RFX5 or RFXAP, and we examined whether Tvl-L and Tvl-S differ in their ability to interact with these molecules. To this end, purified GST-Tvl-L and GST-Tvl-S produced in E. coli were incubated with in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled RFX5 and RFXAP separately or in combination. The in vitro assembled complexes were pulled down using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that both Tvl-L and Tvl-S bind RFX5 and RFXAP, either alone or in combination (Fig.3 A). To determine whether X1-box oligonucleotides affect the assembly of the Tvl-L- or Tvl-S-containing complexes, we repeated the previous experiment in the presence or absence of 1 μg of unlabeled oligonucleotides. The results confirmed that both Tvl-L and Tvl-S support the assembly of the RFX complex in vitro and that the X1-box oligonucleotides do not affect the assembly (Fig.3 B). Earlier studies have shown that RFX complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-L bind DNA, whereas complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S do not (39DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Google Scholar). This was demonstrated using EMSAs. Using a similar approach, we first sought to confirm these data. The results showed that Tvl-S-containing complexes exhibit detectable but significantly weaker binding to X1-box oligonucleotides than Tvl-L-containing complexes (Fig.4 A). Given that both Tvl-L and Tvl-S support the assembly of RFX complexes (Fig. 3,A and B), it is not clear why the complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S do not efficiently bind DNA. One possibility is that amino acids 91–112, which are missing from Tvl-S, may define a DNA-binding motif. Alternatively, complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S may exhibit an altered conformation. In either case, their association with DNA may be weak and unstable. Finally, the protein complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S may themselves be unstable. To confirm that Tvl-S-containing complexes bind DNA, we examined their association with DNA under conditions that do not favor the dissociation of protein-DNA complexes following binding. To this end, 5′-biotinylated X1-box oligonucleotides were incubated with RFX complexes assembled in the presence of different combinations of RFX5, RFXAP, Tvl-L, and Tvl-S. The assembled protein-DNA complexes were precipitated using streptavidine-coated magnetic beads. The beads were then stringently washed and the bead-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results showed that all the RFX5-containing complexes, including those assembled in the presence of Tvl-S, bind DNA (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, RFX5 alone in the absence of any co-factors also binds DNA. The different sensitivities of this assay and EMSA suggest that protein-DNA complexes may dissociate in EMSA due to the shearing stress applied to the complexes as they traverse the gel during electrophoresis. Given that EMSA assays clearly show that Tvl-S-containing complexes bind DNA with significantly reduced efficiency, we hypothesized that the binding of these complexes to DNA may be unstable. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether Tvl-S and Tvl-L compete with each other when incubated with Tvl-L- or Tvl-S-containing protein-DNA complexes. Our results showed that although excess Tvl-L displaces Tvl-S, excess Tvl-S does not displace Tvl-L (Fig. 4 C). This finding suggests that the inability of the Tvl-S-containing RFX complexes to bind DNA efficiently may result from the instability of these complexes. The experiment in Fig. 3 revealed that both Tvl-L and Tvl-S support the assembly of RFX complexes. However, complex assembly in this experiment was carried out in the presence of a large excess of Tvl-1. The very high concentration of Tvl-L and Tvl-S may obscure the efficiency with which these two proteins promote complex assemblyin vitro. To address this hypothesis, we examined the assembly of Tvl-L- and Tvl-S-containing RFX complexes using in vitro translated proteins at nearly equimolar amounts. The results showed that Tvl-L is more efficient in promoting the assembly of the complex than Tvl-S (Fig. 5). The lower efficiency of RFX complex assembly in the presence of Tvl-S could result from a lower rate of assembly or from a lower stability of the assembled complexes or both. To evaluate these possibilities, we incubated in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled RFX5 and RFXAP with excess of bacterially expressed GST-Tvl-L or GST-Tvl-S bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The complexes assembled in the presence of the two Tvl-1 isoforms were harvested at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min from the start of the incubation, and they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The relative abundance of RFX5 and RFXAP in these complexes was determined by autoradiography and exposure to a phosphorimager screen followed by analysis with the Image Quant software. The results showed that the assembly of Tvl-S- and Tvl-L-containing complexes proceeds with similar efficiency in the first 5 min of incubation. However, although the assembly of Tvl-S-containing complexes reaches a plateau at 5 min, the assembly of Tvl-L-containing complexes continues up to, and perhaps beyond, the 30-min time point (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the assembly of Tvl-L- and Tvl-S-containing complexes proceeds at a similar rate. However, the assembly of Tvl-S-containing complexes reaches an equilibrium very rapidly. Given that the assembly is a reversible process, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the Tvl-S-containing complexes are unstable. To evaluate the stability of Tvl-L- and Tvl-S-containing complexes, we incubated in vitro translated GST-RFX5 and RFXAP within vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Tvl-L or Tvl-S. The assembled complexes were pulled down by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Following extensive washing, the beads were incubated in the binding buffer at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected at the indicated time points, and they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The results showed that complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-S release their components more rapidly than complexes assembled in the presence of Tvl-L (Fig.7, A1 and A2). In agreement with this data, a higher amount of Tvl-L than Tvl-S remained bound to the complex at 6 h from the start of the incubation (Fig.7, B1 and B2). To confirm the relative instability of the Tvl-S-containing complexes, we incubated complexes assembled in the presence of in vitrotranslated FLAG-Tvl-L or FLAG-Tvl-S with a 50-fold excess of bacterially expressed GST-Tvl-S or GST-Tvl-L, respectively. The composition of the complexes, before and after incubation with the bacterially expressed Tvl-1 isoforms, was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the proteins immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The results showed that although excess GST-Tvl-L almost completely displaces Tvl-S from the complex, GST-Tvl-S does not displace Tvl-L (Fig. 7 C). This confirmed that Tvl-S-containing complexes are indeed less stable than those containing Tvl-L. IFN-γ up-regulates the expression of CIITA in non-hematopoietic cells and induces Class II MHC expression (28Chin K.C. Mao C. Skinner C. Riley J.L. Wright K.L. Moreno C.S. Stark G.R. Boss J.M.

Here, we examined whether, in addition to its effect on CIITA, IFN-γ treatment changes the expression of the two differentially spliced forms of Tvl-1. To measure the expression in untreated and IFN-γ-treated (500 units/ml for 24 h) 293 cells, we employed RT-PCR using primers from exons 4 and 6, which flank the differentially spliced exon 5. The results showed that while both isoforms were abundant in untreated 293 cells, treatment with IFN-γ induced a shift toward Tvl-L, which encodes the transcriptionally active isoform of T"
