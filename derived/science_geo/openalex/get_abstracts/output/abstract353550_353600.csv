Here we show that deletion, depletion or inhibition of p53 can induce autophagy in human, mouse and nematode cells subjected to knockout, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of p53. Enhanced autophagy improved the survival of p53-deficient cancer cells under conditions of hypoxia and nutrient depletion, allowing them to maintain high ATP levels. Inhibition of p53 led to autophagy in enucleated cells, and cytoplasmic, not nuclear, p53 was able to repress the enhanced autophagy of p53−/− cells. Many different inducers of autophagy (for example, starvation, rapamycin and toxins affecting the endoplasmic reticulum) stimulated proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 through a pathway relying on the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2. Inhibition of p53 degradation prevented the activation of autophagy in several cell lines, in response to several distinct stimuli. These results provide evidence of a key signalling pathway that links autophagy to the cancer-associated dysregulation of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2091583229,"Calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) couples increases in cellular Ca2+ to fundamental responses in excitable cells. CaMKII was identified over 20 years ago by activation dependence on Ca2+/CaM, but recent evidence shows that CaMKII activity is also enhanced by pro-oxidant conditions. Here we show that oxidation of paired regulatory domain methionine residues sustains CaMKII activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. CaMKII is activated by angiotensin II (AngII)-induced oxidation, leading to apoptosis in cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. CaMKII oxidation is reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA), and MsrA-/- mice show exaggerated CaMKII oxidation and myocardial apoptosis, impaired cardiac function, and increased mortality after myocardial infarction. Our data demonstrate a dynamic mechanism for CaMKII activation by oxidation and highlight the critical importance of oxidation-dependent CaMKII activation to AngII and ischemic myocardial apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2077582389,"Since its discovery as the elusive tumor suppressor gene at the frequently mutated 10q23 locus, PTEN has been identified as lost or mutated in several sporadic and heritable tumor types. A decade of work has established that PTEN is a nonredundant phosphatase that is essential for regulating the highly oncogenic prosurvival PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This review discusses emerging modes of PTEN function and regulation, and speculates about how manipulation of PTEN function could be used for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1990300808,"Kinetochores are proteinaceous assemblies that mediate the interaction of chromosomes with the mitotic spindle. The 180 kDa Ndc80 complex is a direct point of contact between kinetochores and microtubules. Its four subunits contain coiled coils and form an elongated rod structure with functional globular domains at either end. We crystallized an engineered “bonsai” Ndc80 complex containing a shortened rod domain but retaining the globular domains required for kinetochore localization and microtubule binding. The structure reveals a microtubule-binding interface containing a pair of tightly interacting calponin-homology (CH) domains with a previously unknown arrangement. The interaction with microtubules is cooperative and predominantly electrostatic. It involves positive charges in the CH domains and in the N-terminal tail of the Ndc80 subunit and negative charges in tubulin C-terminal tails and is regulated by the Aurora B kinase. We discuss our results with reference to current models of kinetochore-microtubule attachment and centromere organization.

We discuss our results with reference to current models of kinetochore-microtubule attachment and centromere organization. The mitotic spindle, a microtubule-based scaffold, captures, aligns, and separates the replicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) during mitosis (O'Connell and Khodjakov, 2007O'Connell C.B. Khodjakov A.L. Cooperative mechanisms of mitotic spindle formation.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1717-1722Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The spindle assembly checkpoint detects defects in chromosome-spindle attachment and delays anaphase to prevent errors in chromosome segregation. These errors generate imbalances in chromosome numbers that are frequently observed in cancer cells (Musacchio and Salmon, 2007Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. The spindle-assembly checkpoint in space and time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Stable chromosome-spindle attachments are formed through kinetochores, scaffolds of ∼100 different proteins assembled at the periphery of centromeric DNA nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A (Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W.

Most eukaryotes assemble larger kinetochores with multiple attachment sites (15–30) for the plus ends of spindle microtubules, which are organized in kinetochore fibers (Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W.

At low resolution, the kinetochore of vertebrates appears as a trilaminar disk, with an electron-dense inner plate at the periphery of centromeric chromatin, an electron-lucent middle layer, and an electron-dense outer plate, the site of end-on binding of microtubule plus ends (Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W.

Electron tomography-based reconstructions of the outer plate revealed a fibrous structure that undergoes significant reorganization upon end-on microtubule attachment (Dong et al., 2007Dong Y.

The Ndc80 complex is a core component of the end-on attachment sites for kinetochore microtubules (Ciferri et al., 2007Ciferri C. Musacchio A. Petrovic A.

Its depletion perturbs the architecture of the kinetochore outer plate and reduces the number of attached microtubules (DeLuca et al., 2005DeLuca J.G. Dong Y. Hergert P. Strauss J. Hickey J.M.

The four subunits of the Ndc80 complex, named Ndc80 (human Ndc80 is also known as Hec1, for highly expressed in cancer 1), Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25, assemble into a 170–190 kDa complex in different species (Ciferri et al., 2007Ciferri C.

All four subunits contain long coiled coils (Figure S1 available online). Low-resolution structural analyses of yeast and human Ndc80 complexes (Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S.

The globular regions of Nuf2 and Ndc80 occupy one end of the rod and are located near the N termini of these proteins (Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S. Ferrari K.J. Ristic D. Wyman C. Stark H. Kilmartin J. Salmon E.D. Musacchio A. Architecture of the human ndc80-hec1 complex, a critical constituent of the outer kinetochore.J. Biol.

A heterodimeric coiled coil engaging Nuf2 and Ndc80 and emerging from the globular region accounts for most of the central shaft (Figures 1A and S1). The C-terminal end of the Nuf2-Ndc80 coiled coil encounters the N-terminal coiled coil of an Spc24-Spc25 subcomplex. The latter extends to the distal end of the rod, which contains a compact globular domain formed by the interacting heads of Spc24 and Spc25 (Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S.

In vitro, Ndc80-Nuf2 and Spc24-Spc25 form stable subcomplexes that can self-assemble into the ∼57 nm full-length Ndc80 complex (Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S. Ferrari K.J.

Both globular regions of the Ndc80 complex are functionally important. The globular region of Spc24-Spc25 is important for kinetochore localization. It maps “internally” (i.e., closer to the centromere) relative to the Ndc80-Nuf2 globular head (Bharadwaj et al., 2004Bharadwaj R. Qi W. Yu H.

Conversely, the globular head of the Ndc80-Nuf2 moiety binds to microtubules (Cheeseman et al., 2006Cheeseman I.M. Chappie J.S. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Desai A.

The globular region of the Ndc80 subunit folds as a calponin-homology (CH) domain (Wei et al., 2007Wei R.R. Al-Bassam J. Harrison S.C. The Ndc80/HEC1 complex is a contact point for kinetochore-microtubule attachment.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CH domains in different proteins have been implicated in actin or microtubule binding (Gimona et al., 2002Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. Functional plasticity of CH domains.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Korenbaum and Rivero, 2002Korenbaum E. Rivero F. Calponin homology domains at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3543-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The isolated CH domain of Ndc80 binds poorly to microtubules, suggesting that additional segments of the Ndc80 complex are required to create a functional microtubule-binding interface (Wei et al., 2007Wei R.R. Al-Bassam J. Harrison S.C. The Ndc80/HEC1 complex is a contact point for kinetochore-microtubule attachment.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By combining protein engineering, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, and biochemical methods, we characterized the architecture of the Ndc80 complex and the organization of the microtubule-binding interface of the Ndc80 complex. Reconstituted full-length human Ndc80 complex was refractory to crystallization and therefore to high-resolution structural analysis. To promote crystallization, we removed a large part of the coiled-coil region to generate a shorter and less flexible version of the complex. As the C-terminal regions of Nuf2 and Ndc80 contact the N-terminal regions of Spc24 and Spc25, we also reasoned that it should be possible to fuse these chains. We were successful in creating Ndc80-Spc25 and Nuf2-Spc24 chimeric chains containing short segments (15–60 residues) of the original coiled-coil sequences (Figure 1B). Coexpressed in bacteria, the fusion proteins gave rise to soluble and stable complexes, two of which will be discussed in detail: the Ndc801–286-Spc25118–224:Nuf21–169-Spc24122–197 complex, to which we refer as bonsai Ndc80 (Ndc80bonsai); and the Ndc8080–286-Spc25118–224:Nuf21–169-Spc24122–197 complex, to which we refer as Ndc80ΔN-bonsai, where ΔN stands for “N-terminal deletion” (Figure 1C). We fluorescently labeled Ndc80bonsai with Alexa fluor 488 (Alexa-Ndc80bonsai), injected it in early prometaphase HeLa cells, and followed its localization by live-cell video microscopy. Alexa-Ndc80bonsai localized to kinetochores throughout mitosis and until telophase (Figure 1D), similarly to the full-length counterpart (Bharadwaj et al., 2004Bharadwaj R. Qi W. Yu H.

Cosedimentation of Ndc80bonsai as a function of increasing microtubule concentrations (Figure 1E) revealed that Ndc80bonsai binds tightly to microtubules (quantifications are presented in Figures 4 and S2 and Table S1). Microtubule binding by Ndc80bonsai was also visually inspected using negative stain electron microscopy (EM). Paclitaxel- and GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules incubated with Ndc80bonsai appeared “hairy,” consistent with the idea that Ndc80bonsai binds the microtubule lattice. In contrast, the surfaces of unbound microtubules appeared smooth (Figures 1F and S3). Although we were unable to visualize individual complexes, probably due to the relatively short dimensions of Ndc80bonsai, these results recapitulate previous negative stain EM analyses obtained with a tetrameric full-length Ndc80 complex or with the Ndc80-Nuf2 subcomplex (Cheeseman et al., 2006Cheeseman I.M.

In summary, Ndc80bonsai retains the ability to bind microtubules and to localize to kinetochores, two fundamental biological properties of the full-length Ndc80 complex. We crystallized Ndc80ΔN-bonsai and determined its crystal structure to 2.9 Å resolution with phases from a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment (Table 1 and Experimental Procedures). So far, we have been unable to crystallize Ndc80bonsai, possibly because the N-terminal tail of Ndc80 (residues 1–79) is disordered.Table 1Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement StatisticsData Collection and PhasingNativeDerivativeESRF beamlineID23-1BM16Space groupP21212P21212Unit cell parameters (Å,°)a = 157.65, b = 248.97, c = 58.25, α = β = γ = 90a = 157.21, b = 250.15, c = 58.28, α = β = γ = 90Wavelength (Å)0.9540.979Resolution limits (Å)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.50−2.88 (2.96−2.88)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.50−3.50 (3.63−3.50)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.Reflections: partials/full/unique1,019,237/252,016/52,7542,691,322/781,156/29,799Completeness (%)99.1 (99.8)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.99.7 (99.8)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.RsymbRsym = ΣhΣi | Ih,i − < Ih > | / ΣhΣi Ih,i.

At one end of the rod, a globular helical domain of Nuf2 (residues 1–130) is sandwiched between the CH domain (residues 87–201) (Wei et al., 2007Wei R.R. Al-Bassam J. Harrison S.C.

Biol. 2007; 14: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and a helical hairpin (helices αH-αI, residues 221–258) of Ndc80 (Figure 2A). The Ndc80 CH domain and helical hairpin are connected through a disordered segment (residues 202–215). From residues 265Ndc80 and 152Nuf2, the polypeptide chains of Ndc80 and Nuf2 form a coiled coil that merges directly into the Spc24-Spc25 moiety (Figures 2A–2C). The ∼70 Å coiled-coil region is only briefly interrupted near the beginning of Spc24, possibly as an artifact of the fusion design. The globular regions of Spc24 and Spc25 mark the opposite end of the molecule relative to Ndc80-Nuf2. They are structurally related, and their fold consists of a three- or four-stranded β sheet, which packs against one or two α helices (Figures 2A–2C and S4), as shown previously for the homologous subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wei et al., 2006Wei R.R.

Spc24 and Spc25 associate tightly in a single globular entity through a conserved interface (Figure S4), while a few conserved exposed residues define a putative site of interaction with unknown kinetochore partners (Wei et al., 2006Wei R.R. Schnell J.R. Larsen N.A. Sorger P.K. Chou J.J. Harrison S.C.

The globular region of Ndc80 folds as a CH domain (Wei et al., 2007Wei R.R. Al-Bassam J. Harrison S.C. The Ndc80/HEC1 complex is a contact point for kinetochore-microtubule attachment.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The structure of Ndc80ΔN-bonsai reveals that residues 1–130 of Nuf2 also fold as a CH domain (Figure 3). CH domains appear in proteins of different functions (Castresana and Saraste, 1995Castresana J. Saraste M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1069-1079Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). They belong to different sequence classes and are usually present in one, two, or four copies (Gimona et al., 2002Gimona M.

Calponin homology domains at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3543-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The core of the CH domain is a four-helix bundle containing the parallel helices αA, αC, αE, and αG. These are connected by long external loops often but not always containing three additional short and irregular helices (αB, αD, αF). For instance, αD is absent in the Ndc80 CH domain but is present in the Nuf2 CH domain (Figure 3A). The Nuf2 CH domain is irregular. Its αE helix bends at both ends due to the presence of proline and glycine residues (Figure 2, Figure 3). The first half of αE protrudes away from the core of the four-helix bundle to provide an interaction surface for the Ndc80 CH domain (see below). The αE helix orients at an almost right angle relative to the αC-αG pair. This orientation is stabilized by the αF helix, which packs against the αC-αG thanks to a conserved and partially buried salt bridge between Asp108Nuf2 and Arg116Nuf2. At the C-terminal end, the αG helix of Nuf2 extends away from the Nuf2 CH globular domain, interacting first with the αH-αI hairpin of Ndc80 and then merging directly into the coiled coil where it pairs with the αJ helix of Ndc80 (Figure 2A). Structure-based superposition of the Ndc80 and Nuf2 CH domains yields a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 2.4 Å over ∼90 Cα atoms (Figure 3B). An equivalent superposition with the CH domain of EB1 (Hayashi and Ikura, 2003Hayashi I. Ikura M. Crystal structure of the amino-terminal microtubule-binding domain of end-binding protein 1 (EB1).J.

Cell. 2007; 27: 976-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) yields an rmsd of 3.5 Å over 79 Cα atoms (Figure S5). A sequence alignment based on structural alignment of the CH domains of Nuf2, Ndc80, and EB1 shows that the CH domains of Nuf2 and Ndc80 have only ∼6% sequence identity and that the conservation is located predominantly in the hydrophobic core (Figure 3C). The aligned surfaces lack conspicuous conserved features. The Nuf2 CH domain also has negligible sequence similarity to other CH domains. The compact assembly of the Ndc80 and Nuf2 CH domains is capped by the αH-αI hairpin of Ndc80. The assembly has approximate dimensions of 75 Å × 35 Å × 35 Å and is maintained by an interface burying ∼2300 Å2 on each participant and distributed over two major areas (Figure 3D). The first area involves the αD-αE loop and the αE and αF helices of Nuf2 and the ∼20 residue insertion between them. These pack against the αE-αF loop and the αG helix of Ndc80. This region contains Trp187Ndc80, which is very well conserved. It donates a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl of Leu78Nuf2, situated in the irregular segment at the beginning of αENuf2. The second area involves the C-terminal ends of the αC and αE helices and the extension of the αG helix of Nuf2 (after residue 126). These pack against the αH-αI helical hairpin of Ndc80. The interface between the CH domains of Nuf2 and Ndc80 is predominantly hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains interact stably. Tandem CH domains have been implicated as actin-binding modules in proteins such as α-actinin, filamin, and β-spectrin (Gimona et al., 2002Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J.

The functional specificity of different SOX proteins and the tissue specificity of a particular SOX factor are largely determined by the differential partnership of SOX transcription factors with other transcription regulators, many of which have not yet been discovered. Virtually all members of the SOX family have been found to be deregulated in a wide variety of tumors. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular behaviors involved in the oncogenic potential of SOX proteins. Using cell culture experiments, tissue analysis, molecular profiling, and animal studies, we report here that SOX2 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by facilitating the G1/S transition and through its transcription regulation of the CCND1 gene in breast cancer cells. In addition, we identified β-catenin as the transcription partner for SOX2 and demonstrated that SOX2 andβ-catenin act in synergy in the transcription regulation of CCND1 in breast cancer cells. Our experiments not only determined a role for SOX2 in mammary tumorigenesis but also revealed another activity of the multifunctional protein, β-catenin.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These genes are found throughout the animal kingdom, are expressed in a restricted spatial-temporal pattern, and play critical roles in stem cell biology, organogenesis, and animal development (3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of Sox2 in mouse neural stem cells blocks their differentiation, and inhibition of Sox2 in these cells causes their premature exit from the cell cycle and differentiation into neurons(5Graham V. Khudyakov J. Ellis P. Pevny L. Neuron. 2003; 39: 749-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Depletion of Sox2 by RNA interference blocks the proliferation of neural stem-like cells and causes them to differentiate into neurons(6Kondo T. Raff M. Genes. Dev. 2004; 18: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of links have been found between SOX transcription factors and human cancers (7Dong C. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. Cytogenet Genome Res. 2004; 105: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For instance, SOX2 has been found to be an immunogenic antigen in 41% of small cell lung cancer patients (8Gure A.O. Stockert E. Scanlan M.J. Keresztes R.S. Jager D. Altorki N.K. Old L.J. Chen Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4198-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and in 29% of meningioma patients (9Comtesse N. Zippel A. Walle S. Monz D. Backes C. Fischer U. Mayer J. Ludwig N. Hildebrandt A. Keller A. Steudel W.I. Lenhof H.P. Meese E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9601-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry results suggest that SOX2 is involved in later events of carcinogenesis, such as invasion and metastasis of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (10Sanada Y. Yoshida K. Ohara M. Oeda M. Konishi K. Tsutani Y. Pancreas. 2006; 32: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SOX2 may also be involved in gastric carcinogenesis (11Li X.L. Eishi Y. Bai Y.Q. Sakai H. Akiyama Y. Tani M. Takizawa T. Koike M. Yuasa Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar) and may be amplified in prostate cancers (12Sattler H.P. Lensch R. Rohde V. Zimmer E. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Retz M. Zwergel T. Bex A. Stoeckle M. Wullich B. Prostate. 2000; 45: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SOX2 expression has been observed in 43% of basal cell-like breast carcinomas and was found to be strongly correlated with CK5/6, EGFR, and vimentin immunoreactivity, suggesting that SOX2 may play a role in conferring a less differentiated phenotype in these tumors (13Rodriguez-Pinilla S.M. Sarrio D. Moreno-Bueno G. Rodriguez-Gil Y. Martinez M.A. Hernandez L. Hardisson D. Reis-Filho J.S. Palacios J. Mod. Pathol. 2007; 20: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). How SOX2 exerts its oncogenic potential is currently unknown. SOX proteins including SOX2 bind to specific DNA sequences (C(T/A)TTG(T/A)(T/A)) by means of their HMG domains in functioning as transcription factors to activate or repress target gene expression (2Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It is currently accepted that SOX proteins themselves do not possess sufficient affinities for DNA binding. Rather, the transcription activity of SOX proteins requires recruitment of other protein partners, which facilitate and stabilize the formation of SOX transcription initiation complexes (2Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In fact, the functional specificities among members of the SOX family and the tissue specificity for a particular SOX protein are believed to be determined largely by the differential partnership of SOX proteins with other proteins (2Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Numerous transcription factors from a wide range of families have been found to partner with SOX proteins (2Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). As stated above, because the partnership of SOX proteins with different protein factors is a crucial element in determining the functional specificity of SOX proteins, it is of great importance to identify partner proteins for different SOX proteins in different tissues to understand the pathophysiological activities of SOX proteins. Another prominent and related issue is the identification of the downstream targets of SOX proteins. To date, investigation of the functions of SOX proteins has concentrated on embryonic development, and information on the physiological functions of SOX proteins in adult tissues, as well as their potential roles in carcinogenesis, is limited. In this study, we found that SOX2 overexpression is a frequent event in breast carcinomas and that the levels of SOX2 expression were strongly correlated with tumor grades and with the levels of cyclin D1 expression in breast carcinoma samples. We demonstrated that SOX2 promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells through facilitating the G1/S transition and through up-regulation of the CCND1 gene. Furthermore, we identified β-catenin as the transcription partner for SOX2 in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that SOX2 synergized with β-catenin in transactivation of the CCND1 gene. Tissue Specimens and Cell Lines—Breast carcinoma tissues were obtained from Peking University Oncology Hospital. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgical removal and maintained at –80 °C until use. All human tissue was collected using protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of the Peking University Health Science Center. The normal human breast epithelia cell lines and the human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Recombinant Retroviral Construction—Recombinant Retro-GFP, Retro-SOX2, and Retro-SOX2 RNAi were generated using the BD Retro-X™ Universal Packaging System (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manual provided by the vendor. The cDNA for full-length SOX2 and the specific oligonucleotide for generating SOX2 siRNA were cloned into the pLNCX2 vector. The resultant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, purified, and co-transfected with the pVSV-G vector into the GP2-293 packaging cell line (BD Biosciences) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Three days after transfection, cell lysates were obtained from the 293 cells. Cell lysates were added to 293 cells again, and when most of the cells had been killed by virus infection and detached, cell lysates were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter. The viral titers were determined according to the procedure provided by the vendor. For cell infection, cells were incubated with viruses at an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 10 for 6 h before fresh medium was added, and cultures were continued for another 48 h. For generation of SOX-overexpressing cells to be transplanted into nude mice, infected cells were grown in the presence of 400 μg/ml of G418 for 3 weeks. Individual drug-resistant clones were collected, pooled, and expanded. Tumor Xenografts—MCF-7 breast cancer cells were plated and infected in vitro with mock, Retro-GFP, Retro-SOX2, or Retro-SOX2 RNAi at an MOI of 100. Forty-eight hours after infection, 5 × 106 viable MCF-7 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were injected into the mammary fat pads of 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Beijing, China). Six animals per group were used in each experiment. 17β-Estradiol pellets (0.72 mg/pellet, 60 day release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were implanted 1 day before the tumor cell injection. Tumors were measured weekly using a vernier caliper, and volume was calculated according to the formula: π /6 × length × width2. Tumors were collected at the time of sacrifice, 8-weeks postretrovirus infection. Deparaffinized sections of tumor tissue were used to assess proliferation using antibodies against Ki-67 (1:200, Zymed Laboratories). Apoptosis was determined using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, POD (Roche Applied Science, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Nuclei that stained brown were scored as positive for apoptosis and blue as negative. All studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Peking University Health Science Center. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously (14Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M.

SOX2 Is Overexpressed in Human Mammary Tumors and Its Level Is Correlated with Tumor Grade—Similar to other developmentally regulated genes, the expression of SOX2 is supposed to be switched off in adulthood.

Palacios J. Mod. Pathol. 2007; 20: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether SOX2 was also expressed in breast cancers. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we screened paraffin-embedded mammary tissue sections from 19 normal and 56 breast cancer patients for the expression of SOX2. The results of these experiments indicated that, while normal mammary epithelial cells displayed none or weak SOX2 staining (Fig. 1A, left panel), breast carcinoma cells were strongly positive for SOX2 staining in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, right panel). To investigate whether there is any association between the expression level of SOX2 and the development and progression of breast tumors, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of primary tumor mRNAs was carried out to determine the relative expression levels of SOX2. We defined the overexpression cut-off value for tumors to be the normalized mean expression of SOX2 in normal tissue plus three times the standard deviation (20Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In 19 normal and 56 primary human breast cancer tissues that we examined, we observed a striking difference in the level of SOX2 expression. According to Bloom and Richardson's classification system (21Bloom H.J. Richardson W.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1957; 11: 359-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar), SOX2 overexpression was observed in 33.3% (3 of 9) of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tumors, 42.3% (11 out of 26) of grade II tumors, and 57.1% (12 of 21) of grade III tumors (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Western blotting analysis of immunoreactive SOX2 in established mammary epithelial cell lines indicated that the levels of SOX2 in breast cancer cell lines were considerably higher than those in the two cell lines (MCF-10A, HBL100) derived from normal mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data suggest that the overexpression of SOX2 might be a frequent event in human breast cancer and that the level of SOX2 expression is correlated with the tumor grade. SOX2 Promotes Proliferation and Tumorigenesis of Breast Cancer Cells—Because of the crucial role of SOX2 in cell proliferation and differentiation, the deregulation of SOX2 expression in breast carcinomas and breast cell lines may have important pathological relevance. Thus, we next investigate the role of SOX2 expression in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. First, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed to examine the effect of SOX2 overexpression or knockdown on cell cycle regulation in mammary carcinoma cells. In these experiments, MCF-7 cells were synchronized at the G0/G1 phases by serum starvation (22Shi B. Liang J. Yang X. Wang Y. Zhao Y. Wu H. Sun L. Zhang Y. Chen Y. Li R. Hong M. Shang Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell cycle profiling by FACS indicated that, after release from thymidine and nocodazole blocking, cells with either SOX2 overexpression or with SOX2 knockdown proceeded through the S and G2 phases with efficiencies and kinetics similar to those of control cells (Fig. 2A, upper panel). However, after release of the cells from G0/G1 arrest, overexpression of SOX2 was associated with an increase in the population of cells in the S+G2/M phases and a concomitant decrease in the population of cells in the G0/G1 phases (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Consistently, knockdown of the expression of SOX2 with siRNA resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phases. Similar results were also observed in one of basal-like breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (data not shown). To confirm that the phenotypic behavior of cells with SOX2 knockdown was specifically caused by loss of SOX2 protein, we sought to “rescue” the effect of the SOX2 RNAi by constitutively expressing murine Sox2 in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A (lower panel), the expression of Sox2 in cells with SOX2 knockdown resulted in an increase in the population of cells in the S+G2/M phases, similar to the profile of the cells co-transfected with a combination of Sox2 and nonspecific siRNA, suggesting that the G0/G1 accumulation of cells with SOX2 knockdown was specifically associated with the loss of SOX2 protein. Collectively, these results indicate that SOX2 promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells by facilitating the G1/S transition. To investigate the role of SOX2 in breast tumorigenesis, retrovirus (retro)-mediated overexpression and knockdown strategy was utilized. Retro-EGFP (retroviruses carrying the EGFP gene), Retro-SOX2 (retroviruses carrying the SOX2 gene), or Retro-SOX2-RNAi (retroviruses carrying an oligonucleotide specific for SOX2 mRNA) were constructed and used to infect MCF-7 cells. Anchorage-independent growth assays demonstrated that SOX2-overexpressing cells exhibited an increase both in the size and number of colonies formed on the soft agar, whereas knockdown of SOX2 expression resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of colony formed (Fig. 2B). The level of SOX2 expression in MCF-7 cells infected with Retro-EGFP, Retro-SOX2, or Retro-SOX2-RNAi was monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 2B, right panel). To assess the role of SOX2 on breast tumorigenesis in vivo, equal numbers of mock-, Retro-EGFP, Retro-SOX2, or Retro-SOX2-siRNA-infected MCF-7 cells were implanted onto the mammary fat pad of athymic BALB/c mice, and the growth of the implanted tumors was measured. The results of these experiments indicated that overexpression of SOX2 was associated with a significant tumor growth over an 8-week period, and knockdown of SOX2 expression resulted in a dramatic reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 2C). The increase/decrease in tumor volume could either be a reflection of enhanced/inhibited cell proliferation or a manifestation of inhibited/enhanced apoptosis. To further elucidate the mechanism by which SOX2 promotes mammary tumor growth, serial xenograft tumor sections were stained with Ki-67 and TUNEL, markers for cellular proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2D (upper panel), compared with the control, tumors with SOX2 overexpression showed more Ki-67-positive nuclei, whereas tumors with SOX2 knockdown exhibited significantly fewer Ki-67-positive nuclei. However, the apoptosis assay revealed no statistically significant difference in the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells between the control and experimental groups (Fig. 2D, lower panel), suggesting that SOX2 was able to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in xenograft models. Taken together, these experiments indicate that SOX2 contributed to breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenic properties both in vitro and in vivo. Molecular Profiling of SOX2 Downstream Targets in Breast Cancer Cells—As stated before, SOX2 is a transcription factor that exerts its biological function through transactivation of its downstream target genes (2Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To further delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the cell proliferation and tumorigenic properties of SOX2, we investigated the gene expression profile in SOX2-overexpressing MCF-7 cells using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix Gene Chip. The microarray analysis identified 145 up-regulated genes and 41 down-regulated genes. The data were analyzed, and genes were classified into cellular signaling pathways that are known to be implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation with the Gene Ontology classification system using DAVID software (supplemental Fig. S1A). These alleles were all up-regulated by SOX2. The microarray results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 7 genes selected to represent different levels of induction, including 4 up-regulated genes (CCND1, FGFR2, SMARCA1, and CXCL10) and 3 down-regulated genes (CSTA, MME, and ZNF407) (supplemental Fig. S1B). Identification of Cyclin D1 as a Downstream Target for SOX2—Among these SOX2-regulated genes, 4(FGFR2, RhoB, CCND1, and RET), all of which were up-regulated by SOX2, are reported to be related to cell growth and proliferation. To further dissect the signaling pathway leading to SOX2-mediated cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were performed in MCF-7 cells in which the expression of SOX2 was silenced while the 4 genes were ectopically individually expressed (gain-of-function) or where SOX2 was overexpressed while the expression of the 4 genes was individually silenced (loss-of-function). The proliferation of MCF-7 cells under these experimental conditions was measured by BrdU incorporation assays. As shown in Fig. 3A, both the gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments revealed that, while FGFR2, RHOB, and RET had marginal effects on SOX2-promoted cell proliferation, the most profound effect was found with CCND1, indicating that CCND1 is an important downstream target in mediating the cell proliferation activity of SOX2. The expression of the proteins was monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Similar results were also observed in one of basal-like breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (data not shown). Next we investigated the regulation of endogenous cyclin D1 protein expression by SOX2 in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, while either overexpression or knockdown of SOX2 had little effect on the expression of other cell cycle-regulated genes including cyclin D3, cyclin E, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1, the expression of cyclin D1 protein was elevated in cells overexpressing SOX2 and inhibited in cells with SOX2 knockdown. These results further support the argument that CCND1 gene is a downstream target for SOX2 in breast cancer cells. To further explore the role of cyclin D1 in mediating SOX2-promoted proliferation of breast cancer cells, we tested whether overexpression of cyclin D1 could alleviate the effect of G0/G1 accumulation under SOX2 knockdown. For this purpose, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with SOX2 siRNA and cyclin D1 expression construct or with SOX2 siRNA plus an empty vector as control. FACS analysis revealed that cyclin D1 transfection in cells with SOX2 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the S+G2/M phases (Fig. 4A, upper panel). On the other hand, even with SOX2 overexpression, knockdown of cyclin D1 expression was associated with a failure in the G1/S transition in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The expression of SOX2, cyclin D1, and other cell cycle-related genes under different experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 4B. These results strongly favor the idea that cyclin D1 is a critical downstream mediator of SOX2 in promoting the G1/S transition and cell proliferation. Correlation of SOX2 and Cyclin D1 Expression in Breast Tumor Samples—As stated before, SOX2 is up-regulated in several types of cancers including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma, and breast cancer (7Dong C.

In light of our observation that SOX2 is capable of upregulating CCND1 expression, it was logical to postulate that the expression of SOX2 is correlated with the expression of CCND1 in primary breast carcinomas. To validate this hypothesis, the expression of CCND1 and SOX2 mRNAs was analyzed by real time RT-PCR in mammary tissues. As shown in Fig. 4C, statistical analysis found a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.725 (p < 0.0001) between the expression of CCND1 and SOX2 mRNAs in the 26 breast carcinoma samples tested, whereas there was no correlation between CCND1 and SOX2 mRNA expression in 19 normal mammary tissue samples. These experiments further substantiate a functional link between SOX2 and cyclin D1 in brea"
https://openalex.org/W2087661112,"During development of multicellular organisms, cells respond to extracellular cues through nonlinear signal transduction cascades whose principal components have been identified. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying specificity of cellular responses remain poorly understood. Spatial distribution of signaling proteins may contribute to signaling specificity. Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the role of the Rab5 effector Appl1, an endosomal protein that interacts with transmembrane receptors and Akt. We show that in zebrafish, Appl1 regulates Akt activity and substrate specificity, controlling GSK-3beta but not TSC2. Consistent with this pattern, Appl1 is selectively required for cell survival, most critically in highly expressing tissues. Remarkably, Appl1 function requires its endosomal localization. Indeed, Akt and GSK-3beta, but not TSC2, dynamically associate with Appl1 endosomes upon growth factor stimulation. We propose that partitioning of Akt and selected effectors onto endosomal compartments represents a key mechanism contributing to the specificity of signal transduction in vertebrate development."

We report here the identification of a member of the tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein-8 (TNFAIP8) family, designated TIPE2, that is required for maintaining immune homeostasis. TIPE2 is preferentially expressed in lymphoid tissues, and its deletion in mice leads to multiorgan inflammation, splenomegaly, and premature death. TIPE2-deficient animals are hypersensitive to septic shock, and TIPE2-deficient cells are hyper-responsive to Toll-like receptor (TLR) and T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Importantly, TIPE2 binds to caspase-8 and inhibits activating protein-1 and nuclear factor-κB activation while promoting Fas-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting caspase-8 significantly blocks the hyper-responsiveness of TIPE2-deficient cells. These results establish that TIPE2 is an essential negative regulator of TLR and TCR function, and its selective expression in the immune system prevents hyperresponsiveness and maintains immune homeostasis.

These results establish that TIPE2 is an essential negative regulator of TLR and TCR function, and its selective expression in the immune system prevents hyperresponsiveness and maintains immune homeostasis. The immune system is frequently bombarded by large quantities of foreign antigens. Upon engaging these antigens through specific receptors, the immune system mounts specific responses characterized by immune cell activation, proliferation, and inflammatory gene expression, all of which in turn lead to inflammation. Upon removal of the antigen, the immune system returns to its preactivation state, ready to respond to new antigens. The strength and the duration of the immune responses must be tightly regulated because uncontrolled inflammation can cause severe tissue injury and death of the organism. Immune homeostasis is the inherent property of the immune system to maintain a constant number of immune cells and to prevent deleterious inflammatory responses despite frequent stimulations by antigens. It ensures that any antigen-precipitated change of the immune system is kept to the minimum so that the immune responses eliminate the antigen in question but do not lead to fatal inflammatory diseases (Van Parijs and Abbas, 1998Van Parijs L. Abbas A.K. Homeostasis and self-tolerance in the immune system: turning lymphocytes off.Science. 1998; 280: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms through which immune homeostasis is maintained are not fully understood, but recent studies indicate that at least two classes of molecules are required. The first class includes molecules that limit the strength of immune cell activation and expansion. These include inhibitory cytokines (such as transforming growth factor [TGF]-β and interleukin [IL]-10), negative regulators of the antigen receptor and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (such as CTLA-4, inhibitor-of-κB, Socs1, and itch), and repressive transcription factors (such as Foxp3) (Van Parijs and Abbas, 1998Van Parijs L.

The second class controls cell death, which includes Fas, Bim, Bax, and the caspases -8 and -10 (Nagata and Suda, 1995Nagata S. Suda T. Fas and Fas ligand: lpr and gld mutations.Immunol.

When these molecules are depleted from the immune system, immune homeostasis fails and severe inflammatory diseases ensue, which in turn lead to premature death of the organism (Van Parijs and Abbas, 1998Van Parijs L.

Because a large number of genes in the mammalian genomes have not yet been characterized, the number and identity of additional genes required for maintaining immune homeostasis are unknown. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8)—also known as SCC-S2, GG2-1, and MDC-3.13—is a recently identified apoptosis regulator (Kumar et al., 2000Kumar D. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U.

Like several other regulators/mediators of apoptosis, TNFAIP8 contains a death effector domain (DED) and is able to inhibit caspase-mediated apoptosis (Kumar et al., 2000Kumar D. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Identification of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible gene, SCC-S2, containing the consensus sequence of a death effector domain of fas-associated death domain-like interleukin- 1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2973-2978Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Knocking down TNFAIP8 expression in tumor cells reduces their tumorigenicity suggesting that it may play a role in oncogenesis (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang C. Chakravarty D. Sakabe I. Mewani R.R. Boudreau H.E. Kumar D. Ahmad I. Kasid U.N. Role of SCC-S2 in experimental metastasis and modulation of VEGFR-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9 expression.Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 947-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of TNFAIP8 is not clear. In an attempt to identify genes that regulate inflammation and immune homeostasis, we analyzed the transcriptome of murine spinal cord before and after the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, using a high-throughput gene microarray technology. We identified more than 100 genes that are highly expressed in inflamed but not normal nervous tissue (Carmody et al., 2002Carmody R. Hilliard B. Chodosh L. Chen Y. Genomic scale profiling of autoimmune inflammation in the central nervous system: the nervous response to inflammation.J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 133: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of these genes shares a high degree of sequence homology with TNFAIP8, which we call TIPE2. Using knockout, knockdown, and gain-of-function approaches, we established that TIPE2 is a negative regulator of immune cell function, required for preventing hyperresponsiveness and maintaining immune homeostasis. To isolate new genes involved in autoimmune inflammation, we used Affymetrix gene chips to examine gene expression profiles of murine spinal cords before and after the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Carmody et al., 2002Carmody R. Hilliard B. Chodosh L. Chen Y. Genomic scale profiling of autoimmune inflammation in the central nervous system: the nervous response to inflammation.J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 133: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This led to the identification of 141 genes that were highly expressed in the inflamed spinal cord but totally absent in normal spinal cord (Carmody et al., 2002Carmody R. Hilliard B. Chodosh L. Chen Y. Genomic scale profiling of autoimmune inflammation in the central nervous system: the nervous response to inflammation.J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 133: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of these genes was represented in the gene bank as the expressed sequence tag (EST) AI847688. By aligning this EST against the mouse EST database in the gene bank using the BLAST sequence homology search program, we identified a putative full-length cDNA, designated TIPE2 TNFAIP8-like 2, with a predicted open reading frame encoding 184 amino acids (Figure S1A). By aligning this sequence against the human EST database in the gene bank using the same BLAST program, we identified a putative TIPE2 human homolog that shares 94% amino acid sequence identity with murine TIPE2 (Figure S1A). Human TIPE2 shares approximately 53% identity and 78% similarity with TNFAIP8 (Kumar et al., 2000Kumar D. Whiteside T.L. Kasid U. Identification of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible gene, SCC-S2, containing the consensus sequence of a death effector domain of fas-associated death domain-like interleukin- 1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2973-2978Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Additionally, TIPE2 contains a putative DED-like domain that shows significant identity/similarity to other known DED sequences (Figure S1B). The identity/similarity shared between DED of murine TIPE2 and those of the following proteins are as follows: TNFAIP8, 50%/73%; murine cFLIP (FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) DED I, 19%/32%; murine cFLIP DED II, 13%/33%; murine caspase-8 DED I, 19%/40%; and murine caspase-8 DED II, 20%/38%. The TIPE2 DED domain resides in its NH2-terminal region (Figure S1). Like other DED-containing proteins, TIPE2 also possesses six putative conserved α helices as determined by NPS Network Protein Sequence Analysis (Combet et al., 2000Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. [email protected]: network protein sequence analysis.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Besides TIPE2, two additional members of the TNFAIP8 family may exist, which share high degrees of sequence homology with TIPE2 and are designated in the gene bank as TNFAIP8L1 (TIPE1) and TNFAIP8L3 (TIPE3). Thus, the TNFAIP8 family may consist of at least four members. The chromosome location of TIPE2 was then determined by aligning the murine and human TIPE2 sequences with murine and human genome databases, respectively. A single locus was identified for murine TIPE2 on chromosome III (3f1–3f3) and for human TIPE2 on chromosome I (1q21.2–1q21.3). To determine the expression pattern of TIPE2, total RNA was extracted from tissues of perfused normal and EAE mice, fractionated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane. The RNA was then hybridized with the full-length TIPE2 cDNA probe. A ∼1.1 kb transcript was detected in the thymus, spleen, lymph node, and small intestine, but not in the liver, heart, muscle, testis, spinal cord, or brain of normal mice. By contrast, high levels of TIPE2 mRNA were detected in the spinal cord of mice with EAE (Figure 1A). Furthermore, a weak TIPE2 signal was also detected in the lung, skin and colon, which all contain lymphoid tissues. Therefore, TIPE2 detected in the inflamed spinal cord is likely expressed by infiltrating cells of the immune system. To determine which cell type expresses TIPE2, we performed northern blot and/or PCR analysis of a panel of cell preparations (Figures 1B–1E). We found that macrophages, B, and T lymphocytes of various developmental stages, constitutively expressed TIPE2 (Figures 1C and S2). One of the two T cell lines (EL-4) and two of the macrophage cell lines (RAW 264.7 and Wehi 274.1) expressed TIPE2. By contrast, neither NIH 3T3 fibroblasts nor myeloma cell lines (SP2/0 and OKT3) constitutively expressed TIPE2. However, following stimulation with TNF-α, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressed detectable levels of TIPE2 mRNA (Figure 1E). Thus, TIPE2 is preferentially expressed by lymphoid and myeloid cells but may be induced in other cell types by TNF-α. To elucidate the roles of TIPE2 in vivo, we generated TIPE2-deficient mice by deleting both exons of the TIPE2 gene through homologous recombination (Figure S3). The TIPE2 mRNA is completely absent in mice homozygous for the gene mutation (Figure S3C). Mice homozygous for the TIPE2 gene mutation developed normally and were born with the expected Mendelian ratio. However, starting from approximately 2 months of age, many TIPE2−/− mice became chronically ill, characterized by body weight loss, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and multiorgan inflammation. By the end of month 11, ∼50% of TIPE2−/− mice died of the disease (Figure 2A). Histological examinations revealed severe mononuclear cell infiltration in multiple organs including lung (Figure 2D), liver, and intestine starting approximately 3 months after the birth. The splenic microarchitecture was also destroyed due to the enlargement of the white pulps. Serological testing showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α as well as the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 in the blood of TIPE2−/− but not TIPE2+/+ mice (Figure 2B). By contrast, the total amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) of various isotypes remained largely unchanged in 4-month-old TIPE2−/− mice with the exception of IgG2a and IgG2b, which were reduced as compared to those of control littermates (Figure S4). This indicates that class switching of certain Ig isotypes may be disrupted in aged TIPE2−/− mice, which could be secondary to the diseased conditions of these mice. Importantly, no increase in seral antibodies to single- or double-stranded DNA was detected in 4-month-old TIPE2−/− mice. Splenomegaly and leukocytosis were caused by an increase in the numbers of both myeloid and lymphoid cells including CD11b+, B220+, and CD4+ cells (Figure 3). A significantly greater number of splenocytes in TIPE2−/− mice expressed the early activation marker CD69 (Figure 3D) as compared to wild-type (WT) littermates, suggesting heightened cell activation. All mice were kept in a pathogen-free environment. Recombination activating gene (RAG)-1-deficient mice with no lymphoid cells were housed in the same environment and did not develop spontaneous infectious diseases. We were unable to identify any infectious agents in sick TIPE2−/− mice by culture, histochemistry, and routine serological testing.Figure 3Characteristics of TIPE2-Deficient Mice: Wild-Type (n = 11) and TIPE2-Deficient Littermates (n = 11) Were Sacrificed at 4 Months of Age and Tested for the Following ParametersShow full caption(A) Body and spleen weights.(B) Blood leukocyte counts and splenocyte counts.(C) B220+, CD4+, and CD11b+ splenocyte counts by flow cytometry following staining cells with respective antibodies.(D) Percentages of CD69+ splenocytes in B220+ and B220− subpopulations.

To determine whether TIPE2 gene mutation affects immunity, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses in TIPE2−/− mice using the following three experimental systems: (1) lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection (Figure 4), (2) ovalbumin (OVA) immunization with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Figure S5), and (3) Listeria monocytogenes infection. We found that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses were significantly augmented in TIPE2−/− mice as compared to their littermate controls. This was reflected in the number of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen (Figures 4A and 4B), cytokines released by LCMV- or OVA-specific cells in the culture (Figures 4C and S5), and cytokines in the sera of mice infected with Listeria (data not shown). In contrast to the enhanced cellular immunity, humoral immunity in TIPE2−/− mice remained largely undisturbed. Immunization of young TIPE2−/− mice with OVA induced similar levels of OVA-specific antibodies as compared to their control littermates (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that cellular but not humoral immunity is significantly disrupted in TIPE2−/− mice. As further discussed below, this dichotomy is likely due to the receptor-specific—but not cell-specific—functions of TIPE2. In vitro, purified TIPE2−/− T cells were hyperreactive to T cell receptor (TCR) ligation and produced significantly higher levels of Th17 cytokines as compared to WT controls (Figure 4D). The production of Th1 cytokine IFN-γ and Th2 cytokine IL-4 was also increased to various degrees in TIPE2−/− cultures, but no significant changes in T cell proliferation were apparent. In addition to cytokines, CD25, CD44, and CD69 expression was also higher in TIPE2 knockout T cells activated in Figure 4D. Specifically, the percentages of T cells that expressed CD25, CD44, and CD69 at the end of the culture increased from 60 ± 12, 50 ± 11 and 64 ± 11 in the wild-type group to 87 ± 1.4, 72 ± 2 and 90 ± 1.1 in the knockout group, respectively (p < 0.02) (Figure S6). Cells used in these experiments were from 4- to 5-week-old mice that did not have detectable inflammatory diseases or increased numbers of CD69+ activated cells. These results indicate that TIPE2 may negatively regulate T cell activation. To further test this theory, we utilized a retrovirus-mediated gene transfer system that allows stable TIPE2 gene transfer into hematopoietic cells. We found that the expression of the activation marker CD69 and cytokine IFN-γ was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing TIPE2 following stimulation with the specific antigen (Figure S7). This was accompanied by a small but detectable reduction in the activation marker CD44 expression in these cells (Figure S7). Furthermore, cell division was also reduced in cells overexpressing TIPE2, indicating that TIPE2 may regulate mitosis under certain conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that TIPE2 is able to inhibit TCR-mediated T cell activation. To determine the potential roles of TIPE2 in innate immune responses to TLR ligands, we studied TIPE2 knockout and knockdown cells in vitro. Upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bone marrow-derived TIPE2−/− macrophages produced significantly more IL-6 and IL-12 than wild-type cells, with relatively normal amounts of TNF-α (Figure 5A). Similarly, knocking down TIPE2 expression in the RAW 264.7 macrophages significantly increased the levels of IL-6 protein (Figure 5C) and mRNA (Figure 5D). The effect of TIPE2 knockdown is not limited to LPS because responses to three additional TLR ligands were also significantly increased in the knockdown macrophages (Figure 5E). Furthermore, TIPE2−/− splenic B cells expressed significantly more IL-1β and TNF-α than wild-type B cells upon stimulation with LPS or CpG (cytosine guanine nucleotides) (Figure S8, A and B), indicating that the innate immune function of TIPE2−/− B cells is also augmented. By contrast, anti-IgM-induced TNF-α expression was not affected by TIPE2 deficiency (Figure S8B). Proliferation, apoptosis, and Ig secretion of B cells treated with anti-IgM were not significantly different between wild-type and TIPE2−/− groups (data not shown). Thus, TIPE2 may regulate innate but not adaptive B cell responses. This may explain why humoral immunity is not significantly disrupted in TIPE2−/− mice (Figure S4). It is to be noted that TNF-α is significantly affected by TIPE2 deficiency in B cells but not in macrophages treated with TLR ligands. This indicates that TIPE2 may regulate TNF-α expression in a cell-specific manner. Differences between B cells and macrophages in their usage of transcription factors and signaling molecules are likely responsible for this cell-specific effect of TIPE2 on TNF-α. If TIPE2 deficiency enhances TLR activation, will it subject mice to septic shock? To address this question, we studied LPS-induced sepsis in mice that were injected with a low-dose LPS. We found that septic shock was dramatically accelerated and exacerbated in TIPE2−/−mice as compared to wild-type controls. This was reflected by a sharp decline in the survival rate (0% versus 91%), a significant increase in seral IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12p40 (Figure 6), and severe multiorgan necrosis in TIPE2−/− mice (data not shown). Because mice used in these experiments were only 5 to 6 weeks old, not suffering from the inflammatory syndrome described above, these data indicate that TIPE2 is directly responsible for preventing septic shock. Most cytokines affected by TIPE2 deficiency or knockdown are targets of two major signaling pathways downstream of both TCR and TLR, i.e., the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the NF-κB pathways. To determine whether TIPE2 regulates these two pathways, we performed biochemical analyses of key signaling molecules involved. We found that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and the NF-κB pathway, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, were targets of TIPE2 action. Specifically, TIPE2 knockdown amplified the JNK and p38 pathways at the level of AP-1 binding to DNA (Figure S9A), c-Fos, and c-Jun nuclear translocation (Figure 7A), as well as JNK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation (Figures 7A and 7B). Similarly, TIPE2 knockdown enhanced NF-κB nuclear translocation (Figure S10) and inhibitor-of-κB (IκB) phosphorylation (Figure 7A); NF-κB binding to DNA was also increased in resting TIPE2 knockdown cells suggesting that TIPE2 may regulate the basal levels of the NF-κB activity (Figure S9B). By contrast, little or no difference in ERK activation was noted between wild-type and TIPE2 knockdown cells (Figure 7A). Consistent with these results, JNK and p38 activities were also significantly increased in TIPE2 knockout T cells as compared to wild-type controls (Figure S11A). In TIPE2 knockout macrophages, significant increases in IκBα degradation and phosphorylation were observed 15–60 min after LPS stimulation, whereas increases in JNK and p38 phosphorylation were noted only at 5 and 120 min after LPS stimulation (Figure S11B). No significant differences in ERK phosphorylation between wild-type and TIPE2 knockout macrophages were noted at any time points tested. Taken together, these data indicate that TIPE2 is a negative regulator of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 pathways. Results discussed above indicate that the point of action of TIPE2 may lie upstream of MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Because TIPE2 has a DED-like domain and certain DED-containing proteins—such as caspase-8—regulate NF-κB activation, we hypothesized that TIPE2 might interact with these proteins. To test this theory, the HA- or FLAG-tagged TIPE2, FLAG-tagged mutant procaspase-8 (the cysteine at position 360 was replaced by serine to abolish its apoptotic activity), and FLAG-tagged Fas-associated death domain (FADD) were expressed in 293 cells following transfection with corresponding expression plasmids (Figure S12). Coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that overexpressed TIPE2 specifically associated with overexpressed or endogenous caspase-8 but not FADD. To confirm this interaction for the endogenous TIPE2 protein, RAW 264.7 macrophage extracts were used to immunoprecipitate TIPE2-binding proteins with a specific anti-TIPE2 antibody. Upon blotting with anti-caspase-8 antibody, a strong caspase-8 signal was detected in the precipitates (Figure 7C). This caspase-8 signal was almost completely absent in the TIPE2 knockdown cells, confirming the specificity of the assay. By contrast, FLIP was not detected in the immunoprecipitates. Robust interactions between endogenous TIPE2 and caspase-8 were observed in both resting and LPS-stimulated RAW cells, with little detectable differences. Therefore, TLR stimulation may not be required for TIPE2 binding to caspase-8. Importantly, both FADD and caspase-8 were normally recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Figure S13) in TIPE2 knockdown cells following Fas ligation. Caspase-8 cleavage was also normal in these cells. By contrast, TIPE2 was not recruited to the DISC (Figure S13). Therefore, the target of TIPE2 action on the apoptotic pathway is likely downstream of caspase-8 or the DISC. These results establish that TIPE2 is a caspase-8-binding protein, which may regulate caspase-8-dependent functions. In addition to inducing apoptosis, caspase-8 is also crucial for lymphocyte and myeloid cell activation, presumably through regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway (Bidere et al., 2006Bidere N. Snow A.L. Sakai K. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Caspase-8 regulation by direct interaction with TRAF6 in T cell receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation.Curr.

Blocking caspase-8 activation with a specific caspase-8 inhibitor impeded the phosphorylation of IκBα, but not that of ERK, JNK, or p38 (Figure S14) (data not shown). To determine whether caspase-8 played any role in TIPE2 functioning, we blocked caspase-8 activity in wild-type and TIPE2 knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophages using the caspase-8 inhibitor. By flow cytometry, we found that caspase-8 blockade significantly diminished the hyperresponsiveness of TIPE2 knockdown cells (Figure 7D). Both the percentage of IL-6-producing cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of IL-6 were reduced. Significant reduction in IL-6 levels in the culture supernatants were also observed by ELISA (data not shown). These data indicate that TIPE2 may inhibit NF-κB activation by enzymatically active caspase-8 (Bidere et al., 2006Bidere N. Snow A.L. Sakai K. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J.

We have investigated whether positional identity, a fundamental organizing principle governing the generation of neuronal subtype diversity, is also relevant to astrocyte diversification. We identified three positionally distinct subtypes of white-matter astrocytes (WMA) in the spinal cord, which can be distinguished by the combinatorial expression of Reelin and Slit1. These astrocyte subtypes derive from progenitor domains expressing the homeodomain transcription factors Pax6 and Nkx6.1, respectively. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicate that the positional identity of these astrocyte subtypes is controlled by Pax6 and Nkx6.1 in a combinatorial manner.

A central problem in neural development is to elucidate the mechanisms that control the ontogenetic diversification of neuronal and glial subtypes in the central nervous system (CNS). In the last decade, positional identity has emerged as one of the fundamental organizing principles governing neuronal subtype diversification. In the ventral spinal cord, for example, molecularly distinct subtypes of motoneurons (MNs) and interneurons (INs) are generated from spatially segregated domains of progenitor cells, arranged along the dorsoventral axis of the ventricular zone (VZ) (Burrill et al., 1997Burrill J.D. Moran L. Goulding M.D. Saueressig H.

While astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the CNS, play varied functional roles (reviewed in Fields and Stevens-Graham, 2002Fields R.D. Stevens-Graham B.

The existence of different subtypes of astrocytes, such as fibrous and protoplasmic, has long been recognized based on morphologic (Vaughn and Pease, 1967Vaughn J.E. Pease D.C.

However, these subtypes are thought to spatially segregate primarily according to their location in either gray or white matter (Miller and Raff, 1984Miller R.H. Raff M.C. Fibrous and protoplasmic astrocytes are biochemically and developmentally distinct.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that spinal cord astrocytes may exhibit regional distinctions, based on studies of astrocyte phenotypes in vitro (reviewed in Miller et al., 1994Miller R.H. Zhang H. Fok-Seang J. Glial cell heterogeneity in the mammalian spinal cord.Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 225-231PubMed Google Scholar), but whether such phenotypes are positionally distinct in vivo or established by positional specification mechanisms was not established. Morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes have been identified in different layers of the olfactory bulb (Bailey and Shipley, 1993Bailey M.S. Shipley M.T. Astrocyte subtypes in the rat olfactory bulb: Morphological heterogeneity and differential laminar distribution.J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 328: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and astrocytes with different electrophysiological properties have been described in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 (D'Ambrosio et al., 1998D'Ambrosio R.

However, with few molecular markers to differentiate these subtypes in vivo (Sharif et al., 2004Sharif A. Renault F. Beuvon F. Castellanos R. Canton B. Barbeito L. Junier M.P. Chneiweiss H. The expression of PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa) defines subpopulations of astrocytes and neurons throughout the adult mouse brain.Neuroscience. 2004; 126: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to study their ontogeny, phenotypic stability, and function. There is some evidence for positional heterogeneity among astrocyte precursors in the spinal cord. The bHLH transcription factor SCL is specifically expressed in the p2 progenitor domain (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. A homeodomain protein code specifies Progenitor cell identity and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2000; 101: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and is required for generic aspects of astrocyte differentiation within this domain (Muroyama et al., 2005Muroyama Y. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Rowitch D.H. Specification of astrocytes by bHLH protein SCL in a restricted region of the neural tube.Nature. 2005; 438: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, these data did not provide evidence that differentiated p2-derived astrocytes are phenotypically distinct from those derived from other progenitor domains. Expression of FGFR3 is initially restricted to p2-derived astrocyte precursors (Pringle et al., 2003Pringle N.P. Yu W.-P. Howell M. Colvin J.S. Ornitz D.M. Richardson W.D.

Here we identify three positional distinct subpopulations of white-matter astrocytes (WMAs) in the ventral spinal cord, and characterize a homeodomain code that is required for their specification in the ventricular zone. Our data indicate that positional identity is an organizing feature of astrocyte, as well as neuronal, diversity in the CNS and is controlled by similar molecular mechanisms. We initially identified Reelin and Slit1 as astrocyte markers in a gene expression-profiling screen for targets of Olig2. In Olig2 mutants, Olig2+ progenitors generate astrocytes instead of oligodendrocytes, at gliogenic stages (Lu et al., 2002Lu Q.R. Sun T. Zhu Z. Ma N. Garcia M. Stiles C.D. Rowitch D.H.

In situ hybridization to embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) spinal cord sections indicated that Reelin and Slit1 mRNAs are expressed by a subset of cells at the margins of the white matter (Figures 1A and 1F, arrows). To confirm that Reelin and Slit1 are expressed by WMAs, we performed double-labeling studies using the generic astrocyte markers GFAP, a glial-specific intermediate filament, or NFIA, a nuclear protein expressed in differentiated astrocytes and their precursors (Deneen et al., 2006Deneen B.

In the white matter of E18.5 spinal cord, both Reelin and Slit1 were expressed by astrocytes (Figures 1B–1E and 1G–1J, arrowheads), but not by Olig2+ oligodendrocytes (data not shown).

The morphology of both Reelin+ and Slit1+ white-matter cells is characteristic of WMAs (Liuzzi and Miller, 1987Liuzzi F.J. Miller R.H. Radially oriented astrocytes in the normal adult rat spinal cord.Brain Res. 1987; 403: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with NFIA+ nuclei localized at the subpial surface (Figures 1E and 1J, arrowheads) and radially oriented GFAP+ processes projecting inward (Figures 1C and 1H, arrowheads; see also Figure S1). Unexpectedly, we found that Reelin and Slit1 were not expressed by all astrocytes, but rather by positionally distinct subsets in the ventral white matter. Reelin was expressed in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral white matter, but not in astrocytes close to the ventral midline (Figures 1A and 1B; arrow and arrowhead, respectively). Slit1, conversely, was expressed in astrocytes in the ventromedial and ventrolateral white matter, but not in the dorsolateral white matter (Figures 1F and 1G; arrow and arrowhead, respectively). Double labeling for Reelin and Slit1 revealed the existence of three adjacent domains of WMAs: a dorso-lateral domain of Reelin+, Slit1− cells; a ventro-lateral domain of Reelin+, Slit1+ cells; and a ventro-medial domain of Slit1+, Reelin− cells (Figure 1K). For convenience, we refer to these subpopulations henceforth as ventral astrocyte subtypes 1, 2, and 3 (VA1, VA2, and VA3, respectively; Figures 1K and 1P). Quantification indicated that each of these three subpopulations is present in roughly equal numbers (Figure 1L). In principle, VA1–VA3 phenotypes could be established after astrocyte precursors migrate to the WM, under the influence of local environmental cues, or could be specified by positional mechanisms prior to emigration from the VZ. As a first step toward addressing this question, we asked whether Reelin and Slit1 were expressed by positionally distinct subsets of astrocyte precursors within the neuroepithelium. Examination of spinal cord sections at E13.5, a stage when most astrocyte precursors have been specified in the ventral VZ (Shibata et al., 1997Shibata T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Ikenaka K. Wada K.

Triple labeling for Reelin, Slit1-GFP, and NFIA indicated that Reelin and Slit1 are expressed by NFIA+ glial precursors (Figures 1M and 1N, arrowheads) and that the domains of their expression partially overlap (Figure 1O). This partial overlap subdivides the ventral-most VZ into three domains: a dorsal-most Reelin+, Slit1− domain; a more ventral Reelin+, Slit1+ domain; and a ventro-medial Reelin−, Slit1+ domain (Figure 1O). The spatial organization of these progenitor domains, which we refer to as pA1, pA2, and pA3, respectively, therefore mirrors that of the VA1, VA2, and VA3 domains in the WM (Figure 1P). Our microarray analysis also indicated that Pax6 mRNA was upregulated, together with Reelin and Slit1, in the Olig1,2−/− population. Double-labeling experiments indicated that Pax6 marks a subpopulation of astrocytes in the ventro-lateral white matter (Figures 2A–2D), whose distribution is similar to that of Reelin+ astrocytes (Figures 2E–2F). Pax6+ cells constitute approximately 40% of all GFAP+ and NF1A+ WMAs (Figures 2A–2D and 2L). Double labeling for Reelin and Pax6 confirmed that 100% of Reelin+ astrocytes coexpress Pax6, suggesting that Pax6 marks the VA1 and VA2 subpopulations (Figures 2E, 2F [arrows], and 2L). Since Slit1+ astrocytes are equally distributed between the VA3 and VA2 populations, ∼50% of Slit1+ astrocytes (VA2) should be Pax6+, and this was indeed the case (Figure 2H [arrow versus arrowhead] and 2L). Pax6 was excluded from the ventro-medial domain of Slit1 expression (Figure 2G), corresponding to the VA3 subset. In the VZ at E13.5, triple labeling for Pax6, Reelin, and Slit1 indicated that the spatial relationship between expression of the HD factor and the two astrocyte markers was similar to that observed in the white matter at E18.5: Pax6 overlapped with all of the Reelin-expressing progenitors (Figure 2I) and a subset of the Slit1-expressing progenitors (Figure 2J). To investigate whether Pax6+ cells in the VZ are precursors of Pax6+ WMAs, we pulse-labeled embryos at E13.5 with BrdU, and chased to E15.5 or E18.5. We observed a progressive shift in the distribution of both total Pax6+ cells, and of BrdU-labeled Pax6+ cells, from the VZ to the mantle zone (MZ) to the WM, during the chase period (Figure S2J and S2K). The proportion of Pax6+ cells in the WM increased ∼2.5-fold from E15.5 to E18.5, and this increase could be quantitatively accounted for by assuming that, during the same interval, Pax6+ cells in the VZ migrate to the MZ, and from the MZ to the WM (see Figure S2 and its corresponding legend). The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that at least some Pax6+ cells in the E13.5 VZ are precursors of Pax6+ WMAs. Pax6 has been shown to control the positional identity of a subset of INs in the ventral spinal cord (Burrill et al., 1997Burrill J.D. Moran L. Goulding M.D. Saueressig H. PAX2 is expressed in multiple spinal cord interneurons, including a population of EN1+ interneurons that require PAX6 for their development.Development. 1997; 124: 4493-4503PubMed Google Scholar, Ericson et al., 1997Ericson J. Rashbass P. Schedl A. Brenner-Morton S. Kawakami A. van Heyningen V. Jessell T.M. Briscoe J. Pax6 controls progenitor cell identity and neuronal fate in response to graded Shh signaling.Cell. 1997; 90: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether it might also play a role in the determination of astrocyte positional identity. Pax6lacZ/lacZ homozygous mutants (St-Onge et al., 1997St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for differentiation of glucagon-producing [alpha]-cells in mouse pancreas.Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) exhibited a striking reduction in Reelin mRNA expression in the ventro-lateral white matter at E18.5, while expression in the gray matter appeared only modestly reduced (Figures 3A and 3B, versus 3E and 3F; arrows versus arrowheads, respectively). Immunostaining confirmed a loss of Reelin expression in GFAP+ and NFIA+ astrocytes (Figures 3C and 3D versus 3G and 3H; arrows versus arrowheads). Quantification indicated a strong and statistically significant reduction in both the percentage (Figure 3I) and absolute number (Figure 3J) of Reelin+ astrocytes, using either GFAP or NFIA as counterstains. We detected no reduction in the total number of astrocytes in the spinal cord of E18.5 Pax6 mutant embryos (Figure 3J, GFAP+ and NFIA+), consistent with an earlier analysis using GLAST as a generic astrocyte marker (Ogawa et al., 2005Ogawa Y. Takebayashi H. Takahashi M. Osumi N. Iwasaki Y. Ikenaka K. Gliogenic radial glial cells show heterogeneity in the developing mouse spinal cord.Dev. Neurosci. 2005; 27: 364-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since Reelin+ cells constitute ∼60% of all ventral WMAs, this argues against the idea that Reelin+ astrocytes selectively die in the absence of Pax6; otherwise there should be a measureable reduction in overall astrocyte number. However, it is possible that the mutation could cause the selective death of Pax6+ astrocytes, which is then compensated by the expansion of other, Pax6−, astrocyte subpopulations. To address this possibility, we employed the marker gene lacZ, present in the Pax6 knockout allele (St-Onge et al., 1997St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for differentiation of glucagon-producing [alpha]-cells in mouse pancreas.Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) to trace the fate of Pax6+ cells in the absence of Pax6 function. The percentage of Pax6+ or β-gal+ cells that expressed GFAP or NFIA was identical in wild-type and mutant embryos, respectively (Figure 3I; GFAP+, [Pax6+ or β-gal+]; NFIA+ [Pax6+ or β-gal+]). Thus, the loss of Pax6 did not produce a failure of generic astrocyte differentiation by Pax6+ cells. Furthermore, the absolute number of GFAP+, Pax6+ (or GFAP+-β-gal+) cells was unaffected in the mutant (Figure 3J; [Pax6+ or β-gal+], GFAP+), confirming that there was no selective death of Pax6+ astrocytes. However, there was a strong reduction in the percentage of Pax6-β-gal+ cells that were Reelin+ in the mutant, compared to wild-type (Figure 3I, Reelin+/[Pax6+ or β-gal+]). Taken together, these data indicate that Pax6 is required for the expression of Reelin in VA1 and VA2 astrocytes, but not for their generic differentiation to astrocytes, migration to the white matter or survival. The foregoing analysis left open the question of whether the loss of Pax6 function simply caused a failure of Reelin expression by astrocytes, or rather a change in the positional identity of VA1 astrocytes. In the latter case, one might expect that presumptive VA1 astrocytes would acquire a Slit1+ phenotype. Due to a lack of adequate antibodies to Slit1, we intercrossed the Pax6-lacZ mice with Slit1-GFP mice, and analyzed the expression of Slit1-GFP in Pax6 mutants (SlitGFP/+; Pax6lacZ/lacZ). In Pax6 mutant embryos, there was a significant increase in the percentage of GFAP+ or NFIA+ astrocytes that expressed Slit1-GFP (Figure 3Q, red bars). Moreover, the spatial domain of Slit1-GFP expression appeared to expand dorsally in the mutant (Figures 3K–3M versus 3N–3P; arrows). Most importantly, the percentage of Pax6+ astrocytes that expressed Slit1 increased from approximately 50%–60% in wild-type embryos to virtually 100% in the mutant (Figure 3Q, Slit1+/Pax6+ or β-gal+), reflecting the acquisition of Slit1 expression by dorsal Pax6-β-gal+ cells (Figures 3M and 3P, arrows). Taken together, these data indicate that in the absence of Pax6 function, not only is Reelin expression lost, but Slit1 expression is derepressed, in VA1-type astrocytes (Figure 3R). This suggests that loss of Pax6 causes a ventralization of the VA1 domain, such that supernumerary VA3 astrocytes are now found in a more dorsal, ectopic location, analogous to the phenotypes of other spinal cord patterning mutations that change the number and distribution of interneuron subtypes (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M.

Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002Shirasaki R. Pfaff S.L. Transcriptional codes and the control of neuronal identity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 251-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Pax6 plays an instructive role in regulating the expression of markers of astrocyte positional identity, we performed in vivo gain-of-function experiments in the embryonic chick neural tube. We first examined Reelin and Slit1 expression in the unmanipulated E12 chick spinal cord to confirm that these genes labeled subsets of WMAs, as in the mouse. We observed white-matter domains containing Reelin+/Slit1−, Reelin+/Slit1+ and Reelin−/Slit1+ VA1–VA3, astrocytes, as in the mouse (Figure S3). We therefore examined the effect of Pax6 misexpression on these ventral astrocyte populations. The spinal cord of E2 chick embryos was electroporated with replication competent RCAS(B) retroviruses carrying either the chick Pax6 or GFP genes. Electroporated embryos were harvested and analyzed at E12, following 10 days of development in ovo. Pax6 misexpression significantly increased the percentage of Reelin+ cells among NFIA+ cells in the white matter, compared with control GFP misexpressing embryos (Figure 4F versus 4H, WM; Figure 4CC, Reelin, E). The total number of NFIA+ astrocytes was not affected by Pax6 electroporation (data not shown). These data indicate that Pax6 is sufficient, as well as necessary, for Reelin expression by ventral astrocytes in vivo. Because we observed Pax6+, Reelin+ cells in the VZ as well as in the white matter (Figure 2I); we also asked whether misexpression of Pax6 could promote a ventral expansion of the domain of Reelin expression in this germinal layer. We therefore examined embryos at E5, a stage at which ventral VZ progenitors are specified for a glial fate (Shibata et al., 1997Shibata T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Ikenaka K. Wada K. Tanaka K. Inoue Y.

https://openalex.org/W2007074774,"According to the prevailing view, mammalian X chromosomes are enriched in spermatogenesis genes expressed before meiosis and deficient in spermatogenesis genes expressed after meiosis. The paucity of postmeiotic genes on the X chromosome has been interpreted as a consequence of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)--the complete silencing of genes on the XY bivalent at meiotic prophase. Recent studies have concluded that MSCI-initiated silencing persists beyond meiosis and that most genes on the X chromosome remain repressed in round spermatids. Here, we report that 33 multicopy gene families, representing approximately 273 mouse X-linked genes, are expressed in the testis and that this expression is predominantly in postmeiotic cells. RNA FISH and microarray analysis show that the maintenance of X chromosome postmeiotic repression is incomplete. Furthermore, X-linked multicopy genes exhibit a similar degree of expression as autosomal genes. Thus, not only is the mouse X chromosome enriched for spermatogenesis genes functioning before meiosis, but in addition, approximately 18% of mouse X-linked genes are expressed in postmeiotic cells."

These cues provide advance warning about deteriorating environmental conditions, allowing the heterotrophs to prepare for adversity while conditions are still favorable. Many plant molecules interact with and modulate key regulators of mammalian physiology in ways that are beneficial to health, but why? We propose that heterotrophs (animals and fungi) are able to sense chemical cues synthesized by plants and other autotrophs in response to stress. These cues provide advance warning about deteriorating environmental conditions, allowing the heterotrophs to prepare for adversity while conditions are still favorable. That plants make substances of benefit to human health has been known for millennia. One-third of the current top 20 drugs on the market are plant derived and every week, it seems, another plant molecule is found to be good for our health. But why should the plant kingdom be such a pharmacological cornucopia? The question is more than of academic interest. The global economy and human health depend largely on our ability to find new and effective medicines. Yet, surprisingly little attention has been given to understanding why plants synthesize so many compounds that provide health benefits to other organisms. Despite the success of plant molecules as drugs, they are losing favor among drug developers. One reason is the easier patentability of new chemical entities (NCEs), and the other is the perceived “dirtiness” of plant molecules. A molecule is considered “dirty” if it interacts with numerous endogenous proteins. Such compounds presumably are more likely to have negative “off-target” effects than a molecule that specifically targets one protein. Flying in the face of this dogma are examples of plant molecules that, despite interacting with multiple human enzymes and receptors, are surprisingly safe (Corson and Crews, 2007Corson T.W. Crews C.M. Cell. 2007; 130: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These molecules can impart a spectrum of reinforcing health benefits. Take for example salicylic acid (SA), which the Greek physician Hippocrates wrote about in the 5th century: a bitter powder extracted from willow bark that eases aches and pains and reduces fevers. In 1763, Reverend Edward Stone tested the bark of the white willow (Salix alba) for treating fever and concluded that it is a “very efficacious” remedy. Then, a variety of salicylates were isolated from different plants and found to help in the treatment of gout, rheumatic fever, pain, swelling, and arthritis. Today, 45,000 metric tons of the acetylated derivative of SA, also known as “aspirin,” are consumed worldwide each year to treat a variety of human ailments. Salicylates are just one example of dozens of known plant bioactives that produce wide-ranging health benefits in humans by interacting with more than one endogenous protein. Another interesting bioactive is resveratrol, a small polyphenol produced by numerous plant species in response to stress, which famously is present in red wine. In mammals, resveratrol directly modulates over two dozen enzymes and receptors, is surprisingly nontoxic, and protects rodent models against cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes while boosting endurance (Baur and Sinclair, 2006Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar, Westphal et al., 2007Westphal C.H. Dipp M.A. Guarente L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 555-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Some proteins are inhibited by resveratrol whereas others are activated in a manner conducive to health (Figure 1). Similarly, green tea polyphenols, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), promote cell-cycle arrest, increase apoptosis, disable multidrug resistance pumps, and reportedly provide a large number of health benefits in animal models and in some human epidemiological studies (Khan et al., 2006Khan N. Afaq F. Saleem M. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2500-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Even the common molecule curcumin from turmeric has been found to influence over 60 molecular targets implicated primarily in tumorigenesis (Goel et al., 2008Goel A. Kunnumakkara A.B. Aggarwal B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 75: 787-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Given this wealth of data and the importance of finding new medicines, it is surprising that we understand so little about why many plant molecules are safe and beneficial to health. The main theory is that the biosynthetic pathways for signaling compounds originated in a common ancestor of plants and animals (Kushiro et al., 2003Kushiro T. Nambara E. McCourt P. Nature. 2003; 422: 122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After the divergence of these two kingdoms, signaling molecules are thought to have been conserved due to structural constraints, such as having the same biosynthetic precursor molecules and needing to interact with protein receptor-binding pockets whose origins also predate the divergence (Kushiro et al., 2003Kushiro T. Nambara E. McCourt P. Nature. 2003; 422: 122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A particularly notable example of signaling conservation is the role played by fatty acid oxidation products in the wound responses of both plants and animals (Schultz, 2002Schultz J.C. Integr. Comp. Biol. 2002; 42: 454-462Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These signaling molecules are produced by similar synthetic pathways in plants and animals (e.g., jasmonic acid in plants, prostaglandins in animals), resulting in analogous downstream effects (herbivore resistance in plants, inflammation and immune responses in animals). Interestingly, the biological role of SA in plants as an endogenous negative regulator of jasmonic acid synthesis parallels its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in mammals by binding to COX-1 and COX-2 (Schultz, 2002Schultz J.C. Integr. Comp. Biol. 2002; 42: 454-462Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Schultz has suggested that the shared signaling heritage or convergence of plants and animals enables plants to, for example, mount signaling-based chemical defenses against herbivores while allowing herbivores, in turn, to sabotage those defensive measures. This evolutionary back and forth has been termed “phylogenetic espionage” (Schultz, 2002Schultz J.C. Integr. Comp. Biol. 2002; 42: 454-462Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although there is considerable validity to this theory, there is accumulating evidence that this may not be the entire story. There are abundant examples of interactions between plant and animal molecules that cannot be readily explained by the “common origin” hypothesis. For example, why do some plant signaling molecules interact directly with animal enzymes and promote health despite having no apparent homolog or chemical relative in animals? One could argue that these molecular interactions are simply a fortuitous coincidence, with the vast majority of plant molecules being either toxic or producing no benefit to animals. Indeed, given the immensity of the chemical space occupied by plant secondary metabolites, such a view seems plausible. However, several factors suggest that selection, rather than mere coincidence, may be at work. Let us examine, as an example, members of one broad chemical class in plant foodstuffs that confer human health benefits: the polyphenols. The synthesis of polyphenols (and many other phytochemicals) is induced in plants by a variety of environmental stresses. Polyphenol content provides a chemical signature of the state of the environment. This chemical cocktail, when ingested, comes into intimate contact with the receptors and enzymes within the consumer. The fact that stress-induced plant compounds tend to upregulate pathways that provide stress resistance in animals suggests that plant consumers may have mechanisms to perceive these chemical cues and react to them in ways that are beneficial. We have coined the term xenohormesis to explain this phenomenon (from xenos, the Greek word for stranger, and hormesis, the term for health benefits provided by mild biological stress, such as cellular damage or a lack of nutrition). Our xenohormesis hypothesis proposes that animals and fungi (heterotrophs) have evolved the ability to sense signaling and stress-induced molecules from other species, and that they are under selective pressure to do so (Figure 2). In essence, xenohormesis refers to interspecies hormesis, such that an animal or fungal species uses chemical cues from other species about the status of its environment or food supply to mount a preemptive defense response that increases its chances of survival. But why do we call it xenohormesis instead of hormesis? The reason is that the stress occurs in one organism and the beneficiaries include other organisms that evolved to sense those chemical cues. When it comes to phytochemical consumption, it is important to distinguish xenohormetic effects from straightforward hormetic effects. The latter may result from low doses of “toxins” that cause a moderate biological stress, presumably cellular damage, thereby inducing a beneficial stress response (Mattson and Cheng, 2006Mattson M.P. Cheng A. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At least for mammals and their responses to the more common dietary phytochemicals, we consider this unlikely as the primary mode of action. Compounds such as quercetin, a flavonoid found in apples, tea, and onions, and resveratrol, found in wine and peanuts, are abundant in decidedly nontoxic foodstuffs. Even when administered in pure form, resveratrol and quercetin have remarkably low toxicity (Baur and Sinclair, 2006Baur J.A. Sinclair D.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar). We suggest that the majority of health benefits from phytochemical consumption result not from responses to mild cellular damage or from their antioxidant properties, but rather from the evolutionarily adaptive modulation of the enzymes and receptors of stress-response pathways in mammals (Figure 1). Concurrent with the evolution of highly efficient detoxifying mechanisms or toxic food avoidance behaviors, we propose that there has been selective pressure on animals and fungi to use the “information” content of phytochemicals about the status of the environment. Mechanisms that minimize the dangers of toxins could thus have evolved concurrently without loss of the advantageous ability to use phytochemicals as molecular signals. In other words, the xenohormetic and hormetic modes of action are not mutually exclusive, even for the same compound, and may well function synergistically in response to the complex mixtures of phytochemicals in food. Current evolutionary thinking suggests that when an animal faces adversity, such as reduced food availability or other biological stresses, there is a selective advantage to diverting limited resources away from reproduction and growth into maintenance and defense until the offspring have a better chance of survival. For example, the phenomenon of life-span extension through caloric restriction is thought to be a hormetic response, more specifically a consequence of mechanisms that evolved to promote survival in an environment with poor prospects for reproduction. But what about the advantages of detecting possible future stresses and increasing one's biological defenses while resources remain plentiful? As illustrated by the tale of “the ant and the grasshopper,” there is undoubted survival value in preparing for adversity while conditions are still favorable. Take fasting on alternate days, which can impart many of the same health benefits as caloric restriction (Varady and Hellerstein, 2007Varady K.A. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2007; 86: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation of this result is that this type of fasting replicates a natural circumstance in which increasing food uncertainty “foretells” of impending starvation. A selective advantage lies in the improved survival resulting from getting a head start on defensive preparations, well before starvation occurs. Stress-induced plant molecules such as resveratrol, butein, and fisetin can induce defense responses in fungi, nematodes, flies, fish, and mice, leading to an extended life span (Westphal et al., 2007Westphal C.H. Dipp M.A. Guarente L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 555-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that such molecules are “caloric restriction mimetics” (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). As interpreted in the xenohormesis theory, the molecules send a chemical cue analogous to alternate-day fasting. This cue is an early warning gleaned from the environmental stresses felt by the food supply while that food supply is still available. Indeed, levels of these polyphenols required to extend life span in the laboratory (∼10 μM) are detectable in the leaves and fruits of stressed plants. To understand the xenohormesis theory, it is helpful to consider why plants synthesize secondary metabolites in the first place. The synthesis of most plant secondary metabolites generally coincides with environmental stresses—UV light, lack of nutrients, disease, and predation—but with rare exceptions, their functions are unknown. SA is one phytochemical whose role in stress responses is well understood. SA serves as an endogenous signal that mediates plant defenses against pathogens and stress by inducing the production of “pathogenesis-related” proteins (Nandi et al., 2003Nandi A. Krothapalli K. Buseman C.M. Li M. Welti R. Enyedi A. Shah J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2383-2398Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, SA also confers health benefits on animals, consistent with the xenohormesis hypothesis. Polyphenols are a major group of plant secondary metabolites that encompass a number of chemical classes, including chalcones, stilbenes, flavones, isoflavones, catechins, and anthocyanidins. Interestingly, the majority of these molecules are synthesized by plants in response to stress. Some of the endogenous roles ascribed to polyphenols—such as UV filters, herbivory deterrents, antioxidants, antibiotics, and fungicides (that is, phytoalexin activity)—are simple chemical activities rather than signaling functions. However, members of the flavonoid class of polyphenols are also known to act as signaling molecules in pollen and seed development, auxin transport, transcription, the cell cycle, and interaction with bacterial symbionts (Taylor and Grotewold, 2005Taylor L.P. Grotewold E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 317-323Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Stafford proposed that flavonoids originated as “[plant] physiological regulators or chemical messengers” and that functions such as UV filtration evolved later (Stafford, 1991Stafford H.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 680-685Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In light of emerging evidence for flavonoid signaling (Taylor and Grotewold, 2005Taylor L.P. Grotewold E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 317-323Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar), Stafford's idea now seems prescient. Of particular interest is the finding that a yet-to-be-identified flavonoid-like molecule delays leaf senescence in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Woo et al., 2005Woo H.H. Jeong B.R. Hawes M.C. Biotechnol. Lett. 2005; 27: 365-374Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is reminiscent of life-span extension in fruit flies and budding yeast fed the flavonoid fisetin (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar, Wood et al., 2004Wood J.G. Rogina B. Lavu S. Howitz K. Helfand S.L. Tatar M. Sinclair D. Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Just as some animal lineages have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C or certain amino acids, perhaps animal phyla in general have lost an ancestral capacity to synthesize flavonoid-like “physiological regulators” while retaining the capacity to respond to them. Scan the scientific literature and you will likely read that plant polyphenols, including flavonoids, provide health benefits because of their antioxidant activity. Yet many view the data as unpersuasive: Halliwell and colleagues, for example, have described the evidence as “confusing and equivocal” (Halliwell et al., 2005Halliwell B. Rafter J. Jenner A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 268S-276SPubMed Google Scholar). Most damaging for the antioxidant theory is that the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols does not correlate with their efficacy (Halliwell et al., 2005Halliwell B. Rafter J. Jenner A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 268S-276SPubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, antioxidants as a class of molecules do not provide the life-span extending effects across diverse species that polyphenols do. Similarly damaging is the observation that maximal plasma concentrations of polyphenols, such as resveratrol and quercetin, when provided in the diet are often far lower than the levels required for protection against oxidation (Soleas et al., 1997Soleas G.J. Diamandis E.P. Goldberg D.M. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 30: 91-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2002Yu C. Shin Y.G. Chow A. Li Y. Kosmeder J.W. Lee Y.S. Hirschelman W.H. Pezzuto J.M. Mehta R.G. van Breemen R.B. Pharm. Res. 2002; 19: 1907-1914Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). While it is true that the metabolites of polyphenols can reach ten times higher concentrations in the bloodstream, these compounds tend to have decreased antioxidant activity compared to the parent compound (Halliwell et al., 2005Halliwell B. Rafter J. Jenner A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 268S-276SPubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the observed decreases in reactive oxygen species due to polyphenols are an indirect effect, the result of the induction of defense enzymes such as heme oxygenase (Dore, 2005Dore S. Neurosignals. 2005; 14: 61-70Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unless they generate their own energy, the majority of life forms in the biosphere feed on or live in close proximity to photoautotrophs, that is, plants or other organisms that perform photosynthesis with carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source. In response to changes in their own health and changes in the environment, photoautotrophs generate a variety of secondary metabolites. These molecules could be used by other organisms in the same environment to detect and prepare for environmental changes. In discussing xenohormesis, we have presented evidence from plants and animals, but the concept is by no means limited to these kingdoms. It could equally well apply to chemical stress signals from plants, algae, photosynthetic bacteria, or chemosynthetic bacteria that could be sensed by animals, fungi, some bacteria, some protists, or even parasitic plants. A long-term goal of such research should be to characterize the stress-induced secondary metabolites of those autotrophs that have diverged widely from land plants and to assess their interactions with the enzymes of the heterotrophs (animals and fungi) that feed on them. For example, mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria, among other aquatic microorganisms, that accumulate in the tissues of many marine animals. Synthesis of MAAs in cyanobacteria can be induced by a variety of stresses. The sunscreen and antioxidant functions attributed to MAAs parallel, in many ways, functions attributed to the polyphenols of land plants (Oren and Gunde-Cimerman, 2007Oren A. Gunde-Cimerman N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Are the signaling pathways of MAA-consuming organisms modulated by direct protein interactions with MAAs? Are they more receptive to marine MAAs than to “exotic” substances such as polyphenols from land plants? Answering such questions would test the general applicability of the xenohormesis idea as well as, assuming its validity, providing insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that underlie it. We propose that xenohormetic selective pressure could have been around ever since the various phyla diverged and influenced the structure of animal enzymes and receptors. We do not mean to suggest that autotrophs produce metabolites to benefit the heterotrophs, although there are clearly examples where it is advantageous to fool the consumer (Schultz, 2002Schultz J.C. Integr. Comp. Biol. 2002; 42: 454-462Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The xenohormesis hypothesis predicts that we will find conserved domains in enzymes and receptors that do not interact with any endogenous molecule. On the other hand, given evolutionary considerations and the fact that there are likely to be a limited number of regulatory mechanisms for any given receptor or enzyme, xenohormetic molecules are predicted to bind to many of the same receptor sites as endogenous regulators do. Xenohormetic molecules could act as an antagonist against one enzyme or receptor and be an agonist against another. As we propose that these interactions result from selective pressures for particular phenotypic outcomes, we would predict that their effects on the proteins of a given signaling pathway would tend to reinforce one another (see Figure 1). A limited number of plant polyphenol-binding sites on mammalian proteins have been characterized. One theme that emerges is the affinity of flavonoids (such as quercetin) and stilbenes (such as resveratrol) for the nucleotide-binding sites of protein kinases. There are notable examples for proteins that have nucleotide substrate-binding sites, where structural (Gledhill et al., 2007Gledhill J.R. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13632-13637Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) or kinetic (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar) evidence indicates that polyphenols do not compete with the enzyme's nucleotide substrates and instead bind elsewhere on the protein. We suggest that this is at least consistent with these interactions being driven by selective pressures rather than simply by a coincidental structural resemblance to nucleotides. In considering the 14 solved structures of resveratrol-protein or quercetin-protein complexes, Gledhill et al., 2007Gledhill J.R. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13632-13637Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar did not identify a conserved polyphenol interaction domain but concluded simply that in all cases the polyphenols were bound in hydrophobic pockets “predominantly by means of van der Waals contacts and H-bonds involving the hydroxyl groups.” Clearly, identification of polyphenol interaction domains, if they exist, must await further structural work. It should be possible to test the xenohormesis hypothesis at the level of whole organisms and their ecology. For example, a testable prediction of xenohormesis is that stressing a plant such as Arabidopsis with heat or light would lengthen the life span of insects, such as aphids, that feed on it. The life span of aphids feeding on the leaves of the herb Shepherd's Purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is known to be extended when the plant is water-stressed due to root predation by beetle larvae (Gange and Brown, 1989Gange A.C. Brown V.K. Oecologia. 1989; 81: 38-42Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The greatest difficulty with such experiments may lie in designing sufficient controls to allow for an unambiguous interpretation. For example, one must be sure to distinguish xenohormetic life-span effects from those that might arise from simple caloric restriction or lower levels of a particular nutrient or toxin. The genetic manipulations that are possible in Arabidopsis in the realm of polyphenol biogenesis may prove especially useful in this regard. We propose that animals and fungi may have retained the ability to sense stress signaling molecules that their distant ancestors once synthesized to modulate their enzymes and receptors during adversity. These stress-induced molecules have been consistently encountered by animals and fungi in the context of particular environmental stresses, such that evolution may have favored the preservation of enzyme binding and other types of molecule-sensing capacities in heterotrophs. As we achieve a more detailed understanding of the numerous interactions of plant molecules with mammalian proteins, there may come a day when calling a plant molecule “dirty” will be interpreted as a compliment."

Here we show that the expression of miR-199a and miR-199a*(miR-199a/a*), which are processed from the same precursor, is confined to fibroblast cells among cultured cell lines. The fibroblast-specific expression pattern correlated well with methylation patterns: gene loci on chromosome 1 and 19 were fully methylated in all examined cell lines but unmethylated in fibroblasts. Transfection of miR-199a and/or -199a* mimetics into several cancer cell lines caused prominent apoptosis with miR-199a* being more pro-apoptotic. The mechanism underlying apoptosis induced by miR-199a was caspase-dependent, whereas a caspase-independent pathway was involved in apoptosis induced by miR-199a* in A549 cells. By employing microarray and immunoblotting analyses, we identified the MET proto-oncogene as a target of miR-199a*. Studies with a luciferase reporter fused to the 3′-untranslated region of the MET gene demonstrated miR-199a*-mediated down-regulation of luciferase activity through a binding site of miR-199a*. Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was also down-regulated by miR-199a*. Coordinated down-regulation of both MET and its downstream effector ERK2 by miR-199a* may be effective in inhibiting not only cell proliferation but also motility and invasive capabilities of tumor cells.

More than 500 human miRNAs have been identified, and over 1000 miRNAs are predicted to exist in humans (4Bentwich I. Avniel A. Karov Y. Aharonov R. Gilad S. Barad O. Barzilai A. Einat P. Einav U.

Recently, it was reported that miRNAs can regulate the expression of up to 30% of total cellular proteins, thus constituting a vast gene regulatory network (6Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Although hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered, relatively little is known about their biological functions. The partially complementary binding of miRNAs to their target sites in the 3′-UTR of target genes makes it difficult to predict target genes using a computer program. In the case of cancers, accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes.

MET proto-oncogene is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ligand (25Gherardi E. Stoker M. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 227-232PubMed Google Scholar). MET is involved in the control of invasive growth not only during tumorigenesis but also in embryonic development, organ development, inflammatory responses, and wound healing processes (26Birchmeier C.

In addition, the inhibition of MET expression by siRNA technology may be a useful approach. The present study demonstrates that MET proto-oncogene is negatively regulated by miR-199a*. The expression of miR-199a/a* was silent in proliferating cells except fibroblasts and in accordance with its silent expression, the miR-199a/a* locus was heavily methylated in non-expressing cell lines. When introduced into tumor cells, miR-199a/a* induced pronounced apoptosis, suggesting that miR-199a/a* is a putative tumor suppressor. Intriguingly, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK2, which is one of the downstream effectors of MET, was also down-regulated by miR-199a*. Thus, promoting apoptosis through the inhibition of the MET signaling pathway by miR-199a/a* may hold great promise as a potential therapy for a variety of primary and metastatic tumors. RNA and DNA Oligonucleotides—RNA and DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The 19-mer target sequence of 3 siRNAs targeting MET and NC siRNA were 5′-CUGGUUAUCACUGGGAAGA-3′ (siMet-1), 5′-GUGAAGAUCCCAUUGUCUA-3′ (siMet-2), 5′-CAGGUUGUGGUUUCUCGAU-3′ (siMet-3), and 5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGU-3′ (NC), respectively. NC siRNA was used as a non-silencing control siRNA. A 2-nt overhang, dTdT, was added to 3′ of all siRNAs. miRNA mimetics were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). All siRNAs and miRNA mimetics were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of 30 μm. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human cell lines A549 (lung cancer cell line), HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), CCD-986sk (normal skin fibroblasts), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), PC-3 (prostate cancer cell line), KB (oral epidermoid carcinoma), K562 (myeloid leukemia), Jurkat (T cell leukemia), Raji (Burkitt lymphoma), PWR-1E (normal prostate epithelial cell), MCF10A (normal breast epithelial cell line), JEG3 (choriocarcinoma), JAR (choriocarcinoma), SiHa (cervical carcinoma), and SK-OV-3 (ovarian carcinoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (A549, HeLa, KB, PC-3, MCF-7, JAR, and SK-OV-3), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CCD-986sk, K562, JEG3, and SiHa), keratinocyte serum-free medium (PWR-1E), or a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (MCF10A) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Synovial fibroblasts isolated from the knee synovium of two individuals with no known joint disease were obtained from Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI). In addition, synovial fibroblasts were isolated from two patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and prepared for cell culture as described before (44Lee U.J. Choung S.R. Prakash K.V. Lee E.J. Lee M.Y. Kim Y.J. Han C.W. Choi Y.C. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2007; (May 25, in press)Google Scholar). Synovial fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units of penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml). The medium was replaced every 2–3 days and synovial fibroblasts between passages 3 and 6 were used in experiments as indicated. All culture media and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis of MicroRNAs—Total RNAs were isolated from cultured cells using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNAs from human tissues were obtained from Ambion. For quantitative analysis of miRNAs, two-step TaqMan real-time PCR analysis was performed using primers and probes obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Briefly, cDNA was made from total RNA in 15-μl reactions using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and specific primers for each miRNA contained in the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed by sequentially incubating at 16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and 85 °C for 5 min. Each PCR mixture (20 μl) contained 1.3 μl of reverse transcriptase product, 10 μl of Taq-Man 2× Universal PCR Master Mix, and 1 μl of the appropriate TaqMan MicroRNA Assay (20×) containing primers and probes for the miRNA of interest. The mixture was initially incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. PCR were performed in triplicate using a DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research Inc.). All RNA samples were normalized relative to human 18 S rRNA. DNA Methylation Analysis Using Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) and Bisulfite Sequencing—Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured cells using the DNA Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). DNA from human normal and tumor tissues were obtained from Biochain (Hayward, CA). Prior to treatment with bisulfite, DNA was digested with NcoI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The digested DNA was purified with phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. A bisulfite reaction was performed with 0.8 μg of NcoI-digested DNA using EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). After bisulfite reaction and purification, 250 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA was used as a template for each PCR analysis. PCR was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing specific primers (10 pmol each) using AccuPower PCR premix (Bioneer, Korea). The amplification cycle was 94 °C for 40 s, 57 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles. Primers used to amplify the DNA fragment (19-F1) containing the miR-199a/a* genomic locus on chromosome 19 were 5′-GGTGGTGGAAAATGATATTTATTTG-3′ and 5′-AAATTTCCTAAAAACCCAAAACTTT-3′. Primers used to amplify the DNA fragment (19-F2) upstream of the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 19 were 5′-TTTTGGGTTTTTAGGAAATTTTAAAG-3′ and 5′-AATCACAAACCATTCCAACTAATAC-3′. Primers used to amplify the DNA fragment (1-F2) upstream of the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 1 were 5′-TGAATAGGTAGTTTGAATATTGGGG-3′ and 5′-CATATATAAACTCTCCAACCCAACC-3′. Primers used to amplify the DNA fragment (1-F3) upstream of the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 1 were 5′-GGGTTGGGTTGGAGAGTTTATATAT-3′ and 5′-ACTTTTCCATACTAAAACCCACTTC-3′. A DNA fragment (1-F1) containing the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 1 was amplified using nested PCR. First, DNA fragment was amplified using a forward primer (5′-TGGAAATAGTTTATTTTGTTTTTAG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CAACCCTTAAATATATCTCAATCAAC-3′). The product (1 μl) of the initial PCR was then used as a template for a second PCR to amplify DNA fragment 1-F1, using a forward primer (5′-TGGAAATAGTTTATTTTGTTTTTAG-3′) and a nested reverse primer (5′-AAAAAACTTCTAAAAATCCTACTCC-3′). After PCR, reaction mixtures were purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator kit from Zymo Research. The purified PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and individual clones were sequenced. For methylation analysis by COBRA (45Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), PCR fragment (19-F2) was further amplified using nested primers: a forward primer, 5′-ATTTTAAAGAGTGGGGGAGG-3′ and a reverse primer, 5′-CACATCTAAAACTATTTACA-3′. After nested PCR, 3 μl of reaction mixtures, without purification, were digested with HhaI (New England Biolabs) for 3 h at 37 °C. The restriction products were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Transfection—One day before transfection, cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5–8 × 104 cells per well for RNA preparation at 48–72 h post-transfection. Transfection of A549 and HeLa cells was accomplished using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (46Kim J.Y. Choung S. Lee E.J. Kim Y.J. Choi Y.C. Mol. Cells. 2007; 24: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and 500 μl of Opti-MEM was added to each well. For each transfection, 100 nm miRNA duplexes (miRIDIAN miRNA mimetics; Dharmacon) and siRNAs in 250 μl of Opti-MEM were mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM containing 3.5 μl of RNAiMAX and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to cells in the 6-well plate, giving a transfection volume of 1 ml. After 6 h incubation with the transfection solution, the Opti-MEM medium containing the complexes was replaced with 2 ml of standard growth media and cultured at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at different time points for microarray and other experiments. Assessment of Apoptosis—Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1.8 × 104 cells per well and transfected after 24 h incubation. Three days after transfection, cell morphology was examined by light microscopy. For Annexin V staining, transfected cells were stained with Annexin V conjugated with Alexa 568 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. For the experiments with the caspase inhibitor, cells were pretreated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 1 h before transfection. RNA Isolation and Microarray Experiments—Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplified and biotinylated cRNA was generated from 500 ng of total RNA using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). After purification with the RNeasy kit, 700 ng of labeled cRNA was hybridized to the Illumina HumanRef-8 BeadChip following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). After hybridization with strepavidin-Cy3 and washing, the arrays were scanned with an Illumina BeadArray Reader and data analysis was carried out using the Illumina BeadStudio program. To validate microarray data, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers as described previously (46Kim J.Y. Choung S. Lee E.J. Kim Y.J. Choi Y.C. Mol. Cells. 2007; 24: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—One day before transfection, cells were seeded into 10-cm culture dishes at a density of 5–8 × 105 cells per dish for protein preparation at 48 or 72 h post-transfection. Whole cell lysates were prepared using CelLytic-M cell lysis reagent (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instruction. Total protein extracts (30 μg) were electrophoresed on 4–20% precast protein gel (Pierce) and transferred to Protran Nitrocellulose membrane (S&S, Dassel, Germany). The blots were incubated first with a primary antibody and then, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Primary antibodies were PARP (number 9542), CASPASE 9 (number 9502), cleaved CASPASE 9 (number 9501), cleaved CASPASE 7 (number 9491), cleaved CASPASE 3 (number 9661), CASPASE 8 (number 9746), BAD (number 9292), BID (number 2002), BAX (number 2772), BCL-xL (number 2762), BCL2 (number 2870), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) (number 4642), MET (number 3127), AKT (number 9272), phospho-AKT (number 4051), p44/42 MAPK (number 4695), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (number 4370), SAPK/JNK (number 9258), p38 MAPK (number 9212), and ACTIN (C-11). All primary antibodies except anti-ACTIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by using the ECL plus Western blotting reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assay—A luciferase reporter carrying the 3′-UTR of MET was constructed as follows. An 1850-bp fragment containing the majority of the 3′-UTR fragment of the MET gene, including the predicted target site for miR-199a*, was amplified by PCR from a full-length MET cDNA clone (NM_000245, obtained from RZPD, Imagenes GmbH, Berlin, Germany) using F1 and R1 primers that create XhoI and NotI sites, respectively (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). The XhoI-NotI-digested product was cloned into the 3′-UTR of the luciferase gene in the psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega). To delete the predicted miR-199a* target site from the 3′-UTR fragment of MET, DNA fragments containing 1035 bp upstream and 795 bp downstream of the target site were separately amplified using F1/R2 and F2/R1 primers, respectively. After digestion with XbaI, ligation of upstream and downstream fragments, and digestion with XhoI and NotI, the 3′-UTR fragment with a deletion in the miR-199a* binding site was cloned into XhoI/NotI-digested psiCHECK-2. The cells were cotransfected in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 400 ng of the 3′-UTR-luciferase report vector and 10 nm miRNA mimetics or negative control mimetic (Dharmacon). Forty-eight h after transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured consecutively by using dual-luciferase assays (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression of miR-199a/a* Is Confined to Fibroblasts among Proliferating Cell Lines—We recently constructed a library of small RNAs from synovial tissue isolated from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Sequencing of 2000 clones revealed that miR-199a/a* is one of several highly expressed miRNAs in RA synovial tissues. This finding led us to examine miR-199a/a* expression in a variety of tissues and cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR methods. As shown in Fig. 1, miR-199a/a* was well expressed in synovial fibroblasts and CCD normal skin fibroblasts. Interestingly, the expression of miR-199a/a* was almost completely silenced in all other examined tumor and normal cell lines. Because even the precursor forms of miR-199a/a* were not detected by Northern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1), it is likely that the expression is silenced at the transcriptional level. In the tested tissues, the expression of miR-199a/a* was relatively high in breast, colon, and testis and relatively low in thymus, kidney, and liver. Expression was very low in brain, suggesting possible negative effects on brain function. miR-199a/a* Loci on Chromosome 1 and 19 Are Fully Methylated in Proliferating Cell Lines Except Fibroblasts—Because the expression of miR-199a/a* is almost completely silenced in proliferating normal and cancer cell lines except fibroblasts, and DNA methylation is one of the fundamental mechanisms involved in gene silencing (47Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 48Bird A. Cell. 1992; 70: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we determined the methylation patterns of the miR-199a/a* gene using bisulfite sequencing and COBRA (45Xiong Z. Laird P.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2532-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The miR-199a/a* gene exists on both chromosomes 1 and 19 as a consequence of gene duplication: one locus is located in intron 15 of DYNAMIN 2 gene on chromosome 19 and the other in intron 14 of DYNAMIN 3 on chromosome 1. As shown in Fig. 2, CpG density is high in the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 19 and a predicted CpG island (CpG island searcher) is present between ∼130 and 540 bp upstream of the mature miR-199a sequence (another program, the CpG plot program at EBI predicted a 134-bp CpG-dense region between 269 and 402 bp upstream of mature miR-199a). In contrast, the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 1 is relatively CpG poor. Sequencing analysis of 20 clones obtained from the genomic DNA of A549 and HeLa cells following bisulfite conversion and PCR amplification revealed that 94.7 and 94.6% of analyzed CpG sites around the miR-199a/a* locus on chromosome 19 were methylated in A549 and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 2). On chromosome 1, a similar level of DNA methylation was detected: 94.6 and 97.6% in A549 and HeLa cells, respectively. In contrast, the same CpG sites were unmethylated in synovial fibroblasts and CCD-986sk skin fibroblast cells. Therefore, there is a good correlation between DNA hypomethylation and miR-199a/a* gene expression. Next, we extended our methylation analysis to additional normal and"
https://openalex.org/W1976437851,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a molecular sensor of noxious heat and capsaicin. Its channel activity can be modulated by several mechanisms. Here we identify a membrane protein, Pirt, as a regulator of TRPV1. Pirt is expressed in most nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) including TRPV1-positive cells. Pirt null mice show impaired responsiveness to noxious heat and capsaicin. Noxious heat- and capsaicin-sensitive currents in Pirt-deficient DRG neurons are significantly attenuated. Heterologous expression of Pirt strongly enhances TRPV1-mediated currents. Furthermore, the C terminus of Pirt binds to TRPV1 and several phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and can potentiate TRPV1. The PIP2 binding is dependent on the cluster of basic residues in the Pirt C terminus and is crucial for Pirt regulation of TRPV1. Importantly, the enhancement of TRPV1 by PIP2 requires Pirt. Therefore, Pirt is a key component of the TRPV1 complex and positively regulates TRPV1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2105047045,"To allow genome-scale identification of genes that regulate cellular signaling, we cloned >90% of all human full-length protein kinase cDNAs and constructed the corresponding kinase activity-deficient mutants. To establish the utility of this resource, we tested the effect of expression of the kinases on three different cellular signaling models. In all screens, many kinases had a modest but significant effect, apparently due to crosstalk between signaling pathways. However, the strongest effects were found with known regulators and novel components, such as MAP3K10 and DYRK2, which we identified in a mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) signaling screen. DYRK2 directly phosphorylated and induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of the key Hh pathway-regulated transcription factor, GLI2. MAP3K10, in turn, affected GLI2 indirectly by modulating the activity of DYRK2 and the known Hh pathway component, GSK3β. Our results establish kinome expression screening as a highly effective way to identify physiological signaling pathway components and genes involved in pathological signaling crosstalk."
https://openalex.org/W1538720707,"Aberrant interactions of copper and zinc ions with the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) potentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) by participating in the aggregation process of Aβ and in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production and the neurotoxicity of Aβ are associated with copper binding. Metallothionein-3 (Zn7MT-3), an intra- and extracellularly occurring metalloprotein, is highly expressed in the brain and downregulated in AD. This protein protects, by an unknown mechanism, cultured neurons from the toxicity of Aβ. Here, we show that a metal swap between Zn7MT-3 and soluble and aggregated Aβ1–40–Cu(II) abolishes the ROS production and the related cellular toxicity. In this process, copper is reduced by the protein thiolates forming Cu(I)4Zn4MT-3, in which an air-stable Cu(I)4-thiolate cluster and two disulfide bonds are present. The discovered protective effect of Zn7MT-3 from the copper-mediated Aβ1–40 toxicity may lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating AD."
https://openalex.org/W2134998339,"The removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytic neighbors is essential for metazoan development but remains poorly characterized. Here we report the discovery of a Drosophila phagocytosis receptor, Six-microns-under (SIMU), which is expressed in highly phagocytic cell types during development and required for efficient apoptotic cell clearance by glia in the nervous system and by macrophages elsewhere. SIMU is part of a conserved family of proteins that includes CED-1 and Draper (DRPR). Phenotypic analysis reveals that simu acts upstream of drpr in the same pathway and affects the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells, while drpr affects their subsequent degradation. SIMU strongly binds to apoptotic cells, presumably through its EMILIN-like domain, but requires no membrane anchoring, suggesting that it can function as a bridging molecule.

Our study introduces an important factor in tissue-resident apoptotic clearance and underscores the prominent role of glia as “semiprofessional” phagocytes in the nervous system. The elimination of superfluous or damaged cells through programmed cell death plays an essential role in metazoan development and tissue homeostasis; its critical final stage is the clearance of the apoptotic cells through phagocytosis. The proper recognition, uptake, and degradation of dying cells is accomplished either by “professional” phagocytes, such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells, or by “nonprofessional” tissue-resident neighboring cells. While professional phagocytes have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the biological significance and the molecular underpinnings of tissue-resident phagocytosis (Henson and Hume, 2006Henson P.M. Hume D.A. Apoptotic cell removal in development and tissue homeostasis.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 244-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell clearance is a complex process, involving recognition, engulfment, phagosome formation and maturation as distinct steps (Figure 1E) (for review, see Grimsley and Ravichandran, 2003Grimsley C.

The apoptotic cell displays distress (“eat me”) signals that are recognized by the phagocyte, either directly by phagocytic receptors or indirectly through bridging molecules (opsonins), supplied systemically through the serum or secreted locally by the phagocyte. Two types of phagocytic receptors have been implicated in this recognition process: tethering receptors without a significant intracellular domain, such as CD36 (Franc et al., 1999Franc N.C.

Med. 2001; 194: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The clustering of both types of receptors is thought to be required for the recruitment of the downstream machinery to the docking sites, which leads to cytoskeletal reorganization and engulfment of the apoptotic cell. The phagocytosis process is completed by the formation of a phagosome and its maturation to a phagolysosome, effecting the degradation of the apoptotic particle. Insight into the molecular mechanisms by which nonprofessional tissue-resident cells effect apoptotic clearance came initially from the worm, which does not have professional phagocytes. Genetic screens identified several phagocytosis genes that fall into two partially redundant pathways: one consists of a phagocytic docking receptor (CED-1), its adapter (CED-6), an ABC transporter (CED-7), and dynamin; the other pathway consists of an actin-regulating protein complex (CED-2/5/10/12) that presumably acts downstream of an unknown phagocytic receptor (for review, see Mangahas and Zhou, 2005Mangahas P.M.

Recently, the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1 was found to act upstream of the homologous complex in mouse (Park et al., 2007Park D. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Elliott M.R. Lu M. Haney L.B. Ma Z.

In Drosophila, only three factors have been implicated in apoptotic cell clearance to date: the macrophage-specific CD36 homolog Croquemort (CRQ) (Franc et al., 1999Franc N.C. Heitzler P. Ezekowitz R.A. White K. Requirement for croquemort in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila.Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the F Box protein Pallbearer (Silva et al., 2007Silva E. Au-Yeung H.W. Van Goethem E. Burden J. Franc N.C. Requirement for a Drosophila E3-ubiquitin ligase in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.Immunity. 2007; 27: 585-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the broadly expressed CED-1 homolog DRPR, which plays a role in glial phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons (Freeman et al., 2003Freeman M.R. Delrow J. Kim J. Johnson E. Doe C.Q. Unwrapping glial biology: Gcm target genes regulating glial development, diversification, and function.Neuron. 2003; 38: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the apoptotic clearance function of CED-1/DRPR is conserved in vertebrates (Hamon et al., 2006Hamon Y. Trompier D. Ma Z. Venegas V. Pophillat M. Mignotte V. Zhou Z. Chimini G. Cooperation between engulfment receptors: the Case of ABCA1 and MEGF10.PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, most of the players involved in tissue-resident clearance are still unknown, in particular the phagocytic receptors and their cognate ligands on the apoptotic cell. More generally, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of apoptotic clearance in vivo is highly desirable. In the work presented here, we demonstrate that glia are the main phagocytes in the late developing nervous system of the fly. We describe a new tethering receptor named Six-microns-under (SIMU), which functions in apoptotic clearance by both glia and macrophages, and find that it acts upstream of DRPR in the same pathway. Our study reveals an evolutionary expansion and concomitant specialization of the repertoire of CED-1-like receptors, with SIMU required for the recognition and engulfment, and DRPR for the degradation of corpses. In Drosophila development, the elimination of superfluous cells through apoptosis occurs in three main phases: first in mid-to-late embryogenesis, then in midpupa, and again in the early adult. Much of the cell death occurs in the nervous system, where almost half the cells are removed (Abrams et al., 1993Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Programmed cell death during Drosophila embryogenesis.Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2007Rogulja-Ortmann A. Luer K. Seibert J. Rickert C.

Apoptotic cell clearance in embryogenesis was originally thought to be performed primarily by professional phagocytes, the macrophages (Franc et al., 1999Franc N.C. Heitzler P. Ezekowitz R.A. White K. Requirement for croquemort in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila.Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Sonnenfeld and Jacobs, 1995Sonnenfeld M.J.

When tracking apoptosis in the embryonic nervous system with activated caspase antibodies (CM1) we observe a high and steady amount of neuronal cell death between 13 and 16 hr of development (stage 16; Figure 1A) (Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2007Rogulja-Ortmann A. Luer K. Seibert J. Rickert C. Technau G.M. Programmed cell death in the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.Development. 2007; 134: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By this stage, the ventral nerve cord is ensheathed by an epithelium formed by surface glia (Schwabe et al., 2005Schwabe T. Bainton R.J. Fetter R.D. Heberlein U. Gaul U. GPCR signaling is required for blood-brain barrier formation in Drosophila.Cell. 2005; 123: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and macrophages are found hovering around the nerve cord without entering it (Figures 1B and 1C). When we examine the neural cortex, the portion of the nerve cord that harbors the neuronal cell bodies and where most apoptosis takes place (Figure 1D), we find that nearly all CM1-positive apoptotic particles are either engulfed or at least touched by neighboring glia, which are visualized using a transgenic glial membrane marker (repo::CD8GFP) (Figure 1G) (cf. Sonnenfeld and Jacobs, 1995Sonnenfeld M.J. Jacobs J.R. Macrophages and glia participate in the removal of apoptotic neurons from the Drosophila embryonic nervous system.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 644-652Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that in normal tissue the activation of effector caspase is concurrent with phagocytic uptake and thus relatively late. Based on their morphology and position, the CNS glia fall into three main categories: glia that ensheathe the axon tracts (“neuropile glia”), glia that ensheathe the nerve cord as a whole (“surface glia”), and astrocyte-like glia residing in the neural cortex (“cell body glia”) (Ito et al., 1995Ito K. Urban J. Technau G.M. Distribution, classification, and development of Drosophila glial cells in the late embryonic and early larval ventral nerve chord.Dev Genes Evol. 1995; 204: 284-307Google Scholar). These cell body glia appear to be the principal phagocytes in the nervous system at later stages of embryonic development. Unlike vertebrates, the Drosophila nervous system does not contain microglia, which are blood-derived but tissue-resident professional macrophages. The phagocytic role of glia is corroborated by live observation with additional death and phagocytosis markers. Phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid that is restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in healthy cells, accumulates on the outer surface during apoptosis (van den Eijnde et al., 1998van den Eijnde S.M. Boshart L. Baehrecke E.H. De Zeeuw C.I. Reutelingsperger C.P. Vermeij-Keers C. Cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis is phylogenetically conserved.Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and is recognized with high affinity by AnnexinV. When fluorescent AnnexinV probe is injected into embryos that express the glial membrane marker (repo::CD8GFP), we find most of the strongly AnnexinV-positive particles touched or engulfed by the glia, but a significant fraction remains untouched (Figure 1F), suggesting that AnnexinV is an earlier or more sensitive marker for apoptosis than activated caspase CM1 antibody (Figure 1G). By contrast, when lysosomal activity is monitored in vivo by injecting fluorescent LysoTracker, we find that nearly all lysosomal activity in the nerve cord coincides with the glia (Figure 1H). In embryos lacking apoptosis, all three markers show accordant changes in their distribution (Figure S1). Multiple independent markers thus indicate that the removal of apoptotic cells in the nerve cord is entirely carried out by the tissue-resident glial cells. This finding is consistent with results of a genome-wide transcription profiling of FACS-sorted embryonic glia, in which phagocytosis genes are highly represented, including homologs of vertebrate phagocytic receptors, DRPR, and other orthologs of the two worm phagocytosis pathways (H. Courvoisier, D. L., J. Fak, N. Rajewsky, and U. G., unpublished data). To begin our molecular and genetic investigation of glial phagocytosis, we focused on a new gene we named six-microns-under (simu, = CG16876), which ranked near the top in our glial transcription profile and whose expression and molecular features made it a particularly promising candidate. Northern analysis shows a dynamic expression of simu, which parallels the main epochs of developmental apoptosis: mid-to-late embryogenesis, pupa, and young adult. It is also expressed in the adult nervous system (Figure 2D). RNA in situ hybridization reveals that simu is expressed specifically in all three phagocytic cell populations: at midembryogenesis (stages 10–15), it is found in macrophages and the ectoderm (Figures 2A and 2B), and later on (stage 16) also in the glia, with the strongest expression in the astrocytic cell body glia (Figure 2C). This intriguing expression pattern suggested an involvement of simu in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We identified a 2 kb genomic fragment upstream of the simu translation start site, which, when fused to a cytoplasmic GFP reporter (simu-cytGFP), recapitulates the endogenous expression pattern of the locus, namely expression in ectoderm, macrophages, and glia. We use this simu-cytGFP reporter in some of our descriptive and genetic analysis, in particular our time-lapse recordings of phagocytosis in vivo (see below). Since we have not been able to generate SIMU antibodies (the protein is very difficult to express in bacteria), we also used this 2 kb simu promoter to drive a SIMU-MYC protein fusion (simu-SIMU-MYC), which serves as our immunohistochemical marker for SIMU protein expression in vivo (Figures 2E–2J). simu-SIMU-MYC shows strong expression on the cell surface of macrophages and glia, but loses ectodermal expression earlier than the simu-cytGFP reporter, suggesting a difference in protein turnover between SIMU and GFP. To examine the biological function of simu, we sought to generate a genomic knockout. Since there are no P insertions in the vicinity of the simu locus (the nearest P element was 40 kb away), targeted homologous recombination was the only viable strategy. We engineered a simu null allele in which both in-frame ATGs of the coding region were replaced by stop codons (Figure 3T) and swapped the mutant version into the endogenous locus (see Experimental Procedures). The success of the genomic knockout was confirmed both at the molecular level, by PCR and Southern blot analysis, and genetically—a deficiency uncovering the simu locus (Df(2L)Sco7) fails to complement our simu null mutant. A genomic fragment containing the entire transcribed region and 2 kb upstream completely rescues the simu phenotype (Figure 5B, see below). simu mutant animals are homozygous viable and show no gross morphologic abnormalities. To test for phagocytosis defects in vivo, we transgenically labeled the phagocytic cell populations (repo::CD8GFP for glia; simu-cytGFP for macrophages); apoptotic particles were labeled with activated caspase antibodies (CM1). In simu mutants, the number, position, and overall morphology of CNS glia in general and of the highly phagocytic cell body glia in particular appear normal (average glial cell number 37.2 ± 5.6, compared to 37.1 ± 3.8 in wild-type, measured in representative stacks of confocal images, see Experimental Procedures). However, the clearance of apoptotic cells is markedly impaired. The number and total volume of apoptotic particles is increased about 2-fold over wild-type (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3Q), and the apoptotic particles are much less likely to be engulfed. The fraction of particles that are completely untouched by glial cells is increased 3-fold in simu mutants over wild-type (Figures 3E, 3F, and 3R), indicating a significant impairment in the recognition and/or engulfment of apoptotic cells. Similar phenotypes are observed in macrophage phagocytosis: Again, the number (44.8 ± 5.0, compared to 46.3 ± 4.3 in wild-type, see Experimental Procedures), migration pattern, and morphology of the macrophages appear normal. However, the number and volume of apoptotic particles in the embryo outside the nervous system is strongly increased (Figure 3S), and many particles remain unengulfed, often forming large clusters near the macrophages (Figures 3I, 3J, 3M, and 3N). These findings point to the same corpse recognition and engulfment defect as in the glia. To gain insight into the cellular dynamics, we carried out time-lapse recordings in live embryos, with simu-cytGFP labeling glia and macrophages and injected fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate Phiphilux labeling apoptotic cells (see Experimental Procedures). In wild-type, almost all caspase-3-positive particles are engulfed or at least touched by a phagocyte, as observed before in fixed material. Both glia and macrophages are constantly sending out processes to probe their environment and quickly engulf apoptotic cells; the macrophages move around at high speed (∼1 μm/min) while the glia remain stationary (Figure 4E, Movie S1). In the simu mutant, both search behavior and motility of the phagocytes are normal, but many apoptotic particles remain completely untouched for extended periods of time or are briefly touched without being tethered. In addition, many particles attach to the phagocyte cell surface without being engulfed; occasionally, we observe the formation of incomplete phagocytic cups (Figure 4F, Movie S2). These findings clearly indicate that simu does not influence the general behavior and morphology of phagocytes, but rather affects specifically their ability to recognize and engulf apoptotic particles. The simu gene is predicted to encode a 377 aa transmembrane protein, comprising an N-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular portion, a single putative transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus (Figure 5A). The extracellular portion of the protein consists of an N-terminal EMILIN (EMI)-like domain (Callebaut et al., 2003Callebaut I. Mignotte V. Souchet M. Mornon J.P. EMI domains are widespread and reveal the probable orthologs of the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-1 protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 619-623Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and four EGF domains with highly stereotyped spacing of Cys residues, recently named Nimrod (NIM) repeats (Kurucz et al., 2007Kurucz E. Markus R. Zsamboki J. Folkl-Medzihradszky K. Darula Z. Vilmos P. Udvardy A. Krausz I. Lukacsovich T.

Intriguingly, the combination of an EMI(-like) domain, with a highly conserved CC×GY motif at its C-terminal end and immediately followed by a NIM repeat (Figure 6E), is found across the vertebrate/invertebrate divide in a small number of both secreted and transmembrane factors, some of which have been shown to function in phagocytosis. They include the CED-1 homologs in all species (DRPR, human MEGF10, mouse Jedi), the fly bacterial phagocytosis factor Eater (Kocks et al., 2005Kocks C. Cho J.H. Nehme N. Ulvila J. Pearson A.M.

To confirm the overall protein organization of SIMU and determine its orientation within the plasma membrane, we C-terminally tagged SIMU with GFP and expressed the protein fusion in Drosophila tissue culture (S2) cells. Live observation detects SIMU-GFP at the plasma membrane (Figures 2K and 2N); after fixation, GFP antibodies recognize the fusion protein only when cells are permeabilized with detergent (Figures 2L and 2O), indicating that the C terminus is intracellular and thus identifying SIMU as a type I transmembrane protein. Consistent with these results, both SIMU-GFP and SIMU-MYC localize to the plasma membrane in the embryo (Figures 2Q and 2R). Given that the simu phenotype reveals a function in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic particles, we sought to test whether the SIMU protein is able to bind to apoptotic cells in vitro. To this end, we produced a secreted tagged version of SIMU—comprising the entire extracellular domain of the protein—in human HEKc18 cells. Strikingly, while affinity-purified HIS-MYC-SIMUΔTM protein shows very little binding to live S2 cells, consistent with the small percentage of dying cells within the culture, we observe very strong binding to apoptotic S2 cells (Figure 3U). Interestingly, SIMU is also sufficient to increase the uptake of apoptotic cells in a heterologous system: we overexpressed the protein in COS7 cells using transient transfection (see Experimental Procedures), with GFP as a negative control and the known tethering receptor CRQ as a positive control (Franc et al., 1996Franc N.C. Dimarcq J.L. Lagueux M. Hoffmann J. Ezekowitz R.A. Croquemort, a novel Drosophila hemocyte/macrophage receptor that recognizes apoptotic cells.Immunity. 1996; 4: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Compared to GFP-transfected cells, SIMU-transfected cells showed a modest increase in the uptake of apoptotic cells (1.3-fold), very similar to that of CRQ (1.4-fold). Taken together, these data complement the results of our in vivo analysis and provide further strong evidence for a role of SIMU in the recognition and uptake of apoptotic particles. To gain further insight into the molecular function of SIMU, we removed portions of the protein and examined whether the truncations affect its function in vivo. The truncated forms were fused directly to the simu promoter (Figure 5A); we also created MYC-tagged versions of the truncated forms to directly monitor their expression level and localization. Both untagged and tagged truncated versions were placed in the simu mutant background and assayed for their ability to rescue the phagocytosis defect; for each transgene, two different genomic insertions were tested. As a baseline, we established that the full-length version of the SIMU protein completely rescues the simu mutant phenotype, both in its untagged and MYC-tagged form (Figure 5B). First, we removed the EMI-like domain, whose biological function has not been established, from SIMU's N terminus (SIMUΔEMI). SIMUΔEMI is properly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane (data not shown), but does not rescue the simu mutant phenotype (Figure 5B). This indicates that the EMI-like domain is essential for SIMU function and for the first time implicates this type of protein domain in apoptotic clearance. Second, we removed the transmembrane domain and small intracellular portion from SIMU's C terminus (SIMUΔTM). We confirmed that SIMUΔTM is indeed secreted by S2 cell transfection (Figure 5C) and in vivo expression, the latter resulting in abundant distribution throughout the embryo but with particular enrichment on macrophage surfaces (Figures 5D and 5E). Surprisingly, SIMUΔTM rescues the simu mutant phenotype almost completely, indicating that membrane anchoring is dispensable for SIMU function (Figure 5B). This intriguing result suggests that the SIMU protein is able to act in two different modes: as a tethering transmembrane receptor as well as a secreted bridging molecule. SIMU's extracellular domain structure is akin to that of DRPR, the Drosophila homolog of CED-1 (Figures 6D and 6E), but unlike SIMU, DRPR is a docking receptor with a long cytoplasmic domain that contains two conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites known to be required for"

Expand Your Nuclear Horizons Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 283Issue 29PreviewA cell nucleus undergoes dramatic structural changes during the cell cycle, which require extensive remodeling of the nuclear membrane. How this remodeling is coordinated remains a mystery, although some of the changes are likely coupled to phospholipid biosynthesis. In a pair of related Papers of the Week, the laboratories of Symeon Siniossoglou and George Carman have identified and characterized an unusual type of diacylglycerol kinase that helps regulate nuclear membrane growth in yeast. This enzyme, which is encoded by the DGK1 gene, contains a CTP transferase domain that it uses to transfer phosphate from CTP to diacylglycerol to generate phosphatidic acid.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). The regulated production and distribution of phospholipids during the cell cycle or during development often underlie striking changes in membrane biogenesis, which, in turn, can impact on the size, shape, or number of organelles. For example, stimulation of phospholipid biosynthesis accompanies the expansion of the ER 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PA, phosphatidate; DAG, diacylglycerol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PtA, protein A; RFP, red fluorescent protein. in professional secretory cells (2Fagone P.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite these interesting observations, the molecular mechanisms responsible for coupling lipid production to organelle morphology remain largely unknown. An organelle that undergoes striking structural changes during the cell cycle is the nucleus. The nucleus is delimited by the nuclear envelope, which consists of a double lipid bilayer, the outer and inner nuclear membranes (4Hetzer M.W. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The outer membrane is continuous with the ER, whereas the inner membrane faces the nucleoplasm and binds to chromatin. Nuclear membrane growth is essential for cell division. In yeast, nuclear membrane expansion allows anaphase to take place within a single nuclear compartment that partitions between mother and daughter cells (5Byers B. Goetsch L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In metazoan cells, the nuclear membrane expands at the end of mitosis to accommodate chromatin decondensation and DNA replication (6Burke B. Ellenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The source of the nuclear membrane and the mechanism by which it is added to the nuclear envelope remain unknown. Nuclear envelope remodeling is also important for cell types that undergo dramatic nuclear structure changes during their differentiation, such as mammalian blood cell types, where nuclei can be highly lobed and segmented, or spermatocytes and myocytes, where nuclei can take very elongated morphologies (7Leitch A.R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The importance of proper nuclear envelope structure in cell physiology is underscored by the recent identification of several diseases that are associated with changes in nuclear shape and are caused by mutations in nuclear envelope proteins (8Mounkes L. Kozlov S. Burke B. Stewart C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have recently identified an unexpected link between phospholipid biosynthesis and nuclear structure. Mutations in Pah1p, a PA phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to DAG (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), cause proliferation of the nuclear/ER membrane and a massive expansion of the nucleus (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of Pah1p is regulated by Cdc28p-dependent phosphorylation during mitosis. A phosphorylation-null Pah1p mutant has higher PA phosphatase activity than the wild-type enzyme (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, cells lacking Nem1p-Spo7p, the phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates Pah1p, accumulate hyperphosphorylated Pah1p and exhibit nuclear membrane proliferation like pah1Δ cells (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). There are two key consequences of the changes in PA levels that take place in pah1 mutants. First, in yeast cells, PA regulates coordinately the transcription of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme genes through the PA-sensitive repressor Opi1p (12Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37293-37297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When levels of PA are high, as in pah1Δ cells, Opi1p is excluded from the nucleus, and transcription is derepressed (13Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pah1p regulates the transcription of these genes through both Opi1p-dependent and Opi1p-independent mechanisms (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Second, both PA and DAG are the precursors for the synthesis of abundant phospholipids that are used for membrane biogenesis, through the CDP-DAG and CDP-choline pathways, respectively (see Fig. 1A). Therefore, changes in PA and DAG levels in pah1 mutants impact on the cellular levels of these phospholipids (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 14Han G.-S. Siniossoglou S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37026-37035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). How the inactivation of Pah1p leads to nuclear growth is not understood. Moreover, whether Pah1p regulates primarily ER or nuclear membrane biogenesis and whether particular lipids are associated with these changes are not known. We have shown previously that the up-regulation of phospholipid synthesis is necessary but not sufficient to drive nuclear growth in pah1Δ cells (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, there could be additional factors required for nuclear expansion. To investigate the role of phospholipid biosynthesis in nuclear membrane formation and to identify novel components involved in this process, we applied two complementary genetic approaches. First, a systematic search among mutants of known phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes revealed that only Pah1p affects nuclear structure. We therefore performed two non-biased screens looking for previously uncharacterized genes that could encode PA regulators and examined their effect on nuclear structure. Both screens identified the same gene, DGK1 (known previously as HSD1), encoding a nuclear/ER integral membrane protein. We show that Dgk1p counteracts the effects of Pah1p at the nuclear membrane by controlling PA levels. Dgk1p is a novel CTP-dependent DAG kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of DAG to PA. Unlike previously described DAG kinases that use ATP, Dgk1p utilizes CTP as a phosphate donor for the kinase reaction. Overexpression of DGK1 causes recruitment of PA reporter protein on the nuclear membrane and leads to its expansion. Interestingly, cortical ER membrane is not proliferating in these cells. These data reveal a specific role for PA metabolism in nuclear membrane biogenesis. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless stated otherwise, the deletion mutants shown in Fig. 1 were obtained from Open Biosystems and are derived from the BY4742 strain. Knock-out of DGK1 was done by homologous recombination, transforming a dgk1::HIS3 fragment containing 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences into the wild-type (RS453) or pah1::TRP1 deletion strain to obtain the dgk1Δ or pah1Δ dgk1Δ strains, respectively. Deletion of other genes (GAT1, GAT2, PSD1, CHO2, and OPI3) into the pah1Δ strain was done by transforming the appropriate KanMX4 fragments into a pah1::TRP1 strain complemented by a YCplac33-PAH1 plasmid. The PAH1 plasmid was then shuffled out on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates to yield the appropriate double deletions. Yeast cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic medium containing 2% glucose and lacking the appropriate amino acids for plasmid selection. GAL1/10-dependent overexpression was performed by changing the carbon source of early log phase cells from 2% raffinose to 2% galactose. Cells were grown at 30 °C unless mentioned otherwise. To assay growth of yeast cells in medium lacking inositol, synthetic medium was prepared using yeast nitrogen base lacking inositol (Bio 101, Inc.).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef./sourceRS453MATa ade2-1 his3-11,15 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1-1Ref. 43SS1026RS453 pah1::TRP1Ref. 10SS1144RS453 dgk1::HIS3This studySS1147RS453 pah1::TRP1 dgk1::HIS3This studySS1246RS453 pah1::TRP1 gat1::KanMX4This studySS1247RS453 pah1::TRP1 gat2::KanMX4This studySS1282RS453 pah1::TRP1 psd1::KanMX4 + YCplac33-URA3-PAH1This studySS1301RS453 pah1::TRP1 cho2::KanMX4 + YCplac33-URA3-PAH1This studySS1290RS453 pah1::TRP1 opi3::KanMX4 + YCplac33-URA3-PAH1This studySS1372RS453 mCherry-PUS1::URA3This study Open table in a new tab Plasmids and Construction of Fusion Genes—The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. The high copy library used for the suppressor screens was from American Type Culture Collection (catalog no. 37323). The construction of GAT2(G253L) and DGK1(D177A) was done by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The wild-type DGK1 and DGK1(D177A) genes were overexpressed using the GAL1/10 promoter. The RTN2-GFP fusion was constructed by inserting the GFP fragment into the C terminus of RTN2. The fusion gene was cloned into a centromeric URA3 vector (YCplac33), and its expression was driven by the RTN2 promoter. The HEH2-GFP fusion was constructed by inserting the GFP fragment into the C terminus of HEH2. The fusion gene was cloned into a centromeric LEU2 vector (YCplac111), and its expression was driven by the NOP1 promoter. The mCherry-PUS1 fusion was constructed by introducing the mCherry fragment into the N terminus of PUS1. The fusion gene was cloned into a YIplac211 vector, and its expression was driven by the NOP1 promoter. The PtA-DGK1 and GFP-DGK1 fusions were constructed by inserting the protein A or GFP fragment, respectively, into the N terminus of DGK1; their expression was driven by the NOP1 or DGK1 promoter, respectively. The DGK1-PtA fusion was constructed by inserting the protein A fragment into the C terminus of DGK1, and its expression was driven by inducible GAL1/10 promoter.TABLE 2Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionRef./sourceYCplac111-SEC63-GFPSEC63-GFP under control of SEC63 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorRef. 10YCplac33-SEC63-GFPSEC63-GFP under control of SEC63 promoter into CEN/URA3 vectorThis studyYEplac195-PAH1-7PPAH1-7P under control of GAL1/10 promoter into 2μ/URA3 vectorThis studyYCplac33-GAL1/10-NEM1NEM1 under control of GAL1/10 promoter into CEN/URA3 vectorThis studypRS313-GAL1/10-SPO7SPO7 under control of GAL1/10 promoter into CEN/HIS3 vectorThis studyYCplac111-GAL1/10-DGK1DGK1 under control of GAL1/10 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorThis studyYEplac181-GAL1/10-DGK1DGK1 under control of GAL1/10 promoter into 2μ/LEU2 vectorThis studypRS313-RFP-PUS1PUS1 under control of NOP1 promoter into CEN/HIS3 vectorThis studyYCplac111-GAL1/10-DGK1(D177A)DGK1(D177A) under control of GAL1/10 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorThis studyYIplac211-mCherry-PUS1PUS1 under control of NOP1 promoter into integrative/URA3 vectorThis studyYCplac33-RTN2-GFPRTN2-GFP under control of RTN2 promoter into CEN/URA3 vectorThis studyYCplac111-HEH2-GFPHEH2-GFP under control of NOP1 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorThis studyYCplac33-PAH1PAH1 under control of PAH1 promoter into CEN/URA3 vectorRef. 10pRS426-G20GFP-SPO20-(51-91) under control of TEF2 promoter into 2μ/URA3 vectorRef. 26pRS424-GAL1pr-DGKBacterial DGK under control of GAL1 promoter into 2μ/TRP1 vectorRef. 26YCplac111-GAT2GAT2 under control of GAT2 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorThis studyYCplac111-GAT2(G253L)GAT2(G253L) under control of GAT2 promoter into CEN/LEU2 vectorThis study Open table in a new tab High Copy Number Suppressor Screens—For the PAH1-7P suppressor screen, the wild-type RS453 strain overexpressing PAH1-7P from the inducible GAL1/10 promoter in a high copy plasmid (YEplac195) was transformed with a high copy yeast genomic library (15Nasmyth K. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). About 5000 transformants were screened for their ability to suppress the toxicity of the overexpressed PAH1-7P mutant on galactose plates lacking inositol (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Library plasmids were recovered from two suppressor colonies and then retransformed into the original screening strain to verify the suppression. Sequencing of the two library plasmids followed by subcloning of various open reading frames present in the genomic fragment showed that, in both cases, the DGK1 gene was responsible for the suppression of the inositol auxotrophy of the PAH1-7P mutant. For the NEM1-SPO7 suppressor screen, the wild-type RS453 strain overexpressing NEM1 and SPO7 from the GAL1/10 promoter in the YCplac33 and pRS313 plasmids, respectively, was transformed with the same high copy genomic library as described above. About 6000 transformants were screened for their ability to suppress the toxicity of the NEM1-SPO7 overexpression (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Four suppressors were isolated that were found, when analyzed as described above, to contain overlapping inserts of the DGK1 gene. Further subcloning demonstrated that DGK1 was responsible for the suppression of the NEM1-SPO7 toxicity. RNA Extractions and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described previously (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on total RNA using an ABI 7900HT system and a SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of PtA-Dgk1p—The dgk1Δ strain carrying a pRS315-PtA-DGK1 fusion was grown to A600 = 1, washed once with water, and spheroplasted as described previously (16Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were first lysed in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34 rotor), and the pellet was resuspended in the same lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The extract was centrifuged for 30 min as described above, and the supernatant was first pre-cleared by incubation with Sepharose Fast-Flow beads (GE Healthcare) and then loaded onto a column packed with IgG-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Affinity purifications of PtA-Dgk1p followed by tobacco etch virus protease-dependent elution of untagged Dgk1p were performed as described (16Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Preparation of Labeled CTP—[γ-32P]CTP was synthesized enzymatically from CDP and [γ-32P]ATP with nucleoside-diphosphate kinase as described previously (17Müller M.O. Meylan-Bettex M. Eckstein F. Martinoia E. Siegenthaler P.A. Bovet L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19475-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DAG Kinase Assay—DAG kinase activity was measured for 20 min by following the phosphorylation of 0.1 mm DAG with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]CTP (50,000 cpm/nmol) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 mm at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. The radioactive chloroform-soluble product PA was separated from the radioactive water-soluble substrate CTP by a chloroform/methanol/water phase partition (18Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The radioactive chloroform phase was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, the product was subjected to thin layer chromatography using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v) and visualized by phosphorimaging. The DAG kinase assay was conducted in triplicate, and the average S.D. of the assay was ±5%. The enzyme reaction was linear with time and protein concentration. Labeling and Analysis of Lipids—Steady-state labeling of phospholipids and neutral lipids with 32Pi and [2-14C]acetate, respectively, was performed as described previously (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (45:25:2:3, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (32:4:5:1, v/v) as the solvent systems for the first and second dimensions, respectively. Neutral lipids were separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using a solvent system of hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (40:10:1, v/v). The identity of the labeled lipids on thin layer chromatography plates was confirmed by comparison with standards after exposure to iodine vapor. Radiolabeled lipids were visualized by phosphorimaging and subjected to ImageQuant analysis. Microscopy—To visualize GFP, red fluorescent protein, and mCherry fusions, cells were grown in the appropriate selective medium at 30 °C to early logarithmic phase and examined with a ×63 Plan Apochromat objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope with an LSM 510 confocal laser scanning attachment. Cells in Figs. 2D and 6C were viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera, and images were recorded using IP Labs software.FIGURE 6The DAG kinase activity of Dgk1p is required for nuclear membrane expansion.

The arrow points to the conserved aspartate residue. B, the DGK1(D177A) mutant lacks DAG kinase activity. The dgk1Δ strain was transformed with an empty centromeric plasmid or with the same plasmid carrying DGK1 or DGK1(D177A) under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter. Cell extracts from the corresponding strains were assayed for diacylglycerol kinase activity. Values and errors were calculated from three experiments. C, DGK1(D177A) does not promote nuclear membrane growth. The RS453 strain expressing a SEC63-GFP fusion was transformed with the galactose-inducible DGK1 or DGK1(D177A) construct from B, grown to early logarithmic phase in galactose-containing medium, and inspected by microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibodies—The antibody used to detect protein A fusions was from DAKO (catalog no. Z0113). Systematic Analysis of the Function of Phospholipid Biosynthetic Enzymes in Nuclear Structure—Pah1p is a conserved Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase required for phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Pah1p leads to changes in PA and phospholipid levels (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and results in a massive expansion of the nuclear/ER membrane (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To address the possible role of distinct lipid species in nuclear structure, we first asked whether inhibition of other phospholipid biosynthetic steps could have a similar effect on the nuclear/ER membrane. Using a SEC63-GFP fusion as a reporter, we analyzed nuclear/ER membrane structure in a series of mutants lacking the enzymes catalyzing key steps in PA, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, PE, and PC biosynthesis (highlighted in Fig. 1A). Partial defects in peripheral ER structure were observed in cells lacking Cho2p and Opi3p, involved in the final steps of PC methylation (Fig. 1C). Depletion of Cds1p, the essential cytidylyltransferase that utilizes PA to synthesize phospholipids via the CDP-DAG pathway, also partially affects cortical ER structure (Fig. 1C). However, nuclear membrane proliferation and nuclear expansion, similar to those seen in pah1Δ cells, were not observed in any of the mutants tested. Therefore, among the different phospholipid biosynthetic steps, the Pah1p-mediated dephosphorylation of PA to DAG plays a unique role in nuclear structure. Genetic Screens for Factors Regulating PA Metabolism Identify Dgk1p—We reasoned that, if PA regulates nuclear/ER membrane biogenesis, then the activity of other proteins that control PA levels might also impact on nuclear/ER structure. We therefore undertook two screens to identify novel genes encoding PA regulators. Both screens are based on our previous finding that the PA phosphatase activity of Pah1p, which controls cellular concentration of PA (9Han G.-S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), is inhibited by phosphorylation (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively dephosphorylated Pah1p, generated by mutating its phosphorylation sites (PAH1-7P mutant), increases its PA phosphatase activity, represses transcription of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, and results in lethality in medium lacking inositol (11O'Hara L. Han G.-S. Peak-Chew S. Grimsey N. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34537-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with a decrease in cellular PA levels. Similarly, overexpression of the Nem1p-Spo7p phosphatase complex, which dephosphorylates Pah1p, is also lethal (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We therefore screened for high copy number suppressors that can rescue the lethality of the overexpression of PAH1-7P (screen I) or the NEM1-SPO7 phosphatase (screen II). Both screens identified independently the same gene, DGK1 (known previously as HSD1). The suppression of the PAH1-7P and NEM1-SPO7 lethality was confirmed by overexpressing DGK1 in the respective strains using the inducible GAL1/10 promoter (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). DGK1/HSD1 was originally isolated in a screen for suppressors of a sly1 mutant involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking (19Kosodo Y. Imai K. Hirata A. Noda Y. Takatsuki A. Adachi H. Yoda K. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but its function and mechanism of suppression remained so far unknown. Its gene product, Dgk1p, is a 32.8-kDa protein that consists of a short N-terminal hydrophilic region (residues 1-73) followed by four putative transmembrane domains containing a predicted cytidylyltransferase domain (residues 74-288) (Fig. 2C). BLAST searches identified putative Dgk1p orthologs in several other yeast species, but not any apparent related proteins in higher eukaryotes. 4S. Siniossoglou, unpublished data. A GFP-Dgk1p fusion, expressed under the control of the endogenous DGK1 promoter, localized to the ER and nuclear membrane (Fig. 2D). Dgk1p Counteracts the Function of Pah1p by Controlling PA Levels—Cells lacking DGK1 show no apparent growth defects or gross nuclear/ER structure abnormalities. 4S. Siniossoglou, unpublished data. Given that NEM1-SPO7 overexpression inhibits nuclear expansion during mitosis (10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1931-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and that a previous study reported the appearance of membranous tubules in DGK1-overexpressing cells (19Kosodo Y. Imai K. Hirata A. Noda Y. Takatsuki A. Adachi H. Yoda K. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we first asked whether high levels of DGK1 could rescue the lethality of the NEM1-SPO7 overexpression by promoting nuclear growth. Indeed, wild-type cells overexpressing DGK1 from a galactose-inducible promoter contain enlarged and irregularly shaped nuclei and a striking nuclear/ER membrane proliferation that is reminiscent of that originally observed in cells lacking PAH1 (Fig. 3A). Because the overproduction of DGK1 phenocopies the morphological defects of pah1Δ cells, we next asked whether the complementary possibility would be true, i.e. whether lack of DGK1 would rescue the nuclear expansion that takes"

Here, we address plasticity and interconnection of distinct signal transduction pathways within this network. In Caulobacter crescentus antagonistic activities of the PleC phosphatase and DivJ kinase localized at opposite cell poles control the phosphorylation state and subcellular localization of the cell fate determinator protein DivK. We show that DivK functions as an allosteric regulator that switches PleC from a phosphatase into an autokinase state and thereby mediates a cyclic di-GMP-dependent morphogenetic program. Through allosteric activation of the DivJ autokinase, DivK also stimulates its own phosphorylation and polar localization. These data suggest that DivK is the central effector of an integrated circuit that operates via spatially organized feedback loops to control asymmetry and cell fate determination in C. crescentus. Thus, single domain response regulators can facilitate crosstalk, feedback control, and long-range communication among members of the two-component network.

Thus, single domain response regulators can facilitate crosstalk, feedback control, and long-range communication among members of the two-component network. Asymmetric cell division underlies the fundamental basis for the developmental evolution of organisms. It refers to the capability of stem cells to simultaneously produce a continuous output of differentiated cells and to maintain their own population of undifferentiated cells. The regulation of asymmetric division is achieved by the controlled segregation of basally localized cell fate determinants, which leads to the polarization of the stem cell along its axis (Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004Betschinger J. Knoblich J.A. Dare to be different: asymmetric cell division in Drosophila, C. elegans and vertebrates.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R674-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, asymmetry is established by members of the two-component signaling systems, which control various aspects of bacterial physiology including cell differentiation and virulence. Two sensor histidine kinases, DivJ and PleC, are positioned to opposing poles of the Caulobacter predivisional cell (McAdams and Shapiro, 2003McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. A bacterial cell-cycle regulatory network operating in time and space.Science. 2003; 301: 1874-1877Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A cylindrical extension of the cell body, the stalk, and an adhesive holdfast occupy the DivJ-marked pole, while the PleC-occupied pole bears a rotating flagellum and adhesive pili (Figure 7A). Upon division the stalked cell re-enters S-phase immediately, whereas the motile-swarmer cell takes advantage of the replication inert G1 phase to spread out before it undergoes reprogramming into a surface adherent stalked cell. C. crescentus cell fate is implemented by the essential single domain response regulator DivK (Hecht et al., 1995Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A.

Cytokinesis monitoring during development; rapid pole-to-pole shuttling of a signaling protein by localized kinase and phosphatase in Caulobacter.Cell. 2004; 118: 579-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DivK localizes to both poles of the predivisional cell in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, but is released from the flagellated pole after completion of cytokinesis (Figure 7A) (Jacobs et al., 2001Jacobs C. Hung D. Shapiro L. Dynamic localization of a cytoplasmic signal transduction response regulator controls morphogenesis during the Caulobacter cell cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 4095-4100Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). While the DivJ autokinase is the main phosphodonor for DivK and responsible for its sequestration to the cell poles (Lam et al., 2003Lam H. Matroule J.Y. Jacobs-Wagner C. The asymmetric spatial distribution of bacterial signal transduction proteins coordinates cell cycle events.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the PleC phosphatase activity displaces DivK from the flagellated pole by maintaining DivK∼P levels low in the swarmer cell (Lam et al., 2003Lam H.

Compartmentalization of the DivJ kinase and the PleC phosphatase during cell division results in the sudden reduction of DivK∼P levels in the swarmer cell and the initiation of the swarmer-specific developmental program (Matroule et al., 2004Matroule J.Y.

Conversely, a rapid DivJ-mediated increase of DivK phosphorylation is critical for G1-to-S transition and cell differentiation (Hung and Shapiro, 2002Hung D.Y. Shapiro L.

An essential, multicomponent signal transduction pathway required for cell cycle regulation in Caulobacter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 1443-1448Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activated DivK has recently been proposed to control cell cycle progression and development via the CckA-ChpT pathway, which regulates the activity of the master cell cycle regulator CtrA (Biondi et al., 2006Biondi E.G. Reisinger S.J. Skerker J.M. Arif M. Perchuk B.S. Ryan K.R. Laub M.T. Regulation of the bacterial cell cycle by an integrated genetic circuit.Nature. 2006; 444: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that DivK phosphorylation by DivJ and dephosphorylation by PleC are vital for C. crescentus cell cycle control and development, the significance of the spatial behavior of DivK and its molecular role remain unclear. Here we propose that DivK together with PleC and DivJ form the core of an integrated regulatory circuitry that operates via spatially organized cellular feedback loops. We show that DivK directly interacts with both polar proteins to strongly boost their kinase activities. By switching PleC from the phosphatase into the autokinase mode and by forming a strong positive feedback loop with the DivJ autokinase, DivK effectively and robustly mediates G1-to-S transition. One of the readouts of the DivK-driven network is the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP via the activation of the response regulator PleD (Aldridge et al., 2003Aldridge P. Paul R.

PleD phosphorylation results in dimerization-based activation of the C-terminal diguanylate cyclase domain and sequestration of the regulator to the differentiating pole where it directs flagellar ejection, holdfast biogenesis, and stalk formation (Levi and Jenal, 2006Levi A.

Cell cycle-dependent dynamic localization of a bacterial response regulator with a novel di-guanylate cyclase output domain.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments indicated that DivJ, PleC, and DivK are upstream components required for the activation of the PleD diguanylate cyclase (Aldridge et al., 2003Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P.

Pseudoreversion analysis indicates a direct role of cell division genes in polar morphogenesis and differentiation in Caulobacter crescentus.Genetics. 1991; 129: 623-630Google Scholar). Consistent with this, in vivo and in vitro experiments had shown a direct role for PleC and DivJ in modulating phosphorylation, diguanylate cyclase activity, and polar localization of PleD (Aldridge et al., 2003Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P. Rainey P. Jenal U. Role of the GGDEF regulator PleD in polar development of Caulobacter crescentus.Mol.

Cell cycle-dependent dynamic localization of a bacterial response regulator with a novel di-guanylate cyclase output domain.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This indicated that PleC, in addition to functioning as phosphatase in swarmer cells, also plays a role as autokinase and contributes to the stalked cell-specific program via PleD activation. We present in vitro and in vivo evidence that DivK together with the DivJ and PleC kinases serves to activate and sequester the PleD diguanylate cyclase during the G1-to-S transition. DivK contributes to the specific phosphorylation of PleD by acting as a specific and effective enhancer of the PleC and DivJ autokinases. Our findings propose a regulatory role for single domain response regulators in two component signal transduction pathways as diffusible modulators of their cognate sensor histidine kinases. To explore the regulatory link between PleD, PleC, and DivK, activation of PleD diguanylate cyclase activity was assayed in vitro in the presence of PleC and DivK. In line with earlier results (Paul et al., 2004Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Cell cycle-dependent dynamic localization of a bacterial response regulator with a novel di-guanylate cyclase output domain.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) PleC alone only marginally stimulated PleD activity (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, in the presence of DivK or DivKD53N, a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated because it lacks the phosphoryl acceptor site, PleD diguanylate cyclase activity was dramatically stimulated (Figures 1A and 1B). Stimulation by DivK wild-type was less effective, presumably because DivK itself can use PleC∼P as phosphodonor (Hecht et al., 1995Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A. An essential single domain response regulator required for normal cell division and differentiation in Caulobacter crescentus.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and thus can sequester some of the available phosphoryl groups. DivK-dependent stimulation of PleD activity required ATP, PleC autokinase activity, and the PleD phosphoryl acceptor site Asp53 (Figure 1B). In particular, purified PleCF778L, a mutant that lacks autokinase activity but shows normal phosphatase activity (Matroule et al., 2004Matroule J.Y. Lam H. Burnette D.T. Jacobs-Wagner C. Cytokinesis monitoring during development; rapid pole-to-pole shuttling of a signaling protein by localized kinase and phosphatase in Caulobacter.Cell. 2004; 118: 579-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar) failed to support DivK-dependent stimulation of PleD. Because PleD is activated by dimerization (Paul et al., 2007Paul R. Abel S. Wassmann P. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Activation of the diguanylate cyclase pleD by phosphorylation-mediated dimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29170-29177Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), residual diguanylate cyclase activity can be detected at this protein concentration (5 μM) even in the absence of phosphorylation (the Kd for dimerization of nonactivated PleD is 100 μM [Wassmann et al., 2007Wassmann P. Chan C. Paul R. Beck A. Heerklotz H. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Structure of BeF(3)(-)-Modified Response Regulator PleD: Implications for Diguanylate Cyclase Activation, Catalysis, and Feedback Inhibition.Structure. 2007; 15: 915-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar]) (Figure 1B). It is interesting to note that when all three proteins were present PleD diguanylate cyclase activity decreased below the basal level of nonactivated PleD under conditions that did not allow phosphorylation (no ATP, no PleC autokinase activity) (Figure 1B). Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that the single domain response regulator DivK is able to efficiently stimulate the in vitro activity of PleD and that this activation requires an active histidine protein kinase PleC. The above experiments suggested that DivK activates PleD by interfering with PleC autokinase activity. To test this, PleC autophosphorylation activity was monitored in the presence and absence of DivK. Because PleC readily phosphorylates DivK in vitro (Hecht et al., 1995Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A. An essential single domain response regulator required for normal cell division and differentiation in Caulobacter crescentus.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 1998Wu J.

USA. 1998; 95: 1443-1448Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we used DivKD53N to avoid a reduction of PleC∼P by phosphotransfer to DivK. As shown in Figure 2A and Figure S1A (available online), DivKD53N stimulated levels of PleC∼P in a concentration dependent manner. Because the stability of PleC∼P was not affected by DivK (Figure S1B), DivKD53N seems to specifically stimulate PleC autophosphorylation activity. As a consequence of this stimulation, phosphotransfer from PleC to PleD (Figure 2B) as well as PleD dimerization (Figure S2) was increased when both response regulators were present in the reaction. This is consistent with the observed increase in c-di-GMP synthesis in reactions containing PleD, PleC and DivK (Figure 1). Likewise, phosphotransfer from PleC∼P to DivK was stimulated in the presence of DivKD53N (Figure 3A). Stimulation of PleC autokinase activity did not result from a DivK-mediated in vitro artifact (e.g., through DivK assisted folding of PleC), as solubility, quarternary structure, and activity of PleC preincubated with or without DivKD53N was indistinguishable (Figure S3). Finally, we tested if DivKD53N was able to stimulate PleC phosphatase activity. Purified DivK∼P was mixed with PleC in the presence or absence of DivKD53N to assay dephosphorylation rates. In contrast to PleC mediated phosphorylation of DivK, dephosphorylation of DivK was not increased in the presence of DivKD53N (Figures 3A–3C). Rather, the rate of DivK∼P dephosphorylation was reduced in the presence of DivKD53N. In conclusion, these experiments provide strong evidence that the response regulator DivK is able to selectively stimulate the kinase but not the phosphatase activity of its cognate histidine kinase PleC.Figure 3DivK Does not Stimulate PleC Phosphatase ActivityShow full caption(A) PleC-mediated phosphorylation of DivK.

The phosphatase assays were normalized for DivK auto-phosphatase activity. Because DivK and PleD also interact with DivJ, we tested if the response regulators also showed some synergistic behavior with respect to DivJ or if they would compete for DivJ kinase. As shown in Figure 1C, the PleD diguanylate cyclase was activated by DivJ, but the addition of DivK efficiently blocked PleD activation. PleD activation was restored only when DivK was diluted below a molar ratio of 1:10. DivKD53N also reduced DivJ-mediated PleD activation but was less efficient than DivK wild-type (Figure 1C). These results suggested that PleD and DivK compete for the phosphodonor DivJ∼P. This was confirmed by monitoring phosphotransfer from DivJ∼P to the two response regulators. Although DivJ∼P readily served as phosphodonor for PleD in the absence of DivK, phosphoryl groups were transferred exclusively to DivK when both response regulators were present in the reaction mixture (Figure 2D). Altogether, these experiments show that DivK and PleD compete for phosphorylation by the stalked pole specific kinase DivJ, and that in vitro DivJ∼P prefers to transfers phosphate to DivK. The observation that DivK is able to stimulate PleC autokinase activity in vitro raised the possibility that DivK might also modulate the activity of its other cognate kinase, DivJ. Similar to its observed effect on PleC, DivKD53N efficiently stimulated DivJ autophosphorylation (Figures 4A and S1C), and did not affect the stability of DivJ∼P (Figure S1D). As for PleC, pre-incubation of DivJ with DivKD53N did not affect kinase solubility or quarternary structure, and stimulation by DivK was indistinguishable in untreated and DivK pre-treated samples (Figure S4). Activation of DivJ by DivKD53N led to increased phosphotransfer to the response regulators DivK and PleD (Figure 4B). In conclusion, DivK acts both as phosphoryl acceptor and as a potent activator of the stalked pole-specific kinase DivJ. A nonphosphorylatable form of PleD, PleDD53N, had no stimulatory effect on DivJ or PleC (Figure S1C), arguing that the activation of the DivJ and PleC autokinase activities by DivK is specific for this response regulator. Consistent with the postulated cell-cycle role of DivK during the G1-to-S transition, the cold-sensitive divKD90G mutant arrests in G1 at the restrictive temperature (Wu et al., 1998Wu J. Ohta N. Newton A. An essential, multicomponent signal transduction pathway required for cell cycle regulation in Caulobacter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 1443-1448Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature, this strain shows a developmental phenotype strikingly similar to mutants lacking PleD (see below). To test if altered interactions of the mutant protein with DivJ or PleC account for this phenotype we analyzed the ability of DivKD90G to activate the DivJ and PleC autokinases. DivKD90G was slightly less efficient in competing with PleD for the activation by DivJ (Figure 1C). To analyze the interaction of DivKD90G with the DivJ and PleC kinases, we constructed a double mutant protein that lacked the phosphoryl acceptor Asp53. DivKD53ND90G was still able to stimulate DivJ autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to DivK or PleD (Figure 4B). In contrast, DivKD53ND90G was unable to stimulate PleD and PleC autophosphorylation (Figures 1B and 2C), and failed to stimulate PleD activation by PleC (Figure 1B). Phosphotransfer from PleC∼P to DivKD90G was similar to DivK wild-type (Figure S5), and DivKD53ND90G did not affect PleC phosphatase activity (Figure S6). Together, these experiments show that the D90G mutation specifically affects the ability of DivK to stimulate PleC autokinase. Although the phosphatase activity of PleC is sufficient to initiate pole development and induce motility in the swarmer cell (Matroule et al., 2004Matroule J.Y. Lam H. Burnette D.T. Jacobs-Wagner C. Cytokinesis monitoring during development; rapid pole-to-pole shuttling of a signaling protein by localized kinase and phosphatase in Caulobacter.Cell. 2004; 118: 579-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar), it has not been tested if PleC kinase activity plays a role during the next, PleD-dependent step of pole morphogenesis. Because PleC and DivK are able to efficiently activate PleD in vitro, we analyzed the role of PleC kinase in promoting PleD-dependent developmental processes like motility, stalk formation, holdfast synthesis, and surface attachment (Aldridge and Jenal, 1999Aldridge P. Jenal U. Cell cycle-dependent degradation of a flagellar motor component requires a novel-type response regulator.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 379-391Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Aldridge et al., 2003Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P. Rainey P. Jenal U. Role of the GGDEF regulator PleD in polar development of Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1695-1708Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we generated a ΔpleC single and a ΔpleCΔpleD double mutant in the surface-binding wild-type strain CB15 (ATCC19089) and used these strains for complementation experiments with pleC alleles encoding PleC variants with kinase and phosphatase activity (K+P+; pleCWT), with only phosphatase activity (K−P+; pleCF778L), or lacking both activities (K−P−; pleCT614R) (Matroule et al., 2004Matroule J.Y. Lam H. Burnette D.T. Jacobs-Wagner C. Cytokinesis monitoring during development; rapid pole-to-pole shuttling of a signaling protein by localized kinase and phosphatase in Caulobacter.Cell. 2004; 118: 579-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To corroborate that the F778L mutation specifically affects PleC autokinase but not phosphatase activity in vivo, we showed that DivK∼P levels were similarly reduced in swarmer cells of strains harboring pleCWT or pleCF778L, respectively (Figure S7). C. crescentus surface binding is developmentally controlled and requires an active flagellum, the formation of polar pili, and synthesis of an adhesive holdfast (Levi and Jenal, 2006Levi A. Jenal U. Holdfast formation in motile Swarmer cells optimizes surface attachment during Caulobacter crescentus development.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5315-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because of its block in pole development, the ΔpleC mutant completely failed to attach to plastic surfaces, whereas a ΔpleD mutant inefficiently adhered to surfaces because of a delay in holdfast formation (Levi and Jenal, 2006Levi A. Jenal U. Holdfast formation in motile Swarmer cells optimizes surface attachment during Caulobacter crescentus development.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5315-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). Complementation with pleC wild-type fully restored surface attachment of the ΔpleC, but not of the ΔpleCΔpleD double mutant. In contrast, the pleCF778L (K−P+) allele partially restored surface binding of the ΔpleC mutant to the same level observed for a ΔpleD mutant (Figure 5A), arguing that in strains lacking PleC kinase activity development is initiated but cannot proceed past the stage of PleD activation. In comparison, expression of PleCT614R (K−P−) in the ΔpleC strain showed no effect (Figure 5A). Reduced attachment was the result of inefficient formation of the primary cell adhesin, the holdfast, during development. Synchronized cultures of ΔpleC mutant cells complemented with pleC wild-type developed a visible holdfast 15–30 min after swarmer cells were released into fresh medium (Figure 6A). A similar pattern was observed for C. crescentus wild-type cells (Levi and Jenal, 2006Levi A. Jenal U. Holdfast formation in motile Swarmer cells optimizes surface attachment during Caulobacter crescentus development.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5315-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing pleCF778L (K−P+) showed a severe delay in holdfast synthesis and reduced surface attachment during the swarmer-to-stalked cell differentiation (Figure 6A). Because activation of the PleD response regulator results in the production of c-di-GMP (Paul et al., 2004Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Cell cycle-dependent dynamic localization of a bacterial response regulator with a novel di-guanylate cyclase output domain.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), we next tested if PleD-dependent pole morphogenesis correlates with the production of the second messenger during development. A pronounced peak of c-di-GMP was observed early in the C. crescentus cell cycle coincident with the onset of holdfast biogenesis both in wild-type (data not shown) and in the ΔpleC mutant complemented with wild-type pleC (Figure 6B). Because c-di-GMP levels failed to increase in pleD mutant cells or in cells lacking PleC kinase activity (K−P+), we conclude that both activities are necessary to increase second messenger concentration during Caulobacter cell differentiation.Figure 6PleD-Dependent c-di-GMP Synthesis and Holdfast Formation during Development Requires DivK and PleC Kinase ActivityShow full caption(A) Holdfast formation (open symbols) and attachment (closed symbols) during the G1-to-S transition.

Our technique, single-neuron labeling with inducible Cre-mediated knockout (SLICK), is achieved by coexpressing a drug-inducible form of Cre recombinase and a fluorescent protein in a small subsets of neurons, thus combining the powerful Cre recombinase system for conditional genetic manipulation with fluorescent labeling of single neurons for imaging. Here, we demonstrate efficient inducible genetic manipulation in several types of neurons using SLICK. Furthermore, we applied SLICK to eliminate synaptic transmission in a small subset of neuromuscular junctions. Our results provide evidence for the long-term stability of inactive neuromuscular synapses in adult animals and demonstrate a Cre-loxP compatible system for dissecting gene functions in single identifiable neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2057574223,"Human galectins have distinct and overlapping biological roles in immunological homeostasis. However, the underlying differences among galectins in glycan binding specificity regulating these functions are unclear. Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a tandem repeat galectin, has two distinct carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that may cross-link cell surface counter receptors. Here we report that each Gal-8 CRD has differential glycan binding specificity and that cell signaling activity resides in the C-terminal CRD. Full-length Gal-8 and recombinant individual domains (Gal-8N and Gal-8C) bound to human HL60 cells, but only full-length Gal-8 signaled phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in cells, which occurred independently of apoptosis. Although desialylation of cells did not alter Gal-8 binding, it enhanced cellular sensitivity to Gal-8-induced PS exposure. By contrast, HL60 cell desialylation increased binding by Gal-8C but reduced Gal-8N binding. Enzymatic reduction in surface poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) glycans in HL60 cells reduced cell surface binding by Gal-8C but did not alter Gal-8N binding. Cross-linking and light scattering studies showed that Gal-8 is dimeric, and studies on individual subunits indicate that dimerization occurs through the Gal-8N domain. Mutations of individual domains within full-length Gal-8 showed that signaling activity toward HL60 cells resides in the C-terminal domain. In glycan microarray analyses, each CRD of Gal-8 showed different binding, with Gal-8N recognizing sulfated and sialylated glycans and Gal-8C recognizing blood group antigens and polyLacNAc glycans. These results demonstrate that Gal-8 dimerization promotes functional bivalency of each CRD, which allows Gal-8 to signal PS exposure in leukocytes entirely through C-terminal domain recognition of polyLacNAc glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2073738037,"Post-transcriptional modifications at the first (wobble) position of the tRNA anticodon participate in precise decoding of the genetic code. To decode codons that end in a purine (R) (i.e. NNR), tRNAs frequently utilize 5-methyluridine derivatives (xm5U) at the wobble position. However, the functional properties of the C5-substituents of xm5U in codon recognition remain elusive. We previously found that mitochondrial tRNAsLeu(UUR) with pathogenic point mutations isolated from MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patients lacked the 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm5U) modification and caused a decoding defect. Here, we constructed Escherichia coli tRNAsLeu(UUR) with or without xm5U modifications at the wobble position and measured their decoding activities in an in vitro translation as well as by A-site tRNA binding. In addition, the decoding properties of tRNAArg lacking mnm5U modification in a knock-out strain of the modifying enzyme (ΔmnmE) were examined by pulse labeling using reporter constructs with consecutive AGR codons. Our results demonstrate that the xm5U modification plays a critical role in decoding NNG codons by stabilizing U·G pairing at the wobble position. Crystal structures of an anticodon stem-loop containing τm5U interacting with a UUA or UUG codon at the ribosomal A-site revealed that the τm5U·G base pair does not have classical U·G wobble geometry.

The genetic code is deciphered by the anticodons of tRNAs, which carry an amino acid at the 3′ end, bind to a specific codon in the mRNA, and transfer their amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain on the ribosome.

Structural studies of the 30 S ribosomal subunit revealed that the conserved bases A1492, A1493, and G530 in the decoding center of the 16 S rRNA specifically monitor these two WC-type pairings by A-minor interactions (1Ogle J.M.

Cell. 2002; 111: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These interactions induce a large conformational rearrangement of the 30 S subunit that is necessary for tRNA selection and maintaining decoding fidelity. In contrast, base-pairing between the first base of the anticodon (position 34) and the third base of the codon does not always conform to WC-type pairing rules, so that synonymous codons for an amino acid are deciphered by a minimum set of tRNA anticodons. This behavior is referred to as “wobble pairing” (3Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), which is a highly evolved system required for the degeneracy of the genetic code by which 61 sense codons are deciphered into 20 amino acids by a limited set of tRNA species. Modified nucleosides are often found at the wobble position of tRNA anticodons (4Bjork G.R. Biosynthesis and Function of Modified Nucleosides.

The wobble modifications play critical roles in modulating codon recognition by restricting, expanding, or altering the decoding properties of the tRNAs (7Suzuki T. Fine-tuning of RNA Functions by Modification and Editing. Springer-Verlag New York Inc, New York2005: 24-69Google Scholar). In contrast to the first and second codon-anticodon base pair, the ribosome imposes less restraints on the wobble base pair (1Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P.

According to the original wobble rule (3Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), unmodified uridine at the wobble position (U34) was proposed to recognize only A and G at the third codon position. However, U34 can actually base-pair with any of the four bases due to its conformational flexibility (four-way wobbling). In fact, U34 is frequently found in tRNA species that are responsible for entire codon family boxes, in which four codons are synonymous, from Mycoplasma spp. and mitochondria (9Bonitz S.G.

These modifications are classified into two groups according to their distinct chemical structures and decoding properties: 5-hydroxyuridine derivatives (xo5U) with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the C5 atom of the uracil base and 5-methyluridine derivatives (xm5U) with a methylene carbon directly bonded to the C5 atom. The xo5U type modifications are often found in bacterial tRNAs that are responsible for family boxes.

In contrast, xm5U type modifications are found at the wobble position of tRNAs that are responsible for purine-ending split codon boxes (NNR) (7Suzuki T. Fine-tuning of RNA Functions by Modification and Editing. Springer-Verlag New York Inc, New York2005: 24-69Google Scholar). The xm5U type modifications include 2-thiouridine derivatives (xm5s2U) and 2′-O-methyluridine derivatives (xm5Um). 5-Methylaminomethyluridine (mnm5U) and its 2-thio derivative (mnm5s2U) are typical xm5U type modifications found in bacterial tRNAs, whereas 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and its 2-thio (mcm5s2U) and 2′-O-methyl derivatives (mcm5Um) are found only in eukaryotic tRNAs. 5-Carboxymethylaminomethyluridine (cmnm5U) (see Fig. 1A) can be found at the wobble position of tRNAs from Mycoplasma spp. and yeast mitochondria (17Martin R.P.

In bacteria, cmnm5(s2)U is a modification intermediate of mnm5(s2)U, but cmnm5s2U and cmnm5Um are also found at the wobble positions of E. coli tRNALeu4 and tRNAGln1, respectively. 3K. Miyauchi and T. Suzuki unpublished result. The conformation of xm5s2U is largely fixed in the C3′-endo form of ribose puckering due to the large van der Waals radius of the 2-thio atom causing steric repulsion of the 2′-oxygen atom (19Yokoyama S.

Due to its conformational rigidity, the xm5s2U modification prefers to base-pair with A and prevents misreading of NNY codons (6Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Soll D. Rajbandary U.L.

Compared with the 2-thio group of xm5s2U, the chemical nature and functional roles of C5-substituents of xm5U remain elusive. The mammalian mitochondrial decoding system utilizes a limited set of tRNAs (22 species) that are capable of deciphering the 60 sense codons in the 13 protein genes encoded in mitochondrial (mt) DNA (10Barrell B.G. Anderson S. Bankier A.T. de Bruijn M.H. Chen E. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, DC1995: 225-250Google Scholar). The wobble modifications play an essential role in this decoding system. The four-way wobble rule of U34 reduces the total number of tRNA species required. In fact, each family box of codons is deciphered by a single tRNA with an unmodified wobble uridine. In human (and bovine) mt tRNAs responsible for decoding purine-ending two-codon sets, we previously identified two novel xm5U wobble modifications that possess a sulfonic acid group derived from taurine: 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm5U) (see Fig. 1A) in tRNAs for Leu(UUR) and Trp and 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine (τm5s2U) in tRNAs for Lys, Gln, and Glu (21Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Wada T. Saigo K. Watanabe K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6581-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). 4T. Suzuki and T. Suzuki, unpublished results. These taurine-containing uridines are synthesized by direct incorporation of dietary taurine, indicating that taurine is a constituent of biological macromolecules and that there is a catabolic flow of intracellular taurine into mitochondria. Previously, we reported that the τm5(s2)U modifications are defective in mutant tRNAs from cells harboring mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (22Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Ueda T. Ohta S.

The mutant A8344G mt tRNALys from MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers) patients possesses an unmodified wobble uridine instead of the normal τm5s2U modification (23Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Ishii N. Ueda T. Ohta S. Watanabe K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Yasukawa T. Kirino Y. Ishii N. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Makifuchi T. Fukuhara N. Ohta S. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In one of five pathogenic mutations associated with MELAS, a mutant mt tRNALeu(UUR) also lacks the normal τm5U modification (22Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Ueda T. Ohta S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4251-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Kirino Y. Goto Y. Campos Y. Arenas J. Suzuki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7127-7132Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using an in vitro mitochondrial translation system revealed that the wild type tRNALeu(UUR) whose τm5U modification was surgically replaced by an unmodified uridine exhibited severely reduced UUG decoding but no decrease in UUA decoding (27Kirino Y. Yasukawa T. Ohta S. Akira S. Ishihara K. Watanabe K. Suzuki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15070-15075Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that a UUG codon-specific translational defect of mutant mt tRNALeu(UUR) lacking the wobble modification is the primary cause of MELAS at the molecular level. In this study, we examined the decoding properties of cmnm5U- and τm5U-modified tRNAs using an E. coli in vitro translation system to elucidate the functional roles played by xm5U modifications. We chose to compare the cmnm5U modification with τm5U because cmnm5U contains glycine-derived substituents, the chemical characteristics of which are similar to the taurine-derived substituent of τm5U. The decoding properties of the xm5U modification were also investigated in cells of the knock-out strain for the modification enzyme mnmE, which generates the xm5U modification. Finally, we directly observed by crystallography the nature of the τm5U·G base pair at the wobble position at the ribosomal A-site. Our results demonstrate the critical role played by xm5U modifications in decoding NNG codons. Construction of E. coli tRNALeu(UUR) Bearing the Wobble Modification—The cmnm5U and τm5U nucleosides were chemically synthesized (21Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Wada T. Saigo K. Watanabe K.

Subsequently, periodate oxidation was performed to inactivate the unligated substrate (31Kurata S. Ohtsuki T. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sodium periodate (NaIO4) was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the solution was incubated on ice for 40 min in the dark. Sodium periodate was removed from the RNAs by ethanol precipitation. The 3′-phosphate of the ligated 5′-fragment was then removed using bacterial alkaline phosphatase, as described (32Ohtsuki T. Kawai G. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ligated 5′-fragment and the 3′-fragment (5′-HO-AAAAUCCCUCGGCGUUCGCGCUGUGCGGGUUCAAGUCCCGCUCCGGCUACCA-OH-3′) (90 μm each) were mixed and heated at 65 °C for 7 min, annealed at room temperature for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 15 mm MgCl2, and then ligated at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 17.5 mm MgCl2, 3.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 300 μm ATP, and 1.6 units/μl T4 RNA ligase. Subsequently, the 5′ termini of the tRNAs were phosphorylated (31Kurata S. Ohtsuki T. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resultant tRNAs were purified by separation on 10% denaturing PAGE. The sequences of the tRNAs were confirmed enzymatically (34Donis-Keller H.

Briefly, the 5′-ends of E. coli tRNAsLeu(UUR) with or without wobble modifications were labeled with [32P]phosphate and mixed with unlabeled tRNA to adjust the concentration of each tRNA. mRNAs containing A-site UUR codons were synthesized by in vitro run-off transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as described (27Kirino Y.

E. coli 70 S ribosomes were prepared as described (39Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 1-30Google Scholar). E. coli tRNAfMet was kindly provided by Dr. Nono Takeuchi (University of Tokyo). The ribosomal P-site was first occupied with initiator tRNAfMet in a mixture (10 μl) consisting of 5.2 pmol of E. coli 70 S ribosome, 2 μg of mRNA, 12.4 pmol of E. coli initiator tRNAfMet, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm spermine, which was incubated at 37 °C for 17 min. Four different amounts (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 pmol) of 5′-32P-labeled E. coli tRNAsLeu(UUR) with or without wobble modifications in a mixture (10 μl) consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm spermine were added to the ribosomal mixtures, and a nonenzymatic binding reaction was performed at 37 °C for 12 min. The reaction mixture was passed through nitrocellulose filters (pore size 0.45 μm; ADVANTEC). The filter was washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT and then air-dried. The amount of tRNA bound was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In Vitro Cell-free Translation—The in vitro cell-free translation assay was carried out according to previously described methods. Briefly, tRNAsLeu(UUR) with or without wobble modifications were leucylated at 37 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture (30 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, 100 μm [14C]l-leucine, and 1 μg/μl E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase. The preparation of E. coli S30 extracts has been described previously (40Takai K. Takaku H. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Four UUN-mRNAs, each containing one UUN test codon, were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, as described (41Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), to create the following open reading frame sequence (test codon underlined): 5′-AUGAUCAUUAUCAUUAUCAUUAUCAUAAUCAUCUUNGUGGUGGUCGUGGUGUAAUAGUAG-3′, which encodes Met-Ile10-Leu/Phe-Val5. To construct template DNAs for UUN-mRNAs, DNA fragments were synthesized by Klenow reaction using the following primers: 5′-GAAGGAGATATACATATGATCATTATCATTATCATTATCATAATCATCTTNGTGGTGGTCGTGGTGTA-3′ and 5′-GACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTATGCATCTACTATTACACCACGACCACCAC-3′. The template DNAs were then subjected to PCR to obtain the insert fragments for the templates using the following primers: 5′-CCGGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACGGTTTCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGATC-3′ and 5′-AAAAAAAAAACGAGCCTTTCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATG-3′. Resultant DNAs were inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pUC19 (TOYOBO). The nucleotide sequences of the plasmids encoding UUN-mRNAs were confirmed by the dideoxy termination method of sequencing using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Each template DNA was prepared from large scale cultures of E. coli JM109 cells, completely digested with EcoRI, and then transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. In addition, we prepared an mRNA (GGC-mRNA) in which the UUN codon was replaced with a GGC codon, to be used as a negative control. The cell-free translation reaction (18.7 μl) contained 44 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 11 mm DTT, 1.8 mm GTP, 8.4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate potassium salt, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma), 0.54 mg/ml folinic acid calcium salt (Sigma), 44 mm ammonium acetate, 6.4 mm spermidine, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 56 mm potassium glutamate, 0.3 mm each of methionine, isoleucine, and valine, 1 μg of one of the mRNAs, 5 pmol of [14C]Leu-tRNALeu(UUR) with or without wobble modification, and one-sixth volume of S30 extract. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the radioactivity of amino acids incorporated into the peptide was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity of incorporated Leu into GGC-mRNA was subtracted from that of each UUN-mRNA to obtain decoding activity data. Construction of E. coli ΔmnmE Strain—The E. coli K-12 strain BW25113 (lacIq rrnBT14 ΔlacZWJ16 hsdR514 ΔaraBA-DAH33 ΔrhaBADLD78) was used for the “one-step inactivation of chromosomal genes” procedure (42Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PCR fragment containing the kanamaycin resistance (kan) gene flanked by two flippase recombinase (FLP) recognition targets was generated using pKD4 as the template with the following primers: KO-F, 5′-TAAGCACCGCGCATCCGCCACACAAAGCAACAGGAACATCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′; KO-R, 5′-AGCCGCATCTGACAGTCAGAATGCGGCTTCGTAAGCGCGGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′. This PCR product contains 40 nucleotide extensions that are homologous to the 3′ and 5′ 40 base pairs of mnmE. The PCR fragment was introduced into BW25113/pKD46 E. coli, resulting in insertion of the kan FLP recognition target cassette into the mnmE gene. Disruption of the mnmE gene was confirmed by PCR using 5′-TACATGCTGATGGGTTCCGT-3′ and 5′-GAGGTCACACATATATGTAA-3′ as the primers. The mnmE disruption was transduced into BW25113, and the resistance gene was removed using an FLP expression plasmid (pCP20). Construction of fusA Reporters—The E. coli fusA gene encoding EF-G was cloned into the BamHI/SalI site of pQE-80L (Qiagen). The codons in the fusA gene corresponding to Val-447, Trp-448, and Thr-449 were mutated to AGR codons using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction to create the fusA reporters using the following primers: 5′-AAGACCCGTCTTTCCGTAGAAGAAGAGACGAAGAATCTAACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTTAGATTCTTCGTCTCTTCTTCTACGGAAAGACGGGTCTT-3′ for fusA-AGA; 5′-ACCCGTCTTTCCGTGTAAGGAGGGACGAAGAATCTAACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTTAGATTCTTCGTCCCTCCTTACACGGAAAGACGGGT-3′ for fusA-AGG. Construction of the reporters was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The pArgU plasmid, a pMW218 harboring the E. coli argU gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Yamada (Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.). Pulse-labeling of Nascent Peptide Chains—Pulse labeling with [35S]methionine was performed as described previously (43Varenne S. Knibiehler M. Cavard D. Morlon J. Lazdunski C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Each fusA reporter (fusA-AGA and fusA-AGG) was introduced into an E. coli wild-type or ΔmnmE strain. The cells were grown at 37 °C to OD 0.4 at A600 in LB medium (2 ml), and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 mm for induction. After a 30-min induction, [35S]methionine (final concentration, 110 μCi/ml) was added to start the pulse labeling (t = 0). At 20 s, unlabeled methionine (final concentration, 20 mm) was rapidly mixed into the medium. Samples (100-μl aliquots) were taken at t = 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 110, 150, and 200 s and transferred into new tubes containing liquid nitrogen. Before thawing, chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The cells were washed twice at 4 °C with double-distilled H2O. Washed pellets were suspended in a mixture (6.5 μl) consisting of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To this suspension, 2.5 μl of sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, and 0.005% bromophenol blue) and 1 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol were added, and the samples were then boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Wako Chemicals). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, washed, and vacuum-dried. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate, and the labeled polypeptides were visualized using a bioimaging analyzer (BAS 5000; Fuji Photo Film). Northern Blots—Total RNA from E. coli was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA (∼5 μg) was electropho"
https://openalex.org/W2009640428,"Ras oncogene upregulates the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox) 1 via the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, leading to the elevated production of reactive oxygen species that is essential for maintenance of Ras-transformation phenotypes. However, the precise transcriptional control mechanism underlying Ras-induced Nox1 expression remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrated that via the MEK/ERK pathway, Ras signaling enhances the activity of the functional Nox1 promoter (nt −321 to −1) in colon cancer CaCo-2 cells and thereby induces the formation of the specific protein–DNA complexes in the two GATA-binding site-containing regions (nt −161 to −136 and −125 to −100). Supershift assays with GATA antibodies, protein analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that GATA-6 is a component of the specific protein–DNA complexes at the Nox1 promoter. GATA-6 was able to trans-activate the Nox1 promoter but not a promoter in which the GATA-binding sites are mutated. Moreover, GATA-6 was phosphorylated at serine residues by MEK-activated ERK, which increased GATA-6 DNA binding, correlating with suppression of the Nox1 promoter activity by an MEK inhibitor PD98059. Finally, the site-directed mutation of the consensus ERK phosphorylation site (PYS120P to PYA120P) of GATA-6 abolished its trans-activation activity, suppressing of the growth of CaCo-2 cells. On the basis of these results, we propose that oncogenic Ras signaling upregulates the transcription of Nox1 through MEK-ERK-dependent phosphorylation of GATA-6."
https://openalex.org/W2043436209,"SRP is essential for targeting nascent chains to the endoplasmic reticulum, and it delays nascent chain elongation in cell-free translation systems. However, the significance of this function has remained unclear. We show that efficient protein translocation into the ER is incompatible with normal cellular translation rates due to rate-limiting concentrations of SRP receptor (SR). We complemented mammalian cells depleted of SRP14 by expressing mutant versions of the protein lacking the elongation arrest function. The absence of a delay caused inefficient targeting of preproteins leading to defects in secretion, depletion of proteins in the endogenous membranes, and reduced cell growth. The detrimental effects were reversed by either reducing the cellular protein synthesis rate or increasing SR expression. SRP therefore ensures that nascent chains remain translocation competent during the targeting time window dictated by SR. Since SRP-signal sequence affinities vary, the delay may also regulate which proteins are preferentially targeted."

Although it is well established that RNA pol III-dependent transcription is deregulated in transformed cells and malignant tumors, it has not been determined whether this represents a cause or consequence of these processes. We show that Rat1a fibroblasts undergoing oncogenic transformation by the TATA-binding protein or c-Myc display enhanced RNA pol III transcription. Decreased expression of the RNA pol III-specific transcription factor Brf1 prevented this increase in RNA pol III transcription. Although the overall proliferation rates of these cells remained unchanged, the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner and form tumors in mice was markedly reduced. Although overexpression of Brf1 modestly stimulated RNA pol III transcription, expression of a phosphomimic, Brf1-T145D, more significantly induced transcription. However, these increases in transcription were not sufficient to promote cellular transformation. Together, these results demonstrate that enhanced RNA pol III transcription is essential for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis and that these events can be uncoupled from effects on anchorage-dependent proliferation.

RNA polymerase (pol) 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; TF, transcription factor; TBP, TATA-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcription; qPCR, quantitative PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. III synthesizes a variety of small untranslated RNAs, including tRNA, 5 S rRNA, U6 RNA, and 7SL RNA. RNA pol III products play essential roles in protein synthesis, RNA processing, and protein trafficking. rRNA synthesis by RNA pol I and pol III is a limiting step in ribosome accumulation (1Zetterberg A. Killander D. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 40: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the overall rate of translation is determined by the number of ribosomes (2Liebhaber S.A. Wolf S. Schlessinger D. Cell. 1978; 13: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of RNA pol I and pol III transcription dictates the biosynthetic capacity of cells and may be an important determinant of a cell's capacity to grow. Consistent with this idea, decreasing RNA pol I transcription has been shown to result in reduced cellular growth rates (3White R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent results showed that decreased RNA pol III transcription by the bacterial compound Tagetin prevented hypertropic enlargement of cardiomyocytes (4Goodfellow S.J. White R.J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2323-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activation of RNA pol III-dependent transcription may thus be needed for increased cell mass. RNA pol III transcription is regulated by a variety of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Oncogenic Ras (5Wang H.D. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6838-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), c-Myc (6Gomez-Roman N. Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. White R.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (7Woiwode A. Johnson S.A. Zhong S. Zhang C. Roeder R.G. Teichmann M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) all serve to induce transcription, whereas the tumor suppressors Rb (8White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), p53 (9Crighton D. Woiwode A. Zhang C. Mandavia N. Morton J.P. Warnock L.J. Milner J. White R.J. Johnson D.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2810-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and PTEN (7Woiwode A. Johnson S.A. Zhong S. Zhang C. Roeder R.G. Teichmann M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) repress RNA pol III transcription. The RNA pol III-specific transcription factor (TF) IIIB complex, composed of TATA-binding protein (TBP), Brf1, and Bdp1, is the target of these regulatory proteins. Both Rb and p53 interact directly with components of the TFIIIB complex to inhibit its function, whereas c-Myc stimulates RNA pol III transcription by directly associating with the TFIIIB complex and enhancing its recruitment to promoters. In contrast, through its ability to regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PTEN indirectly modulates the association between TBP and Brf1, determining the number of functional TFIIIB complexes. Expression of oncogenic Ras induces expression of TBP in a variety of cell lines (5Wang H.D. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6838-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Woiwode A. Johnson S.A. Zhong S. Zhang C. Roeder R.G. Teichmann M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell.

Changes in TBP expression differentially affect the transcription of RNA pol II genes depending on the promoter architecture (11Colgan J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Majello B. Napolitano G. Lania L. AIDS. 1998; 12: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Alterations in cellular TBP expression have profound phenotypic consequences. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, changes in cellular TBP concentrations alter cellular proliferation rates (13Zhong S. Fromm J. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Heterozygous disruption of TBP in chicken DT cells results in slower growth rates and delayed mitosis (14Um M. Yamauchi J. Kato S. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In Rat1a fibroblasts, increased cellular TBP expression does not alter proliferation rates but promotes anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in athymic mice (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that oncogenic proteins can stimulate RNA pol III transcription, the role of enhanced RNA pol III transcription in their transforming function remains unclear. In addition to its regulation by oncogenes and tumor suppressors, RNA pol III transcription is deregulated in transformed and tumor cells. A hallmark of cancer cells is their abnormally enlarged nucleoli, which pathologists have long used as a diagnostic criterion for malignancy (for example, see Ref. 16Rzymowska J. Tumori. 1997; 83: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This increase in nucleolar size is a result of enhanced rRNA synthesis as a consequence of deregulation of both RNA pol I and pol III transcription. In addition, the accumulation of RNA pol III transcripts around the nucleolus is particularly evident in transformed cells (17Wang C. Politz J.C. Pederson T. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many types of virus-transformed cell lines display enhanced production of RNA pol III transcripts, including those transformed with simian virus 40 (18White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3713-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), papovavirus (19Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48182-48191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and viral products such as hepatitis B virus X protein (20Wang H.D. Yuh C.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein (21Gottesfeld J.M. Johnson D.L. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1777-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Overproduction of RNA pol III transcripts has been observed in a wide variety of human tumors. Both tRNA and 5 S rRNA are overproduced in ovarian tumors relative to matched normal tissue (22Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H. Spandidos D.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12619-12624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas 7 SL RNA was found to be more abundant in 80 tumor samples compared with matched normal tissue derived from 19 different cancers (23Chen W. Bocker W. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in situ hybridization of various RNA pol III transcripts revealed that the levels of these transcripts are increased in neoplastic cells compared with the normal surrounding tissue (23Chen W. Bocker W. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Heierhorst J. Brosius J. Tiedge H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 288-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results argue that enhanced RNA pol III transcription may be essential for tumorigenesis. Here, we show that anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity can be inhibited by selectively preventing TBP- and c-Myc-mediated increases in RNA pol III-dependent transcription. This effect on transformation can be uncoupled from overall cellular proliferation rates, which remain unchanged. These results provide new evidence that increased transcription by RNA pol III is not simply a consequence of the transformation process, but it is actually required to promote cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Expression Plasmids—The human TBP expression plasmid pLTR-E2TBP and construction of the TBP mutants L185E and K249E were as described previously (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The human Brf1 expression plasmids pcDNA3-HA-Brf1 and HA-Brf1-T145D were provided by R. J. White (25Felton-Edkins Z.A. Fairley J.A. Graham E.L. Johnston I.M. White R.J. Scott P.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and were subcloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pCEP4. The Brf1 small interfering RNA targeting sequence 5′-AAG CAC TGC CCC ACT TAT TTG-3′ was used in a small hairpin to make the FG12-U6-Brf1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral expression vector constructed as described (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FG12-U6 mismatch RNA was described previously (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Generation of Lentivirus and Stable Cell Lines—Rat1A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter glucose) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Stable cell lines expressing TBP or mutant TBPs with or without Brf1 or Brf1 mutants were established as described previously and selected with 600 μg/ml G418 and with or without 80 μg/ml hygromycin (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Early passage number pooled populations of selected cells were used. Rat1a cells stably expressing c-Myc were described previously (27Hoang A.T. Cohen K.J. Barrett J.F. Bergstrom D.A. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6875-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Generation of lentiviral stocks and infection of Rat1a cells were described previously (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Where infection efficiencies were <95%, infected cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and expanded for further use. To re-establish cell lines from tumor tissues, tumors from mice injected with vector, TBP, or TBP-L185E cell lines were surgically removed, minced, and recultured in complete medium for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with selection medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 and propagated for 2 weeks. Two independent cell lines were established from tumors from two different mice for each re-established tumor-derived stable cell line. For all experiments, multiple independent stable cell lines were generated for each construct and experimentally tested, and representative results are shown for each. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein lysates from subconfluent cultures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-human TBP or anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), or mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Chemicon) antibody. Anti-Brf1-1 antibody was a gift from R. W. White (28Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Primary antibody was visualized with chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Densitometry was performed using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific). Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60, prepared, and reverse-transcribed for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and analyzed as described previously (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Primer sets for pre-tRNALeu, 7SL RNA, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and for tRNAMeti (29Marshall L. Kenneth N.S. White R.J. Cell. 2008; 133: 78-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were described previously. Additional primer sets were as follows: HA-tagged human TBP, 5′-CCC GAC TAC GCC ACC GGT GAT ATC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTG TTG TTG CTG CTG CTG CCT TTG-3′ (reverse); murine TBP, 5′-GCT AGG TTT CTG CGG TCG CGT C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTG TAC TGA GGC TGC TGC AGT TGC TAC-3′ (reverse); rat Brf1, 5′-CGA CTC ACA GCC TCC AGA GCA C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCG ATG GCT TGA CAG GCT CA-3′ (reverse); and rat Bdp1, 5′-CTC CGC CCA GGA GGA TAG TCA GAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCT GGG TTG CTC AGA CTG CAG ACT-3′ (reverse). Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for all primer sets. Relative transcript amounts were quantified as described (26Johnson S.S. Zhang C. Fromm J. Willis I.M. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using the comparative threshold cycle method with GAPDH serving as the endogenous control reference. Transcript levels were normalized to those of GAPDH, and -fold changes were calculated based on transcript levels in the vector cell line or tumor. Statistics to determine significant differences (p < 0.05) were performed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Cell Accumulation Rate, Anchorage-independent Growth, and Mouse Tumorigenicity Assays—Cell accumulation rates were determined by plating between 10,000 and 50,000 cells/60-mm dish. Cells were harvested daily, and viable cells were counted using a Coulter Counter. Soft agar growth assays were performed as described previously (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1000 cells (Rat1a-Myc) or 7500 cells (all other Rat1a stable cell lines) were evenly single cell-suspended in 1.5 ml of 0.35% (w/v) low-melting agarose at 42 °C and overlaid onto each well of a 6-well dish containing a 0.7% (w/v) low-melting agarose bed in triplicate. All agarose suspensions were made Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/ml glucose) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (final concentrations). Colonies >100 μm were counted after 21 days. Tumorigenicity assay with athymic nude (nu/nu) mice using Rat1a stable cell lines and infected cell lines (1 × 106 cells/animal) was conducted as described previously (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tumor volumes were determined by measuring tumor dimensions (height × width × depth). Statistics were performed as described above. Enhanced TBP Expression Induces RNA pol III-dependent Transcription—Our previous study demonstrated that increased expression of TBP in Rat1a fibroblasts induces both anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in athymic mice (15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Rat1a system is a sensitive experimental approach that has been extensively used to detect transforming properties of proteins (30Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 31Small M.B. Hay N. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To identify the changes in gene expression required for TBP to promote these processes, we asked whether increased TBP expression induces RNA pol III transcription and, if so, whether this is necessary for TBP-mediated transforming function. Rat1a cells were stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged TBP, TBP-L185E, or TBP-K249E. These two mutant forms, which differ from wild-type TBP by single amino acid substitutions, were shown previously to be selectively defective for RNA pol III transcription in cultured cells due to decreased association with the RNA pol III-specific factor Brf1 (32Shen Y. Kassavetis G.A. Bryant G.O. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Expression of both mutant and wild-type proteins in these stable lines was 20% above that of the endogenous TBP protein (Fig. 1A). To determine the consequence of increased TBP expression on RNA pol III transcription, RNA was isolated from each of the stable cell lines, and RT-qPCR analysis was used to determine the amount of precursor transcripts. Enhanced TBP expression induced increases in both precursor tRNALeu and 7SL RNA transcripts (Fig. 1B). However, expression of TBP-L185E and TBP-K249E did not increase production of these transcripts. These results indicate that increased TBP expression induces RNA pol III transcription in vitro. Furthermore, these results suggest that increases in TBP directly support the RNA pol III transcription process because TBP-Brf1 interactions are necessary to augment transcription. We next examined whether the stable cell line expressing TBP-L185E would similarly fail to support an increase in transcription in vivo. Cell lines containing empty vector or those expressing increased TBP or TBP-L185E were each subcutaneously injected into athymic mice. RNA was isolated from the resultant tumor cells, and RT-qPCR analysis was conducted. Unlike what was observed in vitro, expression of TBP-L185E displayed an increase in RNA pol III transcripts in the in vivo environment compared with the vector control, comparable with that seen with enhanced expression of TBP (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the stable cell lines maintained expression of the introduced cDNAs, the amounts of exogenous TBP and TBP-L185E and endogenous TBP mRNAs were measured (Fig. 1D). All tumors derived from vector, TBP, and TBP-L185E cell lines expressed comparable amounts of endogenous TBP and the TFIIIB-associated factors Brf1 and Bdp1. Similar levels of ectopically expressed TBP and TBP-L185E were also expressed. To further examine whether the TBP-L185E-mediated increase in RNA pol III transcription in the tumors is reversible, the tumor cells were recultured in vitro. Although the tumor-derived TBP stable cell line continued to show an increase in RNA pol III transcripts relative to the vector control line, cells expressing TBP-L185E did not support this increase (Fig. 1E), similar to what we observed initially for these stable lines in culture (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that although TBP-L185E does not enhance transcription in vitro, it does so in vivo. This provides us with a tool to examine the effects of transcriptional activity on malignant potential. TBP-mediated Induction of RNA pol III Transcription Does Not Alter Cellular Proliferation but Induces Anchorage-independent Growth—We next determined the phenotypic consequences of enhanced TBP expression in the presence and absence of increased RNA pol III transcription. We compared the cellular proliferation rates of the TBP, TBP-L185E, and TBP-K249E stable cell lines. Neither increased TBP expression nor expression of TBP-L185E and TBP-K249E affected proliferation rates (Fig. 2A). However, there were discernible differences in the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar. Although enhanced TBP expression supported anchorage-independent growth, expression of TBP-L185E or TBP-K249E did not (Fig. 2B). Thus, enhanced RNA pol III transcription is necessary for TBP-mediated anchorage-independent cellular growth. We assessed the ability of the stable cell lines expressing TBP-L185E or TBP-K249E to form tumors in mice. In light of our findings that the mutations did not affect transcription in vivo (Fig. 1C), we anticipated that there would be no measurable difference in the tumorigenic potential of the cells expressing increased TBP versus the mutant TBP proteins. Indeed, compared with the vector control cell line, the TBP, TBP-L185E, and TBP-K249E stable lines all displayed similar enhancements in tumor formation (Fig. 2A). Thus, tumorigenic potential is directly influenced by the RNA pol III transcription capacity. These results indicate that enhanced RNA pol III transcription, together with other TBP-mediated changes in gene expression, correlates with tumorigenesis. Preventing RNA pol III Transcription Induction Inhibits TBP-mediated Tumorigenesis—We used an additional approach to further confirm that RNA pol III transcription induction is required for TBP-mediated cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Expression of the RNA pol III-specific TBP-associated factor Brf1 was reduced to prevent TBP-mediated increases in RNA pol III transcription. Stable cell lines expressing increased amounts of TBP were infected with lentiviral constructs containing a mismatch RNA or an shRNA for Brf1. A 2-fold decrease in Brf1 expression was observed in the TBP-Brf1 shRNA stable cell lines (Fig. 3A). This abrogated the TBP-mediated increase in RNA pol III transcription, although the level of transcription was not lower than that observed in the vector control cell line (Fig. 3B). No differences in cellular proliferation rates were observed upon reduction of Brf1 levels (Fig. 3C). However, decreased Brf1 expression significantly inhibited TBP-mediated anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 3D). As expected, when these cell lines were assayed for their ability to form tumors in mice, the stable line expressing an increase in TBP without a change in Brf1 expression displayed a marked increase in tumor formation compared with the vector control line (Fig. 4A). Decreased Brf1 expression resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume. RNA analysis of the tumor-derived cells confirmed that a reduction in Brf1 expression was maintained in the resultant tumor cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, decreased Brf1 expression was sufficient to maintain a reduction in RNA pol III transcription in vivo (Fig. 4C). Thus, selectively preventing induction of RNA pol III transcription through reduced Brf1 expression markedly decreases TBP-mediated anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis, independent of any effect on cellular proliferation. Increased RNA pol III Transcription Is Not Sufficient to Promote Cellular Transformation—As decreased Brf1 expression prevented TBP-mediated RNA pol III transcription induction and limited the transforming properties of TBP, we sought to determine whether increased Brf1 expression is sufficient for altering cellular growth properties. Stable cell lines were generated that expressed either HA-tagged Brf1 or a mutant form of Brf1, Brf1-T145D, which mimics phosphorylation at this position. Phosphorylation of Brf1 at threonine 145 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) enhances Brf1 interactions with RNA pol III and TFIIIC (25Felton-Edkins Z.A. Fairley J.A. Graham E.L. Johnston I.M. White R.J. Scott P.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HA-Brf1 was consistently expressed at levels ∼30% higher than HA-Brf1-T145D (Fig. 5A). Brf1 overexpression resulted in a modest enhancement of pre-tRNALeu and 7SL RNA and a more pronounced increase in tRNAMeti (Fig. 5B). However, expression of Brf1-T145D resulted in a more significant increase in all of these RNA pol III transcripts, demonstrating the importance of phosphorylation of this site in Brf1 for transcription. RNA pol III transcription induction by Brf1-T145D was comparable with that observed in cells expressing increased TBP. Analyses of the resultant growth properties of these stable cell lines revealed that expression of Brf1 or Brf1-T145D did not alter cellular proliferation rates (data not shown). In addition, expression of these proteins did not confer anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 5C). Together, these results demonstrate that although overexpression of Brf1 or expression of a Brf1 phosphomimic does induce RNA pol III transcription, this is not sufficient to promote transformation of Rat1a fibroblasts. Cellular Transformation by c-Myc Requires Enhanced RNA pol III Transcription—The above studies demonstrated that an increase in RNA pol III transcription is required to drive TBP-mediated cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. To examine whether increased transcription is necessary to drive the transforming function of other oncogenes, we determined whether enhanced RNA pol III transcription is also required to support the transforming function of c-Myc. Stable cell lines expressing c-Myc were infected with either the lentiviral control mismatch RNA or Brf1 shRNA to repress Brf1 expression (Fig. 6A). Expression of Brf1 was effectively reduced by 50% without altering TBP expression. Expression of c-Myc produced an increase in precursor tRNALeu, tRNAMeti, and 7SL RNA expression (Fig. 6B). Reducing Brf1 expression inhibited the increase in all of these RNAs. Moreover, c-Myc-mediated growth in soft agar was repressed by the decrease in Brf1 and RNA pol III transcription (Fig. 6C). This reduction in RNA pol III transcription also significantly reduced c-Myc-mediated tumorigenesis (Fig. 6D). Thus, enhanced RNA pol III transcription is necessary to drive c-Myc-mediated transformation and tumor formation. Increased RNA pol III transcription and enhanced production of tRNAs and 5 S rRNAs are well known hallmarks of the malignant phenotype. These findings support the idea that enhanced RNA pol III transcription may not only contribute to the proliferative potential of cells, but could also alter the oncogenic properties of cells. Our study clearly demonstrates that increased RNA pol III transcription is not merely a consequence of the transformation process but is indeed essential for the transformed phenotype. Both TBP- and c-Myc-mediated increases in RNA pol III transcription allow fibroblasts to acquire anchorage-independent growth properties and to form tumors in an athymic mouse model. Consistent with these studies, recent results have also demonstrated that enhanced RNA pol III transcription is required to mediate focus formation of an HCT116/p53 null colon carcinoma cell line (29Marshall L. Kenneth N.S. White R.J. Cell. 2008; 133: 78-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that small changes in the levels of the central eukaryotic transcription initiation factor, TBP, alter cellular growth properties (13Zhong S. Fromm J. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Johnson S.A. Dubeau L. Kawalek M. Dervan A. Schonthal A.H. Dang C.V. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because TBP is used by all three nuclear RNA polymerases, it is important to identify the genes regulated by changes in TBP concentrations and those that are necessary to support these TBP-mediated phenotypic changes. Our current studies reveal that TBP is a limiting factor for RNA pol III transcription in Rat1a fibroblasts and that increased expression of TBP is sufficient to induce transcription. Increased expression of the RNA pol III-specific TBP-associated factor Brf1 leads to a relatively modest induction of RNA pol III transcription. Expression of the phosphomimic form of Brf1 leads to a more robust increase in transcription. However, these increases in RNA pol III transcription fail to promote cellular transformation. This is consistent with our previous study showing that expression of RNA pol II-defective TBP mutants, which still are able to function in RNA pol I and pol III transcription, abrogates TBP-mediated cellular transformation (15Johnson S.A.

Together, these results demonstrate that although enhanced RNA pol III transcription is required for cellular transformation, it is not sufficient. A recent study by Marshall et al. (29Marshall L. Kenneth N.S. White R.J. Cell. 2008; 133: 78-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) shows that overexpression of Brf1 supports an increase in RNA pol III transcription in mouse embryo fibroblasts and an ovarian epithelial cell line. In addition, enhanced RNA pol III transcription also promotes cell cycle progression and transformation. These phenotypic effects could be mimicked by overexpression of tRNAMeti. However, our studies show that modulating RNA pol III transcription alone does not alter proliferation rates or the transforming properties of Rat1a cells. Although we also found that overexpression of Brf1 or Brf1-T145D increases tRNAMeti levels, this does not appear to be sufficient to induce transformation. Whether the differences observed between our studies and that of Marshall et al. (29Marshall L. Kenneth N.S. White R.J. Cell. 2008; 133: 78-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reflect cell type-specific effects or the conditions used to modulate Brf1 expression is not clear. Previous work in cardiomyocytes showed that an increase in Brf1 expression enhances RNA pol III transcription and that this is required for inducing hypertrophic growth (33Goodfellow S.J. Innes F. Derblay L.E. MacLellan W.R. Scott P.H. White R.J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that the mechanisms that drive an increase in RNA pol III transcription to promote cellular growth or proliferation may be distinct from that used to promote transformation. Expression of mutant TBP proteins did not induce RNA pol III transcription and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, whereas introduction of these cells into mice resulted in stimulation of RNA pol III transcription and tumor formation. Although it is clear that enhanced RNA pol III-dependent transcription is associated with cellular transformation, it is unclear why the mutant TBP proteins are defective for RNA pol III-dependent transcription in vitro but not in vivo. This is likely to be a result of the in vivo environment, where these cells interact with components of the extracellular matrix, which are not present in vitro. These components could alter cellular signaling pathways and impinge on TBP-mediated changes in RNA pol II-dependent transcription that ultimately affect RNA pol III-dependent transcription. We considered that TBP-mediated changes in RNA pol II-dependent transcription might selectively affect the expression of the RNA pol III transcription components in vivo. Because the TBP-containing TFIIIB complex has been shown to be a target of various oncogenic proteins and tumor suppressors (5Wang H.D. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell.

However, no apparent changes in the amounts of endogenous TBP, Brf1, or Bdp1 were found in the tumor-derived cells. Because both Brf1 and Bdp1 are phosphorylated at multiple sites (7Woiwode A.

Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is possible that, in context with the in vivo environment, changes in their phosphorylation state and/or other modifications of these proteins may selectively enhance their function in vivo. Alternatively, recent findings support the idea that certain coactivators of RNA pol II transcription may also be used to drive transcription of RNA pol III genes (39Kenneth N.S. Ramsbottom B.A. Gomez-Roman N. Marshall L. Cole P.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14917-14922Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Selective enhancement of the function of these coactivators in vivo could potentially be used to drive an increase in RNA pol III transcription. Our study demonstrates that enhanced RNA pol III transcription is necessary for both TBP- and c-Myc-mediated transformation. Although many oncogenic factors and proteins induce RNA pol III transcription, it is likely that this increase is generally necessary to promote and maintain a transformed phenotype. As the link between metabolic activity and cancer has long been known, our findings provide a new molecular level of understanding for this connection. The deregulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in cancer has prompted the investigation of potential cancer therapeutic agents that target the translation machinery (40Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Our results support the idea that targeting the RNA pol III transcription machinery may represent a novel strategy for controlling tumorigenesis and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2069096268,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating enzyme Nox1 is important in the induction of oncogenic Ras transformation phenotypes, but it is not defined whether Nox1 is involved in Ras-induced upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent stimulator of tumor angiogenesis. Here we describe that ablation of the Nox1 activity by Nox1 small-interference RNAs (siRNAs) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI) inhibited synthesis of both VEGF proteins and VEGF mRNAs in K-Ras transformed normal rat kidney (KNRK) cells. Nox1siRNAs and DPI suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent phosphorylation of a transcription factor Sp1 and Sp1 binding to a VEGF promoter. Furthermore, tumors derived from Nox1siRNA-transfected KNRK cells markedly decreased neovascularization. The Nox1 activity was required for VEGF production in human colon cancer CaCO-2 cells, as in the case of KNRK cells. However, since overexpression of Nox1 in normal rat kidney cells failed to induce VEGF, the Nox1 activity alone was not sufficient to upregulate VEGF expression, which suggests that unlike the previously proposed model, Nox1 may act in concert with other effectors integrated into the Ras network. We propose that Nox1 mediates oncogenic Ras-induced upregulation of VEGF and angiogenesis by activating Sp1 through Ras-ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Sp1."
https://openalex.org/W2029967405,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DGK1 gene encodes a diacylglycerol kinase enzyme that catalyzes the formation of phosphatidate from diacylglycerol. Unlike the diacylglycerol kinases from bacteria, plants, and animals, the yeast enzyme utilizes CTP, instead of ATP, as the phosphate donor in the reaction. Dgk1p contains a CTP transferase domain that is present in the SEC59-encoded dolichol kinase and CDS1-encoded CDP-diacylglycerol synthase enzymes. Deletion analysis showed that the CTP transferase domain was sufficient for diacylglycerol kinase activity. Point mutations (R76A, K77A, D177A, and G184A) of conserved residues within the CTP transferase domain caused a loss of diacylglycerol kinase activity. Analysis of DGK1 alleles showed that the in vivo functions of Dgk1p were specifically due to its diacylglycerol kinase activity. The DGK1-encoded enzyme had a pH optimum at 7.0-7.5, required Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) ions for activity, was potently inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, and was labile at temperatures above 40 degrees C. The enzyme exhibited positive cooperative (Hill number = 2.5) kinetics with respect to diacylglycerol (apparent K(m) = 6.5 mol %) and saturation kinetics with respect to CTP (apparent K(m) = 0.3 mm). dCTP was both a substrate (apparent K(m) = 0.4 mm) and competitive inhibitor (apparent K(i) = 0.4 mm) of the enzyme. Diacylglycerol kinase activity was stimulated by major membrane phospholipids and was inhibited by CDP-diacylglycerol and sphingoid bases."
https://openalex.org/W2049440346,"Conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into its altered conformation, PrPSc, is believed to be the major cause of prion diseases. Although PrP is the only identified agent for these diseases, there is increasing evidence that other molecules can modulate the conversion. We have found that interaction of PrP with double-stranded DNA leads to a protein with higher β-sheet content and characteristics similar to those of PrPSc. RNA molecules can also interact with PrP and potentially modulate PrPC to PrPSc conversion or even bind differentially to both PrP isoforms. Here, we investigated the interaction of recombinant murine PrP with synthetic RNA sequences and with total RNA extracted from cultured neuroblastoma cells (N2aRNA). We found that PrP interacts with N2aRNA with nanomolar affinity, aggregates upon this interaction, and forms species partially resistant to proteolysis. RNA does not bind to N-terminal deletion mutants of PrP, indicating that the N-terminal region is important for this process. Cell viability assays showed that only the N2aRNA extract induces PrP-RNA aggregates that can alter the homeostasis of cultured cells. Small RNAs bound to PrP give rise to nontoxic small oligomers. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the PrP-RNA complex revealed structural changes in PrP, but most of its native fold is maintained. These results indicate that there is selectivity in the species generated by interaction with different molecules of RNA.

Prion diseases can be infectious, sporadic, or inherited (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar).

Through a poorly understood process, the cellular PrP isoform (PrPC), an α-helix-rich protein, undergoes a profound conformational change, acquiring higher β-sheet content; the latter isoform is known as PrPSc (Sc from scrapie) and is the only known component of the infectious prion particle (1Prusiner S.B.

The protein-only hypothesis postulates that PrPSc “multiplies” by catalyzing the conversion of PrPC into a likeness of itself, thus becoming responsible for its own propagation (5Weissmann C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based strongly on the fact that PrP knock-out mice are resistant to prion infection, suggesting that endogenous PrP is necessary for prion propagation and infection (6Bueler H.

It has also been reported that the N terminus of the protein is important for the interaction with nucleic acids, because mutants lacking different portions of this region presented lower or no affinity for some RNA aptamers (24Weiss S.

All of these findings suggest that nucleic acids play a role in prion diseases. Based on these results, we have proposed a complement for the “protein-only” hypothesis in which nucleic acids can act by serving as catalysts and/or molecular chaperones in the conversion, not by encoding genetic information (8Cordeiro Y.

Biol. 2007; 369: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) found that the binding of single-stranded DNA thioaptamers to PrP occurs on at least two different sites on the protein. Selection against recombinant Syrian hamster PrP 90–231 (recSHaPrP) identified a 12-base consensus sequence within a series of 20 thioaptamers, all of which consist of 40 bases, and one thioaptamer bound to recSHaPrP with extremely high affinity (0.58 nm) (27King D.J. Safar J.G. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The potential therapeutic use of these molecules against prion diseases reinforces the importance of understanding the interaction of PrP protein with different nucleic acids at the molecular level. Besides the prion structural puzzle and the mystery involving the mechanisms of conversion from PrPC into PrPSc, many questions remain unanswered regarding the toxicity of prion aggregates. In addition to amyloid fibers and unstructured deposits of misfolded protein found in infected brains, smaller oligomers have been reported to be the toxic species for several amyloidogenic diseases, including transthyretin amyloidoses, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases (28Lambert M.P.

In both cases, the aggregates were toxic, leading to cell death in culture and to neurodegeneration and spongiosis in hamster brains (31Castilla J. Saa P. Hetz C. Soto C.

Moreover, it cannot be completely excluded that a small oligonucleotide may be present in PrP aggregates and account for prion cytotoxicity, as previously proposed (33Zou W.Q. Gambetti P. Cell. 2005; 121: 155-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we report experimental data on the interaction between murine recombinant prion protein (rPrP23–231) and RNA. We used total RNA extracted from cultured cells and small synthetic oligonucleotides, focusing on PrP secondary and tertiary structure changes. We have also investigated the role of the N-terminal PrP region in RNA binding using two mutants lacking N-terminal domains and evaluating the toxicity of the PrP-RNA complex in cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a). The recombinant prion protein (rPrP) deletion mutants investigated were rPrPΔ51–90 and rPrPΔ32–121, the former lacking residues 51–90, which is the copper-binding region, and the latter lacking residues 32–121, the majority of the PrP N terminus (34Cordeiro Y.

We show that RNA extracted from N2a cells (N2aRNA) induces a loss of α-helical secondary structure and triggers aggregation of rPrP23–231 but has no effect on the rPrP-lacking portions of the N-terminal region. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal, however, that full-length rPrP partially recovers its native fold 3 days after RNA addition, but the changes observed in heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum suggest that RNA binding induces changes in PrP structure. We also find that aggregates generated from PrP-N2aRNA interaction are toxic to cultured N2a cells, which suggests that RNA molecules are potential candidates for catalyzing the PrPC to PrPSc conversion in vivo.

For the labeling reaction, rPrPs were dissolved in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 5–10 mg/ml and incubated with FITC (final concentration, 0.5–1.0 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the FITC-rPrP23–231 conjugate (FITC-rPrP) was separated from the free dye by gel filtration using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. After elution, concentration of the labeled protein and the efficiency of labeling were determined based on molar extinction coefficients of rPrP23–231 (63,495 cm-1 m-1 at 280 nm), rPrPΔ32–121 (33,015 cm-1 m-1 at 280 nm), rPrPΔ51–90 (41,495 cm-1 m-1 at 280 nm), and FITC (68,000 cm-1 m-1 at 494 nm). FITC-rPrPs were stored at -20 °C and protected from light. Ribonucleic Acid Samples—Total RNA from cultured neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (N2aRNA) (36Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Romer A.

(Coralville, IA). Nucleotide sequences were: SAF9343–59, 5′-GGA UGC AAU CUC CAU CCC-3′; and opRNA, 5′-AAA CAU GGG UUC CCA UGU-3′. Synthetic RNA samples were maintained lyophilized at -20 °C and used in RNase-free water. Reagents and Protein Samples—All of the reagents used were of analytical grade. Protein concentration was 1.0 μm (0.023 mg/ml for rPrP23–231, 0.018 mg/ml for rPrPΔ51–90, and 0.014 mg/ml for rPrPΔ32–121) for light scattering (LS) and fluorescence measurements, 30 μm (0.69 mg/ml for rPrP23–231, 0.57 mg/ml for rPrPΔ51–90, and 0.42 mg/ml for rPrPΔ32–121) for CD assays, and 50 nm (1.15 μg/ml for rPrP23–231, 0.9 μg/ml for rPrPΔ51–90, and 0.7 μg/ml for rPrPΔ32–121) for fluorescence anisotropy assays. All of the experiments were performed in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. All of the figures presented in this work are representative of at least three experiments. Spectroscopic Measurements—LS, fluorescence anisotropy, and fluorescence emission were recorded on an ISSPC1 fluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL). LS at 90 ° was measured illuminating the samples at 320 nm and collecting LS from 300 to 340 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence of rPrP23–231, rPrPΔ51–90, and rPrPΔ32–121 was measured by exciting the samples at 280 nm and collecting the emission from 300 to 420 nm. For anisotropy measurements, the samples were excited at 490 nm, and the emission was observed through a 3–69 filter. Far-UV Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C with circular 0.10-mm-pathlength cells. Buffer spectra were subtracted from each sample spectrum, and traces were collected with four accumulations each. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were collected at 298 K with a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with gradient triple resonance probes. The spectra were processed using TOPSPIN 2.1 (Bruker) and analyzed with CARA 1.8 (38Keller R. Optimizing the Process of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrum Analysis and Computer-Aided Resonance Assignment. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich2005Google Scholar). Two-dimensional [15N,1H]HSQCs were collected with 2048 × 200 points and 8–64 scans for the different samples. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra were collected with 2048 points and 128 scans for all samples. For HSQC measurements, we used 0.2 mm uniformly labeled [15N]rPrP23–231 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and a 10% D2O, 90% H2O mixture in the presence (at 1:1 molar ratio) or absence of SAF9343–59. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Samples were adhered to a carbon-coated grid, blotted to remove excess material, and stained for 10 s with a 2% solution of uranyl acetate prepared in water. The images were digitally collected with a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Neuroblastoma Cell (N2a) Culture and Cell Viability Assays—N2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% antibiotic (penicillin, erythromycin, and gentamicin) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 3 days and then transferred to a 96-well plate (∼ 5,000 cells/well). After transfer, the cells were exposed to samples containing rPrP23–231, N2aRNA, or rPrP-RNA complex for 3 days. An MTT assay was performed following the previously described protocol (30Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). MTT enters the cells by endocytosis and is reduced to formazan by NADH reductase and other enzymes in a reaction that can be measured spectro-photometrically. The amount of formazan reflects the reductive potential of the cytoplasm and the cell viability and generally shows good correlation with other viability tests (30Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X.

Neural Transm. 1998; 105: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Live/dead assays were performed following the protocol provided by the kit (live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells; Invitrogen). Live cells were distinguished by the presence of ubiquitous intracellular esterase activity, which was determined by the enzymatic conversion of the virtually non-fluorescent cell-permeant calcein AM to the intensely fluorescent calcein. The polyanionic dye calcein is well retained within live cells, producing an intense uniform green fluorescence in live cells (ex/em =∼495 nm/∼515 nm). EthD-1 enters cells with damaged membranes and undergoes a 40-fold enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells (ex/em = ∼495 nm/∼635 nm). EthD-1 is excluded by the intact plasma membrane of live cells. All of the assays were done in triplicate. Live/dead images were generated in the Observer.Z1 Microscope (SN: 3834000373; Carl Zeiss Inc.). Western Blotting—All of the protease-digested (+PK) samples were incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed on 1.5-mm 15% polyacrylamide gels. The blocked membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (SAF84; Cayman Chemical, MI) diluted 1:500. Following this incubation, the membrane was washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody, IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti mouse (SC-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:200. The blot was stained with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and revealed with hydrogen peroxide (both from Sigma-Aldrich). We first investigated the effects of RNA on the full-length recombinant PrP (rPrP23–231) in vitro. It has been shown that PrPC present in hamster brain homogenates interacts with RNA in vitro, acquiring protease resistance, and that RNase treatment can inhibit this conversion without changing the PrPC content (17Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Questions remain unanswered, however, regarding the size and structure of the RNA that are necessary for interaction with PrPC and for catalysis of this conversion. In light of these results, we investigated the interaction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA extracts and of two synthetic RNAs (SAF9343–59 and 18-mer opRNA) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1) with rPrP23–231 and with two N-terminal rPrP deletion mutants (rPrPΔ51–90 and rPrPΔ32–121). The SAF9343–59 sequence was chosen based on previous work (22Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) that described the isolation of 2′-fluoropyrimidine-substituted RNA aptamers that bind selectively to disease-associated, β-sheet-rich isoforms of PrP. The SAF93 sequence was identified by Sayer et al. (23Sayer N.M. Cubin M. Rhie A. Bullock M. Tahiri-Alaoui A. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13102-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as a high affinity PrP ligand; therefore, we selected the main binding domain (nucleotides 43–59) to perform our studies. The opRNA random sequence was selected because it has been suggested that PrP-nucleic acid interaction is guided by NA structure and not by its specific nucleotide sequence (22Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol.

The local secondary structures of the synthetic RNAs used in this work were predicted with the program GeneBee, which indicated that both sequences adopt a hairpin-like structure (not shown). Thus we report the PrP binding behavior of two different base sequences with similar secondary structures. RNA Incubation with rPrP23–231 Leads to Protein Aggregation—We verified that incubation of the RNA extracts with recombinant PrP led to an increase in light scattering values for full-length rPrP, indicating that the protein aggregates upon RNA addition (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). This result was obtained for incubation with both prokaryotic (from E. coli) and eukaryotic (from mammals, N2aRNA and vRNA; from mosquito cells, C6RNA; and from yeast, ScRNA) RNA extracts (supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, incubation of the rPrPΔ51–90 N-terminal deletion mutant with all of the RNAs investigated did not alter the LS values, revealing an important role for the PrP N-terminal region in the RNA interaction. We further selected the neuroblastoma cell-derived RNA (N2aRNA) to continue our studies because this RNA originates from the same tissue as our prion protein constructs (from mouse) (Figs. 1C and 2).TABLE 1Summary of N2aRNA effects on rPrP23–231 and rPrPΔ51–90Spectroscopic measurementsrPrP23–231RNA digestion by RNase ArPrPΔ51–90–RNA+RNABefore rPrP incubation with RNAAfter rPrP incubation with RNA–RNA+RNAϵ 222 nmaRaw ellipticity values at 222 nm obtained from CD measurements–12.32–1.23–––6.85–6.63LS/LS0bNormalized values obtained by dividing each recorded value (in the presence of N2aRNA) by the initial value (LS0, initial light scattering; FI0, initial fluorescence intensity) for free protein in solution121.182.095.9610.86FI/FI0bNormalized values obtained by dividing each recorded value (in the presence of N2aRNA) by the initial value (LS0, initial light scattering; FI0, initial fluorescence intensity) for free protein in solution11.031.000.8210.88ΔCM (cm–1)cChanges in center of spectral mass values from the tryptophan emission spectra.

Recently, histone acetylation has been shown to have a critical regulatory role in both transcription and DNA repair. We report here that expression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) genes is associated with cisplatin resistance. We found that Tip60 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. The expression of two other HAT genes, HAT1 and MYST1, did not differ between drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Knockdown of Tip60 expression rendered cells sensitive to cisplatin but not to oxaliplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. Tip60 expression is significantly correlated with cisplatin sensitivity in human lung cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the promoter region of the Tip60 gene contains several E boxes, and its expression was regulated by the E-box binding circadian transcription factor Clock but not by other E-box binding transcription factors such as c-Myc, Twist, and USF1. Hyperacetylation of H3K14 and H4K16 was found in cisplatin-resistant cells. The microarray study reveals that several genes for DNA repair are down-regulated by the knockdown of Tip60 expression. Our data show that HAT gene expression is required for cisplatin resistance and suggest that Clock and Tip60 regulate not only transcription, but also DNA repair, through periodic histone acetylation.

Our research has focused on factors affecting cellular sensitivity of solid tumors to anticancer agents and investigation of promising molecular targets for cancer treatment (1Kohno K. Uchiumi T.

Among many drugs, cis-diamminechloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) plays a crucial role in the treatment of various solid tumors (3Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem.

Cisplatin treatment also induces oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses (5Wada T. Penninger J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2838-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Thus, the nature of cellular sensitivity to cisplatin is highly complex. The development of cisplatin resistance is a major clinical limitation in cancer chemotherapy. Cisplatin resistance is influenced by many factors which affect intracellular drug accumulation (6Fujii R. Mutou M. Niwa K. Yamada K. Akitou T. Nakagawa M. Kuwano M. Akiyama S. Jpn. J.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in drug resistance. Cellular factors involved in transcription contribute to the induction of apoptosis or transient or acquired resistance. We have tried to identify the cisplatin-inducible transcription factors and transcription-related factors that are highly expressed in drug-resistant cells (1Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Niina I. Wakasugi T.

The cellular level of ATF4 expression correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in human lung cancer cell lines. DNA microarray analysis has revealed that ATF4 regulates genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis and conjugation (15Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C.

Interestingly, we have found that ATF4 gene expression is regulated by the circadian transcription factor Clock, which is also overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (16Igarashi T. Izumi H.

It has recently been shown that histones are periodically acetylated (17Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wada P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and that Clock is a member of the histone acetyltransferases (18Doi M. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2006; 125: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Clock seems to have a highly specific enzymatic activity and acetylates histone 3 and histone 4 (19Nakahata Y. Grimaldi B. Sahar S. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone 4 has been shown to be required for repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The yeast human histone acetyltransferases (HAT) Esa1 mutant is defective for NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) and is markedly hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, such as camptothecin-11 and methyl methanesulfonate (20Bird A.W.

The acetyl-CoA binding motif is found in Clock and shows high sequence similarity to yeast Esa1 and other MYST members. One of the MYST family members, Tip60, has been shown to be involved in DNA repair and apoptosis (21Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y.

Through our studies seeking to determine the role of HAT in cisplatin resistance, we found that Tip60, but not HAT1 and MYST1, was overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells. Silencing of Tip60 expression effectively sensitized both parental and resistant cells to cisplatin, but not to oxaliplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. These results can open new aspects of cisplatin resistance. Cell Culture—Human epidermoid cancer KB cells and human prostate cancer PC3 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium. This medium was purchased from Nissui Seiyaku (Tokyo, Japan) and contained 10% fetal bovine serum. The cisplatin-resistant KB/CP4 and P/CDP6 cells were derived from KB and PC3 cells as described previously (13Murakami T. Shibuya I. Ise T. Chen Z.S. Akiyama S. Nakagawa M. Izumi H. Nakamura T. Matsuo K. Yamada Y. Kohno K. Int. J.

Eleven lung cancer cell lines were cultured as described previously (14Tanabe M. Izumi H. Ise T. Chen S.J. Higuchi S. Yamori T. Yasumoto K. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8592-8595PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Antibodies and Drugs—Antibodies against c-Myc (sc-764), Clock (sc-6927, sc-25361X), USF1 (sc-8983), Tip60 (sc-5727), PCNA (sc-56), HAT1 (sc-8752), MYST1 (sc-13677), Twist (sc-15393), H4K16 (sc-8662), and ERCC1 (sc-10785) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-H3K9 (31388) and anti-H3K14 (30020) antibodies were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-H2AK5 antibody (#2576) and anti-APE1 antibody (#4128) was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-β-actin antibody (AC-15) was purchased from Sigma. Cisplatin, vincristine, and etoposide were purchased from Sigma. Oxaliplatin was kindly provided from Yakult (Tokyo, Japan). Plasmid Construction—To obtain the full-length complementary DNA (cDNAs) for human Clock and human Bmal1, PCR was carried out on a SuperScript cDNA library (Invitrogen) using the following primer pairs (double underlining indicates the start codons): TTGTTTACCGTAAGCTGTAG and CTACTGTGGTTGAACCTTGGAAG for clock and GCAGACCAGAGAATGGAC and TTACAGCGGCCATGGCAAGTC for Bmal1. These PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To construct a pcDNA3-Bmal1, the EcoRI fragment including Bmal1 cDNA was ligated into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). To construct a plasmid expressing 3×FLAG-HA-tagged Clock, pcDNA3-FLAG vector was prepared by ligation of BamHI-EcoRI fragment including a 3-times repeat FLAG and HA into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-3×FLAG-HA Clock was obtained by ligation of NotI fragment including Clock cDNA into a pcDNA3-3×FLAG-HA vector. The core promoter and partial first exon (-63 to +233) of the wild-type Tip60 gene was amplified by PCR using placenta DNA and the primer pair 5′-AGATCTCACGTGACCCGCTCCGCATACACGTG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCCGGCCCCTCTGGGAGACGTCAC-3′. PCR was also performed to introduce the E-box mutations into the Tip60 promoter using the primer pairs 5′-AGATCTACCCGCTCCGCATA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCCGGCCCCTCTGGGAGACGTCAC-3′ for MT. Single and double underlined nucleotides indicate wild-type E-boxes and mutated E-boxes, respectively. To prepare Tip60-WT-Luc containing wild-type E-boxes and Tip60-MT-Luc containing mutated E-boxes, these PCR products were cloned and ligated into the BglII-HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of whole-cell lysates and whole-nuclear lysates have been described previously (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, to prepare whole-nuclear lysates, isolated nuclei were directly sonicated for 10 s. The indicated amounts of whole-cell lysates or whole-nuclear lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 or 15% gel). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotter. The blotted membranes were treated with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-Clock (sc-6927), USF1, c-Myc, and β-actin antibodies, a 1:2500 dilution of anti-Tip60, HAT1, MYST1, H2AK5, and H4K16 antibodies, a 1:2000 dilution of anti-PCNA, H3K9, and H3K14 antibodies, a 1:1000 dilution of anti-ERCC1 antibody, and a 1:500 dilution of anti-Twist, and APE1 antibodies. The membrane was then incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature and developed using a chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Gel staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue was used as an internal control. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection and a luciferase assay were performed as described previously (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Wakasugi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Suzuki H. Arao T. Nishio K. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of Tip60 reporter plasmid and the expression plasmid were co-transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection the cells were cultured for 48 h. Luciferase activity was detected by a Picagene kit (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan), and the light intensity was measured with a luminometer (Luminescencer JNII RAB-2300; ATTO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results shown are normalized to β-galactosidase activity and are representative of at least three independent experiments. Knockdown Analysis Using Small Interfering RNAs—The following double-stranded RNA 25-base pair oligonucleotides were commercially generated (Invitrogen): Clock small interfering RNA (siRNA), 5′-UAAAGUCUGUUGUUGUAUCAUGUGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACAUGAUACAACAACAGACUUUA-3′ (antisense); Tip60 siRNA, 5′-AUAGUACAGUGUCUUAUGGUCAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCUUGACCAUAAGACACUGUACUAU-3′ (antisense); HAT1 siRNA, 5′-UAUGAACUGUUUCAAGAAGUUGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCUCAACUUCUUGAAACAGUUCAUA-3′ (antisense); MYST1 siRNA, 5′-UUGGGCUGUUUCCCAUAGUCUUCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGAAGACUAUGGGAAACAGCCCAA-3′ (antisense); Twist siRNA, 5′-UUGAGGGUCUGAAUCUUGCUCAGCU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCUGAGCAAGAUUCAGACCCUCAA-3′ (antisense); c-Myc siRNA, 5′-UUUGUGUUUCAACUGUUCUCGUCGU-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCACAUGAUACAACAACAGACUUUA-3′ (antisense); USF1 siRNA, 5′-UCACAAAGAAUUGACCAGUGCCAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCUUGACCAUAAGACACUGUACUAU-3′ (antisense). siRNA transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications (Invitrogen). Ten microliters of Lipofectamine transfection reagent was diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM I medium and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 500 or 250 pmol of Clock, Tip60, HAT1, MYST1, Twist, c-Myc, USF1, and inverted control duplex Stealth RNA (Invitrogen) diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM I were added gently and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Oligomer-Lipofectamine complexes and aliquots of 1 × 106 PC3 cells in 500 μl of culture medium were combined and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Aliquots of 4 × 102 PC3 cells or 6 × 102 P/CDP6 cells were used for a colony-formation assay as described below. The remaining cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes with 10 ml of culture medium and harvested after 96 h culture for Western blotting, as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Wakasugi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Suzuki H. Arao T. Nishio K. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, soluble chromatin from 1 × 106 PC3 or PCDP6 cells was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Clock antibody (sc-25361X), anti-H3K14 anti-body, anti-H4K16 antibody, and normal goat or rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). For transfection experiments, PC3 cells were transiently transfected with 3×FLAG-HA vector or 3×FLAG-HA Clock plasmid and cultured for 48 h as described above. Soluble chromatin from 1 × 106 cells was incubated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG (M2) affinity gel or normal mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNAs with protein A/G-agarose were purified and dissolved in 20 μl of distilled H2O. Each 2 μl of DNA was used for PCR analysis with the following primer pairs; Tip60 #1 (-2586 to -2073), 5′-ATTACAGGAGCGAGCCACTGCGCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTAACTTCCTGCCGTTGCCATGGC-3′ (reverse); Tip60 #2 (-1336 to -944), 5′-CCCTTGAGCACCTATGCTCAGCCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCGGTGGCTCACGCCTATAATC-3′ (reverse); Tip60 #3 (-467 to +233), 5′-AGATCTAGACCATCCTGGCCAACATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCTTCCGGCCCCTCTGGGAGACGTCAC-3′ (reverse); Tip60 #4 (+823 to +1212), 5′-TTCTGGGCCTGAGGTGGGGCATCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGACTAGCTACTGGACTCTGGGAGC-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Cytotoxicity Assay—For the colony-formation assay, 4 × 102 PC3 cells or 6 × 102 P/CDP6 cells transfected with siRNA were seeded in 35-mm dishes with 2 ml of culture medium. The following day the cells were treated with indicated concentrations of cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etoposide, and vincristine. After 7 days, the number of colonies was counted. For correlation analysis, we calculated 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) from the concentration-response curves. RNA Isolation—Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen™ RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the RNeasy mini protocols for isolation from animal cells (I. spin protocol). RNA quality and integrity were determined using the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano 6000 assay (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit) on the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified by measuring A260 nm on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland, DE). Microarray Studies and Data Analysis—High quality RNA samples (200 ng each) prepared from PC3 cells 72 h after transfection with control or Tip60 siRNA were amplified and labeled with Cy5-and Cy3-CTP (Amersham Biosciences) to produce labeled cRNA using Agilent low RNA input fluorescent linear amplification kits following the manufacturer's protocol. After the amplification and labeling, the dye-incorporation ratio was determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and the ratios were within 10 to 20 pmol per μg of cRNA, the range the manufacturer suggests before hybridization. For hybridization, 750 ng of cyanine 3- and 750 ng of cyanine 5-labeled cRNA were fragmented and hybridized to an Agilent Technologies Human 1A (V2) Gene Expression Microarray using the Agilent Gene Expression hybridization kit as described in the Two-color Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis Version 4.0 manual. After hybridization, all microarrays were washed as described in the manual and scanned using the Agilent dual-laser DNA microarray scanner. The scans were converted to data files with Agilent Feature Extraction software (Version 8.5). Data were analyzed using Microsoft Access and Spotfire. The arrays were scanned by the Agilent dual-laser DNA microarray scanner using SureScan technology, extracted by feature Extraction software, and analyzed by Rosetta Resolver® software. An average of three replicate samples was used for each experiment. Statistical Analysis—Expression levels of protein assayed by Western blotting were assessed numerically with the NIH image program (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The Pearson correlation was used for statistical analysis, and significance was set at the 5% level. Tip60 Is Overexpressed in Cisplatin-resistant Cells—HATs are categorized into three groups on the basis of their catalytic domains (23Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The Gcn5 N-acetyltransferase family includes GCN5 and HAT1. The MYST family is named for the members of HAT family: MOZ, Ybf2, Sas2, and Tip60. Other HATs include p300/CBP (CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein) and one of the nuclear receptor co-activators (24Kimura A. Matsubara K. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We first investigated the expression levels of three human HAT genes, Tip60, MYST1, and HAT1, in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells. As shown in Fig. 1, Tip60 was overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells when compared with sensitive cells. On the other hand, cellular expression of two HAT genes, MYST1 and HAT1, was almost similar in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Although we also examined other proteins, β-actin and PCNA, there was no difference in their expression in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Tip60 Silencing Effectively Sensitizes Cells to Cisplatin—To examine whether Tip60 is involved in drug resistance, an siRNA strategy was employed (Fig. 2A). Cisplatin sensitivity was significantly enhanced by the knockdown of Tip60 expression (Fig. 2B). Knockdown of Tip60 expression did not induce cellular sensitivity to vincristine, etoposide, and oxaliplatin (Fig. 2B). We next investigated whether down-regulation of Tip60 expression partially overcomes cisplatin resistance in cisplatin-resistant cell line P/CDP6. As shown in Fig. 2C, down-regulation of Tip60 expression partially overcame cisplatin resistance. We also confirmed that knockdown of other HAT genes, MYST1 and HAT1, did not induce cellular sensitivity to cisplatin (data not shown). Circadian Transcription Factor Clock Regulates Tip60 Gene Expression—To explore the reason why Tip60 was overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells, we analyzed the function of the promoter of the Tip60 gene. There are two proximal E-boxes in the core promoter region of the Tip60 gene (see Fig. 4A). We have previously shown that the E-box binding transcription factor Clock is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether circadian transcription factor Clock is involved in Tip60 gene expression. Knockdown of Clock expression markedly reduced the expression of Tip60 in two human cancer PC3 and KB cell lines (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the expression of other E-box binding factors, c-Myc, Twist, and USF1, did not influence the expression of Tip60 (Fig. 3B). The heterodimeric transcription factors Clock/Bmal1 that bind to E-box plays an indispensable role in driving the transcription of target genes. We have introduced the mutation in the two proximal E-boxes of Tip60 promoter as shown in Fig. 4A. The reporter assay showed that cotransfection of both Clock and Bmal1 expression plasmids displayed an 8-fold higher level of luciferase activity. However, no transactivation was observed when the Tip60-MT-Luc was used (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, silencing of Clock expression reduced the promoter activity of the Tip60 gene (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 3Tip60 gene expression is regulated through the E-boxes located in the promoter region by Clock but not by c-Myc, Twist, and USF1. A, control siRNA (100 pmol) or Clock siRNA (100 pmol) were transfected into PC3 cells and KB cells. Fifty μg of whole-nuclear lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Relative intensity is shown under each blot. B, indicated siRNAs (100 pmol) were transfected into PC3 cells and KB cells. Whole-nuclear lysates (50 μg for c-Myc and USF1, and 100 μg for Twist) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Relative intensity is shown under each blot.

Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2006; 125: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether overexpression of Clock and Tip60 leads to enhanced histone acetylation in cisplatin-resistant cells, we performed Western blotting using four acetylated histone-specific antibodies. Hyperacetylation of histones was clearly observed in cisplatin-resistant cells (Fig. 5). Both H3K14 and H4K16 were significantly hyperacetylated in cisplatin-resistant cells in comparison with parental cells. On the other hand, the acetylation of both H2AK5 and H3K9 did not alter between drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Specificity of both Clock and Tip60 enzymatic activity was investigated by using specific siRNA for Clock and Tip60. Knockdown of Clock expression reduced the acetylation of H3K14 and H4K16, and knockdown of Tip60 expression reduced the acetylation of H4K16 in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells. The acetylation of both H2AK5 and H3K9 did not alter in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant cells by using specific siRNA either for Clock or Tip60. Our results indicate that Clock acetylates H3K14 and Tip60 acetylates H4K16 in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Silencing Clock and Tip60 reduces histone acetylation. PC3 and PC/DP6 cells were transfected with control siRNA (100 pmol), Clock siRNA (100 pmol), and Tip60 siRNA (100 pmol). Whole-nuclear lysates (50 μg for Clock and Tip60) and whole-cell extracts (25 μg for H3K9 and H3K14 and 50 μg for H2AK5 and H4K16) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Relative intensity is shown under each blot. CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Clock and Acetylated Histone Interaction with the Tip60 Promoter—To determine whether the transactivation of Clock/Bmal1 on the Tip60 promoter was a result of direct recruitment of Clock/Bmal1 to the promoter, we carried out ChIP assays covering different segments of the promoter and 5′ end of the Tip60 gene. Initially, transient transfection of PC3 cells with a 3×FLAG-HA-tagged Clock expression plasmid was used. Forty-eight hours after transfection, a ChIP assay was done with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, we found that Clock was only present in one segment containing E-boxes. Fig. 7B shows that the endogenous nuclear Clock interaction with the Tip60 promoter element was verified using two selected primer pairs (Tip60 #1 and #3). Anti-Clock antibody specifically coprecipitated the Tip60 promoter fragment containing E-boxes from both PC3 and P/CDP6 cells (Fig. 7C, right panel). We have also investigated the status of H3K14 and H4K16 acetylation associated with the Tip60 promoter. Both PC3 and P/CDP6 cells were subjected to ChIPs with antibodies against acetylated H3K14 and H4K16. Interestingly, it was observed that acetylated H3K14 was markedly bound to the Tip60 promoter when both Tip60 #1 and #3 were used (Fig. 7B, lanes 5). On the other hand, H4K16 acetylation was less evident overall (Fig. 7B, lanes 7). Quantification of the band densities after normalization shows that drug resistant P/CDP6 cells have a significant increase in Clock and acetylated H3K14 binding to the Tip60 promoter compared with PC3 cells (Fig. 7C). Cellular Expression of Tip60 Correlates with Cisplatin Sensitivity—We examined the correlation between Tip60 expression and cisplatin sensitivity in 11 lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 8). Expression of β-actin was also examined as a control (Fig. 8A), because β-actin expression in cisplatin-resistant cells is almost similar to that in parental cells (Fig. 1). Tip60 expression significantly correlated with cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 8B) and Clock expression (Fig. 8C). We have previously shown that Clock expression correlated with cisplatin sensitivity (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis of Tip60-regulated Genes—Because the available information regarding the Tip60 target genes is limited, we used microarray technology. To investigate the transcriptional changes by the Tip60 siRNA, DNA microarray study was carried out in PC3 cells treated with control or Tip60 siRNA. Data analysis identified 1091 genes, which were down-regulated more than 2-fold, and 1150 genes, which were up-regulated (data not shown). Among down-regulated genes, several genes involved in DNA repair was identified (Table 1). It was reported that ERCC1 was one of the key molecules to determine the cellular sensitivity of cisplatin (25Olaussen K.A. Dunant A. Fouret P. Brambilla E. Andre F. Haddad V. Taranchon E. Filipits M. Pirker R. Popper H.H. Stahel R. Sabatier L. Pignon J.P. Tursz T. Le Chevalier T. Soria J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 26Takenaka T.

To evaluate the microarray study, we selected two genes and examine their expression by Western blot analysis. Both ERCC1 and APE1 (27Daniel R.M. David M.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were significantly down-regulated by the Tip60 siRNA (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, the expression of these genes was significantly up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant cells (Fig. 9B).TABLE 1List of DNA repair genes regulated by Tip60 DNA microarray analysis of Tip60-regulated genes was investigated. Oligonucleotide microarray study was carried out in PC3 cells treated with Tip60 siRNA (100 pmol) or control siRNA (100 pmol). Data analysis identified 1091 genes, which were down-regulated more than 2.0-fold.

Recently, we have reported that the circadian transcription factor Clock is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Clock has recently been found to have intrinsic HAT activity (18Doi M. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2006; 125: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The HAT activity is required to activate Clock/Bmal1-dependent transcription. Thus, Clock may promote Clock/Bmal1-dependent transcription by forming active chromatin and increasing the accessibility of transcriptional cofactors to the promoter region. Tip60 was originally identified as a cellular acetyltransferase that interacts with human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein (28Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tip60 exists as a multimeric protein complex on chromatin and has been shown to be involved in DNA damage response and repair (20Bird A.W. Yu D.Y. Pray-Grant M.G. Qiu Q. Harmon K.E. Megee P.C. Grant P.A. Smith M.M. Christman M.F. Nature. 2002; 419: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 29Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that HAT gene expression might affect cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents including cisplatin. In the present study we investigated which HATs are involved in modifying cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents and drug resistance. We found that Tip60 was overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant cells, but MYST1 and HAT1 were not (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that down-regulation of the cellular expression of the Clock protein conferred cisplatin and etoposide sensitivity to human lung cancer cell lines (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we also found that Tip60 expression correlated well with cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 8B). However, down-regulation of Tip60 expression conferred only cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 2B), which suggests a different mechanism through which either Clock or Tip60 modifies drug sensitivity. Several mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of cisplatin resistance including decreased cisplatin accumulation, increased levels of cellular glutathione, and increased DNA repair activity. These supported that the knockdown of Tip60 expression by Tip60 siRNA showed only a small effect on the cellular sensitivity of cisplatin (Fig. 2, B and C). We have previously shown that ATF4 is a target of Clock, and the Clock and ATF4 transcription system plays an important role in multidrug resistance through a glutathione-dependent redox system (16Igarashi T. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Nishio K. Arao T. Tanabe M. Uramoto H. Sugio K. Yasumoto K. Sasaguri Y. Wang K.W. Otsuji Y. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4749-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The knockdown of Tip60 expression also showed a similar effect on the cellular sensitivity in drug-sensitive cell. DNA microarray analysis showed several DNA repair genes are regulated by the Tip60 expression (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 8, both ERCC1 and APE1 gene are regulated by Tip60. To investigate the molecular mechanism of the enhanced expression of Tip60 in cisplatin-resistant cells, we surveyed the transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region using the human genome data base. There are two proximal E-boxes in the core promoter region of the Tip60 gene (Fig. 4A). We found that the Tip60 gene is a target of Clock but not of the other E-box binding factors, such as Twist, c-Myc, and USF1 (Fig. 3B). The ChIP assay also supports these results (Fig. 7). Our results indicate that Tip60 might also be involved in rhythmic histone acetylation. Histone acetylation in cisplatin-resistant cells is supposed to be regulated by Clock and Tip60. We found that both H3K14 and H4K16 were highly acetylated in cisplatin-resistant cells (Fig. 5). It has been shown that Clock can acetylate H3K14 well (19Nakahata Y. Grimaldi B. Sahar S. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that Tip60 acetylates H2A and H4 (23Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 29Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which indicates that H4K16 may be catalyzed by Tip60. Our results using siRNA for Clock and Tip60 are consistent with those in previous studies (Fig. 6). The acetylation of H3K14 has been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation (19Nakahata Y. Grimaldi B. Sahar S. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the acetylation of H4K16 may contribute to the decondensation of chromatin (30Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the ChIP assays demonstrate evidence of high Clock binding and H3K9 acetylation at the Tip60 promoter in drug-resistant cells, implicating a more open state of chromatin primed for transcription. Based on these data, Clock overexpression might be involved in maintaining transcription-permissive chromatin structure through H3K14 acetylation, and Tip60 might be involved in establishing DNA-repair-permissive chromatin structure in cisplatin-resistant cells. Thus, our results stress the positive role that the HAT function of both Clock and Tip60 contribute to drug resistance. In conclusion, we established that both Clock and Tip60 are required for cisplatin resistance. Our data also suggest that Tip60 may play a role in circadian clock function. Our study begins to offer molecular insight into the circadian regulation of genomic response against anticancer agents and drug sensitivity through histone acetylation.

However, recent work has indicated that Egr2 not only activates genes required for peripheral nerve myelination but may also be involved in gene repression. The NAB (NGFI-A/Egr-binding) corepressors interact with Egr2 and are required for proper coordination of myelin formation. Therefore, NAB proteins could mediate repression of some Egr2 target genes, although direct repression by Egr2 or NAB proteins during myelination has not been demonstrated. To define the physiological role of NAB corepression in gene repression by Egr2, we tested whether the Egr2·NAB complex directly repressed specific target genes. A screen for NAB-regulated genes identified several (including Id2, Id4, and Rad) that declined during the course of peripheral nerve myelination. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the myelinating sciatic nerve was used to show developmental association of both Egr2 and NAB2 on the Id2, Id4, and Rad promoters as they were repressed during the myelination process. In addition, NAB2 represses transcription by interaction with the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase chromatin remodeling complex, and we demonstrate that CHD4 occupies NAB-repressed promoters in a developmentally regulated manner in vivo. These results illustrate a novel aspect of genetic regulation of peripheral nerve myelination by showing that Egr2 directly represses genes during myelination in conjunction with NAB corepressors.

The importance of NAB corepressors to the regulation of peripheral nerve myelination by Egr2 was recently confirmed by the demonstration that a double knock-out of the NAB1/NAB2 genes results in a phenotype very similar to that of the Egr2 knock-out, i.e. early lethality and peripheral neuropathy resulting from arrested myelination (16Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Svaren J. LaPash C. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Expression analysis of Egr2-deficient mice identified several genes induced in the absence of Egr2 (2Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on expression data, it has been proposed that Egr2 acts as a repressor of specific genes in peripheral myelin development. However, these analyses have compared expression patterns of wild type (myelinating) Schwann cells with Egr2-deficient Schwann cells that 1) fail to myelinate, 2) have increased rates of proliferation and apoptosis, and 3) exhibit up-regulation of some transactivators such as Sox2 and Scip/Oct6 (2Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2596-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Decker L. Desmarquet-Trin-Dinh C.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, given the profound differences in Schwann cells used in these comparisons, it is not clear that Egr2 is directly involved in repressing any genes. The goal of this study was to define the molecular role of Egr2 and NAB proteins in repression of gene expression during myelination. Although Egr2 has been considered principally as an activator of myelin gene expression, our study reveals that an Egr2·NAB complex directly represses specific genes during peripheral nerve myelination in vivo. Cell Culture and Microarray Analysis—Primary rat Schwann cells were cultured and infected as described (18Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using recombinant adenoviruses prepared using the AdEasy system (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). For microarray analysis, rat Schwann cells were infected for 48 h with recombinant adenovirus (1.5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) expressing Egr2 in the presence or absence of a virus expressing dominant-negative NAB2 E51K (5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml). Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA was prepared and analyzed by chemiluminescent detection on an Applied Biosystems 1700 rat array (GenUs Biosystems, Chicago). Gene-Spring software was used to analyze for genes that differed more than 2-fold in samples expressing dominant-negative NAB2, and that had a signal/noise ratio of >4 in the induced sample (see supplemental Table 1). Treatments with trichostatin A (TSA) were performed as described (20Srinivasan R. Mager G.M. Ward R.M. Mayer J. Svaren J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15129-15137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For expression of dominant-negative Egr2, recombinant adenovirus was prepared to express the DNA-binding domain of Egr2 (amino acids 330–470). The control siRNA (a medium GC content control) and Id2 Stealth siRNAs were obtained from Invitrogen. Rat Schwann cells were either cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% bovine growth serum (Hyclone) or transferred to a modified N2 medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% Ham's F12 medium with an insulin/transferrin/selenium supplement) prior to transfection with 80 pmol of either control or a pool of three Id2 siRNAs with Lipofectamine 2000 and then treated 24 h later with forskolin (2 μm)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (150 ng/ml) or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control for an additional 24 h. Quantitative PCR—cDNA was prepared from total RNA and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green dye as described (9LeBlanc S.E. Srinivasan R. Ferri C. Mager G.M. Gillian-Daniel A.L. Wrabetz L. Svaren J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) on a TaqMan 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Relative amounts of the indicated genes between samples were determined using a comparative Ct method (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

For Egr2/Krox20 wild type and homozygous-null P7 littermates, total RNA was prepared from pools of 20 sciatic nerves as described (9LeBlanc S.E. Srinivasan R. Ferri C. Mager G.M. Gillian-Daniel A.L. Wrabetz L. Svaren J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In Vivo Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Sciatic nerves were pooled from P5 and P15 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (from ∼10–13 pups at each time point). Freshly dissected nerves were immediately minced in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature. Cross-linked chromatin was prepared, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated as described previously (10Jang S.W. LeBlanc S.E. Roopra A. Wrabetz L. Svaren J. J.

After reversal of cross-links and DNA purification, quantitative PCR was performed on samples in duplicate using primers to the Rad (Ras homolog in diabetes) and IMG2a promoters (20Srinivasan R.

Values are expressed as percent recovery compared with the input into the immunoprecipitation. Promoter Analysis—Sequence analysis for Egr2 binding sites in aligned genomic sequence was performed using the rVISTA program (22Loots G.G. Ovcharenko I. Pachter L. Dubchak I. Rubin E.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and putative Egr2 sites were confirmed by comparison with the previously defined consensus Egr2 binding site (23Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The rat Rad promoter (-325 to +25) was cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pGL2 (Promega). A deletion of Egr2 binding sites (-195 to -110) from the Rad promoter was created by site-directed mutagenesis. The pGLId2–2750 promoter construct (provided by Antonio Iavarone, Columbia University (24Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Yokota Y. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)) was modified to include nucleotides up to -3029. Transfection Assays—S16 rat Schwann cells (25Toda K. Small J.A. Goda S. Quarles R.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1646-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were transfected as described (20Srinivasan R. Mager G.M. Ward R.M. Mayer J. Svaren J. J. Biol.

After 48 h, luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Identification of NAB-regulated Genes—As described above, profiling studies have identified a number of genes induced in peripheral nerve of Egr2-deficient mice (2Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2596-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 3Decker L. Desmarquet-Trin-Dinh C. Taillebourg E. Ghislain J. Vallat J.M. Charnay P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9771-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To identify candidate genes that are directly repressed by Egr2 in a NAB-dependent manner, we employed a screen in which primary rat Schwann cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses to express Egr2 in the absence and presence of dominant-negative NAB2 (15Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which eliminates the function of both NAB1 and NAB2. This dominant negative contains a point mutation that selectively prevents interaction with EGR factors, yet it retains the ability to multimerize with other NAB proteins. In initial experiments, dominant-negative NAB2 had little effect on the activation by Egr2 of a previously identified NAB-regulated gene, Pthrp (parathyroid hormone-related peptide) (16Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Svaren J. LaPash C. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the effect of dominant-negative NAB2 cannot be observed if ectopic expression increases Egr2 to superstoichiometric levels relative to the level of endogenous NAB proteins. Therefore, the experiment was repeated with reduced concentrations of Egr2-expressing virus, and the effect of dominant-negative NAB2 was much more evident at lower levels of Egr2 expression (Fig. 1). RNA samples from cells with the lower levels of Egr2 expression were therefore used in a candidate screen for NAB-regulated Egr2 target genes. Rat Schwann cells were infected with Egr2-expressing adenovirus in the absence and presence of dominant-negative NAB2, and the resulting microarray analysis identified ∼700 genes (supplemental Table 1) that are induced more than 2-fold by dominant-negative NAB2, although many of these may not be direct target genes. In addition, the Pthrp assays in Fig. 1 also revealed that the regulation of these genes in cultured Schwann cells is dependent on the relative ratios of NAB to Egr2 expression. Since ectopic expression of Egr2 does not necessarily recapitulate physiological levels of Egr2 and NAB expression, further analysis was directed toward identifying which of these genes may be directly down-regulated by the Egr2·NAB complex during myelination in vivo. Analysis of Candidate Genes Repressed by the Egr2·NAB Complex—The list of NAB-repressed genes was compared with previously published microarray analyses of peripheral myelination to identify NAB-regulated genes that decrease during the course of peripheral nerve myelination (26Verheijen M.H. Chrast R. Burrola P. Lemke G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2450-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Buchstaller J. Sommer L. Bodmer M. Hoffmann R. Suter U. Mantei N. J.

Glia. 2006; 53: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), consistent with their inhibition by an Egr2·NAB complex (Table 1). For example, the AP-2γ and Scip/Oct6 transcription factors decline during the course of peripheral nerve myelination (8Zorick T.S. Syroid D.E. Arroyo E. Scherer S.S. Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 129-145Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Stewart H.J. Brennan A. Rahman M. Zoidl G. Mitchell P.J. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 363-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined whether any of these genes were up-regulated in a similar profiling analysis of peripheral nerve injury (30Nagarajan R. Le N. Mahoney H. Araki T. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8998-9003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), as Egr2 declines during the demyelination period subsequent to nerve injury (8Zorick T.S. Syroid D.E. Arroyo E. Scherer S.S. Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 129-145Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Topilko P. Levi G. Merlo G. Mantero S. Desmarquet C. Mancardi G. Charnay P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) This analysis showed that expression of several NAB-regulated genes is inversely correlated with Egr2 levels in vivo (Table 1). In addition, several of these genes are up-regulated in the NAB knock-out mice (16Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Svaren J. LaPash C. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Nat.

Schwann cells express all members of the Id family, but Id2 and Id4 levels decline during the course of myelination and are expressed at relatively low levels in mature nerve (26Verheijen M.H. Chrast R. Burrola P. Lemke G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2450-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Stewart H.J. Zoidl G. Rossner M. Brennan A. Zoidl C. Nave K.A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. J.

Spinelli B. Kelly K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which controls Schwann cell migration and the length of myelinated segments (40Yamauchi J. Chan J.R.

Interestingly, several genes that are induced in the absence of Egr2 were not identified in this screen for NAB-regulated genes. For example, recent work has shown that Sox2 is down-regulated during myelination and is reactivated in the absence of Egr2 (2Le N. Nagarajan R. Wang J.Y. Araki T. Schmidt R.E. Milbrandt J. Proc.

Similarly, other developmentally down-regulated genes identified by cluster analysis of myelinating peripheral nerve (26Verheijen M.H. Chrast R. Burrola P. Lemke G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2450-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28D'Antonio M. Michalovich D. Paterson M. Droggiti A. Woodhoo A. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R.

For example, Pmp2 (peripheral myelin protein P2) is a developmentally regulated myelin gene (42Narayanan V. Barbosa E. Reed R. Tennekoon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8332-8337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is induced by Egr2 expression in primary Schwann cells (Ref. 18Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M.

Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although the biogenesis requirements of only a few membrane proteins have been studied thoroughly, most of them are targeted via the signal recognition particle (SRP) 5The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; TM, transmembrane; IMV, inverted membrane vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TF, trigger factor; PSBT, P. shermanii transcarboxylase; Lep, leader peptidase. pathway to the inner membrane where they are delivered at the Sec translocon (2Luirink J.

The core of the Sec translocon consists of the integral membrane proteins SecY and SecE and the peripheral ATPase SecA (4Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 5Veenendaal A.K. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

SecY and -E form a protein-conducting channel that can mediate both translocation and membrane insertion (4Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 7Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the translocon channel can open laterally toward the lipid bilayer thereby allowing the release of transmembrane segments (TMs) into the membrane (6Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 8Clemons Jr., W.M. Menetret J.F. Akey C.W. Rapoport T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ATPase SecA is required for the translocation of large (≥60 amino acids) periplasmic domains of inner membrane proteins (1Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Dalbey R.E. Chen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The inner membrane protein YidC, which is essential for viability, has been identified as a factor that assists in the integration, folding, and assembly of inner membrane proteins both in association with the Sec translocon and separately (10Kiefer D. Kuhn A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 259: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus far, only a handful of inner membrane proteins that insert via the YidC-only pathway have been identified. All these proteins are small and do not contain a sizable periplasmic domains and more than two TMs. It is not clear how YidC assists the biogenesis of these proteins. During the biogenesis of SRP/Sec translocon-dependent inner membrane proteins, YidC specifically interacts with the TMs of these proteins (e.g. Refs. 12Houben E.N. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that YidC mediates the transfer of TMs from the Sec translocon into the lipid bilayer (1Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, YidC could be co-purified with the Sec translocon, suggesting a physical connection (14Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A recent in vitro study using lactose permease (LacY) reveals a novel function for YidC in the co-translational folding of this inner membrane protein rather than its insertion into the membrane (16Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The observation that YidC depletion leads to the induction of the Cpx and σE envelope stress responses, which both sense protein misfolding in the cell envelope, also points to a role of YidC in the folding of inner membrane proteins (17Shimohata N. Chiba S. Saikawa N. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Shimohata N. Nagamori S. Akiyama Y. Kaback H.R. Ito K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the inner membrane protein MalF as a model protein to study the role of YidC in the biogenesis of polytopic inner membrane proteins, which are part of a heterooligomeric complex. MalF functions in maltose transport as a 1:1:2 complex with the integral inner membrane protein MalG and the peripheral inner membrane protein MalK (19Ehrmann M. Ehrle R. Hofmann E. Boos W. Schlosser A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The complex belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. MalF is a 514-amino acid-long inner membrane protein containing 8 TMs, with its N and C termini facing the cytosol (21Froshauer S. Green G.N. Boyd D. McGovern K. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). A large periplasmic domain (∼180 amino acids) is present between the third and the fourth transmembrane segments. This domain folds into a trypsin-resistant conformation when MalF is incorporated into the MalFGK2 maltose transport complex (22Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of MalF was studied using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. MalF was found to be targeted via the SRP pathway to the Sec/YidC insertion site. Despite close proximity of nascent MalF to YidC during insertion, YidC appeared dispensable for the insertion of MalF into the membrane. However, YidC is required for the stability of MalF and the formation of the MalFGK2 maltose transport complex suggesting an important role of YidC in the assembly of oligomeric complexes in the inner membrane. Materials—Restriction endonucleases and the Expand Long Template PCR system were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The Megashort Script T7 transcription kit was from Ambion Inc.

Serva Blue G was obtained from Serva. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. A polyclonal antibody against the c-Myc epitope tag was obtained from Abcam. Antisera against SecY, SecE, YidC, and Ffh were from our own collection. Antisera against MalF, -G, and -K, trigger factor (TF), and L23 were kind gifts from A. Davidson, W. Wickner, and R. Brimacombe, respectively. In Vitro Cross-linking—E. coli strain MRE600 was used to prepare a lysate for translation of in vitro synthesized mRNA and suppression of UAG stop codons in the presence of (Tmd)-Phe-tRNAsup. Strain MC4100 was used to isolate inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs). Strain JM110 was used to isolate pC4Meth-derived plasmids for in vitro transcription. pC4Meth-derived plasmids for in vitro expression of truncated forms of MalF were constructed by PCR using pTAZFQ as template (23Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These plasmids encode truncated MalF fused to a 4× methionine tag to improve labeling efficiency of nascent chains with [35S]methionine. Immunoprecipitation of nascent chains was enabled by constructing a complementary set of constructs with a C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag (EQKLI-SEEDL) fused to the truncated MalF sequence. Furthermore, amber mutations (TAG) were introduced at the indicated positions to enable sup-tRNA photo-cross-linking, as described previously (14Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Truncated mRNAs were prepared from HindIII- or ClaI-linearized pC4Meth-derived plasmids. In vitro translation, targeting to IMVs, photo-cross-linking, carbonate extraction (to separate membrane-bound material from non-membrane-bound material), and sample processing were performed as described previously (14Scotti P.A.

To deplete cells of SecA, they were grown to mid-log phase at 41 °C. The SecE depletion strain CM124 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.2% l-arabinose as described previously (24Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y.

To deplete cells of SecE, cells were grown to mid-log phase in the absence of l-arabinose. Depletion of SecA and SecE was checked by monitoring the accumulation of pro-OmpA during a short pulse-labeling step with [35S]methionine. The SecG deletion strain KN370 was cultured in M9 minimal medium to mid-log phase, and plasmid pH+ was used to complement with SecG as described previously (24Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C.

MalF was expressed by arabinose induction from the pBAD24 vector (26Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J.

Where appropriate, ampicillin (final concentration, 100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (final concentration, 30 μg/ml), kanamycin (final concentration, 50 μg/ml), streptomycin (final concentration, 25 μg/ml), and tetracycline (final concentration, 12.5 μg/ml) were added to the medium. For all experiments cells were grown to mid-log phase. Expression of the constructs was induced for 3 min with either IPTG (final concentration, 1 mm) or l-arabinose (final concentration, 0.2%). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml, 1 Ci = 25 GBq) for 30 s. After labeling, cells were converted to spheroplasts. For spheroplasting, cells were collected at 14,000 rpm for 30 s in a microfuge, resuspended in ice-cold buffer (40% w/v sucrose, 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and incubated with lysozyme (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min on ice. Aliquots of the spheroplast suspension were incubated on ice for 1 h either in the presence or absence of proteinase K (final concentration, 0.3 mg/ml). Subsequently, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the spheroplast suspension (final concentration, 0.33 mg/ml) to inhibit the protease. After addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%), washed with acetone, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/2% SDS, immunoprecipitated with antisera to MalF, OmpA (a periplasmic control), and AraB/bandX (a cytoplasmic control), washed, and analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE (24Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Park S.K. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R. Luirink J. de Gier J.W.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gels were scanned in a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimaging device and quantitated using Image Gauge (version 3.4). All pulse experiments were repeated at least three times. For the MalF biotinylation-based membrane insertion assay, the genes encoding the MalF derivatives MalF I (MalF with a PBST biotinylation domain engineered in the periplasmic loop between TM3 and -4, Fig. 1) and MalF L (MalF with a PBST biotinylation domain engineered in the cytoplasmic loop between TM4 and -5, Fig. 1) were cloned into the expression vector pASK-IBA3 (IBA GmbH, Germany) (28Jander G. Cronan J.E. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3049-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors containing the two derivatives of MalF were transformed into the conditional YidC strain FTL10. Cells were grown overnight in LB medium containing arabinose. Cultures were then washed and transferred into fresh LB medium containing arabinose or glucose to deplete cells for YidC. Expression of MalF-I and -L was induced by addition of 0.2 μg/ml anhydrotetracycline. After 4 h samples were taken and processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Biotinylated proteins were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Analysis of the Accumulation Levels of the MalFGK2 Maltose Transport Complex by Blue Native PAGE—Overnight cultures of MC4100ara+ and FTL10 cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. To induce the expression of YidC in FTL10 during growth overnight, 0.2% arabinose was added. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to an A660 of 0.05 in fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 0.2% maltose. It should be noted that the maltose transport complex is also expressed in the absence of maltose (29Wagner S. Baars L. Ytterberg A.J. Klussmeier A. Wagner C.S. Nord O.

The accumulation levels of the MalFGK2 maltose transport complex were analyzed by blue native-PAGE (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) followed by Western blot analysis. Sample preparation and running conditions were essentially as described previously (29Wagner S. Baars L. Ytterberg A.J. Klussmeier A. Wagner C.S. Nord O. Nygren P.A. van Wijk K.J. de Gier J.W. Mol.

For blotting of blue native-PAGE gels, the cathode buffer containing 0.02% Serva Blue G was exchanged after one-third of the run to cathode buffer containing 0.002% Serva Blue G. This was done to prevent excessive binding of the dye to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blotting and decoration of blots with antisera to MalF, -G, -K, YidC, and SecY were performed as described previously (29Wagner S. Baars L. Ytterberg A.J. Klussmeier A. Wagner C.S. Nord O.

Western Blotting Analysis—The accumulation levels of MalF, MalK, MalG, and YidC in inner membranes were monitored by immunoblot analysis. IMVs (3–5 μg of protein) were separated by standard SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Wagner S. Baars L. Ytterberg A.J. Klussmeier A. Wagner C.S. Nord O.

To verify the specificity of the MalG signal, a malG deletion mutant (SW1242) was used (see below). Construction of malG and malK Deletion Strains and FTL10 malF::Tn10—malG and malK deletion mutants were made using the Red Swap method (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In brief, primers “malG_ ECOLI_swapc_HP1” (5′-AACCTGAAAGCCACGCGAATGAAGTTTGATTAAGGGAGATAACAAAAATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and “malG_ECOLI_swapc_HP2” (5′-AGCGGCATAACATTGGCAGAACAACATCTTTAACCTTTCACACCACCTGCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) or “malK_ECOLI_swapc_HP1” (5′-TCATGAATGTTGCTGTCGATGACAGGTTGTTACAAAGGGAGAAGGGCATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3′) and “malK_ECOLI_swapc_ HP2” (5′-TGACAGGCTTTGTGTGTTTTGTGGGGTGCTTAAACGCCCGGCTCCTTATGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) were used to amplify the chloramphenicol resistance cassette from pKD3 (31Datsenko K.A.

After electroporation with the PCR product, chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were isolated on agar plates containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Deletion of malG and malK was verified by PCR with the following primers: k1, k2 (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar), “malG_ECOLI_swap_U” (5′-CAATTGCCACGCTGATCTTC-3′), “malG_ECOLI_swap_D” (5′-CGTGACTCAGAGCACGAAAG-3′), “malK_ECOLI_swap_U” (5′-GGTGGAGGATTTAAGCCATC-3′), and “malK_ECOLI_swap_D” (5′-GCTACCTGTCCAACCAATAC-3′). Strains SW1242 (ΔmalG) and SW1282 (ΔmalK) were tested for defective maltose fermentation on McConkey agar plates containing 1% maltose. The malF::Tn10 (TetR) mutant allele (a kind gift of Michael Ehrmann, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany) was moved into strain FTL10 by bacteriophage P1-mediated generalized transduction (32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). FTL10 malF::Tn10 (TetR) transductants were selected at 37 °C on LB agar plates supplemented with sodium citrate (10 mm), l-arabinose (0.1%), and tetracycline (15 μg/ml). Transductants were further tested for defective maltose fermentation on McConkey agar plates containing maltose. Monitoring the Stability of MalF upon Depletion of YidC—Overnight cultures of MC4100ara+, FTL10, SW1242, and SW1282 cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. To induce the expression of YidC in FTL10 during growth overnight, 0.2% arabinose was added. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to an A660 of 0.05 in fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glycerol. To induce the expression of YidC in FTL10, 0.2% arabinose was added. To induce the expression of the mal operon, 0.2% maltose was added. After 3 h of growth, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to an A660 of 2.0 in 1 ml of minimal medium supplemented with all amino acids, except methionine and cysteine, and containing 0.2% glycerol and 0.2% maltose. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min, followed by chases of 3, 30, and 60 min, and subsequently precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated material was processed as described above under “Strains, Plasmids, Growth Conditions, and Assay Used in MalF Membrane Targeting/Insertion Experiments in Vivo.” Nascent MalF Interacts with TF, Ffh, and the Ribosomal Component L23 and Inserts into the Inner Membrane in the Vicinity of YidC and the Sec Translocon—We initially analyzed the pathway of targeting and membrane insertion of MalF using an in vitro translation/targeting/photo-cross-linking approach. Radiolabeled nascent MalF of 88 amino acids was synthesized in a wild-type cell-free E. coli extract in the presence of inverted inner membrane vesicles to allow membrane targeting and insertion on the ribosome nascent chain complex (14Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). At this length, the ribosome nascent chain complex is expected to fully expose the first and second TMs of MalF, assuming that the ribosome covers ∼30 amino acids (33Houben E.N. Zarivach R. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To enable the incorporation of a photoreactive probe in the middle of the first TM of MalF, a single TAG amber codon was introduced at position 26. Following translation in the presence of (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup and UV-induced cross-linking, samples were extracted with sodium carbonate at pH 11.5 to separate membrane-integrated from untargeted material. Cross-linked partners were identified by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The TAG26 mutation in 88MalFTAG26 was efficiently suppressed by (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup (data not shown), resulting in nascent MalF of the expected molecular weight. 88MalFTAG26 was efficiently targeted to IMVs, as judged by the relative amount of carbonate-resistant material (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2). Upon UV irradiation, several specific cross-linking products could be observed in the carbonate supernatant and pellet fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7). An adduct of ∼55 kDa could be immunoprecipitated with antiserum to Ffh, the protein component of E. coli SRP (Fig. 2, lane 5). Substantial amounts of smaller adducts were also precipitated with antiserum to Ffh, which most probably represent cross-linked degradation products of Ffh (34Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Raine A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Ehrenberg M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A cross-linking product of ∼65 kDa could be immunoprecipitated with antiserum to trigger factor (TF), which is a cytosolic chaperone with general affinity for nascent polypeptides that resides on the ribosome close to the nascent chain exit site (35de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 4). A prominent ∼20-kDa cross-link product was precipitated with antibodies directed toward the ribosomal protein L23 (Fig. 2, lane 6), which is located near the nascent chain exit site (37Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar). Ffh and TF have both been shown to associate with L23 (34Ullers R.S. Houben E.N.

Science. 2006; 312: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the carbonate pellet fraction a very strong cross-linking product of ∼60 kDa becomes apparent after UV irradiation (Fig. 2, lane 7). We could immunoprecipitate this adduct with antiserum to YidC (Fig. 2, lane 8) (35de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A less prominent band of ∼40 kDa could be immunoprecipitated with antiserum to SecY (Fig. 2, lane 9) (35de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In summary, using this unbiased approach it was shown that, at a nascent chain length of 88 amino acids, TM1 of MalF interacts with TF, SRP, and L23 and inserts into the inner membrane in a carbonate-resistant state close to YidC and SecY. This strongly suggests that MalF is targeted via the SRP pathway to the SecY/YidC insertion site in the inner membrane. TM1 of MalF Remains Close to YidC and the Sec Translocon during Insertion of TM2 and TM3 of MalF into the Membrane, and TM2 and TM3 Insert into the Membrane in a Molecular Environment Similar to That of TM1—To study the sequence of events taking place during the biogenesis of the three N-terminal TMs of MalF, nascent chains of increasing lengths were synthesized in vitro. The shortest nascent chain, 68MalF, is expected to fully expose the first TM segment from the ribosome nascent chain complex (see Fig. 3A). At a length of 100 amino acids, 100MalF exposes TM1 and TM2. 131MalF, the longest nascent chain, exposes TM1, TM2, and TM3. By placing a TAG codon at position 26 and by exploiting the photo-cross-linking procedure described above, the molecular environment of TM1 in each of these translation intermediates was studied. C-terminal c-Myc epitope tags were introduced to enable purification of nascent chains by immunoprecipitation. Previous work has shown t"

The cellular response from the host to LPS is mediated through stepwise interactions involving the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), CD14, and MD-2, which produces the rearrangement of TLR4. In addition to LBP, the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein gene family includes the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). Here we show that the intravascular redistribution of LPS from the plasma lipoprotein-free fraction toward circulating lipoproteins is delayed in PLTP-deficient mice. In agreement with earlier in vitro studies, which predicted the neutralization of the endotoxic properties of LPS when associated with lipoproteins, significant increases in the plasma concentration of proinflammatory cytokines were found in PLTP-deficient as compared with wild type mice. Similar inflammatory damage occurred in tissues from wild type and PLTP-deficient mice 24 h after one single intraperitoneal injection of LPS but with a more severe accumulation of red blood cells in glomeruli of LPS-injected PLTP-deficient mice. Complementary ex vivo experiments on isolated splenocytes from wild type and PLTP-deficient mice further supported the ability of cell-derived PLTP to prevent LPS-mediated inflammation and cytotoxicity when combined with lipoprotein acceptors. Finally, PLTP deficiency in mice led to a significant increase in LPS-induced mortality. It is concluded that increasing circulating levels of PLTP may constitute a new and promising strategy in preventing endotoxic shock.

Int. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 6: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The presence of LPS in the bloodstream activates the innate immune system through LPS recognition and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (2van Deventer S.J.

If, instead of binding to LBP, LPS binds to circulating lipoproteins, including chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and high density lipoproteins (HDL), its activity is neutralized. Compared with LPS in the plasma lipoprotein-free fraction (LFF), LPS-lipoprotein complexes have been shown to be less pyrogenic, less able to activate complement, and less active in inducing the release of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α), resulting in fewer deaths in lipoprotein-treated animals (17Cavaillon J.M.

In the case of PLTP, only in vitro data showing its LPS transfer activity have been reported (32Vesy C.J. Kitchens R.L. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Munford R.S. Infect.

In the present study, the physiopathological impact of PLTP on LPS metabolism and endotoxic shock was evaluated through the comparison of PLTP-knocked out mice with WT mice, which combine high plasma PLTP activity (38Guyard-Dangremont V. Desrumaux C. Gambert P. Lallemant C. Lagrost L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and a remarkable resistance to LPS-mediated endotoxic shock (39Redl H. Bahrami S. Schlag G. Traber D.L. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 330-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Animals—PLTP-deficient mice were previously generated by Jiang et al. (40Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, they were obtained by replacing exon 2 (containing the translation start site) with a neo gene (40Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Animals were on a homogenous C57BL/6 background (eight backcrosses). PLTP-/- homozygous mice, PLTP+/- heterozygous mice, and WT/nontargeted C57BL/6 mice (4–6 months old) were fed a standard chow diet (A03 diet; Safe, Augy, France). Animals had free access to water and food. All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved by the University of Burgundy's Ethics Committee on the Use of Laboratory Animals (protocol number 2606). LPS Injection and Blood Sampling—All materials were apyrogen or depyrogenated by steam autoclaving before use, and all of the reagents used were of “endotoxin-free” grade. As assessed by using either the LAL assay or the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3-hydroxymyristic acid quantitation (see below), only trace amounts of LPS were detected in experimental media that were not supplemented with exogenous LPS. LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5; Sigma) was suspended in endotoxin-free, 0.15 m sodium chloride and vigorously mixed for 15 min before use. The LPS was injected intraperitoneally into mice (5 or 0.5 mg/kg body weight; single doses). Blood was then collected at the indicated times on endotoxin-free sodium citrate (1:9, v/v) (Sigma) via caudal or retroorbital puncture. Plasma was obtained by blood centrifugation (10 min, 2000 × g at 4 °C), and lipoproteins were further isolated from the plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation as previously described (39Redl H. Bahrami S. Schlag G. Traber D.L. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 330-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The d > 1.21 g/liter fraction constituted the LFF. All samples were stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Phospholipid Transfer Activity—PLTP activity was measured as previously described (41Klein A. Deckert V. Schneider M. Dutrillaux F. Hammann A. Athias A. Le Guern N. Pais de Barros J.P. Desrumaux C. Masson D. Jiang X.C. Lagrost L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 2160-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), using a commercially available fluorescence activity assay (Roar Biomedical Inc., New York, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This fluorimetric assay measures the transfer (unquenching) of fluorescent phosphatidylcholine from donor to acceptor synthetic liposomes. Phospholipid transfer rates were calculated as the initial slope of the phospholipid transfer curve. They were expressed as increase in fluorescence per second (arbitrary units (AU)/s). PLTP Genotyping—DNA was extracted from blood cells as previously described (42Walsh P.S. Metzger D.A. Higuchi R. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 506-513PubMed Google Scholar), and PCRs were conducted by using a mixture of 3 primers: 5′-GCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC-3′ (Neo3), 5′-AAAGGCTGCCGGACCCGCG-3′ (66AM), and 5′-TGGTCATGCATCTAGAACGGAGT-3′ (58BM). Amplification products were analyzed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide, and molecular weights were determined as compared with the 100-bp DNA ladder calibration kit (Invitrogen). One single 580 bp band is obtained in WT mice, one 580 bp band plus one 680 bp band are obtained in PLTP+/- heterozygotes, and one single, 680 bp band is obtained in PLTP-/- homozygotes. LPS Quantification—LPS in total serum, bile, or isolated lipoprotein fractions was assayed by using either a biological activity assay (Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) kit, QCL-1000 chromogenic assay; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) or the direct quantitation of 3-hydroxymyristic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (43Szponar B. Krasnik L. Hryniewiecki T. Gamian A. Larsson L. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the LAL assay, samples were diluted to fall within the range of the standard curve and heated for 15 min at 70 °C to avoid protein inhibition. The quantitation of 3-hydroxymyristic acid was performed as previously described (43Szponar B. Krasnik L. Hryniewiecki T. Gamian A. Larsson L. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 1149-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except that 3-hydroxypentadecanoic acid was used as an internal standard in the present studies. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of 3-hydroxymyristate was performed by using the selected ion monitoring mode. The 3-hydroymyristate concentration was found to correlate significantly with the biological/LAL activity of LPS (44Saraf A. Park J.-H. Milton D.K. Larsson L. J. Environ. Monit. 1999; 1: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Areas under the LPS curves (AUC) in total plasma and plasma fractions were calculated from kinetic curves, which were measured over 24 h. Cytokine and Chemokine Measure ments—Cytokines (IL-10, TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1)) were assayed by cytometric bead array using a commercially available kit (cytometric bead array mouse inflammation kit; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Leukocyte Counts in LPS-injected Mice—Total leukocyte count was conducted in a Malassez cell after lysis of red blood cells. An aliquot of blood was used for blood smear prior to May Grünwald Giemsa staining in order to determine the relative proportions of leukocyte subpopulations. Histological Examination—Lung, liver, and kidney segments were fixed in 10% (v/v) phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.4) for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. Five-μm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and viewed by light microscopy at ×200 magnification (45Li L. Bhatia M. Zhu Y.Z. Zhu Y.C. Ramnath R.D. Wang Z.J. Anuar F.B. Whiteman M. Salto-Tellez M. Moore P.K. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1196-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Ex Vivo Response of Mouse Splenocytes to LPS—Splenocytes were isolated from wild type or PLTP-/- mice and cultured as previously described (46Reisser D. Pinard D. Jeannin J.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cells from individual mice were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence (10%) or in the absence of fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). After 2 h of incubation, LPS (low dose, 0.1 μg/ml; high dose, 10 μg/ml) was added to culture media. Culture media from LPS-treated splenocytes were collected after 20 h of incubation and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were kept for further cytokine measurements and cytoxicity assay. Cytotoxicity—The toxicity of the supernatants from wild type or PLTP-/- splenocytes treated with the high LPS dose was assessed by determining their impact on the ability of EMT-6J cells to adhere to plastic according to the general procedure previously described (47Gauthier N. Lohm S. Touzery C. Chantome A. Perette B. Reveneau S. Brunotte F. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. Jeannin J.F. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 48Olsson N.O. Leclerc A. Jeannin J.F. Martin F. Ann. Immunol. 1982; 133: 245-254Google Scholar). Results were expressed as a percentage of adherent cells, 100% adhesion corresponding to the control value obtained in the absence of LPS. Lipid and Protein Measurements—Cholesterol and proteins were assayed using commercially available kits (Cholesterol 100 (ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier, France) and the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Interchim, Montluçon, France)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LBP was assayed by using a commercially available mouse LBP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cell Sciences). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between two data means was determined with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney or the Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate. The statistical significance of differences between three groups was determined with analysis of variance and Fisher test. Survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the χ2 test. PLTP and LBP Expression Levels in the Mouse Model—As compared with both WT mouse plasma and human plasma, which show high plasma PLTP activity, PLTP-/- mice displayed virtually no plasma phospholipid transfer activity (Fig. 1, A and B) (40Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). PLTP gene knock-out was confirmed by PCR analysis with one single 580-bp product for WT mice, one single 680-bp product for PLTP-/- homozygotes, and one 580-bp product plus one 680-bp product in PLTP+/- heterozygotes (Fig. 1C). Levels of the related LBP were similar in WT and PLTP-deficient plasmas (Fig. 1D). Tissue Abnormalities in LPS-injected Mice—In a first attempt to characterize the ability of LPS to cause tissue damage, sections of liver, lung, and kidney from injected WT and PLTP-/- mice were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and viewed by light microscopy. As expected from previous studies (45Li L. Bhatia M. Zhu Y.Z. Zhu Y.C. Ramnath R.D. Wang Z.J. Anuar F.B. Whiteman M. Salto-Tellez M. Moore P.K. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1196-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of one single dose of Escherichia coli 055:B5 LPS, tissue sections from both WT mice and PLTP-/- mice showed the main characteristics of inflammatory damage (Fig. 2). In particular, it is illustrated by sinusoid dilatation and intrasinusoidal thrombi in the liver and by alveolar thickening and the presence of peribronchiolar leukocytes in the lung. Interestingly, accumulation of red blood cells in glomeruli was found in both genotypes, and quantitative analysis revealed a more severe trait in LPS-injected PLTP-/- mice than in LPS-injected WT mice (Fig. 2I). Total, polynuclear, and mononuclear cell counts did not differ significantly between WT and PLTP-/- mice, whether they were treated or not with LPS (Table 1). As expected (49Hickey M.J. Issekutz A.C. Reinhardt P.H. Fedorak R.N. Kubes P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), LPS injection produced significant decreases in the number of blood leukocytes. The effect tended to be more pronounced in PLTP-/- mice than in WT mice in which only mononuclear cell counts were decreased, whereas total white blood, polynuclear, and mononuclear cells were all significantly decreased after LPS treatment in PLTP-/- mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Leukocyte counts in LPS-injected mice Wild-type (n = 5) and PLTP–/– mice (n = 5) were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (5 mg/kg). Blood samples were drawn before (base line) and 24 h after LPS injection.

To this end, WT and PLTP-/- mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg of body weight of E. coli 055:B5 LPS, and blood was then collected at the indicated times. IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and MCP-1 in plasma were assayed by cytometric bead array. At base line (t = 0), only trace amounts of IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and MCP-1 were found in plasma of both WT and PLTP-/- mice (Fig. 3, A–E). As expected (5Gallay P. Heumann D. Le Roy D. Barras C.

Med. 1997; 186: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the injection of LPS produced a burst of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in WT mice at t = 1.5 h, and a similar trend was observed in PLTP-/- mice (Fig. 3, A–E). After 9 h, plasma levels of IFN-γ (Fig. 3B), TNF-α (Fig. 3C), IL-6 (Fig. 3D), and MCP-1 (Fig. 3E) in PLTP-/- mice were approximately twice those in WT mice, whereas the LPS-induced increases in the concentration of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 were of similar magnitude in WT and PLTP-/- mice (Fig. 3A). After 24 h, plasma levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 in PLTP-/- mice were still significantly higher than those in WT mice (Fig. 3, D and E). Synergistic Effects of PLTP and Lipoprotein Acceptors on LPS-mediated Inflammation—Splenocytes were isolated from WT and PLTP-/- mice, and they were treated or not with LPS. As shown in Fig. 4, phospholipid transfer activity was detected in the culture medium of WT splenocytes, whereas no transfer activity was detected in the medium of PLTP-/- splenocytes. In the absence of fetal calf serum (Fig. 5, A–C), the addition of LPS (high dose, 10 μg/ml) to cultured cells induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines after 20 h of LPS treatment. Identical patterns were observed whether or not the cells expressed PLTP, indicating similar intrinsic responsiveness of PLTP-/- versus WT cells. In addition, at the high, 10 μg/ml dose, LPS induced cytotoxicity, as assessed by a major decrease in the adherence of EMT-6J target cells in both genotypes (Fig. 5D). When splenocytes were cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum as a source of lipoproteins (Fig. 5, E–H), production of proinflammatory cytokines as well as cytotoxicity after the addition of the high, 10 μg/ml LPS dose were significantly higher in PLTP-/- than in WT mice. When LPS was used at a lower, 0.1 μg/ml dose in complementary experiments, again more pronounced, significant in"
https://openalex.org/W1986688234,"Sulfiredoxin (Srx) is one of a family of low molecular weight sulfur containing proteins linked with maintenance of cellular redox balance. One function of Srx is the reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid to sulfenic acid in proteins subject to oxidative stress. Other redox active protein families have multiple functions in regulating redox and controlling proliferation/death pathways; increased Srx has been linked with oncogenic transformation. To explore the biological functions of Srx in tumors, we established cell lines that overexpress Srx. Enhanced levels of Srx promoted cell proliferation and enhanced cell death following cisplatin. Srx overexpression triggered an alteration in expression and phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators p21, p27 and p53; stabilized the phosphatase PTEN and, importantly, interacted directly with, and enhanced the activity of, phosphatase PTP1B. In turn, this promoted Src kinase activity by dephosphorylating its inhibitory tyrosine residue (Y530). Srx expression was stimulated by cell exposure to certain growth factors. These data support a role for Srx in controlling the phosphorylation status of key regulatory kinases through effects upon phosphatase activity with an ultimate effect on pathways that influence cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2022973538,"Cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Intramembranous proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein by a multiprotein gamma-secretase complex generates Abeta. Previously, it was reported that CD147, a glycoprotein that stimulates production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is a subunit of gamma-secretase and that the levels of secreted Abeta inversely correlate with CD147 expression. Here, we show that the levels and localization of CD147 in fibroblasts, as well as postnatal expression and distribution in brain, are distinct from those of integral gamma-secretase subunits. Notably, we show that although depletion of CD147 increased extracellular Abeta levels in intact cells, membranes isolated from CD147-depleted cells failed to elevate Abeta production in an in vitro gamma-secretase assay. Consistent with an extracellular source that modulates Abeta metabolism, synthetic Abeta was degraded more rapidly in the conditioned medium of cells overexpressing CD147. Moreover, modulation of CD147 expression had no effect on epsilon-site cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and Notch1 receptor. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CD147 modulates Abeta levels not by regulating gamma-secretase activity, but by stimulating extracellular degradation of Abeta. In view of the known function of CD147 in MMP production, we postulate that CD147 expression influences Abeta levels by an indirect mechanism involving MMPs that can degrade extracellular Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W2020594763,"Responses to transforming growth factor β and multiple cytokines involve activation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) kinase, which activates kinases IκB kinase (IKK) and MKK3/6, leading to the parallel activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK. Activation of TAK1 by autophosphorylation is known to involve three different TAK1-binding proteins (TABs). Here we report a protein phosphatase subunit known as type 2A phosphatase-interacting protein (TIP) that also acts as a TAB because it co-precipitates with and directly binds to TAK1, enhances TAK1 autophosphorylation at unique sites, and promotes TAK1 phosphorylation of IKKβ and signaling to NF-κB. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that co-expression of TAB4 protein significantly increased phosphorylation of four sites in TAK1, in a linker region between the kinase and TAB2/3 binding domains, and two sites in TAB1. Recombinant GST-TAB4 bound in an overlay assay directly to inactive TAK1 and activated TAK1 but not TAK1 phosphorylated in the linker sites, suggesting a bind and release mechanism. In kinase assays using TAK1 immune complexes, added GST-TAB4 selectively stimulated IKK phosphorylation. TAB4 co-precipitated polyubiquitinated proteins dependent on a Phe-Pro motif that was required to enhance phosphorylation of TAK1. TAB4 mutated at Phe-Pro dominantly interfered with IL-1β activation of NF-κB involving IKK-dependent but not p38 MAPK-dependent signaling.

Our interest in PP6 raised a question about inactivation of TAK1. Studies of the TOR pathway in yeast led to the discovery of Tap42, a protein that binds all of the yeast type 2A phosphatases: Sit4 (PP6), Pph3, and Pph21/22 (PP2A) (23Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, Tap42 action on phosphatases is not understood and is controversial. One group claims Tap42 is phosphorylated directly by TOR to increase Tap42 binding to Pph21/22 or Sit4 (24Duvel K. Broach J.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 19-38PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Another group suggests that Tap42 is restricted from binding to phosphatases by instead binding a protein called Tip41 (Tap42-interacting protein of 41 kDa) and that the Tip41-Tap42 complex is disrupted by TOR phosphorylation of Tip41 (26Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Yet a third scenario arose when it was reported that yeast Tip41 interacted with yeast phosphatases Pph21/22 and Pph3 in a two-hybrid assay (27Gingras A.C. Caballero M. Zarske M. Sanchez A. Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Sonenberg N. Hafen E. Raught B. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1725-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). While our work was in progress another group published that the human orthologue of yeast Tip41 called type 2A phosphatase-interacting protein (TIP) binds human PP2A, PP4, and PP6 (28McConnell J.L. Gomez R.J. McCorvey L.R. Law B.K. Wadzinski B.E. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, type 2 phosphatases, including PP6, can bind to yeast and human orthologues of both Tap42 (α-4Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and Tip41 (TIP). We showed that the human version of Tap42 called α-4 acts as a targeting subunit for PP2A, binding to MEK3 to promote selective dephosphorylation of one of two sites in the activation loop in that way opposing activation of p38 MAPK by cytokines (29Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here because of the relationship to PP6 we investigated the function of the human TIP protein (NP_690866) relative to TAK1 and discovered properties that qualify this protein as a TAB and led us to call it TAB4. We show that, like TAB1, TAB4 directly binds and activates TAK1 by inducing autophosphorylation of TAK1. The activated TAK1 phosphorylates TAB1 and shows specificity toward the endogenous substrate IKKβ.A Phe-Pro sequence motif found in TAB2/3 is present in the C-terminal region of TAB4. Mutation of Phe254 and Pro255 in TAB4 eliminated binding of polyubiquitinated proteins and activation and phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1 without reduction in PP6 binding. These mutations separate multiple functions of TAB4. We propose that TAB4 is a multifunctional protein that promotes the activation of NF-κB using separate domains that bind TAK1 and polyubiquitin chains. cDNA Constructs, Plasmids, and Antibodies—Full-length human TAB4 was cloned downstream of GST in pGEX-4T2 using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites for production of recombinant protein in bacteria. Recombinant GST-TAB4 was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Antibodies were purified using a two-step procedure. 1) GST-conjugated Affi-Gel-15 was used to preclear anti-GST antibodies followed by 2) purification with GST-TAB4-conjugated Affi-Gel-15 using 0.1 m glycine elution-2 m Tris-HCl neutralization as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). TAB4 was also cloned downstream of HA epitope tag (pKHA vector) and FLAG epitope tag (pcDNA3-FLAG2 vector) using BamHI and EcoRI for expression in mammalian cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of TAB4 was done following the manufacturers' protocol. FLAG-TAK1, HA-TAK1, HA-TAK1(K63W), FLAG-TAB1, and T7-TAB1 were described previously (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K.

Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Pulldown Assays—HEK293, HEK293T, and 293IL-1R1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HEK293T cells were transfected using Arrest-In (Open Biosystems) as suggested by the manufacturer. In every case, HEK293T cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes at ∼40% confluence the day before transfection. Cells were transfected using ∼5 μg of plasmid for each construct and incubated for 24–48 h before harvesting. Cell extracts were made using a 1% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal CA-630, Sigma) lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm microcystin-LR (Alexis Biochemicals), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Extracts were immunoprecipitated using either anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA beads (Sigma-Aldrich), or anti-TAB4 bound to protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations and pulldowns were done using approximately the same volume of extracts with 10–15 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and microcystin-LR-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitations and pulldowns were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer two to three times. Complexes were eluted using 35 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Extracts and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the antibodies described earlier and the LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner and software. Recombinant λ-Phosphatase Treatment—HEK293T cells were transfected with 1) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 or 2) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 plus HA-TAB4, and extracts were made with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates were collected after 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with RIPA buffer followed by two washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol (λ-phosphatase buffer). Immunoprecipitates were taken up in 30 ml of λ-phosphatase buffer and treated with 0, 0.2, or 1 μl of MBP-λ-phosphatase (∼8,330 units/mg) for 2 h at 30 °C. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to detect mobility shifts of TAK1 and/or TAB1. Far-Western (Overlay) Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with 1) FLAG-TAK1, 2) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1, 3) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 plus HA-TAB4, or 4) empty vector control. Extracts were made using RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer, eluted with 35 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 1% blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20) for 2 h. Probes were diluted in 1% blocking buffer at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed two to three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1–2 min followed by fixation using 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were then rinsed quickly twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and quenched using 2% glycine in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with anti-GST plus secondary antibody and analyzed using the LI-COR Odyssey system and software. FLAG-Ub Binding Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-TAB4(wt), HA-TAB4(F254A), or HA-TAB4(FP-AA) or empty vector control along with FLAG-Ub. Extracts were prepared using 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer described above and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA beads for 2 h at 4 °C and washed 2–3 times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. HA-FLAG complexes were eluted using 35 μl 2X SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and anti-HA. Immunoblots were analyzed using the LI-COR Odyssey system and software. In Vitro TAK1 Kinase Assay with MKK6 or IKKβ—HEK293T cells were transfected with 1) FLAG-TAK1, 2) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1, or 3) FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 plus either HA-TAB4(wt), 4) HA-TAB4(F254A), or 5) HA-TAB4(FP-AA). Extracts were prepared using a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer described above and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads. Immunoprecipitates were collected after 2 h at 4 °C, washed two to three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and then washed twice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Immunoprecipitates were taken up in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. Kinase assays were done using 1 μg of recombinant His6-MKK6 or GST-IKKβ (Upstate-Chemicon), 5 μl of immunoprecipitate, 2 μl of 5× kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm MgCl2), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 2 min. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Gel-Code Blue (Pierce) to visualize bands. Bands corresponding to His6-MKK6 or GST-IKKβ were excised from the stained gel, and 32P was analyzed using a liquid scintillation counter. NF-κB Luciferase Assays—HEK293T cells were seeded at 30–40% confluence in 12-well dishes and transfected 16 h later with 100 ng of F254A, FP-AA, or empty vector plus 100 ng of NF-κB firefly luciferase and 10 ng of Renilla luciferase vectors or with 100 ng of FLAG-TAB4(wt) or empty vector and HA-TAK1(wt) or HA-TAK1(K63W) plus 100 ng of NF-κB luciferase and 10 ng of Renilla vectors. Cells were incubated for 16 h before changing the medium to serum-free conditions (0.5% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for the remainder of the experiment. Cells were pretreated with curcumin or SB203580 for 30 min prior to stimulation for 6 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or vehicle alone. Cells were harvested and analyzed as described previously (29Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Cell.

TAB4 Enhances Activation of TAK1-TAB1—The human protein NP_690866 has been reported to bind protein phosphatase catalytic subunits PP2A, PP4, and PP6 (27Gingras A.C. Caballero M. Zarske M. Sanchez A.

We found that TIP bound type 2 phosphatases in a yeast two-hybrid assay and noted that it showed preferential binding to the C-terminal region of PP6 (residues 177–305) compared with PP2A. Because PP6 dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1 kinase (21Kajino T. Ren H. Iemura S. Natsume T. Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39891-39896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we tested whether overexpression of this PP6-binding protein (which we called TAB4) would affect TAK1. Activation of TAK1 and its substrate IKKβ were assayed in whole cell extracts by immunoblotting with phosphosite-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). Neither TAK1 nor IKKβ were phosphorylated in cells transfected with FLAG-TAK1 alone (lane 1) or T7-TAB1 alone (lane 2). However, cells co-expressing FLAG-TAK1 with T7-TAB1 exhibited phospho-TAK1, with retarded migration of the FLAG-TAK1, and increased phosphorylation of endogenous IKKβ (lane 3). Compared with this, co-expression with HA-TAB4 (lane 6) caused more reduced migration of FLAG-TAK1 and greatly increased the phosphorylation of endogenous IKKβ at Ser177/Ser181 with appearance of multiple IKK bands presumably due to other sites of phosphorylation. Co-expression of TAB4 with either FLAG-TAK1 alone (lane 4) or T7-TAB1 alone (lane 5) as controls did not induce phosphorylation of either TAK1 or IKKβ. This shows TAB1 dependence of TAK1 activation by TAB4, the same as for activation of TAK1 by TAB2/3. The effects were specific for TAB4 and not mimicked by overexpression of another PP2A/PP4/PP6-binding protein, α-4 (Fig. 1A). HA-α-4 was expressed with FLAG-TAK1 (lane 7) or T7-TAB1 (lane 8) but produced no increase in phospho-TAK1, no gel shift of FLAG-TAK1, and no detectable phospho-IKKβ. Triple expression of HA-α-4, FLAG-TAK1, and T7-TAB1 (lane 9) was no different from dual expression of FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 (lane 3). The level of HA-α-4 expressed in these controls was even higher than the levels of HA-TAB4 in parallel samples based on anti-HA immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6 and 7–9). Together these results showed that TAB4 expression enhanced TAB1-dependent TAK1 phosphorylation and TAK1 activity toward the endogenous substrate IKKβ.FIGURE 2Phosphorylation sites in TAK1 and TAB1. Phosphorylation sites in TAK1 (top) and TAB1 (bottom) are shown as vertical lines, and those sites significantly increased by co-expression of TAB4 are indicated with a P above the boxes.

FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 were expressed in HEK293T cells with and without HA-TAB4, and complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 beads. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-T7 showed reduced mobility of both TAK1 and TAB1 proteins due to TAB4 co-expression (Fig. 1B; also see Fig. 3A below). Incubation of immunoprecipitates with increasing amounts of recombinant λ-phosphatase-MBP fusion protein dephosphorylated both FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 as evident from their increased mobility (Fig. 1B). After dephosphorylation by MBP-λ-phosphatase the FLAG-TAK1 and T7-TAB1 had the same mobility whether they originated from cells expressing or not expressing TAB4. This demonstrated that the extra reduced mobility of TAK1 and TAB1 during co-expression with TAB4 was due to phosphorylation. We noted that migration of TAB4 itself in SDS-PAGE was not affected by co-expression with TAK1-TAB1 or incubation with MBP-λ-phosphatase, suggesting that it was not phosphorylated. The results demonstrate that TAB4 increased phosphorylation and kinase activity of TAK1-TAB1 complexes. Phosphorylation sites in both TAK1 and TAB1 induced by co-expression of TAB4 were mapped by mass spectrometry. Cells were transfected to express TAK1-TAB1 with and without TAB4, FLAG-TAK1 complexes were immunoprecipitated, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by a linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) (Table 1). A total of at least 16 phosphorylation sites were identified in FLAG-TAK1, including the well known sites at Thr184, Thr187, and Ser192 in the kinase activation loop (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of 14 sites in T7-TAB1 were identified. Co-expression of TAB4 induced a significant increase (>5-fold) in phosphorylation of at least four sites in TAK1: 1) residue Thr344 in peptide residues 331–347; 2) peptide 373–386 with residues Ser374, Ser375, and Ser382; 3) peptide 388–398 containing residues Ser389 and Ser393; and 4) peptide 412–429 containing residues Ser412, Thr421, and Ser428. These all mapped to a region C-terminal to the kinase domain (Fig. 2). Likewise co-expression of TAB4 significantly increased at least two sites of phosphorylation in TAB1: 1) peptide 364–386 containing phosphorylated residues Ser273 and Ser278 and 2) peptide 464–477 phosphorylated at residue Ser464 or Ser469. Thus, TAB4 co-expression significantly increased phosphorylation of specific sites in both TAK1 and TAB1.TABLE 1Phosphopeptide analysis of TAK1 and TAB1 by mass spectrometrySitesPeptidesaPeptides with significantly increased phosphorylation (>5-fold) determined by peak area from co-expression of TAB4 are in boldface font.SequencebListing of TAK1 and TAB1 phosphopeptides detected in single letter code.

Based on morphological and molecular studies, Merkel cells are proposed to be mechanosensory cells that signal afferents via neurotransmission; however, functional studies testing this hypothesis in intact skin have produced conflicting results. To test this model in a simplified system, we asked whether purified Merkel cells are directly activated by mechanical stimulation. Cell shape was manipulated with anisotonic solution changes and responses were monitored by Ca2+ imaging with fura-2. We found that hypotonic-induced cell swelling, but not hypertonic solutions, triggered cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients. Several lines of evidence indicate that these signals arise from swelling-activated Ca2+-permeable ion channels. First, transients were reversibly abolished by chelating extracellular Ca2+, demonstrating a requirement for Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Second, Ca2+ transients were initially observed near the plasma membrane in cytoplasmic processes. Third, voltage-activated Ca2+ channel (VACC) antagonists reduced transients by half, suggesting that swelling-activated channels depolarize plasma membranes to activate VACCs. Finally, emptying internal Ca2+ stores attenuated transients by 80%, suggesting Ca2+ release from stores augments swelling-activated Ca2+ signals. To identify candidate mechanotransduction channels, we used RT-PCR to amplify ion-channel transcripts whose pharmacological profiles matched those of hypotonic-evoked Ca2+ signals in Merkel cells. We found 11 amplicons, including PKD1, PKD2, and TRPC1, channels previously implicated in mechanotransduction in other cells. Collectively, these results directly demonstrate that Merkel cells are activated by hypotonic-evoked swelling, identify cellular signaling mechanisms that mediate these responses, and support the hypothesis that Merkel cells contribute to touch reception in the Merkel cell-neurite complex."
https://openalex.org/W2080916540,"To reveal insight into the initiation of mammalian O-mannosylation in vivo, recombinant glycosylation probes containing sections of human α-dystroglycan (hDG) were expressed in epithelial cell lines. We demonstrate that O-mannosylation within the mucin domain of hDG occurs preferentially at Thr/Ser residues that are flanked by basic amino acids. Protein O-mannosylation is independent of a consensus sequence, but strictly dependent on a peptide region located upstream of the mucin domain. This peptide region cannot be replaced by other N-terminal peptides, however, it is not sufficient to induce O-mannosylation on a structurally distinct mucin domain in hybrid constructs. The presented in vivo evidence for a more complex regulation of mammalian O-mannosylation contrasts with a recent in vitro study of O-mannosylation in human α-dystroglycan peptides indicating the existence of an 18-meric consensus sequence. We demonstrate in vivo that the entire region p377–417 is necessary and sufficient for O-mannosylation initiation of hDG, but not of MUC1 tandem repeats. The feature of a doubly controlled initiation process distinguishes mammalian O-mannosylation from other types of O-glycosylation, which are largely controlled by structural properties of the substrate positions and their local peptide environment.

The feature of a doubly controlled initiation process distinguishes mammalian O-mannosylation from other types of O-glycosylation, which are largely controlled by structural properties of the substrate positions and their local peptide environment. The posttranslational modification of proteins by O-glycosylation meanwhile represents a much more complex phenomenon than initially assumed. Besides the abundant mucin-type O-glycosylation, which is characterized by serine- or threonine-linked O-GalNAc (1Hanisch F.-G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), special O-glycosylation types are found in proteoglycans (O-Xyl) (2Silbert J.E. Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 29b. Elsevier Science B. V, Amsterdam1979: 1-31Google Scholar) and collagens (O-Gal) (3Butler W.T. Cunningham L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3882-3888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another series of more transient, substoichiometric modifications with regulatory function, like the core glycosylation with O-Fuc (4Klinger M.M. Laine R.A. Steiner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7932-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and O-GlcNAc (5Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), were discovered during the last two decades. A further, more rare modification of hydroxylated amino acids was revealed as O-linked mannose. This type of posttranslational modification was initially regarded as restricted to yeast cells and other fungi (6Setandreu R. Northcote D.H. Carbohydrate Res. 1969; 10: 584-585Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There it is introduced into a variety of proteins with essential functions for the yeast cells, like cell wall proteins, by action of a protein mannosyltransferase family residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Google Scholar, 8Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Immervoll T.

According to current knowledge, O-mannosylation in mammalian cells is found in a limited number of proteins, among them glycoproteins of the brain, nerves, and skeletal muscle (12Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8237-8242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chiba A. Matsumura K. Yamada H. Inazu T. Shimizu T. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Kobata A.

Acta. 1998; 27: 599-606Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The only identified O-mannosylated protein is α-dystroglycan, an extracellular component of the dystrophin complex in membranes of skeletal muscle, nerves, and brain (15Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 16Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Different from yeast cells, where O-mannose is elongated by neutral, linear oligomannose chains (7Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Google Scholar), the core mannose on human α-dystroglycan shows extensions with complex glycans terminating with sialic acid or fucose. As major component a tetrasaccharide with the structure NeuAc2–3Gal1–4GlcNAc1–2Man was characterized and claimed to represent the specific ligand for interaction with the laminin G domains (13Chiba A.

Distinct forms of congenital muscle dystrophies (dystroglycanopathies) are caused by mutation defects of glycosyltransferases involved in O-mannosylation of α-dystroglycan (21Martin P.T. Glycobiology. 2003; 8: 55-66Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Michele D.E. Barresi R. Kanagawa M. Saito F. Cohn R.D. Satz J.S. Dollar J. Nishino I. Kelley R.I. Somer H. Nature. 2002; 418: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Among these the Walker-Warburg syndrome represents an autosomal recessive form of congenital muscle dystrophies that is characterized by severe brain malfunction and eye anomalies (23Muntoni F. Brockington M. Blake D.J. Torelli S. Brown S.C. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1419-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The subpopulation of Walker-Warburg syndrome patients suffers from a selective deficiency of glycosylated α-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle, which results from mutations in the POMT1/POMT2 genes and the concomitant loss of a functional O-mannosyltransferase (24Beltran-Valero de Bernabe D.

Genet. 2005; 42: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Initiation of O-mannosylation is catalyzed by two homologues of the yeast protein mannosyltransferases, the POMT1 and POMT2, which are active only on co-expression and were shown to form a functional complex (26Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 27Akasaka-Manya K. Manya H. Nakajima A. Kawakita M. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19339-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In yeast the protein mannosyltransferases are not dependent on any target sequences as they catalyze in vitro even the O-mannosylation of pentameric peptides (28Willer T. Brandl M. Sipiczki M. Strahl S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues are not active in vitro on short peptides, but recombinantly in procaryote-expressed α-dystroglycan (26Manya H. Chiba A. Yoshida A. Wang X. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Margolis R.U. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is no information available on the structural requirements for the initiation of mammalian O-mannosylation (see also below). All other forms of glycosylation are controlled by structural features of the glycosylation target sites. In the case of N-glycosylation the consensus motif Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser, which contains an asparagine residue as a potential target site, serves as a sequon in the co-translational modification of proteins (29Marshall R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 673-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Other glycosylation forms, like mucin-type O-glycosylation, are less specifically controlled by structural qualities of the substrate (30Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L.

About 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferases with cell-specific expression patterns transfer the O-GalNAc modification sequon-independent into serine or threonine positions of proteins, but show some degree of selectivity with overlapping site preferences (33Ten Hagen K.G. Fritz T.A. Tabak L.A. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Also the acceptor site for O-GlcNAc does not display a definite consensus sequence. However, the fuzzy motif is marked by the close vicinity of proline residues, valines, and a downstream tract of serines, whereas other amino acids, like leucines and glutamines are disfavored (34Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O-Fucosylation again shows a sequon dependence by its restriction to the consensus sequence Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Gly-Ser/Thr-Cys within epidermal growth factor domains (4Klinger M.M. Laine R.A. Steiner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7932-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent in vitro study has revealed evidence that mammalian O-mannosylation could be dependent on a consensus sequence (35Manya H. Suzuki T. Akasaka-Manya K. Ishida H.K. Mizuno M. Suzuki Y. Inazu T. Dohmae N. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20200-20206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, based on this postulated sequon in human α-dystroglycan (hDG) 2The abbreviations used are: hDG, human α-dystroglycan; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; CID, collision-induced dissociation. no other proteins could be identified in a BLAST search as potentially O-mannosylated. Although initiation of glycosylation appears to be generally determined by structural properties of the substrate position, we revealed evidence in vivo for the existence of further control mechanisms involved in the initiation of mammalian O-mannosylation. We provide experimental support for the hypothesis that O-mannosylation is cis-controlled by upstream located peptide regions, which determine potential mucin-type O-glycosylation sites as O-Man targets in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the substrate sites themselves also control the initiation of O-mannosylation by specific structural features. Identification of the structural requirements for O-mannosylation and the modified sites may enable the discovery of other proteins with potential O-mannosylation and hence reveal insight into the functional networks, in which this largely unexplored modification is involved. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the grade “pro analysi.” Exceptions are marked in the text. Proteins were handled at +4 °C, long time storage was at -20 °C. Cells and Cell Culture—Cell culture work was performed with media and plasticware from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Human embryonic kidney cell line EBNA-293 (Invitrogen) and mouse myoblast cell line C2F3 (kindly provided by Dr. U. Hartmann, Institute of Biochemistry II, University of Cologne) were cultivated at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 5 (EBNA) or 20% (C2F3) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was performed using the Superfect lipofection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Transfected cells were cultivated in the presence of 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The supernatant was collected for purification of the recombinant proteins. Generation of Glycosylation Probes—Glycosylation probes were amplified by PCR on a DNA Thermo-Cycler (Hybaid MBS, Thermo, Egelsbach, Germany) from EST clone 7309805 (Invitrogen). We used 1 ng of cDNA, 6.25 nm dNTPs (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), 25 pmol of sense and antisense primer, respectively (BioTeZ, Berlin, Germany), 1 unit of Taq Polymerase (Qiagen), and 2.5 μl of Taq buffer in a volume of 25 μl. The temperature program was: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 times for 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 20 s at 68 °C with a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. To the probes hDG1–hDG11 the restriction sites NheI (5′) and BglII (3′) were added simultaneously with the indicated primer pairs listed in supplemental Table S1. To the DNA of fusion proteins hDGdel1 and hDGdel2, containing two separate parts of dystroglycan, the restriction sites NheI (5′) and EcoRV (3′) were added to the N-terminal DNA part (A in supplemental Table 1) and EcoRV (5′) and BglII (3′) sites were added to the C-terminal part (B in supplemental Table S1). Amplified cDNA was cloned in one step into a modified version of the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP-PU (pCEP4) via the restriction sites (5′ → 3′) NheI, EcoRV, and BamHI/BglII. The vector has an N-terminal BM40 secretion signal, a cytomegalovirus promotor, and a C-terminal strepII as well as a His8 tag. For selection of transfected cells the vector contains an ampicillin and a puromycin resistance gene. Enzymatic digestion of the amplified cDNA and the vector pCEP-PU with restriction endonucleases BamHI, BglII, EcoRV, and NheI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) was done according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoreses on a 1% agarose gel with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Invitrogen). The DNA was eluted from the gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Ligation was performed with the T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α according to standard protocols. Transformed bacteria were selected overnight on LB-broth agar plates (Invitrogen) containing 200 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Amplification occurred overnight in LB-broth liquid medium (Invitrogen) with ampicillin in a 37 °C shaker. The DNA was purified by using a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). The dystroglycan part of the hybrid fusion proteins was amplified by PCR (supplemental Table S1) with restriction sites NheI (5′) and EcoRV (3′) added simultaneously. The DNA of the tandem repeat domain of a MUC1 construct (36Müller S. Hanisch F.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26103-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was isolated with the restriction enzymes EcoRV (3′) and BamHI (5′). Both DNA fragments were cloned in one step into the vector pCEP-PU as described above. For the hybrid fusion protein MUC1-hDG the N-terminal domain of MUC1 was amplified and cloned N-terminal to a section of the dystroglycan mucin domain via restriction sites (5′ → 3′) NheI, EcoRV, and BamHI/BglII. Isolation of Recombinant Proteins from Cell Culture Supernatant—The recombinant fusion proteins were purified from the cell culture supernatant by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by reversed phase HPLC as described in Ref. 37Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.-G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Isolation of the MUC1-VNTR Region of hDG-MUC1–3—The protein was digested with trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 for 16 h at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC as described in Ref. 37Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.-G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar with a different gradient (8–20% acetonitrile during 20 min, followed by 20–28% acetonitrile during 1 min and 28–48% during 20 min). Fractions were collected every minute. HPLC fractions containing the VNTR domain were identified by dot blot and detection with the anti-MUC1 tandem repeat-specific C595 antibody (37Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.-G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The absence of dystroglycan-derived peptides was proved by MALDI-MS on a REFLEX IV mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) and with positive ion detection in the reflection mode. As matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Bruker Daltonics) (40 mg/ml in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2:1) was applied onto a stainless steel target. The spectra were analyzed with the Flex Analysis software. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS gels were either stained with silver or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protan BA 83, Schleicher & Schuell) in a semi-dry transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). The fusion proteins were detected with anti-strepII mouse IgG (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). Protein-antibody conjugates were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). Monosaccharide Composition and Identification of the Core Sugar—Monosaccharide composition was determined by GC/MS of the trimethylsilylated 1-O-methylglycosides (38Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) on a Fison MD800 GC/MS (Thermo Fisher, Dreieich, Germany), equipped with a 15-m RTX5-SILMS column (Restek, Bad Homburg, Germany). After an isothermal phase at the initial temperature (100 °C, 1 min), a gradient of 6 °C/min up to 260 °C was used. MS spectra were registered by electron impact ionization at 70 eV. Relative masses between m/z 100 and 700 were scanned every second at 400 V. To identify the core sugar, the glycan chains were released from the protein by reductive β-elimination. For this purpose the glycoproteins were incubated with 0.5 m NaBH4 in 50 mm NaOH for 18 h at 50 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of acetic acid. Salt was removed with 50 μl of Dowex 50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) in a batch procedure. Excessive borate was codistilled as methylester in a stream of nitrogen by adding several 0.1-ml aliquots of 1% acetic acid in methanol. Permethylation of Glycan Alditols—Permethylation of the glycan chains, released by reductive β-elimination, was done as described by Ciucanu and Kerek (39Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Glycan Analysis by Collision-induced Dissociation-Electrospray (Q-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometric data were acquired in the positive ion mode on a QTOF2 (Waters, Dreieich, Germany) by static nanospray application of the methylated glycans according to Ref. 37Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.-G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Linkage Analysis of Glycans—Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples according to Ref. 37Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Müller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.-G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and analyzed by GC/MS on a 15-m RTX5-SILMS column (Restek) with an initial temperature of 60 °C. The gradient was from 60 to 100 °C with 40 °C/min followed by 10 °C/min up to 280 °C. Masses were scanned between 100 and 450 Da. Glycopeptide Analysis by Collision-induced Dissociation-(CID) Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Prior to trypsin digestion (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) the glycoproteins were either partially deglycosylated by successive incubation with the exoglycosidases neuraminidase (Clostridium perfringens, New England Biolabs), β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (both Jack Bean, GLYKO, ProZyme, Nils, IL), or chemically desialylated in 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid by heating for 1 h at 80 °C. The exoglycosidases were removed by reverse phase HPLC on a C8 column (see “Purification of Recombinant Proteins”) before trypsin digestion. ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed on a PTMDiscovery System (HCT-Ultra, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) coupled with an online nano-LC system (Ultimate, LC-Packings, Dionex, Idstein, Germany) and a PepMap C18 column (75 μm inner diameter, 5 cm). Ions were scanned with 8100 atomic mass units/s in a range of m/z 300–2500 in MS mode and m/z 100–3000 in MS/MS mode. MS/MS spectra were generated by CID (helium) fragmentation. To search specifically for O-mannosylated glycan structures, in the first run the CID fragmentation pattern was generated to search for characteristic fragment ions or patterns. In a second run, MS/MS spectra of selected ions were generated by using preferred mass lists and time segments. In Vitro Glycosylation Studies—In vitro glycosylation with O-GalNAc was performed according to Ref. 32Hanisch F.-G. Reis C.A. Clausen H. Paulsen H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar with slight modifications. We used 5 μg of the synthetic peptide in 25 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MnCl2 and 200 μm UDP-GalNAc together with 2.5 μl of the semipurified GalNAc-transferases rGalNAc-T1 and -T2 (32Hanisch F.-G. Reis C.A. Clausen H. Paulsen H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and stopped with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. (Glyco) Peptides were analyzed by MALDI-MS as described above. Generation and Expression of Recombinant Glycosylation Probes—In an attempt to localize the structural elements required for O-mannosylation we followed a recombinant approach that was based on glycosylation probes corresponding to sections of human α-dystroglycan (Fig. 1). Ten recombinant hDG probes (truncation and deletion constructs) and three hybrid hDG-MUC1 probes were generated that comprised the entire hDG mucin domain (p418–536, defined by clusters of Ser/Thr and a high Pro content) or truncated versions thereof and N-terminal sequence stretches p286–417 of different lengths. The largest probe, hDG1, contained the entire mucin domain (p418–536) and the N-terminal sequence p286–417 (Fig. 1). All fusion proteins contained an N-terminal secretion signal peptide BM40/SPARC and C-terminal His8 tags as well as strepII to facilitate their isolation from culture supernatants and their detection in Western blots. The probes were successfully expressed in the human kidney cell line EBNA-293 and isolated from culture supernatant. Three recombinant probes (hDG2 to hDG4) were expressed at very low levels and could not be included into the structural analyses. Two constructs were derived from hDG8 by deletion of peptide stretches (Fig. 1): hDGdel1 lacks amino acids p392–417, and hDGdel2 lacks an extended strand-peptide upstream of the mucin domain (p368–376). The hybrid fusion proteins contained amino acids p286–346 (hDG-MUC1–1), p286–393 (hDG-MUC1–2), and p286–418 (hDG-MUC1–3) of human α-dystroglycan fused to six tandem repeats of human MUC1, or the N-terminal sequence of human MUC1 (p23–100), fused to p393 to p504 of α-dystroglycan, corresponding to the probe hDG5 (MUC1-hDG) (Fig. 1). All hybrid fusion proteins were cloned into the pCEP-PU vector and expressed as described above. As the dystroglycan part of hDG-MUC1–3 corresponds to hDG11 it was expected to be O-mannosylated. To analyze the MUC1 part separately, the protein was digested with trypsin and the VNTR-derived peptides were isolated by reverse phage HPLC. Purification of the Proteins—The secreted proteins were purified from 1 liter of cell culture supernatant by immobilized nickel-affinity chromatography followed by reversed phase chromatography on a C8-silica column (Fig. 2). Homogeneity and identity of the proteins was proven by silver staining of SDS gels and Western blot analyses with a monoclonal anti-strepII antibody (supplemental Fig. S1). No contaminating proteins were detectable and the silver-stained bands were demonstrated to be isographic with strep-tagged proteins. The glycosylation profiles of the probes were then analyzed by GC-MS and ESI-MS/MS with respect to sugar composition, the identity of the reducing sugar, and the sequence of the oligosaccharides (Fig. 2). Monosaccharide Analysis and Identification of the Core Sugar—The monosaccharide compositions were analyzed by GC/MS. To identify the sugars (mannose, Man; galactose, Gal; N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc; N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc; N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) selected ion traces of the total ion chromatogram were used. Alternatively, selected ion monitoring was applied at the respective relative masses (m/z 173: HexNAc, m/z 204: Hex, m/z 319: Hex-ol, m/z 378: HexNAc-ol). Analysis of the probes indicated the presence of two different types of glycans (Table 1). Probes hDG5, hDG7, and hDG9 showed a monosaccharide composition consistent with the exclusive expression of mucin-type glycans (NeuAc, Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc) based on GalNAc as the core sugar. Glycans in probes hDG1, hDG6, hDG8, hDG10, and hDG11 were composed of the same monosaccharides, but additionally contained mannose. As core sugars in the latter probes we identified Man-ol beside GalNAc-ol, indicating the presence of two different glycosylation types on the same protein, i.e. glycans based on core Man and on core GalNAc (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table 1). In summary, probes containing N-terminal peptide region p286–417 or sections thereof (p346–417) were apparently O-mannosylated, whereas probes starting at amino acid p393 were exclusively modified with mucin-type O-glycans (Table 1).TABLE 1Glycan composition dataProbeMan/Man-olGalGalNAcGalNAc-olGlcNAchDG1xxxxxhDG5xxxxhDG6xxxxxhDG7xxxxhDG8xxxxxhDG9xxxxhDG10xxxxxhDG11xxxxxhDGdel1xxxxhDGdel2xxxxxhDG-MUC1–1xxxxhDG-MUC1–2xxxxhDG-MUC1–3xxxxxhDG-MUC1–3 tryptic MUC1 glycopeptidesxxxxMUC1-hDGxxxx Open table in a new tab The hybrid fusion proteins hDG-MUC1–1, hDG-MUC1–2, and MUC1-hDG were modified exclusively with mucin-type O-glycans. The same holds true for hDGdel1, whereas hDGdel2 and hDG-MUC1–3 were mannose positive (Table 1). However, mannose on hDG-MUC1–3 was, however, restricted to the dystroglycan part of the hybrid fusion protein, because tryptic glycopeptides derived from the MUC1 tandem repeat domain were shown to be mannose negative (Table 1). Sorbitol was present as a contaminant in all chromatograms and should originate from chromatographic matrices. We tested a possible epimerization of glucose to mannose by adding glucose to a mannose-free glycoprotein standard and subjecting this mixture to the reductive β-elimination protocol followed by methanolysis. In the GC/MS chromatogram of this sample we could not detect any mannose or mannitol, indicating that the mannose detected in α-dystroglycan probes was not an artifact. Oligosac"

The ETO family represents a group of highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulatory proteins that are components of a diverse range of multiprotein repressor complexes. ETO proteins function as transcriptional repressors by interacting with a number of transcription factors that bind to their cognate consensus DNA binding sequences within the promoters of target genes. We previously reported that the classical C2H2 zinc finger DNA-binding protein, ZNF652, specifically and functionally interacts with the ETO protein CBFA2T3 and has a role in the suppression of breast oncogenesis. Here we report the identification and validation of the ZNF652 consensus DNA binding sequence. Our results show that the E-box gene HEB is a direct target of CBFA2T3-ZNF652-mediated transcriptional repression. The CBFA2T3-ZNF652 complex regulates HEB expression by binding to a single ZNF652 response element located within the promoter sequence of HEB. This study also shows that the NHR3 and NHR4 domains of CBFA2T3 interact with a conserved proline-rich region located within the C terminus of ZNF652. Our results, together with previous reports, indicate that HEB has a complex relationship with CBFA2T3; CBFA2T3 interacts with ZNF652 to repress HEB expression, and in addition CBFA2T3 interacts with the HEB protein to inhibit its activator function. These findings suggest that CBFA2T3-ZNF652-mediated HEB regulation may play an important role in hematopoiesis and myogenesis.

These findings suggest that CBFA2T3-ZNF652-mediated HEB regulation may play an important role in hematopoiesis and myogenesis. Gene regulation occurs through the balanced activity of transcriptional activators and repressors and is critical for the ordered development and maintenance of homeostasis. Inherited or acquired defects in transcription factor structure and function can result in irreversible alterations in this balance. The ensuing aberrant expression of target genes can lead to developmental abnormalities or to the initiation and promotion of cancer (1Benz C.C. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 1998; 5: 271-282Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Spatial and temporal gene regulation by transcriptional activation has been intensely investigated, whereas the critical role of transcriptional repression in development and disease has only been recently recognized (2Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 689-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBFA2T1 (RUNX1T1, MTG8) together with CBFA2T2 (MTGR1) and CBFA2T3 (MTG16) form a group of ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulatory proteins called the “ETO” family. The ETO proteins have modular structures and are characterized by the presence of four regions, NHR1 to NHR4, so named because of their homology to the Drosophila nervy protein (3Feinstein P.G. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Mann R.S. Genetics. 1995; 140: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ETO proteins are primarily nuclear-localized and are capable of oligomerization and interaction with other proteins through their NHR 2The abbreviations used are: NHR, nervy homology region; AML, acute myleloid leukemia; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Gfi-1, growth factor independence 1; HA, hemagglutinin; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HEB, HeLa E-box-binding protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HuT78, human T-lymphoblastoid; Luc, luciferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MT, mutant; MYND, Myeloid-Nervy-DEAF-1; N-CoR, nuclear receptor co-repressor; RE, response element; SCL, stem cell leukemia; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor; TK, thymidine kinase; WT, wild type; ZNF652, zinc finger protein 652. domains (4Kitabayashi I.

The NHR1 (also called eTAFH) domain of CBFA2T1 has been shown to bind the repression domain I of nuclear receptor co-repressor N-CoR in vitro and repress transcription in a reporter assay (7Lausen J. Cho S. Liu S. Werner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49281-49288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NHR1 also mediates ETO interactions with a conserved activation domain of the E-box proteins HEB and E2A and inhibits their transactivation functions (8Zhang J. Kalkum M. Yamamura S. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Science. 2004; 305: 1286-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the NHR1 motif can interchange negative and positive coregulatory proteins to control transcription (9Wei Y. Liu S. Lausen J. Woodrell C. Cho S. Biris N. Kobayashi N. Yokoyama S. Werner M.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second domain, NHR2, is described as a hydrophobic heptad repeat domain and is required for homo- and heterotetramerization of the ETO proteins (6Liu Y. Cheney M.D. Gaudet J.J. Chruszcz M. Lukasik S.M. Sugiyama D. Lary J. Cole J. Dauter Z. Minor W. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 249-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The tetramerization of the ETO proteins is not essential for interaction with the corepressors N-CoR, SMRT, mSin3A, and HDAC1-3. However, NHR2-mediated tetramerization of the AML1-CBFA2T1 fusion protein contributes to the development of leukemia in t(8:21) translocation carriers (6Liu Y. Cheney M.D. Gaudet J.J. Chruszcz M.

The third domain in CBFA2T1, NHR3, has been shown to interact with the regulatory subunit of type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA RIIα) in lymphocytes (10Fukuyama T. Sueoka E. Sugio Y. Otsuka T. Niho Y. Akagi K. Kozu T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6225-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The last of these domains, NHR4, also called the MYND (Myeloid-Nervy-DEAF-1) domain, contains two nonclassical zinc fingers and, in conjunction with NHR1 and NHR3, interacts with the corepressor N-CoR (7Lausen J. Cho S. Liu S. Werner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49281-49288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, the NHR4 domain of CBFA2T1 also directly interacts with SMRT (5Zhang J. Hug B.A. Huang E.Y. Chen C.W. Gelmetti V. Maccarana M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Chen W. Gaudet J. Cheney M.D. Roudaia L. Cierpicki T. Klet R.C. Hartman K. Laue T.M. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H.

Consistent with the role of the ETO proteins in transcriptional repression, NHR2, NHR3, and NHR4 also interact with various members of the HDAC family. CBFA2T1 is the most studied of the ETO proteins because of its involvement in the non-random t(8;21) translocations that are frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The t(8;21) in AML generates an in-frame fusion of the coding sequences of the N-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding domain of AML1 (also called RUNX1) with almost the entire CBFA2T1 encoding region, leading to a chimeric AML1-CBFA2T1 protein (14Hug B.A. Lazar M.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AML1 normally functions as an activator of transcription, but when fused with CBFA2T1, it acts as a repressor. The resulting changes in gene expression are thought to be the basis for the development of leukemia. The ETO protein CBFA2T3 is also involved in a recurrent t(16;21) translocation with AML1 and is associated with therapy-related myeloid malignancy (15Gamou T. Kitamura E. Hosoda F. Shimizu K. Shinohara K. Hayashi Y. Nagase T. Yokoyama Y. Ohki M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies in mice have been utilized to determine the normal cellular role of the ETO family of proteins, although the observed phenotypes may be influenced by functional complementation between the ETO family members. Studies of knock-out mice show that Cbfa2t1 plays a critical role in gut development (16Calabi F. Pannell R. Pavloska G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas Cbfa2t2 is required for maintenance of the secretory cell lineage in the small intestine (17Amann J.M. Chyla B.J. Ellis T.C. Martinez A. Moore A.C. Franklin J.L. McGhee L. Meyers S. Ohm J.E. Luce K.S. Ouelette A.J. Washington M.K. Thompson M.A. King D. Gautam S. Coffey R.J. White-head R.H. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9576-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further clues regarding the normal function of the ETO proteins have been obtained through their interacting proteins. CBFA2T1 regulates early adipogenesis by inhibiting transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ, a member of the C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) family of leucine zipper transcription factors (18Rochford J.J. Semple R.K. Laudes M. Boyle K.B. Christodoulides C. Mulligan C. Lelliott C.J. Schinner S. Hadaschik D. Mahadevan M. Sethi J.K. Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both CBFA2T1 and CBFA2T3 have been shown to interact with the corepressor ATN1 (19Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K. Zhang C. Wang J. Kim Y. Schilling G. Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An expansion of a polyglutamine repeat within the ATN1 protein is associated with the neurodegenerative disease dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) (19Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K. Zhang C. Wang J. Kim Y. Schilling G. Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As a component of multiprotein complexes, CBFA2T3 has been shown to coordinate cellular proliferation and differentiation during erythropoiesis (20Goardon N. Lambert J.A. Rodriguez P. Nissaire P.

CBFA2T3 is located in the 16q24.3 loss-of-heterozygosity region in breast cancer, and our functional studies are consistent with a role of CBFA2T3 as a breast cancer tumor suppressor (22Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Cornelisse C. Whitmore S.A. Crawford J.

We have previously shown that loss, or reduced levels, of CBFA2T3 expression is associated with breast oncogenesis (22Kochetkova M. McKenzie O.L. Bais A.J. Martin J.M. Secker G.A. Seshadri R. Powell J.A. Hinze S.J. Gardner A.E. Spendlove H.E. O'Callaghan N.J. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Cornelisse C. Whitmore S.A. Crawford J. Kremmidiotis G. Sutherland G.R. Callen D.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4599-4604PubMed Google Scholar). CBFA2T3 has also been shown to interact with the soluble intracellular domain, termed s80, of ERBB4 and to have a role in ERBB4-dependent differentiation (24Linggi B. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25373-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reporter assays have shown ERBB4 also regulates CBFA2T3-mediated transcriptional repression. ERBB4 and CBFA2T3 are both expressed in normal breast tissue, and changes in their levels are associated with breast cancer. Interaction between CBFA2T3 and ERBB4 may therefore have an important role in the normal development of the mammary gland, and their deregulation may lead to breast cancer (24Linggi B. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25373-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the whole, although the original description of the ETO family was based on their involvement in leukemia, these proteins have now been shown to have a range of other functions (14Hug B.A. Lazar M.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ETO proteins act as transcriptional repressors by forming multiprotein complexes with the corepressor proteins N-CoR, SMRT, mSin3A, and ATN1, which act as scaffolds for recruiting various combinations of HDACs (14Hug B.A. Lazar M.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The recruited HDACs are critical for the potent repressor function of the ETO complexes (14Hug B.A. Lazar M.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The three ETO proteins exhibit variations in their direct interactions with HDACs, with CBFA2T1 interacting directly with HDAC1, -2, and -3 (25Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), CBFA2T2 only with HDAC3 (17Amann J.M. Chyla B.J. Ellis T.C. Martinez A.

Gene-specific repression by ETO-containing multiprotein complexes is mediated through their interaction with transcription factors that can bind directly to the promoters of target genes. These DNA-binding transcription factors are predominantly classical C2H2 zinc finger proteins. It is remarkable that all of the identified ETO-interacting DNA-binding zinc finger proteins are involved in cancer. For example, BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6 protein) is frequently translocated and mutated in diffuse large cell lymphoma (26Chevallier N. Corcoran C.M. Lennon C. Hyjek E. Chadburn A. Bard-well V.J.

The zinc finger protein Gfi-1 is required for the development of neuroendocrine cells, sensory neurons, and both T- and B-lymphocytes (28Kazanjian A. Gross E.A. Grimes H.L. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 59: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Germ-line mutations in the Gfi-1 coding sequence are associated with severe congenital neutropenia or non-immune chronic idiopathic neutropenia in adults (29Person R.E. Li F.Q. Duan Z. Benson K.F. Wechsler J. Papadaki H.A. Eliopoulos G. Kaufman C. Bertolone S.J. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Grimes H.L. Horwitz M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recent findings also suggest that Gfi-1 can act as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene (28Kazanjian A. Gross E.A. Grimes H.L. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Therefore, the ETO family of proteins generates a diverse constellation of transcriptional repressor complexes through interaction with various transcription factors and corepressors. We have recently shown that the classical C2H2 zinc finger DNA-binding protein ZNF652 specifically and functionally interacts with the ETO protein CBFA2T3 to repress transcription (31Kumar R.

ZNF652 has seven classical C2H2 zinc finger motifs conforming to the consensus CX2CX12HX3H sequence, with three of these joined by part or all of a consensus TGEKP linker sequence, suggesting a role as a DNA-binding protein (32Wolfe S.A.

As an approach to discovering ZNF652 target genes, we have identified the ZNF652 consensus DNA binding sequence and subsequently have determined that the promoter of the HEB gene contains a functional ZNF652 DNA binding motif. We present data that HEB expression is regulated by the CBFA2T3-ZNF652 repressor complex. In addition, we also have determined the minimal interaction domains for ZNF652 and CBFA2T3. Cell Lines and Antibodies—HEK293T, CHO, HuT78, Jurkat (human T-cell leukemia), MCF7 and ZR75-1 (breast cancer), and HeLa (cervical carcinoma) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in the recommended media at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Antibodies used were: rabbit affinity-purified anti-ZNF652 (31Kumar R. Manning J. Spendlove H.E. Kremmidiotis G. McKirdy R. Lee J. Millband D.N. Cheney K.M. Stampfer M.R. Dwivedi P.P. Morris H.A.

A rabbit polyclonal anti-CBFA2T3 antibody was generated using regions of the protein that diverged among the ETO family (15Gamou T. Kitamura E. Hosoda F. Shimizu K. Shinohara K. Hayashi Y. Nagase T. Yokoyama Y. Ohki M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4028-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBFA2T3 DNA fragments expressing amino acids 354-392 and 505-567 were combined by an overlap-PCR method and cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pET14b (Novagen). The His6-CBFA2T3-(354-392 + 505-567) protein induced from BL21pLysS bacteria harboring the expression construct was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid SuperFlow beads (Qiagen) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The rabbit polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified using bacterially expressed GST-CBFA2T3-(354-392 + 505-567) fusion protein conjugated to a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix (GE Healthcare). Plasmids—The FLAG-ZNF652 expression construct was generated by subcloning a ZNF652 open reading frame from the existing construct (31Kumar R. Manning J. Spendlove H.E. Kremmidiotis G. McKirdy R.

For co-immunoprecipitation assays, constructs expressing HA-tagged ZNF652 (full-length, amino acids 1-606), ZNF652-(243-606) (ZNF652-2), and ZNF652-(498-606) (ZNF652-4) have been reported (31Kumar R.

Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing HA-tagged ZNF652-(565-568) (PPVP→AAAA) and ZNF652-(571-574) (PPPP→AAAA) mutant proteins were generated by overlap-PCR using the following pairs of primers: ZNF652-(565-568)-mut1-F (5′-ACACCACCTTCCCATCGCAGCGGCCGCTCACCTCCCGCCACCTCCAGCTCTCT-3′), ZNF652-(565-568)-mut1-R (5′-TGGAGGTGGCGGGAGGTGAGCGGCCGCTGCGATGGGAAGGTGGTGTGGGTGGTGA-3′), ZNF652-(571-574)-mut2-F (5′-TCCCTCCAGTCCCTCACCTCGCGGCCGCAGCTGCTCTCTTTAAGAGTGAGCCTTTAAATC-3′), and ZNF652-(571-574)-mut2-R (5′-AGGCTCACTCTTAAAGAGAGCAGCTGCGGCCGCGAGGTGAGGGACTGGAGGGATGGGA-3′). To generate constructs expressing various regions of the CBFA2T3 protein, the relevant fragments of cDNA were PCR-amplified from an existing expression construct, using primers with sequence extensions that created BamHI restriction sites, and cloned into the BglII restriction site of pCMV-myc (BD Biosciences). CBFA2T3 expression constructs generated were CBFA2T3 (full-length, amino acids 1-567), CBFA2T3-(201-393) (CBFA2T3-1), CBFA2T3-(341-447) (CBFA2T3-2), CBFA2T3-(341-567) (CBFA2T3-3), and CBFA2T3-(447-567) (CBFA2T3-4). All CBFA2T3 constructs express the CBFA2T3b isoform. For the CASTing protocol, a DNA fragment encoding full-length ZNF652 was cloned in-frame into the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs). The MBP-ZNF652 fusion protein induced in DH5α bacteria carrying the expression construct was purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Myc-CBFA2T1 and Myc-CBFA2T2 expression constructs used in testing the specificity of anti-CBFA2T3 antibody were as reported earlier (31Kumar R. Manning J. Spendlove H.E. Kremmidiotis G. McKirdy R.

For luciferase reporter assays, a pGL2-4×ZNF652-TK-Luc construct carrying four tandem copies of the ZNF652 consensus binding sequence was generated by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-CGAAAGGGTTAATCGATCCGAAAGGGTTAATCGATCCGAAAGGGTTAATCGATCCGAAAGGGTTAATCCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTCGAGGATTAACCCTTTCGGATCGATTAACCCTTTCGGATCGATTAACCCTTTCGGATCGATTAACCCTTTCGGTAC-3′), and cloning at KpnI and XhoI sites located upstream of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in a pGL2-TK-Luc reporter vector (Promega). The HEB promoter region (1043 bp) containing the ZNF652 consensus DNA-binding site was amplified from the human genomic DNA with forward (5′-CACACACACACACAACGCGTCGGTCTTTACTGCACTCACTTACCTA-3′) and reverse (5′-CACACACACACACAACGCGTAATAGAACTTGTGGGTCTCTTCAG-3′) primers using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity and cloned at the MluI site of pGL3-Enhancer-Luc (hereafter called pGL3-E-Luc) reporter vector (Promega) to generate pGL3-HEB-E-Luc construct. The single ZNF652 DNA-binding site within the HEB promoter sequence was mutated by overlap-PCR to generate pGL3-HEB-mut-E-Luc.

CASTing (Cyclic Amplification and Selection of Targets) protocol—To identify ZNF652 DNA binding sequence by CASTing (34Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the bacterially expressed MBP-ZNF652 fusion protein was affinity-purified using amylose-coated resin under nondenaturing conditions. A library of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules containing 18 degenerate nucleotides flanked by known sequences was generated according to the published method (35Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, random sequence oligonucleotide 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG(N)18GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′ was annealed to 5′-GCTGCAGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC-3′ and filled in by DNA polymerase I, large fragment (Klenow) to generate a pool of dsDNA for the binding assay. This pool of dsDNA (250 ng) was incubated with 1 μg of affinity-purified MBP-ZNF652 in 1× DNA-binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 250 μg/ml BSA) in a 50-μl final volume at 4 °C for 1 h. MBP-ZNF652-DNA complexes were captured on amylose resin, eluted, and then PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GCTGCAGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG-3′ with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), initially for 2 min at 94 °C and then 15 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 10 s, and 68 °C for 10 s. The amplified DNA from each round was used for the subsequent round of binding and ZNF652-sequence specific enrichment. Five rounds of selection were performed. DNA amplified from the fifth round of selection was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned at the same restriction enzyme sites in BlueScript vector pKS(+) (Stratagene), and a total of 27 clones were sequenced. Nuclear Extracts—For nuclear extracts, nuclei from ZR75-1 breast cancer cells (4 × 107) known to express endogenous ZNF652 (31Kumar R. Manning J. Spendlove H.E. Kremmidiotis G. McKirdy R. Lee J.

Here, we investigate the similarly structured Dlk1/Gtl2 imprinted domain and show that in the mouse liver, the G/C-rich intergenic germ line-derived DMR, a sequence involved in domain-wide imprinting, is highly retained within the nuclear matrix fraction exclusively on the methylated paternal copy, reflecting its differential function on that chromosome. Therefore, not only ""classical"" A/T-rich matrix attachment region (MAR) sequences but also other important regulatory DNA elements (such as DMRs) can be recovered from genomic MAR assays following a high salt treatment. Interestingly, the recovery of one A/T-rich sequence (MAR4) from the ""nuclear matrix"" fraction is strongly correlated with gene expression. We show that this element possesses an intrinsic activity that favors transcription, and using chromosome conformation capture quantitative real time PCR assays, we demonstrate that the MAR4 interacts with the intergenic germ line-derived DMR specifically on the paternal allele but not with the Dlk1/Gtl2 promoters. Altogether, our findings shed a new light on gene regulation at this locus."

APC shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, however its role in the nucleus remains elusive. We have found that nuclear APC specifically associates with transcriptionally active chromatin through structural elements located downstream to the region of frequent truncation mutations found in colorectal tumors. We show that a recombinant APC fragment comprising such elements associates in vivo with euchromatin and preferentially binds in vitro to acetylated histone H3. Induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) stimulates accumulation of APC at the damaged DNA chromatin marked by histone H2AX and S139-phosphorylated histone H2AX. A nuclear complex containing the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs) and APC associates with chromatin in response to DNA DSB. APC knockdown with siRNA decreased the rate of DNA DSB-induced S139 histone H2AX phosphorylation in cells expressing endogenous full-length APC, but not in colon cancer cells with its truncation mutants, whereas ectopic APC expression stimulated the H2AX phosphorylation regardless of the type of endogenous APC. Our data suggest that APC involves in the DSB DNA repair and that truncation mutations impair chromatin-associated functions of APC."
https://openalex.org/W1986271315,"When cells traversing G(1) are irradiated with UV light, two parallel damage checkpoint pathways are activated: Chk1-Cdc25A and p53-p21(WAF1/CIP1), both targeting Cdk2, but the latter inducing a long lasting arrest. In similarly treated S phase-progressing cells, however, only the Cdc25A-dependent checkpoint is active. We have recently found that the p21-dependent checkpoint can be activated and induce a prolonged arrest if S phase cells are damaged with a base-modifying agent, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and cisplatin. But the mechanistic basis for the differential activation of the p21-dependent checkpoint by different DNA damaging agents is not understood. Here we report that treatment of S phase cells with MMS but not a comparable dose of UV light elicits proteasome-mediated degradation of Cdc6, the assembler of pre-replicative complexes, which allows induced p21 to bind Cdk2, thereby extending inactivation of Cdk2 and S phase arrest. Consistently, enforced expression of Cdc6 largely eliminates the prolonged S phase arrest and Cdk2 inactivation induced with MMS, whereas RNA interference-mediated Cdc6 knockdown not only prolongs such arrest and inactivation but also effectively activates the p21-dependent checkpoint in the UV-irradiated S phase cells."

SGK-1 activity is regulated on three levels: transcriptional induction following a variety of environmental and intracellular stresses, proteasomal degradation, and phosphorylation. Here we report that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent phosphorylation of SGK-1 requires formation of a complex between SGK-1 and heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Inactivation of Hsp90 by geldanamycin led to decreased SGK-1 phosphorylation independently of increased proteasomal protein degradation, and inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 appeared to eliminate SGK-1 phosphorylation at the same residues as those affected by geldanamycin treatment. Interestingly, geldanamycin-targeted phosphorylation sites were not limited to the known conserved PI3K-dependent sites Thr-256 and Ser-422 in SGK-1 but included additional unknown PI3K-dependent residues. Inhibition of Hsp90 also resulted in a complete loss of SGK-1 kinase activity, suggesting that Hsp90 activity is essential for regulating the PI3K/SGK-1 pathway."

Here, we analyzed the impact of the Val678-to-Phe substitution on Tyk2 functioning. This mutation is homologous to the Jak2 Val617-to-Phe mutation, implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. We studied ligand-independent and ligand-dependent Jak/Stat signaling in cells expressing Tyk2 V678F. Moreover, the effect of Tyk2 V678F was monitored in the context of the native heterodimeric interferon α receptor and in the context of a homodimeric receptor chimera, EpoR/R1, containing the ectodomain of the erythropoietin receptor. We show that Tyk2 V678F has increased catalytic potential in vivo and in vitro and more so when it is anchored to the homodimeric receptor. Tyk2 V678F leads to constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation but has no notable effect on the canonical interferon α-induced signaling. However, if anchored to the homodimeric EpoR/R1, the mutant confers to the cell increased sensitivity to erythropoietin.

Thus, despite the catalytic gain of function of Tyk2 V678F, the effect on ligand-induced signaling is manifest only when two mutant enzymes are juxtaposed via the homodimeric receptor. The protein tyrosine kinases of the Janus or Jak (Janus kinase) family (Tyk2, Jak1–3) initiate signaling cascades through receptors for helix-bundled cytokines. In mammals, these large enzymes are preassociated to the membrane-proximal cytosolic portion of receptors and play non-redundant functions in cytokine-regulated developmental, differentiation, and host defense processes as shown from biochemical analyses and from studies of knock-out mice (1Schindler C. Levy D.E. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20059-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The present understanding of the molecular mechanism of Jak activation is still fragmentary: some cytokines bind in a two-step process to constitutive receptor homodimers, whereas other cytokines drive dimerization of the distinct subunits of heterodimeric receptors. Conformational and rotational changes are generated and translated across the transmembrane domains so that the juxtaposed Jaks acquire a configuration suitable for trans-phosphorylation and catalytic activation. This process has been best described for the erythropoietin (Epo) 5The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; EpoR, Epo receptor; IFN, interferon; WT, wild-type; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab; IL, interleukin. and growth hormone homodimeric receptors, which activate two associated Jak2 molecules (2Brown R.J.

Instead, in heteromeric-type receptors the mode of activation of two different Jaks and their specific role remains ill defined. In all Jak proteins, three highly interdependent modules ensure proper regulation of the enzyme. The N-terminal region, comprising a FERM-related domain and a SH2-like domain, makes specific contacts with the cytosolic region of a cognate receptor. The N-terminal region is followed by two kinase folds, the centrally located KL (kinase-like) domain, also called pseudokinase or JH2, and the catalytic TK (tyrosine kinase) or JH1 domain. Upon ligand binding, the degree of activation of these enzymes is commonly monitored by the phosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the activation loop of the TK domain (4Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that the KL domain is central to the auto- and trans-regulation of Jak catalytic activity. On the one hand, it locks the enzyme in an unphosphorylated or low phosphorylated state, by possibly restricting the flexibility and the exposure of the activation loop. On the other hand, in response to cytokine stimulation, the KL domain plays a positive, though ill-defined, role in driving or stabilizing the protein toward an activated state (5Chen M. Cheng A.

This valine residue, located in the KL domain, is conserved in Jak1 and Tyk2 but not in Jak3, where it is replaced by a methionine. All findings to date are concordant in attributing a gain of function to Jak2 V617F. Similar conclusions were drawn for the corresponding Jak1 V658F and Tyk2 V678F mutants, based on their phosphorylation status and their ability to transform murine pro-B Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent cells (13Shide K.

Notably, the impact of this Val-to-Phe substitution in Jak-mediated signaling through a heterodimeric receptor has not been explored. Indeed, in this context, a mutant Jak would be juxtaposed to the wild-type (WT) form of another Jak family member. Here, we have addressed this issue by studying the functional consequences of Tyk2 V678F in type I IFN-induced signaling in human cells. The type I IFN receptor is a prototypic class 2 cytokine receptor consisting of two transmembrane chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which are not preassociated in the absence of ligand and which bind Tyk2 and Jak1, respectively (15Uze G. Schreiber G. Piehler J. Pellegrini S. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 316: 71-95PubMed Google Scholar). Using Tyk2-deficient cells, we show that the Tyk2 V678F mutant, expressed at nearly physiological level, is hyperphosphorylated and hyperactive with respect to the WT protein but has no effect on the profile of Jak1/Stat1/Stat2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) activation by IFNα. However, it does augment phosphorylation of Stat3 in a ligand-independent fashion. We have also analyzed the impact of Tyk2 V678F on signaling through an EpoR/R1 chimeric receptor forming homodimers. We demonstrate that, in this context, in addition to constitutively targeting Stat3 phosphorylation, Tyk2 V678F confers to the cell increased ligand sensitivity.

IFN sensitivity was determined by seeding 6 × 104 cells into 6-well plates in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine- or 6-thioguanine-containing medium and increasing doses of IFNα2b. After 3 days, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% methylene blue. Western Blotting and Antibodies—For Western blot analyses, cells were stimulated with IFNα (a gift of D. Gewert, Wellcome Research Laboratories) or Epo (a gift from P. Mayeux, Institut Cochin) and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (16Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Between 30 and 60 μg of proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Membranes were usually cut horizontally according to molecular size markers, and stripes were incubated with different Abs. Immunoblots were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL Western blotting reagent (Pierce) or the more sensitive Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer). Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 30 min at room temperature. The following Abs were used, unless indicated otherwise in the figure legend (all polyclonal unless indicated): anti-Tyk2 mAb T10-2 (Hybridolab, Institut Pasteur); anti-phospho-Tyr1054/Tyr1055 Tyk2 (Calbiochem); anti-phospho-Tyr1022/Tyr1023 Jak1 (BIOSOURCE); anti-Stat1, anti-Stat2, anti-phospho-Tyr689 Stat2, anti-Stat3, anti-Jak1, and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology); anti-phospho-Tyr701 Stat1, anti-phospho-Tyr705 Stat3, and anti-phospho-Tyr694 Stat5 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-Stat5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-IFNAR1 mAb 64G12 (a gift from P. Eid, CNRS). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific to phospho-Tyr292 of Tyk2 was obtained by injecting the human Tyk2 phosphorylated peptide 285QAEGEPCY-(PO3)-IRDSG298. Serum specificity was assessed by Western blotting on lysates from Tyk2-deficient cells and from several human cell lines untreated and treated with IFNα. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin. Tyk2 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of lysate using R5-7 polyclonal Abs. Beads were washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA; once with 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 200 mm NaCl; and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2). Beads were then resuspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer with or without 50 μm ATP (Fermentas). The in vitro kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 5 min in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer, and the phosphorylated products were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb and, after stripping, with the anti-Tyk2 mAb. Signals were acquired and quantified with a Kodak Image Station 440 CF. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from control or IFNα-treated cells was purified with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptions were primed with random primers and performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the TaqMan gene expression assays technology (Applied Biosystems) for IRF1 (Hs00233698-m1), 6-16 (Hs00242571-m1), and SOCS3 (Hs00269575-m1). Each sample was run in triplicate, normalized to 18 S RNA amplification levels in the same sample, and calculated relative to expression of the target gene in unstimulated cells. Tyk2 V678F Has a High Basal Autophosphorylation Activity—To study the effect of the V678F substitution, Tyk2WT and Tyk2 V678F were transiently expressed in 293T cells, and their level of phosphorylation on tyrosine was compared. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using two phospho-specific Abs, one directed to the activation loop tyrosines (Tyr1054 and Tyr1055) and the other directed to Tyr292. This latter residue is located in a stretch of 37 residues unique to the Tyk2 FERM domain and is a phosphorylation target identified in phosphoproteomic analyses (18Walters D.K. Goss V.L. Stoffregen E.P. Gu T.L. Lee K. Nardone J. McGreevey L. Heinrich M.C. Deininger M.W. Polakiewicz R. Druker B.J. Leuk. Res. 2006; 30: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Zheng H. Hu P. Quinn D.F. Wang Y.K. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using either Ab, Tyk2 V678F was found to be considerably more phosphorylated than the WT protein, despite comparable expression level (Fig. 1A). Similar data were obtained when the two proteins were transiently expressed in Tyk2-deficient 11,1 cells (Fig. 1B). To exclude a possible role for endogenous Jak1 in the basal phosphorylation of Tyk2 V678F, Jak1-deficient U4C cells were also transfected with the two constructs. Similarly, Tyk2 V678F was found to be hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 1B). These results show that the V678F mutation in the KL domain alters the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. In protein kinases, the phosphorylation state of the activation loop is a critical, though not absolute, determinant of catalytic potential. Therefore, we asked whether the hyperphosphorylation of Tyk2 V678F on the loop correlated with an augmented intrinsic autophosphorylation activity. For this and further studies, we turned to stable neoR transfectants derived from 11,1 cells. We chose clones expressing the WT and V678F at comparable levels approaching the physiological level of Tyk2 in parental 2fTGH cells. To measure the intrinsic autophosphorylation ability of WT and mutant proteins in vitro, Tyk2 was immunoprecipitated from two pairs of clones and incubated in the presence or absence of cold ATP. The reaction products were analyzed by blotting with the 4G10 mAb, and bands were quantified. As shown in Fig. 1C, the autophosphorylation activity of mutant V678F was consistently higher than that of the WT protein. Together, these results show that the V678F mutation augments Tyk2 phosphorylation on the activation loop as well as the autocatalytic potential of the enzyme. Tyk2 V678F Augments Stat3 Phosphorylation but Not the Canonical IFNα-induced Signaling—We previously reported that Tyk2 sustains the level of IFNAR1, one of the two subunits of the type I IFN receptor (20Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on this, we analyzed the content of IFNAR1 in cells stably expressing Tyk2WT (WT5 cells) or Tyk2 V678F (VF5 cells). As can be seen in Fig. 2 (bottom panels), IFNAR1 levels were similarly reconstituted, indicating that the V678F mutation in the KL domain does not impair the ability of Tyk2 to interact with the receptor. As anticipated from the transient analyses described in Fig. 1A, stably expressed Tyk2 V678F, but not Tyk2WT, was basally phosphorylated on the activation loop (Fig. 2, top panel; compare lanes 1 and 5 or lanes 9 and 14). Moreover, a notable difference between WT5 and VF5 cells concerned Stat3. Indeed, in the absence of ligand, Stat3 was weakly but detectably phosphorylated only in VF5 (Fig. 2, Stat3-P; compare lanes 1 and 5 or lanes 9 and 14). Having shown that Tyk2 V678F is catalytically more active than the WT protein (Fig. 1C), we compared the kinetic and dose-response phosphorylation profiles in WT5 and VF5 cells stimulated with IFNα. Jak1, Stat1, and Stat2 were similarly phosphorylated in the two clones, whereas Stat3 and Stat5 were somewhat more phosphorylated in VF5 cells (Fig. 2). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that Tyk2 V678F has gained the capacity to phosphorylate endogenous Stat3 in the absence of added cytokine. However, Tyk2 V678F rescues signaling through the heterodimeric IFN receptor to the same extent as the WT protein. To investigate further the impact of Tyk2 V678F, we monitored the extent of induction of IFN-stimulated genes in WT5 and VF5 cells treated for different times with 500 pm IFNα. Transcripts of SOCS3, a Stat3-dependent gene, IRF1, a Stat1-dependent gene, and 6-16, an ISGF3-dependent gene, were quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 3). The only consistent difference between the two clones was a 2-fold higher level of SOCS3 transcripts in VF5 cells treated with IFNα for 1 h. This result further supports the finding that Tyk2 V678F targets specifically Stat3. Cells were also subject to a sensitive assay (survival in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine- or 6-thioguanine-containing medium), which monitors canonical (ISGF3-mediated) IFNα response in 2fTGH-derived mutants (21Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Concordant with the above data, WT- and V678F-expressing cells showed comparable IFN sensitivity phenotypes in these media (data not shown). Tyk2 V678F Has Increased Basal Activity when Associated to a Homodimeric Receptor—It has been proposed that, when Jak2 V617F is expressed at nearly physiological levels, transformation of Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent proliferation requires co-expression of a homodimeric receptor (22Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we investigated whether the Tyk2 V678F mutant would have a stronger signaling output than the WT protein when it is anchored to a homodimeric-type receptor. To this end, we made use of 11,1 cells that express a chimeric receptor (EpoR/R1) containing the ectodomain of EpoR fused to the transmembrane and the intracellular regions of IFNAR1 (16Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These cells (denoted EpoR/R1 cl.19) were stably reconstituted with either Tyk2WT or Tyk2 V678F, and several clones were chosen based on comparable level of Tyk2 (see scheme in Fig. 4A). Moreover, we confirmed that the chosen clones expressed the same level of EpoR/R1 receptor as the parental EpoR/R1 cl.19 cells (16Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows a direct comparison of the level of phosphorylated Tyk2 in a panel of WT- or V678F-expressing clones that either lacked or expressed the EpoR/R1 chimera. In all of the clones analyzed, Tyk2WT was not phosphorylated, whereas the V678F mutant was hyperphosphorylated. Importantly, the extent of phosphorylation of the V678F mutant was consistently higher in cells expressing EpoR/R1. This result suggests that the mere presence of the homodimeric EpoR/R1 receptor boosts the already deregulated state of the mutant protein, whereas it does not affect the WT protein. The basal level of Stat3 phosphorylation in these clones was also analyzed (Fig. 4B). Irrespective of the presence of EpoR/R1, Stat3 was not phosphorylated in WT-expressing clones. On the other hand, Stat3 was phosphorylated in all V678F-expressing clones, and the presence of EpoR/R1 did not consistently enhance it. The autophosphorylation activity of WT and mutant Tyk2 anchored to EpoR/R1 was tested in vitro using two EpoR/R1 clones (WT9 and VF8). As shown in Fig. 4C, the V678F mutant in VF8 cells exhibited >14-fold increased basal activity with respect to the WT protein in WT9 cells. Thus, the impact of the V678F point mutation on the basal autophosphorylation activity of the enzyme is higher when the mutant protein is placed in the context of a cognate homodimeric receptor (compare Figs. 1C and 4C). Tyk2 V678F Confers Ligand Hypersensitivity When Associated to a Homodimeric Receptor—Having shown that the basal gain of function of Tyk2 V678F is greater when the mutated enzyme coexists with the homodimeric EpoR/R1 receptor, we investigated the consequences on Epo signaling. Basal and Epo-induced Jak/Stat phosphorylation profiles were monitored in several clones. As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of stimulation Tyk2 and Stat3 were phosphorylated in V678F-expressing clones, but not in control WT clones. In response to Epo, neither Jak1 nor Stat2 was activated (data not shown). The absence of Jak1 activation was expected because this enzyme cannot associate to the cytosolic portion of the EpoR/R1 chimera. The absence of Stat2 activation is most likely due to the lack of suitable docking sites on the chimeric receptor (16Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tyk2 and, to a lesser extent, Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 were phosphorylated in response to Epo. Importantly, the induced phosphorylation was more robust in clones expressing Tyk2 V678F than in clones expressing Tyk2WT, and this was particularly evident in the dose-response profile (Fig. 5B). Together, these results indicate that the presence of the homodimeric receptor does indeed amplify the signaling potential of the Tyk2 V678F mutant. We report here on the functional characterization of the Tyk2 V678F mutant protein expressed at near-physiological levels in the most appropriate context of Tyk2-deficient cells. This point mutation in the Tyk2 KL domain has a clear effect on the functioning of the enzyme. On the one hand, the mutation does not affect overall protein stability nor perturbs the ability of Tyk2 to sustain its cognate receptor, IFNAR1. On the other hand, the mutation has a clear (auto)activating effect, operationally defined as an increased ligand-independent (basal) phosphorylation of critical tyrosines in the activation loop both in vivo and in vitro. A direct consequence of this gain of function is the increased basal phosphorylation of Tyr292, located in the FERM domain and conserved in Tyk2 orthologues but not in other Jak family members. Although the role of Tyr292 remains elusive, we have confirmed previous evidence (18Walters D.K. Goss V.L. Stoffregen E.P. Gu T.L. Lee K. Nardone J. McGreevey L. Heinrich M.C. Deininger M.W. Polakiewicz R. Druker B.J. Leuk. Res. 2006; 30: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Zheng H. Hu P. Quinn D.F. Wang Y.K. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) of its phosphorylation in cells stimulated with IFNα. Moreover, phospho-Tyr292 results, at least in part, from autophosphorylation because it is undetected in the kinase-dead K930R mutant. 6J. Ragimbeau and S. Pellegrini, unpublished observations. We found that, when placed in the context of a cognate homodimeric-type receptor, the V678F mutant has enhanced capacity to autophosphorylate basally, whereas wild-type Tyk2 remains unaffected. We believe that this is due to the propensity of EpoR/R1 and associated kinase to form dimers even in the absence of ligand, as was described for EpoR (3Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F.

Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We infer from these findings that the V678F mutation somehow enables ligand-independent phosphorylation of the activation loop and that this effect is magnified when two mutant enzymes are juxtaposed via homodimerizing receptors. However, despite a basal catalytic gain, the V678F mutant is still “activable” upon ligand binding in either receptor context. Thus, the mutant may exist in a partially activated conformation, which is intermediate between that of a resting and a fully activated enzyme. What are the consequences of the Tyk2 V678F deregulation in terms of ligand-independent and ligand-dependent Jak/Stat signaling? An important finding is that the V678F mutant augments specifically the level of tyrosine phosphorylated Stat3 in a ligand-independent fashion and in cells that do not require cytokines for proliferation, thus ruling out the requirement of a selection step for activation of signaling. These results are concordant with previous findings obtained in 11,1 and Ba/F3 cells expressing Tyk2 V678F, TpoR, and Stat3 (14Staerk J. Kallin A. Demoulin J.B. Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells, Tyk2 V678F also activated Stat5, whereas in the cells used here a modest increment of Stat5 phosphorylation was observed only in response to IFN. We suggest that in a cell context where Stat5 can drive proliferation, further selection may occur, which leads to constitutive Stat5 activation. Interestingly, we found that Tyk2 V678F leads to an increased Stat3 phosphorylation in IFN-stimulated cells, and this correlates with enhanced early induction of the SOCS3 gene. Conversely, Tyk2 V678F has no remarkable effect on the IFN-induced phosphorylation of Jak1, Stat1, and Stat2. Indeed, the mutant rescued IFNα-induced signaling and Stat1/1- or Stat1/2-mediated gene induction to virtually the same extent as the WT protein. This result suggests that Jak1, which is juxtaposed to Tyk2 in the heterodimeric type I IFN receptor, prevails over or controls the deregulated Tyk2 mutant. This is in accordance with previous work that proposed a hierarchy of Jak function in the IFN receptor (17Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We do not know how the privileged interplay of Tyk2 V678F and Stat3 is achieved. One possibility is the direct docking of Stat3 onto hyperphosphorylated Tyk2 V678F, for instance via the phospho-Tyr292 in the FERM domain or the C-terminal Tyr1176 located in a Stat3 consensus binding site. Alternatively, Tyk2 V678F could basally phosphorylate a Stat3 docking site accessible on IFNAR1 and EpoR/R1. The analyses of the EpoR/R1 clones showed that Epo-induced signaling was robustly enhanced in the V678F context. Indeed, Tyk2WT-expressing cells never achieved the level of Epo-induced Stat phosphorylation detected in V678F-expressing cells (Fig. 5). Such"
