https://openalex.org/W3087192622,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, as sample’s viral load become low, rapid decrease in abundances of several amplicons were seen. In this report, we will show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR. Based on this, we propose 12 alternative primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network’s original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set."

However, the optimal short-arm centrifugation protocol that is effective whilst remaining tolerable has yet to be determined. Given that exposure to centrifugation is associated with presyncope and syncope and in addition motion sickness an intermittent protocol has been suggested to be more tolerable. Therefore, we assessed cardiovascular loading and subjective tolerability of daily short arm centrifugation with either an intermittent or a continuous protocol during long-term head-down bed rest as model for microgravity exposure in a mixed sex cohort. During the Artificial Gravity Bed Rest with European Space Agency (AGBRESA) 60 day 6° head down tilt bed rest study we compared the tolerability of daily +1 Gz exposure at the center of mass centrifugation, either performed continuously for 30 minutes, or intermittedly (6 x 5 minutes). Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed daily during centrifugation along with post motion sickness scoring and rate of perceived exertion. During bed rest, 16 subjects (6 women, 10 men), underwent 960 centrifuge runs in total. Ten centrifuge runs had to be terminated prematurely, 8 continuous runs and 2 intermittent runs, mostly due to pre-syncopal symptoms and not motion sickness. All subjects were, however, able to resume centrifuge training on subsequent days. We conclude that both continuous and intermittent short-arm centrifugation protocols providing artificial gravity equivalent to +1 Gz at the center of mass is tolerable in terms of cardiovascular loading and motion sickness during long-term head down tilt bed rest. However, intermittent centrifugation appears marginally better tolerated, albeit differences appear minor."
https://openalex.org/W3087196212,"Objective In the setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a potential association of this disease with stroke has been suggested. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods This is a case series of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to an academic health system in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia (USA) between March 24th, 2020 and July 17th, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described. Results Of 396 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 13 (2.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 61.6 ± 10.8 years, 10 (76.9%) male, 8 (61.5%) were Black Americans, mean time from last normal was 4.97 ± 5.1 days, and only one received acute reperfusion therapy. All 13 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic with 4 explained by atrial fibrillation. COVID-19 patients had a significantly higher rate of cryptogenic stroke than non-COVID-19 patients during the study period (69% vs 17%, p = 0.0001). Conclusions In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors at an age typically seen in non-COVID populations, and mainly affecting males and Black Americans. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes, a prolonged median time to presentation and symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for increased community awareness, early identification, and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3087120617,"The worldwide shortage of single-use N95 respirators and surgical masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many health care personnel to use their existing equipment for as long as possible. In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (cotton, polyester, silk), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Laboratory-based tests were conducted when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier for respirators and when constructed as face coverings. When used as material in these two situations, silk was more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks, and silk face coverings have the added advantage over masks such that they can be sterilized for immediate reuse. We show that silk is a hydrophobic barrier to droplets, can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning. We suggest that silk can serve as an effective material for making hydrophobic barriers that protect respirators, and silk can now be tested under clinical conditions to verify its efficacy for this function. Although respirators are still the most appropriate form of protection, silk face coverings possess properties that make them capable of repelling droplets."

There is a paucity of studies on workplace violence against doctors and its effect, in India. The present study was conducted to assess workplace violence faced by doctors, its effect on the psycho-social wellbeing of the treating doctor and, subsequently, on patient management.The present nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2019 -April 2020. The sample size was calculated assuming the prevalence of workplace violence as 50%, with 20% non-response. Doctors, working in private and/or public set-up, with ≥1 year clinical experience, were included. A pre-tested study tool- Google form-was sent to study participants via social media platforms. The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was downloaded from google drive and data was analysed using STATA-12 statistical software.A total of 617 responses were received from doctors all over India; out of which 477 (77.3%) doctors had ever faced workplace violence. ""Actual or perceived non-improvement or deterioration of patient's condition"" (40.0%), followed by ""perception of wrong treatment given"" (37.3%) were the main causes of workplace violence; and the family members/relatives were the major perpetrators (82.2%). More than half of the participants reported ""loss of self-esteem"", ""feeling of shame"" and ""stress/depression/anxiety/ideas of persecution"" after the incident. Management by surgical interventions (p-value<0.001) and handling of emergency/complicated cases (p-value<0.001) decreased significantly with an increase in severity of workplace violence; while the suggestion of investigations and referrals increased (p-value<0.001).Workplace violence has a significant effect on the psycho-social well-being of doctors, as well as on patient management; which may escalate discontent and distrust among the general public, thereby increasing incidents of workplace violence-in a self-propagating vicious cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3087065826,"Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is an essential event during liver fibrogenesis. Phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of this process. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which catalyzes DNA methylation and subsequently leads to the transcriptional repression of PTEN, is selectively induced in myofibroblasts from diseased livers. Sennoside A (SA), a major purgative constituent of senna and the Chinese herb rhubarb, is widely used in China and other Asian countries as an irritant laxative. SA is reported to improve hepatic steatosis. However, the effect and mechanism of SA on liver fibrosis remain largely unknown. We recently identified a novel strategy for protecting liver fibrosis via epigenetic modification by targeting DNMT1. A Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay first reported that SA could directly bind DNMT1 and inhibit its activity. Administration of SA significantly prevented liver fibrosis, as evidenced by the dramatic downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen alpha-1 (Col1α1) protein levels in a CCl4 -induced mouse hepatic fibrosis model and in TGF-β1-activated HSC-T6 cells, in vivo and in vitro. SA decreased the expression of Cyclin D1, CDK, and C-myc, indicating that SA may inhibit the activation and proliferation of TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6. Moreover, SA significantly promoted the expression of PTEN and remarkably inhibited the expression of p-AKT and p-ERK in vitro. Blocking PTEN or overexpressing DNMT1 could reduce the effect of SA on liver fibrosis. These data suggest that SA directly binds and inhibits the activity and that attenuated DNMT1-mediated PTEN hypermethylation caused the loss of PTEN expression, followed by the inhibition of the AKT and ERK pathways and prevented the development of liver fibrosis. Hence, SA might be employed as a promising natural supplement for liver fibrosis drug therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3087520953,"The national Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) reported the major indication for liver transplants in 2018 was for other/unknown causes. This study was undertaken to examine all causes and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among adults who received liver transplants in the past 10 years.A national cohort study of all adults who received liver transplants from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec 31, 2019 recorded in the OPTN STAR database analyzed by etiology of liver disease and HCC, and gender.Adult liver transplants increased from 5,731 in 2010 to 8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase). Between 2010 and 2014, liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C (HCV) was the major cause for liver transplantation. Proportion of liver transplants for HCV associated liver disease and HCC has since decreased to 18.7% in 2019 compared with 44.5% in 2010 [25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to 27.3%), p<0.001], while liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associated with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increased from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to 17.4%), p<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001], respectively. When all causes of liver disease were examined, only 1.7% of liver transplants had unspecified causes. The five major causes of liver disease and HCC among men receiving liver transplants in 2019 were ALD (33.1%), HCV (21.9%), NAFLD (18.5%), cholestatic liver disease (5.7%) and hepatitis B (4.9%), while the major causes among women were NAFLD (26.8%), ALD (21.1%), HCV (13.1%), cholestatic liver disease (11.1%), and autoimmune liver disease (5.6%).Our study found NAFLD in 2017 in women and ALD in 2019 in men have surpassed HCV as the leading causes of liver disease and HCC among adults receiving liver transplants."
https://openalex.org/W3087695784,"Invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In the early 2000's the proportion of infections due the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) increased rapidly. We described the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive S. aureus disease in a pediatric population.We prospectively identified children in Utah with invasive S. aureus infections. Medical records were reviewed to determine diagnosis and clinical characteristics. Isolates were genotyped using multi-locus sequence typing. The presence of genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was determined using polymerase chain reaction.Over a 4-year period between January 2009 and December 2012, we identified 357 children, hospitalized at Primary Children's Hospital, with invasive S. aureus infections and isolates available for the study. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) caused 79% of disease, while MRSA caused only 21% of disease. Mortality associated with invasive S. aureus infection was 3.6%. The most common diagnoses were osteoarticular infections (38%) followed by central line associated blood stream infections (19%) and pneumonia (12%). We identified 41 multi-locus sequence types. The majority of isolates belonged to 6 predominant clonal complexes (CC5, CC8, CC15, CC30, CC45, CC59). PVL was present in a minority (16%) of isolates, of which most were ST8 MRSA.MSSA was the primary cause of invasive S. aureus infections at our institution throughout the study period. A limited number of predominant strains accounted for the majority of invasive disease. The classic virulence factor PVL was uncommon in MSSA isolates. Further study is needed to improve our understanding of S. aureus virulence and disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3087538940,"Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) represent a technical revolution in integrative neuroscience. However, the first used ligands exhibited dose-dependent selectivity for their molecular target, leading to potential unspecific effects. Compound 21 (C21) was recently proposed as an alternative, but in vivo characterization of its properties is not sufficient yet. Here, we evaluated its potency to selectively modulate the activity of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons through the canonical DREADD receptor hM4Di using TH-Cre rats. In males, 1 mg.kg-1 of C21 strongly increased nigral neurons activity in control animals, indicative of a significant off-target effect. Reducing the dose to 0.5 mg.kg-1 circumvented this unspecific effect, while activated the inhibitory DREADDs and selectively reduced nigral neurons firing. In females, 0.5 mg.kg-1 of C21 induced a transient and residual off-target effect that may mitigated the inhibitory DREADDs-mediated effect. This study raises up the necessity to test selectivity and efficacy of chosen ligands for each new experimental condition."
https://openalex.org/W3087200991,"Based on 0.01°×0.01° grid data of PM2.5 annual concentration and statistical yearbook data for 11 cities in Hebei Province from 2000 to 2015, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in the study area are analysed, the level of intensive land use in the area is evaluated, and decoupling theory and spatial regression are used to discuss the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and intensive land use and the influence of intensive land use variables on PM2.5 in Hebei Province. The results show that 1. In terms of time, the concentration of PM2.5 in Hebei Province showed an overall upward trend from 2000 to 2015, with the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. The daily variations show double peaks at 8:00-10:00 and 21:00-0:00 and a single valley at 16:00-18:00. 2. In terms of space, the concentration of PM2.5 in Hebei Province is high in the southeast and low in the northwest, and the pollution spillover initially decreases and then increases. 3. In the past 16 years, the level of intensive land use in Hebei Province has increased annually, but blind expansion still exists. 4. Decoupling theory and the spatial lag model show that land use intensity, land input level and land use structure are positively correlated with PM2.5 concentration, land output benefit is negatively correlated with PM2.5 concentration, and PM2.5 concentration and land intensive use level have not yet been decoupled; thus, the relationship is not harmonious. This research can provide a scientific basis for reducing air pollution and promoting the development of urban land resources for intensive and sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W3087276385,"Human-elephant conflict is an often intractable problem that threatens the contribution of conservation interventions to human wellbeing and securing livelihoods in Africa and Asia. Local human populations living in key elephant ranges are among the world's most poor and vulnerable people. In efforts to address this problem, previous studies have mainly focused on the direct impacts of conflict and applied standard regression models based on the assumption of individual-level homogeneity. More recently, human-elephant conflict has been seen to extend well beyond the physical, to the psychological and social sides of wellbeing. However, the impacts on human wellbeing have not been robustly explored, especially for local communities co-existing with elephants. We evaluated the impacts of conflicts on the wellbeing of local communities around the world-famous Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. We conducted 18 focus group discussions with 120 community members in different locations and administered a questionnaire survey to 367 sampled households from 26 sub-locations in Trans Mara. We used descriptive statistics with appropriate statistical tests, including propensity score matching, to evaluate the impacts of conflict on human wellbeing. Before matching, the results of the descriptive statistics showed differences between households experiencing conflicts and those without in terms of gender, age, education level, household size, benefiting from elephant conservation, main occupation and number of income sources. Our matching results indicate the existence of a significant negative and positive impacts on four and one of our eight wellbeing indicators for households that experienced conflicts, respectively. Better conflict mitigation approaches and conservation policies need to be adopted to realize the harmonious and concurrent development of ecological and wellbeing objectives."
https://openalex.org/W3087600521,"Limited data coverage on harmful algal blooms (HABs) in some regions makes assessment of long-term trends difficult, and also impedes understanding of bloom ecology. Here, observations reported in a local newspaper were combined with cell count and environmental data from resource management agencies to assess trends in Karenia brevis ""red tide"" frequency and duration in the Nueces Estuary (Texas) and adjacent coastal waters, and to determine relationships with environmental factors. Based on these analyses, the Coastal Bend region of the Texas coast has experienced a significant increase in the frequency of red tide blooms since the mid-1990s. Salinity was positively correlated with red tide occurrence in the Nueces Estuary, and a documented long-term increase in salinity of the Nueces Estuary may be a major factor in the long-term increase in bloom frequency. This suggests that freshwater inflow management efforts in Texas should consider impacts on red tide habitat suitability (i.e., salinity regime) in downstream estuaries. Natural climate variability such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, which is strongly related to rainfall and salinity in Central and South Texas, was also an influential predictor of red tide presence/absence. Though no significant change in the duration of blooms was detected, there was a negative correlation between duration and temperature. Specifically, summer-like temperatures were not favorable to K. brevis bloom development. The relationships found here between red tide frequency/duration and environmental drivers present a new avenue of research that will aid in refining monitoring and forecasting efforts for red tides on the Texas coast and elsewhere. Findings also highlight the importance of factors (i.e., salinity, temperature) that are likely to be altered in the future due to both population growth in coastal watersheds and anthropogenic climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3087222131,"Pathway analysis is an informative method for comparing and contrasting drug-induced gene expression in cellular systems. Here, we define the effects of the marine natural product fucoxanthin, separately and in combination with the prototypic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY-294002, on gene expression in a well-established human glioblastoma cell system, U87MG. Under conditions which inhibit cell proliferation, LY-294002 and fucoxanthin modulate many pathways in common, including the retinoblastoma, DNA damage, DNA replication and cell cycle pathways. In sharp contrast, we see profound differences in the expression of genes characteristic of pathways such as apoptosis and lipid metabolism, contributing to the development of a differentiated and distinctive drug-induced gene expression signature for each compound. Furthermore, in combination, fucoxanthin synergizes with LY-294002 in inhibiting the growth of U87MG cells, suggesting complementarity in their molecular modes of action and pointing to further treatment combinations. The synergy we observe between the dietary nutraceutical fucoxanthin and the synthetic chemical LY-294002 in producing growth arrest in glioblastoma, illustrates the potential of nutri-pharmaceutical combinations in targeting this challenging disease."
https://openalex.org/W3087105595,"Manganese oxide (MnO) nanoparticles (NPs) can serve as robust pH-sensitive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to Mn2+ release at low pH, which generates a ~30 fold change in T1 relaxivity. Strategies to control NP size, composition, and Mn2+ dissolution rates are essential to improve diagnostic performance of pH-responsive MnO NPs. We are the first to demonstrate that MnO NP size and composition can be tuned by the temperature ramping rate and aging time used during thermal decomposition of manganese(II) acetylacetonate. Two different temperature ramping rates (10°C/min and 20°C/min) were applied to reach 300°C and NPs were aged at that temperature for 5, 15, or 30 min. A faster ramping rate and shorter aging time produced the smallest NPs of ~23 nm. Shorter aging times created a mixture of MnO and Mn3O4 NPs, whereas longer aging times formed MnO. Our results indicate that a 20°C/min ramp rate with an aging time of 30 min was the ideal temperature condition to form the smallest pure MnO NPs of ~32 nm. However, Mn2+ dissolution rates at low pH were unaffected by synthesis conditions. Although Mn2+ production was high at pH 5 mimicking endosomes inside cells, minimal Mn2+ was released at pH 6.5 and 7.4, which mimic the tumor extracellular space and blood, respectively. To further elucidate the effects of NP composition and size on Mn2+ release and MRI contrast, the ideal MnO NP formulation (~32 nm) was compared with smaller MnO and Mn3O4 NPs. Small MnO NPs produced the highest amount of Mn2+ at acidic pH with maximum T1 MRI signal; Mn3O4 NPs generated the lowest MRI signal. MnO NPs encapsulated within poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) retained significantly higher Mn2+ release and MRI signal compared to PLGA Mn3O4 NPs. Therefore, MnO instead of Mn3O4 should be targeted intracellularly to maximize MRI contrast."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted at Renmin University of China, in Beijing. A total of 5,233 students were surveyed in September 2015. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire on their demographic characteristics, tobacco and alcohol use, PA, ST, sleep quality, and health status. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the independent and interactive associations between PA and ST with sleep quality and suboptimal health status. In total, 10.43%, 13.18%, and 13.26% of the 5,233 students had physiological, psychological, and social suboptimal health status, respectively. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 37.94%. High ST and high PA were significantly associated with physiological suboptimal health status (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.68, and aOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45–0.71), psychological suboptimal health status (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.21–1.69, and aOR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47–0.69), social suboptimal health status (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08–1.50, and aOR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.52–0.77), and poor sleep quality (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03–1.39, and aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55–0.76). Additionally, low ST and high PA were interactively negatively associated with poor sleep quality (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45–0.70), physiological suboptimal health status (aOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.40–0.59), psychological suboptimal health status (aOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39–0.58), and social suboptimal health status (aOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.40–0.59).

https://openalex.org/W3087200852,"Patient satisfaction, a healthcare recipient's reaction to salient aspects of their service experience, has been considered an important metric of the overall quality of healthcare in both advanced and developing countries. Given the growing number of studies on patient satisfaction in developing and transitioning countries, publications using high-quality patient surveys in these countries remain scarce. This study examines factors associated with inpatient satisfaction levels using nationwide, large-scale interview data from 10,143 randomized and voluntary patients of 69 large and public hospitals in Vietnam during 2017-2018. We find that older patients, poor patients, female patients, patients with lower levels of education, patients not working for private enterprises (or foreign enterprises), and rural patients reported higher levels of overall satisfaction. Health insurance is found to have positive influence on overall patient satisfaction, primarily driven by limiting patient concerns about treatment costs, as well as increasing positive perceptions of hospital staff. We further find that patients who paid extra fees for their hospital admission expressed higher scores for hospital living arrangements and medical staff, but were mostly dissatisfied with treatment costs. These findings have important policy implications for current policy makers in Vietnam as well as for other countries with limited healthcare resources and ongoing healthcare reforms."
https://openalex.org/W3087546116,"Genome-editing technology has become increasingly known in recent years, and the 2018 news of genome-edited twins in China had a particularly significant impact on public awareness. In the present study we investigate the effect of Japanese media coverage on public opinions of this technology. To identify the effects we employ a questionnaire survey method on a pre-registered sample from online research company Macromill. Our repeated survey from 2016 through 2019 reveal a generally supportive attitude toward the medical application of genome-editing methods. To see this we employed a multinomial logit analysis examining the determinants of negative and positive impressions of the technology. Results show that although editing for medical purposes remained mostly acceptable, its use in fertilizing human eggs was increasingly rejected, especially in 2019, the most recent sample year. The suggestion is that while genome-editing applications in general medical fields are publicly accepted, its use in human functionality enhancement is heavily increasingly resisted. News of the twin babies in China did raise public awareness of the methods but also damaged their reputation. It therefore is important for genome researchers to hold such concerns in mind, keeping the public informed of changing technology fundamentals. As a related question we inquire into the public acceptability of genome editing for animal and plant breeding, such as in agriculture and fisheries, as well. We find the Japanese public views the medical and breeding applications of this technology to be unconnected with each other, despite that awareness of both has risen significantly in recent years."
https://openalex.org/W3087605587,"The two-domain bacterial laccases oxidize substrates at alkaline pH. The role of natural phenolic compounds in the oxidation of substrates by the enzyme is poorly understood. We have studied the role of ferulic and caffeic acids in the transformation of low molecular weight substrates and of soil humic acid (HA) by two-domain laccase of Streptomyces puniceus (SpSL, previously undescribed). A gene encoding a two-domain laccase was cloned from S. puniceus and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography to an electrophoretically homogeneous state. The enzyme showed high thermal stability, alkaline pH optimum for the oxidation of phenolic substrates and an acidic pH optimum for the oxidation of K4[Fe(CN)6] (potassium ferrocyanide) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt). Phenolic compounds were oxidized with lower efficiency than K4[Fe(CN)6] and ABTS. The SpSL did not oxidize 3.4-dimethoxybenzoic alcohol and p-hydroxybenzoic acid neither in the absence of phenolic acids nor in their presence. The enzyme polymerized HA—the amount of its high molecular weight fraction (>80 kDa) increased at the expense of low MW fraction (10 kDa). The addition of phenolic acids as potential mediators did not cause the destruction of HA by SpSL. In the absence of the HA, the enzyme polymerized caffeic and ferulic acids to macromolecular fractions (>80 kDa and 10–12 kDa). The interaction of SpSL with HA in the presence of phenolic acids caused an increase in the amount of HA high MW fraction and a two-fold increase in the molecular weight of its low MW fraction (from 10 to 20 kDa), suggesting a cross-coupling reaction. Infrared and solution-state 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed an increase in the aromaticity of HA after its interaction with phenolic acids. The results of the study expand our knowledge on the transformation of natural substrates by two-domain bacterial laccases and indicate a potentially important role of the enzyme in the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) at alkaline pH values."
https://openalex.org/W3087343146,"Only quite recently, we have shown that yeast strains Clavispora lusitaniae 146 and Pichia fermentans 27 can act as efficient biocontrol agents for combating postharvest fungal diseases in lemons. During postharvest and storage conditions, microorganisms are subject to different stress factors that could affect both their survival and their protective capacity. Understanding the tolerance of yeasts to environmental stress factors could support the future development and commercial application of biological control formulations based on such organisms. Thus, the impact of different stressors on the viability and protection efficiency of C. lusitaniae strain 146 and P. fermentans strain 27 was evaluated, and the yeasts were subjected to oxidative stress, thermal treatments, exposure to NaOCl, osmotic stress, and ultraviolet irradiation. Candida oleophila strain O served as the reference control. C. lusitaniae 146 was more resistant to H2O2 in plate assays; however, in liquid media there was no significant difference to the other strains. Strain 146 was less affected by NaOCl, being able to survive with 300 ppm. P. fermentans 27 was the strain most heavily affected by osmotic pressure, while strains 146 and strain O showed a similar adaptation. UV-B irradiation severely affected C. oleophila and P. fermentans, while C. lusitaniae was the most resistant. Strains 146 and 27 were similarly tolerant to thermal shocks, compared to the reference strain, which was less viable. In in vivo tests, exposure to 10 mM H2O2, 45°C or 200 ppm NaOCl prior to fruit inoculation, reduced the antagonistic activity against the pathogen Penicillium digitatum. However, in no case was the biocontrol efficiency reduced to less than 50%. As C. lusitaniae 146 demonstrated a great potential to combat P. digitatum under a wide range of conditions, the organism is a promising candidate as an effective and valuable alternative to toxic fungicides."
https://openalex.org/W3087365403,"The physiological role played by uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) has not been fully elucidated so far. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of the absence of UCP3 on BAT mitochondrial functionality and morphology. To this purpose, wild type (WT) and UCP3 Knockout (KO) female mice were housed at thermoneutrality (30°C), a condition in which BAT contributes to energy homeostasis independently of its cold-induced thermogenic function. BAT mitochondria from UCP3 KO mice presented a lower ability to oxidize the fatty acids and glycerol-3-phosphate, and an enhanced oxidative stress as revealed by enhanced mitochondrial electron leak, lipid hydroperoxide levels, and induction of antioxidant mitochondrial enzymatic capacity. The absence of UCP3 also influenced the mitochondrial super-molecular protein aggregation, an important feature for fatty acid oxidation rate as well as for adequate cristae organization and mitochondrial shape. Indeed, electron microscopy revealed alterations in mitochondrial morphology in brown adipocytes from KO mice. In the whole, data here reported show that the absence of UCP3 results in a significant alteration of BAT mitochondrial physiology and morphology. These observations could also help to clarify some aspects of the association between metabolic disorders associated with low UCP3 levels, as previously reported in human studies."
https://openalex.org/W3087561936,"High-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly enabled the study of genomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics. Automated annotation and classification of the vast amounts of generated sequence data has become paramount for facilitating biological sciences. Genomes of viruses can be radically different from all life, both in terms of molecular structure and primary sequence. Alignment-based and profile-based searches are commonly employed for characterization of assembled viral contigs from high-throughput sequencing data. Recent attempts have highlighted the use of machine learning models for the task, but these models rely entirely on DNA genomes and owing to the intrinsic genomic complexity of viruses, RNA viruses have gone completely overlooked. Here, we present a novel short k-mer based sequence scoring method that generates robust sequence information for training machine learning classifiers. We trained 18 classifiers for the task of distinguishing viral RNA from human transcripts. We challenged our models with very stringent testing protocols across different species and evaluated performance against BLASTn, BLASTx and HMMER3 searches. For clean sequence data retrieved from curated databases, our models display near perfect accuracy, outperforming all similar attempts previously reported. On de novo assemblies of raw RNA-Seq data from cells subjected to Ebola virus, the area under the ROC curve varied from 0.6 to 0.86 depending on the software used for assembly. Our classifier was able to properly classify the majority of the false hits generated by BLAST and HMMER3 searches on the same data. The outstanding performance metrics of our model lays the groundwork for robust machine learning methods for the automated annotation of sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W3087667872,"Spring migration phenology is shifting towards earlier dates as a response to climate change in many bird species. However, the patterns of change might not be the same for all species, populations, sex and age classes. In particular, patterns of change could differ between species with different ecology. We analyzed 18 years of standardized bird capture data at a spring stopover site on the island of Ponza, Italy, to determine species-specific rates of phenological change for 30 species following the crossing of the Mediterranean Sea. The advancement of spring passage was more pronounced in species wintering in Northern Africa (i.e. short-distance migrants) and in the Sahel zone. Only males from species wintering further South in the forests of central Africa advanced their passage, with no effect on the overall peak date of passage of the species. The migration window on Ponza broadened in many species, suggesting that early migrants within a species are advancing their migration more than late migrants. These data suggest that the cues available to the birds to adjust departure might be changing at different rates depending on wintering location and habitat, or that early migrants of different species might be responding differently to changing conditions along the route. However, more data on departure time from the wintering areas are required to understand the mechanisms underlying such phenological changes."
https://openalex.org/W3087113596,"Although it is known that patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) have impaired dental conditions, incidence rates and incidence rate ratios of various dental diseases in these patients are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and prevalence of dental diseases in patients with pSS, and to evaluate the risk of common dental diseases in these patients.A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using the data from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 709 patients with newly diagnosed pSS between 2000 and 2012 were identified to form the pSS cohort. A comparison cohort of patients without pSS was assembled based on frequency matching for sex, 5-year age interval, and index year at a ratio of 10:1. All participants were followed until the end of the follow-up period or when the outcome of interest occurred. The incidence of dental caries, pulpitis, gingivitis, periodontitis, oral ulceration, and stomatitis were calculated using multiple Poisson regression models.A significantly higher prevalence (74.6% vs. 63.0%, P = 0.001) and frequency (median 5.37 vs. 1.45 per year, P < 0.001) dental visits were observed in patients with pSS compared with patients in the comparison cohort. The risk of dental caries (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.64, P < 0.001), pulpitis (aIRR 1.42, P < 0.001), gingivitis (aIRR 1.43, P < 0.001), periodontitis (aIRR 1.44, P < 0.001), oral ulceration (aIRR 1.98, P < 0.001), and stomatitis (aIRR 2.06, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with pSS.In this nationwide, population-based cohort study, a higher prevalence and frequency of dental visits were found in patients with pSS. Patients with PSS had increased risk of six most common dental disorders, including dental caries, pulpitis, gingivitis, periodontitis, oral ulceration, and stomatitis. Rheumatologists should remain vigilant for the dental health of patients with pSS."
https://openalex.org/W3087204040,"Carnosine is a naturally occurring histidine-containing dipeptide present at high concentration in mammalian skeletal muscles. Carnosine was shown to affect muscle contraction, prevent the accumulation of oxidative metabolism by-products and act as an intracellular proton buffer maintaining the muscle acid-base balance. The present study was undertaken to gain additional knowledge about the intracellular mechanisms activated by carnosine in porcine myoblast cells under basal and oxidative stress conditions. Satellite cells were isolated from the skeletal muscles of 3 to 4 day-old piglets to study the effect of 0, 10, 25 and 50 mM carnosine pre-treatments in cells that were exposed (0.3 mM H2O2) or not to an H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Study results demonstrated that carnosine acts differently in myoblasts under oxidative stress and in basal conditions, the only exception being with the reduction of reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyls observed in both experimental conditions with carnosine pre-treatment. In oxidative stress conditions, carnosine pre-treatment increased the mRNA abundance of the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NEF2L2) transcription factor and several of its downstream genes known to reduce H2O2. Carnosine prevented the H2O2-mediated activation of p38 MAPK in oxidative stress conditions, whereas it triggered the activation of mTOR under basal conditions. Current results support the protective effect of carnosine against oxidative damage in porcine myoblast cells, an effect that would be mediated through the p38 MAPK intracellular signaling pathway. The activation of the mTOR signaling pathway under basal condition also suggest a role for carnosine in myoblasts proliferation, growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W3087650897,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease. The interaction of genetic and environmental factors is likely necessary for RA. Among potential genetic factors, many major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC variants may be involved in RA susceptibility. CTLA4 is involved in the regulation of T-cell response during an immune reaction, and multiple CTLA4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with numerous autoimmune diseases, including RA. To our knowledge, the genetic association of CTLA4 with RA risk has not been examined previously in the Pakistani population. In this study, we sequenced the entire CTLA4 gene and flanking regions in 95 Pakistani RA cases followed the screening of identified variants in Study 1 sample consisting of 350 RA cases and controls. Four common significant variants identified in Study 1 sample were further examined in a larger Study 2 replication sample comprising 1,678 independent RA cases and controls. We report significant associations of three variants from the combined analysis: rs3087243 (OR = 1.26, p = 4.47E-03), rs5742909 (OR = 1.78, p = 4.60E-03), and rs11571319 (OR = 1.48, p = 6.64E-03); the latter is a novel association in the Pakistani sample."
https://openalex.org/W3016664516,"Cells have the ability to detect electric fields and respond to them with directed migratory movement. Investigations identified genes and proteins that play important roles in defining the migration efficiency. Nevertheless, the sensing and transduction mechanisms underlying directed cell migration are still under discussion. We use Dictyostelium discoideum cells as model system for studying eukaryotic cell migration in DC electric fields. We have defined the temporal electric persistence to characterize the memory that cells have in a varying electric field. In addition to imposing a directional bias, we observed that the electric field influences the cellular kinematics by accelerating the movement of cells along their paths. Moreover, the study of vegetative and briefly starved cells provided insight into the electrical sensing of cells. We found evidence that conditioned medium of starved cells was able to trigger the electrical sensing of vegetative cells that would otherwise not orient themselves in the electric field. This observation may be explained by the presence of the conditioned medium factor (CMF), a protein secreted by the cells, when they begin to starve. The results of this study give new insights into understanding the mechanism that triggers the electrical sensing and transduces the external stimulus into directed cell migration. Finally, the observed increased mobility of cells over time in an electric field could offer a novel perspective towards wound healing assays."

In this perspective, the present research was aimed at the complete valorisation of Garganega grape pomace by recovering bioactive phenol extracts and by testing the solid fibre extract residues in composite formulation for packaging applications. The pomace was derived from white wine production, therefore, respect to red pomace, it was promptly removed from must after pressing, and its exploitation can be particularly interesting and valuable as still rich in active compounds. Phenol extracts were obtained both via solvent-based and pressurised liquid extractions and their phytochemical compositions were compared in terms of total amount of phenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and reducing sugars. Antioxidant activity and detailed phenol profiles were also achieved. The highest phenol yield was obtained via solvent-based extraction with 75% acetone (v/v), solid/liquid ratio 1:5, 2h incubation at 50°C (77.9 gGAeq/kgDW). The fibrous solid residue of the extraction was characterized via thermogravimetric analysis and used for composite preparation by melt mixing with the renewable and biodegradable PHBV polymer through a green approach (solvent-less process). The composites resulted thermally stable at high temperatures, showing initial degradation processes only at temperatures higher than 250°C. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses were carried out to study melting and crystallization phenomena, while mechanical properties were investigated by tensile tests. The materials finally showed properties similar to those of the matrix. The bio-composites can be considered as an alternative to plain PHBV, since they are less expensive and eco-friendlier thanks to a reduced polymeric content, and they could represent a suitable way for full agro-waste exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W3087590466,"To solve the problem that the details of fusion images are not retained well and the information of feature targets is incomplete, we proposed a new fusion method of infrared (IR) and visible (VI) image-IR and VI image fusion method of dual non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN). The method makes full use of the flexible multi-resolution and multi-directional of NSCT, and the global coupling and pulse synchronization excitation characteristics of PCNN, effectively combining the features of IR image with the texture details of VI image. Experimental results show that the algorithm can combine IR and VI image features well. At the same time, the obtained fusion image can better display the texture information of image. The fusion performance in contrast, detail information and other aspects is better than the classical fusion algorithm, which has better visual effect and evaluation index."
https://openalex.org/W3087728895,"The immunopathogenesis of H5N1 virus has been studied intensively since it caused cross-species infection and induced high mortality to human. We previously observed the interaction between monocytes and B cells, which increased the susceptibility of B cell to H5N1 virus infection after a co-culture. Levels of α2,3 sialic acid (avian flu receptor) were also significantly increased on B cell surface in this co-culture model with unclear explanation. In this study, we aimed to determine the possible mechanism that responded for this increase in α2,3 sialic acid on B cells. Acquisition of α2,3 SA by B cells via cell contact-dependent trogocytosis was proposed. Results showed that the lack of α2,3 SA was detected on B cell surface, and B cells acquired membrane-bound α2,3 SA molecules from monocytes in H5N1-infected co-cultures. Occurrence of membrane exchange mainly relied on H5N1 infection and cell-cell contact as opposed to a mock infection and transwell. The increase in α2,3 SA on B cell surface mediated by trogocytosis was associated with the enhanced susceptibility to H5N1 infection. These observations thus provide the evidence that H5N1 influenza virus may utilize trogocytosis to expand its cell tropism and spread to immune cells despite the lack of avian flu receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3087016337,"Japan is the world’s leading aging society, and increasing medical expenses for elderly people is an urgent issue. Since aspiration pneumonia in elderly people with impaired swallowing function is a huge problem in Japan, their expected long-term clinical course should be clarified. Accordingly, we collected data from 991 elderly (≥75 years old) patients whose swallowing function was evaluated by Kitasato Institute Hospital’s speech therapists (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017). We analyzed the relationship between swallowing function and the subjects’ long-term prognosis. To clarify the prognostic factors of patients with dysphagia, we obtained their clinical information (age, gender, activities of daily living, nutritional status, availability of alternative feeding pathways such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, and cognitive function). We confirmed 372 death cases and stratified the cases into three groups using Fujishima’s swallowing ability grade, which is used to predict elderly people’s real-world life expectancy. Results showed the median survival days were 331 and 952 days in Groups I (Grades 1–3, n = 308) and II (Grades 4–6, n = 153), respectively, whereas the median survival days for Group III (Grades 7–10, n = 530) could not be calculated. We conducted a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model with Group I, which revealed that initial grade and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were significant prognostic factors for the subjects’ long-term survival. Nevertheless, further discussion is necessary, particularly to determine advanced care planning regarding indications for alternative feeding pathways in elderly patients with severe dysphagia, since percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could significantly prolong their survival."
https://openalex.org/W3087085928,"Omeprazole is the most commonly used proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a class of medications whose therapeutic mechanism of action involves formation of a disulfide linkage to cysteine residues in the H+/K+ ATPase pump on gastric secretory cells. Covalent linkage between the sole sulfur group of omeprazole and selected cysteine residues of the pump protein results in inhibition of acid secretion in the stomach, an effect that ameliorates gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease. PPIs, though useful for specific conditions when used transiently, are associated with diverse untoward effects when used long term. The mechanisms underlying these potential off-target effects remain unclear. PPIs may, in fact, interact with non-canonical target proteins (non-pump molecules) resulting in unexpected pathophysiological effects, but few studies describe off-target PPI binding. Here, we describe successful cloning of monoclonal antibodies against protein-bound omeprazole. We developed and used monoclonal antibodies to characterize the protein target range of omeprazole, stability of omeprazole-bound proteins, and the involvement of cysteines in binding of omeprazole to targets. We demonstrate that a wide range of diverse proteins are targeted by omeprazole. Protein complexes, detected by Western blotting, are resistant to heat, detergents, and reducing agents. Reaction of omeprazole occurs with cysteine-free proteins, is not fully inhibited by cysteine alkylation, occurs at neutral pH, and induces protein multimerization. At least two other clinically used PPIs, rabeprazole and tenatoprazole, are capable of binding to proteins in a similar fashion. We conclude that omeprazole binds to multiple proteins and is capable of forming highly stable complexes that are not dependent on disulfide linkages between the drug and protein targets. Further studies made possible by these antibodies may shed light on whether PPI-protein complexes underlie off-target untoward effects of chronic PPI use."

By incorporating spatially varying input and output prices, we predict the expected profitability for a location-specific smallholder farmer. A stochastic rainfall component of the model allows us to quantify the uncertainty around expected economic returns. The resulting mapped estimates of expected profitability and uncertainty are good predictors of actual smallholder fertilizer usage in nationally representative household survey data. The integration of agronomic and economic information in our framework makes it a powerful tool for spatially explicit targeting of agricultural technologies and complementary investments, as well as estimating returns to investments at multiple scales."
https://openalex.org/W3087280106,"Light conditions in retail stores may contribute to potato greening. In this study, we aimed to develop a potato tuber greening risk rating model for retail stores based on light quality and intensity parameters. This was achieved by firstly exposing three potato varieties (Nicola, Maranca and Kennebec) to seven specific light wavelengths (370, 420, 450, 530, 630, 660 and 735 nm) to determine the tuber greening propensity. Detailed light quality and intensity measurements from 25 retail stores were then combined with the greening propensity data to develop a tuber greening risk rating model. Our study showed that maximum greening occurred under blue light (450 nm), while 53%, 65% and 75% less occurred under green (530 nm), red (660 nm) and orange (630 nm) light, respectively. Greening risk, which varied between stores, was found to be related to light intensity level, and partially explained potato stock loss in stores. Our results from this study suggested that other in-store management practices, including lighting duration, average potato turnover, and light protection during non-retail periods, likely influence tuber greening risk."
https://openalex.org/W3087440089,"Trained community workers (CWs) successfully deliver health and social services, especially due to greater community acceptance. Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and their caregivers (CG) often need support from several sectors. We identified CW, program and referral characteristics that were associated with success of referrals provided to OVC and their CG in Tanzania in a cross-sectoral bi-directional referral system.Data for this secondary analysis come from the first two years (2017-2018) of the USAID funded Kizazi Kipya project. Referral success was defined as feedback and service received within 90 days post-referral provision. We analyzed factors that are associated with the referral success of HIV related, education, nutrition, parenting, household economic strengthening, and child protection services among OVC and CG, using generalized estimating equations.During the study period, 19,502 CWs in 68 councils provided 146,996 referrals to 132,640 beneficiaries. OVC had much lower referral success for HIV related services (48.1%) than CG (81.2%). Adjusted for other covariates, CW age (26-49 versus 18-25 years, for OVC aOR = 0.83, 95%CI (0.78, 0.87) and CW gender (males versus females, for OVC aOR = 1.12, 95%CI (1.08, 1.16); CG aOR = 0.84, 95%CI (0.78, 0.90)) were associated with referral success. CWs who had worked > 1 year in the project (aOR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.46, 1.58) and those with previous work experience as CW (aOR = 1.57, 95%CI (1.42, 1.74) more successfully referred OVC. Referrals provided to OVC for all other services were more successful compared to HIV referrals, with aORs ranging from 2.99 to 7.22. Longer project duration in the district council was associated with increased referral success for OVC (aOR = 1.16 per month 95%CI 1.15,1.17), but decreased for CG (aOR = 0.96, 95%CI 0.94, 0.97). Referral success was higher for OVC and CGs with multiple (versus single) referrals provided within the past 30 days (aOR = 1.28 95%CI 1.21, 1.36) and (aOR = 1.17, 95%CI (1.06, 1.30)) respectively.CW characteristics, referral type and project maturity had different and often contrasting associations with referral success for OVC versus for CG. These findings could help policymakers decide on the recruitment and allocation of CWs in community based multi-sectoral intervention programs to improve referral successes especially for OVC."
https://openalex.org/W3087613328,"The genetic diagnostics of inherited neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) is challenging due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We launched an online survey within the EURO-NMD European Reference Network (ERN) to collect information about the availability/distribution of genetic testing across 61 ERN health care providers (HCPs). A 17 items questionnaire was designed to address methods used, the number of genetic tests available, the clinical pathway to access genetic testing, the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and participation to quality assessment schemes (QAs). A remarkable number of HCPs (49%) offers ≥ 500 genetic tests per year, 43,6% offers 100–500 genetic tests per year, and 7,2% ≤ 100 per year. NGS is used by 94% of centres, Sanger sequencing by 84%, MLPA by 66% and Southern blotting by 36%. The majority of centres (60%) offer NGS for all patients that fulfil criteria for NMD of genetic origin. Pipelines for NGS vary amongst centres, even within the same national system. Referral of patients to genetic laboratories by specialists was frequently reported (58%), and 65% of centres participates in genetic testing QAs. We specifically evaluated how many centres cover SMA, DMD, Pompe, LGMDs, and TTR genes/diseases genetic diagnosis, since these rare diseases benefit from personalised therapies. We used the Orphanet EUGT numbers, provided by 82% of HCPs. SMA, DMD, LGMD, TTR and GAA genes are covered by EUGTs although with different numbers and modalities. The number of genetic tests for NMDs offered across HCPs National Health systems is quite high, including routine techniques and NGS. The number and type of tests offered and the clinical practices differ among centres. We provided evidence that survey tools might be useful to learn about the state-of-the-art of ERN health-related activities and to foster harmonisation and standardisation of the complex care for the rare disease patients in the EU."
https://openalex.org/W3087095427,"Background Work-related psychosocial hazards result in numerous adverse effects on physical and psychological health, a reduction in quality of life and a decline in performance capacity to workers. While the condition is widespread across various occupations, healthcare sectors are acknowledged to be at high risk. In developing countries such as Ethiopia, however, the lack of reliable data on psychosocial hazards including psychological distress (PD) often hampers officials from planning for preventive actions. This study assessed the magnitude and influencing factors of PD among healthcare professionals in Gondar city, Ethiopia. Methods We employed a cross-sectional survey of 422 healthcare professionals selected with a stratified random sampling technique between April and March 2019. The symptoms of psychological distress were assessed with a standardized 10 items Kessler Psychological Distress Scale instrument. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted by use of SPSS program version 20. Factors associated with psychological distress symptoms were ascertained at < 0.05 p-value. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% was used to determine the strength of associations. Results In total, 417questionnaires fully completed and returned with a response rate of 98.8%. Age ranges from 23 to 57 with a mean of 31.00 (± 8.219 SD) years. Work-related psychological distress symptoms in the past 4weeks stood at 44.4% (N = 185) [95%CI (39.8, 49.4)]. Being female worker [AOR: 2.07; 95% CI (1.29, 3.32)], high job demand [(AOR: 1.53; 95% CI (1.10, 2.57)] and low job control [AOR: 2.54; 95% CI (1.60, 4.04)] were significant factors of psychological distress. Conclusion This study underscores the level of psychological distress among healthcare professionals is high. The experiences of psychological distress symptoms were significantly influenced by socio-demographic factors including sex and psychosocial job characteristics such as job demand and job control. Efforts to prevent the mental health of workers including psychological distress symptoms need to focus on individual attributes and job contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3087423340,"Humans can innately track a moving target by anticipating its future position from a brief history of observations. While ballistic trajectories can be readily extrapolated, many natural and artificial systems are governed by more general nonlinear dynamics and, therefore, can produce highly irregular motion. Yet, relatively little is known regarding the behavioral and physiological underpinnings of prediction and tracking in the presence of chaos. Here, we investigated in lab settings whether participants could manually follow the orbit of a paradigmatic chaotic system, the Rössler equations, on the (x,y) plane under different settings of a control parameter, which determined the prominence of transients in the target position. Tracking accuracy was negatively related to the level of unpredictability and folding. Nevertheless, while participants initially reacted to the transients, they gradually learned to anticipate it. This was accompanied by a decrease in muscular co-contraction, alongside enhanced activity in the theta and beta EEG bands for the highest levels of chaoticity. Furthermore, greater phase synchronization of breathing was observed. Taken together, these findings point to the possible ability of the nervous system to implicitly learn topological regularities even in the context of highly irregular motion, reflecting in multiple observables at the physiological level."
https://openalex.org/W3087483380,"HIV-1 infection exhibits a significant sex bias. This study aimed at identifying and examining lymphocyte associated sex differences in HIV-1 pathogenesis using a data-driven approach. To select targets for investigating sex differences in lymphocytes, data of microarray experiments and literature mining were integrated. Data from three large-scale microarray experiments were obtained from NCBI/GEO and screened for sex differences in gene expression. Literature mining was employed to identify sex biased genes in the microarray data, which were relevant to HIV-1 pathogenesis and lymphocyte biology. Sex differences in gene expression of selected genes were investigated by RT-qPCR and flowcytometry in healthy individuals and persons living with HIV-1. A significant and consistent sex bias was identified in 31 genes, the majority of which were related to immunity and expressed at higher levels in women. Using literature mining, three genes (DPP4, FCGR1A and SOCS3) were selected for analysis by qPCR because of their relevance to HIV, as well as, B and T cell biology. DPP4 exhibited the most significant sex bias in mRNA expression (p = 0.00029). Therefore, its expression was further analyzed on B and T cells using flowcytometry. In HIV-1 infected controllers and healthy individuals, frequencies of CD4+DPP4+ T cells were higher in women compared to men (p = 0.037 and p = 0.027). In women, CD4 T cell counts correlated with a predominant decreased in DPP4+CD4+ T cells (p = 0.0032). Sex differences in DPP4 expression abrogated in progressive HIV-1 infection. In conclusion, we found sex differences in the pathobiology of T cells in HIV-1 infection using a data-driven approach. Our results indicate that DPP4 expression on CD4+ T cells might contribute to the immunological sex differences observed in chronic HIV‑1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3087740018,"To deal with dynamically changing user's credentials in identity-based encryption (IBE), providing an efficient key revocation method is a very important issue. Recently, Ma and Lin proposed a generic method of designing a revocable IBE (RIBE) scheme that uses the complete subtree (CS) method by combining IBE and hierarchical IBE (HIBE) schemes. In this paper, we propose a new generic method for designing an RIBE scheme that uses the subset difference (SD) method instead of using the CS method. In order to use the SD method, we generically design an RIBE scheme by combining IBE, identity-based revocation (IBR), and two-level HIBE schemes. If the underlying IBE, IBR, and HIBE schemes are adaptively (or selectively) secure, then our RIBE scheme is also adaptively (or selectively) secure. In addition, we show that the layered SD (LSD) method can be applied to our RIBE scheme and a chosen-ciphertext secure RIBE scheme also can be designed generically."

Previous studies have attempted to quantitatively measure body image but methods for measuring body change recognition over time have not yet been established. The present study proposes a novel human-computer interaction technique using dynamic morphing and body ownership illusion, and we conducted a user study to investigate how body ownership illusion and gender would affect to body change recognition. The results showed that a participant's body change recognition was weak when the body ownership illusion was strong. In addition, female participants were less sensitive than male participants. With our proposed technique, we demonstrated that we were able to quantitatively measure body change recognition and our empirical data indicated that body change recognition varied depending on body ownership illusion and gender, suggesting that our methodology could not only be used in future body image studies but also in eating disorder treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3087326728,"Mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1R132H) occurs in various types of cancer, including low and high grade gliomas. Despite high incidence indicating its central role in tumor initiation and progression there are no targeted therapies directed against this oncogene available in the clinic. This is due to the limited understanding of the role of IDH1R132H in carcinogenesis, which is further propagated by the lack of appropriate experimental models. Moreover, proper in vitro models for analysis of gliomagenesis are required. In this study, we employed a Tet On system to generate human induced neural stem cells with doxycycline-inducible IDH1R132H. Equivalent expression of both forms of IDH1 in the presented model remains similar to that described in tumor cells. Additional biochemical analyses further confirmed tightly controlled gene regulation at protein level. Formation of a functional mutant IDH1 enzyme was supported by the production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). All samples tested for MGMT promoter methylation status, including parental cells, proved to be partially methylated. Analysis of biological effect of IDH1R132H revealed that cells positive for oncogene showed reduced differentation efficiency and viability. Inhibition of mutant IDH1 with selective inhibitor efficiently suppressed D2HG production as well as reversed the effect of mutant IDH1 protein on cell viability. In summary, our model constitutes a valuable platform for studies on the molecular basis and the cell of origin of IDH-mutant glioma (e.g. by editing P53 in these cells and their derivatives), as well as a reliable experimental model for drug testing."
https://openalex.org/W3087427476,"Biomarkers can be used to enrich a clinical trial for patients at higher risk for an outcome, a strategy termed enrichment. Methodology is needed to evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of trials with time-to-event endpoints such as survival. Key considerations when considering prognostic enrichment include: clinical trial sample size; the number of patients one must screen to enroll the trial; and total patient screening costs and total per-patient trial costs. The Biomarker Prognostic Enrichment Tool for Survival Outcomes (BioPETsurv) is a suite of methods for estimating these elements to evaluate a prognostic enrichment biomarker and/or plan a prognostically enriched clinical trial with a time-to-event primary endpoint. BioPETsurv allows investigators to analyze data on a candidate biomarker and potentially censored survival times. Alternatively, BioPETsurv can simulate data to match a particular clinical setting. BioPETsurv's data simulator enables investigators to explore the potential utility of a prognostic enrichment biomarker for their clinical setting. Results demonstrate that both modestly prognostic and strongly prognostic biomarkers can improve trial metrics such as reducing sample size or trial costs. In addition to the quantitative analysis provided by BioPETsurv, investigators should consider the generalizability of trial results and evaluate the ethics of trial eligibility criteria. BioPETsurv is freely available as a package for the R statistical computing platform, and as a webtool at www.prognosticenrichment.com/surv."
https://openalex.org/W3087593598,"This study aimed to evaluate the visualization of peripheral bronchioles in normal lungs via quarter-detector computed tomography (QDCT). Visualization of bronchioles within 10 mm from the pleura is considered a sign of bronchiectasis. However, it is not known peripheral bronchioles how close to the pleura in normal lungs can be tracked using QDCT. This study included 228 parts in 76 lungs from 38 consecutive patients who underwent QDCT. Reconstruction was performed with different thicknesses, increments, and matrix sizes: 0.5-mm thickness and increment with 512 and 1024 matrixes (Group5 and Group10, respectively) and 0.25-mm thickness and increment with 1024 matrix (Group10Thin). The distance between the most peripheral bronchiole visible and the pleura was determined in the three groups. The distance between the peripheral bronchial duct ends and the nearest pleural surface were significantly shorter in the order of Group10Thin, Group10, and Group5, and the mean distances from the pleura in Group10Thin and Group10 were shorter than 10 mm. These findings suggest the visualization of peripheral bronchioles in QDCT was better with a 1024 axial matrix than with a 512 matrix, and with a 0.25-mm slice thickness/increment than with a 0.5-mm slice thickness/increment. Our study also indicates bronchioles within 10 mm of the pleura do not necessarily indicate pathology."

In order to improve the health system response, the Ministry of Health piloted the introduction of malnutrition prevention and care indicators within its performance-based financing (PBF) scheme. Paying for units of services and for qualitative indicators is expected to enhance provision and quality of these nutrition services. The objective of this study is to assess the impacts of this intervention, on both child acute malnutrition recovery rates at health centre level and prevalence of chronic and acute malnutrition among children at community level. This study follows a cluster-randomized controlled evaluation design: 90 health centres (HC) were randomly selected for the study, 45 of them were randomly assigned to the intervention and received payment related to their performance in malnutrition activities, while the other 45 constituted the control group and got a simple budget allocation. Data were collected from baseline and follow-up surveys of the 90 health centres and 6,480 households with children aged 6 to 23 months. From the respectively 1,067 and 1,402 moderate and severe acute malnutrition transcribed files and registers, findings suggest that the intervention had a positive impact on moderate acute malnutrition recovery rates (OR: 5.59, p = 0.039 -at the endline, 78% in the control group and 97% in the intervention group) but not on uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition recovery rate (OR: 1.16, p = 0.751 -at the endline, 93% in the control group and 92% in the intervention group). The intervention also had a significant increasing impact on the number of children treated for acute malnutrition. Analyses from the anthropometric data collected among 12,679 children aged 6-23 months suggest improvements at health centre level did not translate into better results at community level: prevalence of both acute and chronic malnutrition remained high, precisely at the endline, acute and chronic malnutrition prevalence were resp. 8.80% and 49.90% in the control group and 8.70% and 52.0% in the intervention group, the differences being non-significant. PBF can contribute to a better management of malnutrition at HC level; yet, to address the huge problem of child malnutrition in Burundi, additional strategies are urgently required."
https://openalex.org/W3087216858,"In arthropods, the cleavage of specific proteins by peptidases has pivotal roles in multiple physiological processes including oogenesis, immunity, nutrition, and parasitic infection. These enzymes are also key players in the larval development, and well-described triggers of molting and metamorphosis. In this work the peptidase complement throughout the larvae development of Penaeus vannamei was quantified at the transcript and activity level using qPCR and fluorogenic substrates designed to be hydrolyzed by class-specific peptidases respectively, providing a detailed identification of the proteolytic repertoire in P. vannamei larvae. Significant changes in the peptidase activity profile were observed. During the lecithotrophic naupliar instars, the dominant peptidase activity and expression derive from cysteine peptidases, suggesting that enzymes of this class hydrolyze the protein components of yolk as the primary amino acid source. At the first feeding instar, zoea, dominant serine peptidase activity was found where trypsin activity is particularly high, supporting previous observations that during zoea the breakdown of food protein is primarily enzymatic. At decapodid stages the peptidase expression and activity is more diverse indicating that a multienzyme network achieves food digestion. Our results suggest that proteolytic enzymes fulfill specific functions during P. vannamei larval development."
https://openalex.org/W3087296746,"Tablet-adapted measures provide an efficient, accurate method of data collection for large-scale studies. The Castles and Coltheart Reading Test 2 (CC2) is a standardized paper-and-pencil measure of children’s reading ability. In the current study, the CC2 was administered to 603 children aged 7–8 years via iPad using electronic data capture software. Results indicate the tablet-adapted measure could be reliably administered by non-clinical staff and showed quantitative equivalence, i.e., comparable score distributions, to CC2 normative data. Internal consistency was good for regular and non-word lists. Findings suggest that the tablet-adapted CC2 is a viable tool for large research studies."
https://openalex.org/W3087162989,"In older adults with subjective memory complaints (SMCs), featuring a decline in memory but not exhibiting problems during medical examinations and objective memory tests, the weak links between nodes evident in the word retrieval process can be a primary factor for predicting mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This study examined the frequency of the “Tip-of-the-Tongue” (ToT) phenomenon according to age and subjective memory complaints of older adults, and identified differences in the resolution method using sequential cues. A celebrity naming task was performed on older adults (aged 50 to 79) with SMCs (n = 30) and without SMCs (n = 30), comparing the frequency of the ToT phenomenon and in resolution methods. We found that, even if our subjects with SMCs obtained normal results in the objective neuropsychology test, they experienced a significantly higher frequency of the ToT phenomenon than those without SMCs. In addition, subjects with SMCs showed a significantly lower rate of resolution, both spontaneous and following a syllabic cue, compared to those without SMCs. SMCs can be a very early marker of degenerative diseases causing cognitive dysfunction, and thus the selection of appropriate tools for early detection of SMCs is important. The proper naming task may sensitively detect subclinical symptoms of SMCs in subjects who are not classified as patients with cognitive impairments on general neuropsychological test. In addition, this task can identify weak connections between semantic and phonological nodes due to changes in the neural region of older adults with SMCs."
https://openalex.org/W3087229275,"Assessing the quality of mass drug administration (MDA) rounds is a key component of lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs. Routine collection of administrative coverage is unreliable, especially when pockets with low program coverage exist. To address this gap, we used lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) following the 10th annual LF-MDA round in Fiji to explore whether there was any area in which target coverage was not reached. We also assessed the level of drug compliance and satisfaction with the LF-MDA implementation strategy.We conducted a cross-sectional household survey in 3 divisions of Fiji. For LQAS, we defined 19 lots in 7 medical areas of the Suva sub-division and another 12 sub-divisions in the Central, Northern, and Eastern Divisions. A sample of 16 randomly selected household members was taken un each lot. We defined our decision rule as follows: if more than 1 person in a given lot did not swallow the medication, coverage was considered inadequate, i.e. less than 80%. Of the 7 lots in Suva sub-division and 12 lots in the 3 divisions, five and two lots, respectively, were identified as having inadequate coverage. The overall program coverage estimated from 304 samples was 92%, which was higher than the reported administrative coverage of 82%. About 98% of interviewees were offered the medication and 96% swallowed it. Non-participation arose from insufficient information on how to obtain the drugs. At least 92% were satisfied with the LF-MDA implementation strategy.Areas of low program coverage with results discordant with the reported administrative coverage existed in both urban and rural settings. Drug compliance and satisfaction were high, even after repeated rounds. We recommend increasing efforts to deliver the service in those areas with inadequate program coverage, as well as conducting timely coverage assessment through LQAS for corrective action."
https://openalex.org/W3087391248,"We propose the epsilon-tau procedure to determine up- and down-trends in a time series, working as a tool for its segmentation. The method denomination reflects the use of a tolerance level ε for the series values and a patience level τ in the time axis to delimit the trends. We first illustrate the procedure in discrete random walks, deriving the exact probability distributions of trend lengths and trend amplitudes, and then apply it to segment and analyze the trends of U.S. dollar (USD)/Japanese yen (JPY) market time series from 2015 to 2018. Besides studying the statistics of trend lengths and amplitudes, we investigate the internal structure of the trends by grouping trends with similar shapes and selecting clusters of shapes that rarely occur in the randomized data. Particularly, we identify a set of down-trends presenting similar sharp appreciation of the yen that are associated with exceptional events such as the Brexit Referendum in 2016."
https://openalex.org/W3087038453,"The genotyping of genetically-modified cells is a crucial step in studies of transgenics and genomic editing with systems such as CRISPR/Cas. The detection of genome editing events can be directly related to the genotyping methodology used, which is influenced by its costs, since many experiments require the analysis of a large number of samples. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of direct lysis methods of genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction for the detection of knockins and knockouts in primary goat cells. Initially, three gDNA extraction protocols (protocol A, heat denaturation/freeze-thaw in water; protocol B, heat denaturation/proteinase K; and protocol C, CellsDirect Kit) were tested using different quantities (1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 cells) and types of goat primary cells (fibroblasts and goat mammary epithelial cells-GMECs) for subsequent validation by PCR amplification of small (GAPDH) and large amplicons (hLF transgene). All protocols were successful in the detection of the small amplicon; however, in GMECs, only protocol B resulted efficient amplification (protocol A-0%, protocol B-93%, protocol C-13.33%, P <0.05). In a proof-of-principle experiment, the TP53 gene was knocked out in GMECs by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion while constructs containing the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (pBC-anti-VEGF) and bacterial L-Asparaginase (pBC-ASNase) transgenes were knocked-in separately in fibroblasts. Detection of successful editing was performed using protocol B and PCR. The integration rates of the pBC-ASNase and pBC-anti-VEGF transgenes were 93.6% and 72%, respectively, as per PCR. The efficiency of biallelic editing in GMECs using CRISPR/Cas9 for the TP53 deletion was 5.4%. Our results suggest that protocol B (heat denaturation/proteinase K) can be used as an inexpensive and quick methodology for detecting genetic modifications in different types of primary goat cells, with efficiency rates consistent with values previously described in the literature when using extraction kits or more complex proteinase K formulations."
