https://openalex.org/W2949238013,"A highly multiplexed cytometric imaging approach, termed co-detection by indexing (CODEX), is used here to create multiplexed datasets of normal and lupus (MRL/lpr) murine spleens. CODEX iteratively visualizes antibody binding events using DNA barcodes, fluorescent dNTP analogs, and an in situ polymerization-based indexing procedure. An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed. The fidelity of multiplexed spatial cytometry demonstrated here allows for quantitative systemic characterization of tissue architecture in normal and clinically aberrant samples."
https://openalex.org/W2887910040,"We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility in ∼100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and ∼400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2886239953,"Synapses are semi-membraneless, protein-dense, sub-micron chemical reaction compartments responsible for signal processing in each and every neuron. Proper formation and dynamic responses to stimulations of synapses, both during development and in adult, are fundamental to functions of mammalian brains, although the molecular basis governing formation and modulation of compartmentalized synaptic assemblies is unclear. Here, we used a biochemical reconstitution approach to show that, both in solution and on supported membrane bilayers, multivalent interaction networks formed by major excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold proteins led to formation of PSD-like assemblies via phase separation. The reconstituted PSD-like assemblies can cluster receptors, selectively concentrate enzymes, promote actin bundle formation, and expel inhibitory postsynaptic proteins. Additionally, the condensed phase PSD assemblies have features that are distinct from those in homogeneous solutions and fit for synaptic functions. Thus, we have built a molecular platform for understanding how neuronal synapses are formed and dynamically regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2886288118,"In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) convey complex acoustic information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to the brainstem. Although SGNs exhibit variation in physiological and anatomical properties, it is unclear which features are endogenous and which reflect input from synaptic partners. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we derived a molecular classification of mouse type I SGNs comprising three subtypes that express unique combinations of Ca2+ binding proteins, ion channel regulators, guidance molecules, and transcription factors. Based on connectivity and susceptibility to age-related loss, these subtypes correspond to those defined physiologically. Additional intrinsic differences among subtypes and across the tonotopic axis highlight an unexpectedly active role for SGNs in auditory processing. SGN identities emerge postnatally and are disrupted in a mouse model of deafness that lacks IHC-driven activity. These results elucidate the range, nature, and origins of SGN diversity, with implications for treatment of congenital deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2887693294,"Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit sound information from cochlear hair cells to the CNS. Using transcriptome analysis of thousands of single neurons, we demonstrate that murine type I SGNs consist of subclasses that are defined by the expression of subsets of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. Subtype specification is initiated prior to the onset of hearing during the time period when auditory circuits mature. Gene mutations linked to deafness that disrupt hair cell mechanotransduction or glutamatergic signaling perturb the firing behavior of SGNs prior to hearing onset and disrupt SGN subtype specification. We thus conclude that an intact hair cell mechanotransduction machinery is critical during the pre-hearing period to regulate the firing behavior of SGNs and their segregation into subtypes. Because deafness is frequently caused by defects in hair cells, our findings have significant ramifications for the etiology of hearing loss and its treatment."

Synapses are also highly complex at the molecular level, with >1,000 genes encoding postsynaptic proteins in excitatory synapses (Bayés et al., 2011Bayés A. van de Lagemaat L.N. Collins M.O.

The differential expression of these proteins raises the possibility that there is high synapse diversity within the brain (Grant, 2007Grant S.G. Toward a molecular catalogue of synapses.Brain Res.

Deep molecular diversity of mammalian synapses: why it matters and how to measure it.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although it is routine to examine the expression of proteins and the morphology of individual synapses in small tissue areas (using light and electron microscopy), there are no methods permitting the study of single-synapse molecular composition on the scale of the whole brain. As a result, the extent and spatial organization of synapse diversity across the brain are poorly understood. The term synaptome describes the set of all synapses in the brain, and to date, there has not been a single-synapse-resolution molecular map of the nervous system in any organism. Synapses connect axons and dendrites into a global anatomical network that is often referred to as the structural connectome, whereas the functional connectome describes the activity of this network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009Bullmore E. Sporns O. Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (7297) Google Scholar). Synaptome mapping could be used to ask if the spatial distribution of synapses with different proteomes is related to connectome architecture. If so, this would support a fundamental role for synapse diversity in the specification of connections and systems-level organization and function. Synaptome mapping at single-synapse resolution could also increase the anatomical resolution of the connection matrix between brain regions. Synapse diversity might be important for cognitive function. The prevailing model explaining how cognitive processes are represented in the brain is one in which each behavior is the product of a circuit or ensemble of neurons—the connectionist model. If circuits comprised diverse synapse types, arising from the differential distribution of proteins controlling synapse physiology, then this would result in functional diversity where each synapse type would respond differently to patterns of neural activity and thereby shape the circuit activity. Thus, synapse diversity could be an important mechanism for representing information within the brain. Identifying the synapses that express disease-relevant proteins will also be important for understanding how the more than 130 diseases arising from mutations in postsynaptic proteins cause their phenotypes (Bayés et al., 2011Bayés A. van de Lagemaat L.N. Collins M.O. Croning M.D. Whittle I.R. Choudhary J.S. Grant S.G. Characterization of the proteome, diseases and evolution of the human postsynaptic density.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Mutations that reorganized synapse diversity could result in changes to circuit function and representations. We developed methods to capture information on the molecular composition and morphology of individual synapses on the scale of the whole mouse brain. From these data, we generated the first synaptome molecular maps of any organism. The approach utilizes mice expressing fluorescently labeled postsynaptic proteins and a semi-automated standardized image capture and analysis suite. We focused on two postsynaptic proteins expressed at excitatory synapses, PSD95 (Postsynaptic Density 95) and SAP102 (Synapse-Associated Protein 102), for the following reasons. First, we have extensive experience in genome engineering of these proteins in mice (Broadhead et al., 2016Broadhead M.J. Horrocks M.H. Zhu F. Muresan L. Benavides-Piccione R. DeFelipe J. Fricker D.

In double-homozygous knockin mice, all copies of these proteins are labeled, which enables their visualization and quantification in individual postsynaptic puncta throughout the brain. Second, PSD95 and SAP102 are abundant and stable postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, which assemble neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and structural and signaling proteins into multiprotein signaling complexes (Broadhead et al., 2016Broadhead M.J.

Here, we report that synapse diversity arising from the differential distribution of postsynaptic proteins generates a previously unanticipated synaptome architecture across scales from single synapses to the entire brain. We provide resources quantifying synapse types and molecular distributions across the mouse brain (http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org) and a suite of analysis tools, including Synaptome Explorer for viewing individual synapses in the mouse brain. The generation and availability of these resources will be of widespread benefit in the neuroscience community. To label and map the molecular composition of individual synapses across the whole mouse brain, we built a synaptome mapping pipeline (SYNMAP) consisting of four main components: (1) genetic tagging of synaptic proteins in knockin mice, (2) tissue imaging, (3) image and data analysis, and (4) data storage and dissemination (Figure 1). Because genetic tagging of endogenous proteins assures quantitative labeling, we fused PSD95 with eGFP and SAP102 with mKO2 using gene targeting, producing PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 knockin mice (Figures 1A and S1). Normal protein expression levels (Figures S2A and S2B), regional expression (Figures S2C and S2D; Fukaya and Watanabe, 2000Fukaya M. Watanabe M.

Neurol. 2000; 426: 572-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), postsynaptic localization (Figure S3), and absence of electrophysiological perturbations (Figures S4 and S5) confirmed that gene tagging did not detectably alter endogenous protein function. Both proteins labeled discrete postsynaptic puncta, and crossing of PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 mice enabled comparisons of their expression patterns (Figures 1A, 2A , and S6).Figure 2Whole-Brain-Scale Mapping of PSD95 and SAP102Show full caption(A) PSD95 (green) and SAP102 (magenta) expression in stitched down-sampled images of five coronal sections (S1–S5).

(G) Dendrogram showing hierarchical organization of subregions based on their similarity. Branch tips represent delineated subregions, colored as in (B). Single-synapse-resolution imaging across brain sections required high-speed spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDM), which offers near-diffraction-limit resolution (∼290 nm in xy) (Huang et al., 2010Huang B.

For each punctum, we measured a set of parameters, including intensity, size, and shape. The size and shape of synaptic junctions correlate with synaptic strength, efficacy, and plasticity (Ganeshina et al., 2004Ganeshina O. Berry R.W. Petralia R.S. Nicholson D.A. Geinisman Y.

Advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms were developed to segment individual synaptic puncta, measure their spatial distribution, and classify them in an unsupervised manner. The validity of detection and quantification of synaptic punctum parameters by SDM was established by the high correlation of SDM data with published data (Broadhead et al., 2016Broadhead M.J.

Rep. 2016; 6: 24626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) from laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and super-resolution gated stimulated emission depletion (g-STED) microscopy (Figure S7). Synapse diversity was evident in different neuronal types and brain regions; for example, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons had large PSD95-eGFP puncta (characteristic of “thorny excrescence” synapses), in contrast to the small puncta in pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex (Figure S3). Furthermore, different brain regions showed differential distributions of PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 (Figure S6). To study this synapse diversity at the whole-brain scale, we performed synaptome mapping by imaging five coronal sections covering 13 overarching brain areas: isocortex, olfactory areas (OLFs), hippocampal formation (HPF), cortical subplate (CTXsp), striatum (STR), pallidum (PAL), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus (HY), midbrain (MB), pons (P), medulla (MY), cerebellum (CB), and fiber tracts (FT) (Figure 2). These were further subdivided into ∼800 delineated subregions over both hemispheres, representing >300 unique subregions aligned with those in the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) (Dong, 2008Dong H.-W. Allen Reference Atlas: A Digital Color Brain Atlas of the C57black/6J Male Mouse. Wiley, 2008Google Scholar). We also developed an unsupervised mapping strategy devoid of a priori constraints on region boundaries in which the density of synapse parameters, type, or subtype (described below) were quantified in voxels (19 × 19 × 0.5 μm). The sets of synaptome maps are available on our website (http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org). We have also developed an interactive software application called Synaptome Explorer that allows visualization of individual synaptic puncta and their intensities, sizes, types, and subtypes across the five coronal sections (STAR Methods; Video S1). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3M2MxMDc5NWEzODUwMGJkYmQ4ODc5MzA4ZjYwYTlkOCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3Nzk3MjkzfQ.rXY8AZmENwgjqDjdNSEJelfXySEQM9O5g5n-YdDmlgCeLJKszl227rWmeQtjdjXfXZ4FTj753qF26TK4lxax28kZ8Rhmni1VsepT68EcHZi2bBFno70NmVWffq2Rdxn6oFjeWiyjOdfPsvvxRb7Y1mpUatP9AFOX0B47B889O3KL4KbGtp9WEkhnsPqYVELNFQIXVDxhmZztzXYcvHqa1vXTvmiZTPLbVJDyTpZMg6Z0lP4HqPsNoILoffwl_8PDtickgFfwy4QUXw3wX2dmCbFubRG-8zVE3OzHE1Nl5RQlvu_DRbfkjhig3A3AU9N3XSdAfveavWdx-TriejvURg Download .mp4 (79.88 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

A striking and distinct anatomical patterning of PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 puncta was observed in the low-magnification view of brain sections (Figures 2A and S6A). High-magnification images showed that this patterning reflected the differential distribution of the two proteins in populations of synapses in different brain areas (Figure S6B). Therefore, our first goal was to quantify the punctum parameters in synapse populations from delineated areas defined by the ARA. We observed unique regional distributions of punctum density (number of puncta per area), intensity (reflecting protein amount), and size (reflecting PSD size) for each protein, as well as for the percentage of puncta expressing both proteins (colocalization) (Figures 2B, 2C, and S8; Table S1).

https://openalex.org/W2886241640,"Replication origins, fragile sites, and rDNA have been implicated as sources of chromosomal instability. However, the defining genomic features of replication origins and fragile sites are among the least understood elements of eukaryote genomes. Here, we map sites of replication initiation and breakage in primary cells at high resolution. We find that replication initiates between transcribed genes within nucleosome-depleted structures established by long asymmetrical poly(dA:dT) tracts flanking the initiation site. Paradoxically, long (>20 bp) (dA:dT) tracts are also preferential sites of polar replication fork stalling and collapse within early-replicating fragile sites (ERFSs) and late-replicating common fragile sites (CFSs) and at the rDNA replication fork barrier. Poly(dA:dT) sequences are fragile because long single-strand poly(dA) stretches at the replication fork are unprotected by the replication protein A (RPA). We propose that the evolutionary expansion of poly(dA:dT) tracts in eukaryotic genomes promotes replication initiation, but at the cost of chromosome fragility."
https://openalex.org/W2887106193,"Neocortical expansion, thought to underlie the cognitive traits unique to humans, is accompanied by cortical folding. This folding starts around gestational week (GW) 20, but what causes it remains largely unknown. Extracellular matrix (ECM) has been previously implicated in neocortical expansion and here we investigate the potential role of ECM in the formation of neocortical folds. We focus on three specific ECM components localized in the human fetal cortical plate (CP): hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1), lumican and collagen I (collectively, HLC). Addition of HLC to cultures of human fetal neocortex (11–22 GW) caused local changes in tissue stiffness, induced CP folding, increased CP hyaluronic acid (HA), and required the HA-receptor CD168 and downstream ERK signaling. Importantly, loss of HA reduced HLC-induced and 22 GW physiological nascent folds. This was altered in samples with neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating it may be a useful system to study such disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2608146202,"The ensemble method random forests has become a popular classification tool in bioinformatics and related fields. The out-of-bag error is an error estimation technique often used to evaluate the accuracy of a random forest and to select appropriate values for tuning parameters, such as the number of candidate predictors that are randomly drawn for a split, referred to as mtry. However, for binary classification problems with metric predictors it has been shown that the out-of-bag error can overestimate the true prediction error depending on the choices of random forests parameters. Based on simulated and real data this paper aims to identify settings for which this overestimation is likely. It is, moreover, questionable whether the out-of-bag error can be used in classification tasks for selecting tuning parameters like mtry, because the overestimation is seen to depend on the parameter mtry. The simulation-based and real-data based studies with metric predictor variables performed in this paper show that the overestimation is largest in balanced settings and in settings with few observations, a large number of predictor variables, small correlations between predictors and weak effects. There was hardly any impact of the overestimation on tuning parameter selection. However, although the prediction performance of random forests was not substantially affected when using the out-of-bag error for tuning parameter selection in the present studies, one cannot be sure that this applies to all future data. For settings with metric predictor variables it is therefore strongly recommended to use stratified subsampling with sampling fractions that are proportional to the class sizes for both tuning parameter selection and error estimation in random forests. This yielded less biased estimates of the true prediction error. In unbalanced settings, in which there is a strong interest in predicting observations from the smaller classes well, sampling the same number of observations from each class is a promising alternative."
https://openalex.org/W2885349901,"Summary Neurons in the developing auditory system exhibit spontaneous bursts of activity before hearing onset. How this intrinsically generated activity influences development remains uncertain, because few mechanistic studies have been performed in vivo. We show using macroscopic calcium imaging in unanesthetized mice that neurons responsible for processing similar frequencies of sound exhibit highly synchronized activity throughout the auditory system during this critical phase of development. Spontaneous activity normally requires synaptic excitation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Unexpectedly, tonotopic spontaneous activity was preserved in a mouse model of deafness in which glutamate release from hair cells is abolished. SGNs in these mice exhibited enhanced excitability, enabling direct neuronal excitation by supporting cell-induced potassium transients. These results indicate that homeostatic mechanisms maintain spontaneous activity in the pre-hearing period, with significant implications for both circuit development and therapeutic approaches aimed at treating congenital forms of deafness arising through mutations in key sensory transduction components."
https://openalex.org/W2887556343,"FOXP2, initially identified for its role in human speech, contains two nonsynonymous substitutions derived in the human lineage. Evidence for a recent selective sweep in Homo sapiens, however, is at odds with the presence of these substitutions in archaic hominins. Here, we comprehensively reanalyze FOXP2 in hundreds of globally distributed genomes to test for recent selection. We do not find evidence of recent positive or balancing selection at FOXP2. Instead, the original signal appears to have been due to sample composition. Our tests do identify an intronic region that is enriched for highly conserved sites that are polymorphic among humans, compatible with a loss of function in humans. This region is lowly expressed in relevant tissue types that were tested via RNA-seq in human prefrontal cortex and RT-PCR in immortalized human brain cells. Our results represent a substantial revision to the adaptive history of FOXP2, a gene regarded as vital to human evolution."

Preterm birth is estimated to affect approximately 5%–18% of newborns worldwide with an increasing incidence rate each year (Blencowe et al., 2012Blencowe H. Cousens S. Oestergaard M.Z. Chou D.

Unfortunately, relevant therapies to promote functional recovery are still unavailable. The major component of white matter is the myelin sheath, generated by mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) that differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the CNS (Chang et al., 2016Chang K.J.

Neurol. 2010; 6: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Myelin ensures the precise and rapid conduction of action potentials, while OLs provide metabolic support to meet the energy demand of axons (Morrison et al., 2013Morrison B.M. Lee Y. Rothstein J.D.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that hypomyelination and insufficient numbers of mature OLs are prominent after WMI, presumably owing to a wave of acute cell death of immature OLs and inhibitory environmental cues preventing OPC differentiation (Fancy et al., 2014Fancy S.P.J.

This suggests that a failure in differentiation rather than survival or proliferation of OPCs contributes to hypomyelination in WMI brains.

Hypomyelination typically coincides with other pathological changes. For instance, a number of studies have demonstrated that a delay in synaptogenesis accompanies hypomyelination in hypoxic brains (Curristin et al., 2002Curristin S.M. Cao A. Stewart W.B. Zhang H.

Therefore, determining the specific functional significance of myelination requires oligodendroglial-specific genetic manipulations that alter oligodendroglial differentiation in the CNS. Previously, we and others have reported that the transcription factor Olig2 acts as a positive regulator of oligodendroglial differentiation and that the muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R) acts as a negative regulator (Mei et al., 2013Mei F.

Genetic manipulation of these genes in oligodendroglia provides us with a unique opportunity to uncouple the functional importance of myelination in hypoxia brains. In this study, we examine the functional significance of myelination on WMI by OPC-specific deletion of Olig2 (loss of function) or M1R (gain of function). Our results demonstrate that hypomyelination specifically contributes to the significant loss of excitatory synapses and prolonged functional deficits after chronic hypoxia and that myelination-enhancing strategies represent a promising approach for functional recovery following WMI. To determine whether chronic hypoxia is a reasonable model to recapitulate hypoxia-induced diffuse brain injury in prenatal infants, we set out to examine the effect of chronic hypoxia (10% oxygen) on newborn mice from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P10, corresponding to gestation week 32–40 in humans (Ortega et al., 2016Ortega S.B.

To exclude variations from different litters, we exposed half of each litter to hypoxia with their birth mother, and the other half to normoxia (room air, 21% oxygen) with a foster mother. At P10, we examined myelination and quantified the number of mature OLs in the CNS by immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP) and, CC1, respectively (Figures 1B–1E). As expected, MBP expression was significantly diminished, and the numbers of CC1 positive OLs were greatly reduced in hypoxic brains as compared to normoxia littermates (Figures 1B–1E). Consistent with the changes, the number of nodes of Ranvier was greatly decreased in the hypoxic spinal cords, indicated by immunostaining for Caspr, a paranodal marker, and sodium channel 1.6 (Nav1.6), a nodal marker (Figure 1F) (Chang et al., 2016Chang K.J. Redmond S.A. Chan J.R. Remodeling myelination: Implications for mechanisms of neural plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar to the immunostaining results, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) showed much fewer myelinated axons in the corpus callosum of hypoxic brains as compared to the normoxic control littermates (Figure 1G). It is important to note that the NF200 positive axon densities were not altered in the brains after hypoxia (Figures 1B′, 1B″, 1C′, 1C″, and 1D) suggesting that chronic hypoxia may not cause significant axonal degeneration. Further, we examined axonal degeneration by labeling for SMI-32 and apoptosis by TUNEL assay, respectively (Figures S1A and S1B), and neither axonal degeneration nor neuronal apoptosis was apparent in the hypoxic brains (Figures S1A and S1B). In response to hypoxia, NG2 positive OPC numbers were overtly increased in the hypoxic brains (Figure S1D). These results suggest that chronic hypoxia inhibits oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination in the developing CNS. Since a delay in synaptogenesis may be coincident with hypomyelination in hypoxic brains (Curristin et al., 2002Curristin S.M. Cao A. Stewart W.B. Zhang H. Madri J.A. Morrow J.S. Ment L.R. Disrupted synaptic development in the hypoxic newborn brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 15729-15734Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we next examined whether hypoxia alters synaptogenesis in layers 3–4 of the cortex. Given that motor deficits are consistently observed in WMI patients (Misumi et al., 2016Misumi S. Ueda Y. Nishigaki R. Suzuki M. Ishida A. Jung C.G. Hida H. Dysfunction in motor coordination in neonatal white matter injury model without apparent neuron loss.Cell Transplant. 2016; 25: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we selected the motor cortex (M2) to immunostain for the pan-presynaptic marker, Synapsin1 (De Camilli et al., 1983De Camilli P. Harris Jr., S.M. Huttner W.B. Greengard P. Synapsin I (Protein I), a nerve terminal-specific phosphoprotein. II. Its specific association with synaptic vesicles demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in agarose-embedded synaptosomes.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1355-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and the pan-postsynaptic marker, Homer1 (Tu et al., 1998Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Homer binds a novel proline-rich motif and links group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors with IP3 receptors.Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) at P10 (Figures 2A–2C). The pre- and postsynaptic markers are closely associated with the somatodendritic membranes of MAP2 positive neurons (Figures 2A–2C). Strikingly, the densities of both Synapsin1 and Homer1 positive puncta were significantly decreased in the hypoxic brains without altering the number of MAP2 positive neurons (Figure 2E), suggesting that hypoxia can inhibit synaptogenesis. Next, we examined the excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals by labeling vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) and vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT), respectively (Minelli et al., 2003Minelli A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Edwards R.H. DeFelipe J. Conti F. Postnatal development of the vesicular GABA transporter in rat cerebral cortex.Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Paolicelli et al., 2017Paolicelli R.C.

Lee V.M. et al.TDP-43 depletion in microglia promotes amyloid clearance but also induces synapse loss.Neuron. 2017; 95: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We found that the number of vGlut1 puncta but not vGAT was greatly reduced in hypoxic brains at P10 as compared to the normoxia littermates (Figures 2D and S1C), suggesting that chronic hypoxia greatly inhibits excitatory presynaptic innervation. Since the chronic hypoxia mouse model is characterized by mild and global diffuse brain injury without prominent axonal degeneration or neuronal death (Figures S1A and SB), the synaptic loss does not seem to be attributed to neuron or axonal degeneration. Since chronic hypoxia inhibits excitatory presynaptic innervation, we next assessed excitatory synaptic function by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) from pyramidal neurons in the M2 cortex at P21 (Figure 3A). The mEPSC amplitudes were unchanged, whereas the frequency was significantly decreased in the hypoxic brains as compared to the normoxic controls (Figures 3B–3D), indicating that chronic hypoxia severely attenuates excitatory synaptic function. Considering that both synaptogenesis and myelination are actively developing throughout late pregnancy and during the postnatal period, we next asked whether hypoxic insult could result in long-term impairments on synaptogenesis and myelination in adolescent mice. The expression of MBP was greatly reduced in the hypoxic cortex at P40 as well as levels of Synapsin1 and Homer1 expression (Figures S2A–S2E). These results indicate that neonatal hypoxic exposure can result in long-term impairment of myelination and synaptogenesis. Next, we examined functional deficits in adolescent mice by applying a beam-walking test to assess motor coordination in the hypoxic mice at P40 and calculating the frequency of foot slippage while walking the length of the beam (Figure 3E). Consistent with the pathological observations, the frequency of foot slippage from the hypoxic mice was significantly increased as compared to the normoxic controls (Figure 3E), suggesting that chronic hypoxia results in prolonged behavioral deficits (Scafidi et al., 2014Scafidi J. Hammond T.R. Scafidi S. Ritter J. Jablonska B. Roncal M. Szigeti-Buck K. Coman D. Huang Y. McCarter Jr., R.J. et al.Intranasal epidermal growth factor treatment rescues neonatal brain injury.Nature. 2014; 506: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Zonouzi et al., 2015Zonouzi M.

Cull-Candy S.G. et al.GABAergic regulation of cerebellar NG2 cell development is altered in perinatal white matter injury.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that chronic hypoxia results in hypomyelination and disruption of synaptogenesis, which may lead to functional impairment in adolescent mice. Given that hypomyelination is accompanied by disrupted synaptogenesis and functional deficits after chronic hypoxia, we decided to ask whether hypomyelination could specifically contribute to synaptic loss and behavioral impairments. To determine the direct effect of hypomyelination and examine its functional consequence, we ablated Olig2 specifically in oligodendroglia to mimic the hypomyelination phenotype observed in hypoxic brains. It has been previously shown that Olig2 is an essential transcriptional factor that is important in regulating the specification and differentiation of OLs (Mei et al., 2013Mei F. Wang H. Liu S. Niu J. Wang L. He Y. Etxeberria A. Chan J.R. Xiao L. Stage-specific deletion of Olig2 conveys opposing functions on differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes.J.

The bHLH transcription factor Olig2 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in collaboration with Nkx2.2.Neuron. 2001; 31: 791-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Olig2-floxed mouse line was crossed with the CNP-Cre line to induce Olig2 deletion in OPCs (Mei et al., 2013Mei F. Wang H. Liu S. Niu J. Wang L. He Y. Etxeberria A. Chan J.R. Xiao L. Stage-specific deletion of Olig2 conveys opposing functions on differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 8454-8462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As expected, conditional deletion of Olig2 in OPCs resulted in a decrease in MBP expression in the corpus callosum and cortex of the Olig2 cKO brains (CNP-Cre; Olig2 fl/fl) at P10 when compared to wild-type littermates (Olig2 fl//fl) (Figure 4A). Consistent with this evidence, the number of nodes of Ranvier, indicated by immunostaining for Caspr and Nav1.6, was significantly decreased in the Olig2 cKO spinal cords at P10 (Figure 4B) and the numbers of myelinated axons were also reduced in the Olig2 cKO corpus callosum at P15 when examined by TEM (Figure 4C). By P42, MBP expression in the corpus callosum of the Olig2 cKO brains was comparable to the wild-type littermates, but decreased MBP expression persisted in the cortex (Figures 4D and 4E). It is notable that NF200 positive axonal densities were not significantly altered (Figure 4E) and SMI-32 expression was undetectable (Figure S3E) in the Olig2 cKO brains, indicating that the delay in myelination does not result in axonal degeneration in the adolescent mice. Since Olig2 deletion in OPCs phenocopies the change in myelination of hypoxic brains, we next asked whether hypomyelination could alter synaptogenesis in the M2 cortex. Interestingly, coincident with hypomyelination, the levels of Synapsin1 and Homer1 positive puncta were significantly decreased in the hypoxic brains without altering the number of MAP2 positive neurons (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D ), suggesting that hypomyelination may directly inhibit synaptogenesis. Consistent with these findings, vGlut1 positive puncta were significantly decreased in the M2 cortex of Olig2 cKO brains as compared to wild-type mice at P10 (Figures 5C and 5D), suggesting that disrupted excitatory presynaptic innervation was a direct result of hypomyelination. Next, we assessed synaptic function by recording mEPSCs from the pyramidal excitatory neurons in the M2 cortex at P14 (Figure 5E). Consistent with the changes in synaptic markers, the mEPSC frequency was significantly decreased, while the amplitude was unchanged in the Olig2-cKO brains (Figure 5E), indicating disrupted excitatory synaptic function. Once again, the beam-walking examination displayed a higher frequency of foot slippage in the Olig2-cKO mice as compared to the wild-type littermates even at P42 (Figure 5F). Consistent with these findings, the rotarod test revealed that the Olig2 cKO mice exhibited an increased probability to fall from the spinning rod than the wild-type littermates (Figure 5G). To exclude the possibility that Olig2 in mature OLs is required for the maintenance of myelin or axonal integrity, we crossed the Olig2-floxed line to the PLP-CreERt driver line to induce Olig2 deletion in mature OLs by tamoxifen at P40 (Figures S3A and S3B). No signs of demyelination or axonal degeneration were observed in the Olig2 cKO (PLP-CreERt; Olig2 fl/fl) brains at P80, indicated by immunostaining for MBP and TEM (Figures S3C and S3D). These results demonstrate that a delay in myelination disrupts the proper timing of synaptogenesis and results in prolonged motor deficits. Given the necessity of myelination for neuronal functional development, we sought to ask whether enhancing oligodendroglial differentiation is sufficient to rescue the hypomyelination phenotype and consequently the synaptic deficits and behavioral response in hypoxic mice. To accelerate myelination without altering other cell types, we induced the cell-specific deletion of the muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R) in OPCs. We previously identified the M1R as a negative regulator for oligodendroglial differentiation, and deletion of M1R in OPCs resulted in the enhanced intrinsic ability to differentiate and myelinate axons (Mei et al., 2016aMei F. Lehmann-Horn K. Shen Y.-A.A. Rankin K.A. Stebbins K.J. Lorrain D.S. Pekarek K. A Sagan S. Xiao L. Teuscher C. et al.Accelerated remyelination during inflammatory demyelination prevents axonal loss and improves functional recovery.eLife. 2016; 5: 1-21Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the M1R-floxed line was crossed with the NG2-CreERt driver line to generate inducible OPC-specific M1R knockout mice (NG2-CreERt; M1R fl/fl). Recombination was induced by administration of tamoxifen concomitantly with chronic hypoxia treatment from P3 to P10 and histology was performed at P10 (Figure 6A). M1R deletion in OPCs resulted in enhanced MBP expression and increased CC1 positive OL numbers in the corpus callosum and cortex as compared to the wild-type (M1R fl/fl) littermates (Figures 6B and 6C). Additionally, the formation of nodes of Ranvier, indicated by immunostaining for Caspr and Nav1.6, was enhanced in the spinal cord at P10 (Figure 6D). Under TE"
https://openalex.org/W2886602471,"Akt is a critical protein kinase that drives cancer proliferation, modulates metabolism, and is activated by C-terminal phosphorylation. The current structural model for Akt activation by C-terminal phosphorylation has centered on intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal tail and the N lobe of the kinase domain. Here, we employ expressed protein ligation to produce site-specifically phosphorylated forms of purified Akt1 that are well suited for mechanistic analysis. Using biochemical, crystallographic, and cellular approaches, we determine that pSer473-Akt activation is driven by an intramolecular interaction between the C-tail and the pleckstrin homology (PH)-kinase domain linker that relieves PH domain-mediated Akt1 autoinhibition. Moreover, dual phosphorylation at Ser477/Thr479 activates Akt1 through a different allosteric mechanism via an apparent activation loop interaction that reduces autoinhibition by the PH domain and weakens PIP3 affinity. These results provide a new framework for understanding how Akt is controlled in cell signaling and suggest distinct functions for differentially modified Akt forms."

Central to metabolic homeostasis is the kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that exists as two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A.

While both complexes bind common partners through mTOR’s middle and C-terminal domains, mTORC1 and mTORC2 are distinguished by unique N-terminal regulators that utilize similar and mutually exclusive binding strategies. mTORC1 is bound by regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) (Hara et al., 2002Hara K.

As mTORC1 lies downstream of Akt, to prevent a continuous feed-forward loop, the mTORC1 substrate p70S6K suppresses mTORC2, while another mTORC1 substrate Grb10 suppresses PI3K signaling (Hsu et al., 2011Hsu P.P.

This establishes negative feedback that balances mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities (Figure 1A). Many RNA viruses employ cap-independent modes of translation initiation and suppress mTORC1 to inhibit host protein synthesis (Jan et al., 2016Jan E. Mohr I. Walsh D. A Cap-to-Tail Guide to mRNA Translation Strategies in Virus-Infected Cells.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2016; 3: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By contrast, many DNA viruses impair host translation by impairing mRNA biogenesis, export, and/or stability and often stimulate mTORC1 to foster cap-dependent translation of their own mRNAs (Jan et al., 2016Jan E. Mohr I. Walsh D. A Cap-to-Tail Guide to mRNA Translation Strategies in Virus-Infected Cells.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2016; 3: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A common strategy to do so is receptor-mediated activation of PI3K. Additionally, for example, myxomavirus M-T5 protein binds and activates Akt, cytomegalovirus UL38 binds and inactivates TSC, and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) kinase Us3 acts as an Akt mimic (Chuluunbaatar et al., 2010Chuluunbaatar U.

However, there are no reports of viruses targeting mTORC1 or mTORC2 directly. Beyond exploiting host metabolic regulators, viruses must also contend with an armory of immune sensors aimed at detecting their presence (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Regulation and function of the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). While all viruses must evade RNA sensors, DNA viruses face the added obstacle of complex DNA sensing pathways. Most, if not all DNA sensors activate stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) that recruits tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to phosphorylate IFN response factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus to induce IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008Ishikawa H. Barber G.N.

Among the primary cytosolic sensors identified, AIM2 mainly initiates inflammatory responses (Hornung et al., 2009Hornung V. Ablasser A. Charrel-Dennis M. Bauernfeind F. Horvath G. Caffrey D.R. Latz E. Fitzgerald K.A. AIM2 recognizes cytosolic dsDNA and forms a caspase-1-activating inflammasome with ASC.Nature. 2009; 458: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), while Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and cyclic-di-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthetase (cGAS) function in antiviral immunity (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q.

TLR9 is expressed in specialized immune cells. By contrast, cGAS is the primary cytoplasmic DNA sensor expressed in many cell types. Upon binding DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP that directly activates STING (Ablasser et al., 2013Ablasser A. Goldeck M. Cavlar T. Deimling T. Witte G. Röhl I. Hopfner K.P. Ludwig J.

USA. 2015; 112: E1773-E1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Indeed, in most instances, viral DNA in the cytoplasm is both limited in quantity and shielded within viral capsids. A notable exception is infection by poxviruses, a family of extraordinarily self-sufficient DNA viruses that replicate entirely in the cytoplasm within structures called viral factories (VFs) (Moss, 2015Moss B. Poxvirus membrane biogenesis.Virology. 2015; 479-480: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Smith et al., 2018Smith G.L. Talbot-Cooper C. Lu Y. How Does Vaccinia Virus Interfere With Interferon?.Adv. Virus Res. 2018; 100: 355-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Poxviruses include Variola virus (VarV), the causative agent of smallpox, and Vaccinia virus (VacV), the smallpox vaccine and laboratory prototype for poxvirus studies. Poxvirus infection initiates in dermal fibroblasts followed by skin-resident macrophages or in alveolar macrophages, in the case of aerosol transmission. Macrophages then carry the virus to the blood stream, where it spreads to distal sites, replicating once again in dermal fibroblasts to cause characteristic pustules. Recent studies have established that although TLR9 plays a minor role in sensing poxvirus infection in immune cells, cGAS is its primary sensor (Dai et al., 2014Dai P. Wang W. Cao H. Avogadri F.

Sumner R.P. Towers G.J. Maluquer de Motes C. Virulent poxviruses inhibit DNA sensing by preventing STING activation.J. Virol. 2018; Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the cGAS response and the viral antagonist that allows poxviruses to replicate remain mysterious. Here, we show that poxviruses evade cytosolic sensing through a conserved structural protein that disrupts an mTORC1-mTORC2 regulatory circuit. VacV biphasically activates PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, first during early entry and again at later stages (Soares et al., 2009Soares J.A. Leite F.G. Andrade L.G. Torres A.A. De Sousa L.P. Barcelos L.S.

PI3K signaling regulates rapamycin-insensitive translation initiation complex formation in vaccinia virus-infected cells.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As prior studies used PI3K, Akt, or mTOR inhibitor pre-treatments, effects on early replication confound our understanding of mTOR function at later stages. To address this, we tested the effects of inhibitors when added after infection was already established in growth-arrested primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs), a natural target cell type for infection in vivo. In NHDFs, infection enters late stages ∼16–20 hr post infection (hpi), characterized by the onset of host translation shut-off and increasing synthesis of late poxvirus proteins (Figure S1A). To compare translational dependencies on mTOR, uninfected or VacV-infected NHDFs were pulsed between 20 and 22 hpi with either of two mTOR catalytic site inhibitors, PP242 or Torin1. Western blot (WB) analysis of two of mTORC1’s best-characterized substrates, p70S6K and 4E-BP1 (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017Saxton R.A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR Signaling in Growth, Metabolism, and Disease.Cell. 2017; 169: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), confirmed the efficacy of inhibitors in both uninfected and infected cells (Figure S1B). 35S-Met/Cys labeling showed that although poxviruses modify ribosomes and can utilize cap-dependent or cap-independent initiation (Dhungel et al., 2017Dhungel P. Cao S. Yang Z.

Rollins M.G. Fuchs G. Procter D.J. Hall E.A. Cozzolino K. Sarnow P. Savas J.N. Walsh D. Trans-kingdom mimicry underlies ribosome customization by a poxvirus kinase.Nature. 2017; 546: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), maximal rates of host or late viral protein synthesis were similarly dependent on mTOR (Figure S1B). This was also observed in HEK293A or BSC40 cells (Figure S1B). However, slower-migrating phosphorylated forms of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 persisted in infected cells when cultures were pulsed in a similar manner using the Akt inhibitor, AKTVIII, despite effective inhibition of Akt (Figure S1C). This revealed that once infection was established, Akt was no longer able to signal to mTORC1. Given this observation, we tested whether VacV affected the composition of mTORCs in NHDFs. Two independent anti-mTOR antibodies co-immunoprecipitated (coIPed) mLST8, a C-terminal-binding mTOR activator (Kim et al., 2003Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Latek R.R. Guntur K.V. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. GbetaL, a positive regulator of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway required for the nutrient-sensitive interaction between raptor and mTOR.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), but not unrelated proteins such as ERK1/2 (Figure 1B). However, VacV reduced the recovery of Raptor. This was not unique to NHDFs, as VacV also reduced the binding of both Raptor and Rictor to mTOR in HEK293A cells (Figure 1C). The relative enrichment of Rictor in coIP complexes over input lysates was greater than that for Raptor, and this was also observed in NHDFs below. This is in line with reports that Rictor binds mTOR more tightly than Raptor in several cell lines (Sarbassov et al., 2004Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Rictor, a novel binding partner of mTOR, defines a rapamycin-insensitive and raptor-independent pathway that regulates the cytoskeleton.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). To determine whether VacV encoded a protein(s) to control mTOR, we performed coIP-based screens of components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in metabolically labeled NHDFs. This approach exploits the fact that VacV induces host translation shut-off, and although target proteins are recovered in coIPs (Figures 1B and 1C and below), most 35S-labeled proteins in infected cells are viral. Screens identified an ∼11-kDa protein in Raptor or Rictor coIPs but not Akt or mTOR coIPs (Figures 1D and S2A). Low levels of synthesis and association of this protein with Raptor were detectable at earlier times (Figure S2B), showing that it was produced coincident with the switch to late stages of infection. This Raptor-associated protein was also evident on silver-stained gels (Figure 1E), and mass spectrometry identified it as F17 (formerly called F18; GenBank: AAO89335.1). F17 is an abundant and conserved poxvirus structural protein required for the formation of infectious virions, with no known non-structural function (Wickramasekera and Traktman, 2010Wickramasekera N.T. Traktman P. Structure/Function analysis of the vaccinia virus F18 phosphoprotein, an abundant core component required for virion maturation and infectivity.J.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6101-6110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether F17 was required for VacV to displace Raptor or Rictor, we infected NHDFs with wild-type (WT) VacV or the mutant vRR10K (Zhang and Moss, 1991Zhang Y.F. Moss B. Vaccinia virus morphogenesis is interrupted when expression of the gene encoding an 11-kilodalton phosphorylated protein is prevented by the Escherichia coli lac repressor.J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6101-6110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). vRR10K expresses F17 under the control of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactose (IPTG) to generate virus stocks. Virion-resident F17 is rapidly degraded upon cell entry (Schmidt et al., 2013Schmidt F.I. Bleck C.K. Reh L. Novy K. Wollscheid B. Helenius A. Stahlberg H. Mercer J. Vaccinia virus entry is followed by core activation and proteasome-mediated release of the immunomodulatory effector VH1 from lateral bodies.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 464-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the mutant then effectively operates as a null virus (ΔF17) in the absence of IPTG. CoIP of mTOR complexes from infected NHDFs revealed that unlike WT virus, ΔF17 was unable to reduce Raptor or Rictor binding to mTOR (Figure 1F). Infections also showed that unlike WT virus, ΔF17 failed to hyper-phosphorylate p70S6K (Figure 1G). Notably, ΔF17 elicited a modest increase in p70S6K phosphorylation over uninfected cells that, unlike WT infection, was sensitive to Akt inhibition. Thus, F17 hyper-activated mTOR and rendered it unresponsive to Akt, while moderate Akt-dependent signaling occurred in the absence of F17. Immunofluorescence (IF) imaging further revealed that in uninfected cells, both mTOR and Raptor were present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, similar to other cell types (Betz and Hall, 2013Betz C. Hall M.N. Where is mTOR and what is it doing there?.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). While their nuclear fractions appeared unaffected, in 94.5% of WT-infected cells, a population of mTOR, but not Raptor or Rictor, concentrated at perinuclear regions (Figures S2C and S2D). By contrast, mTOR did not relocalize in ΔF17-infected cells. Cumulatively, this suggested that F17 caused mTOR, lacking its regulatory subunits, to redistribute to perinuclear sites during infection. Testing F17 functionality outside the context of infection, FLAG-tagged F17 specifically bound Raptor and Rictor, but not Akt, when expressed in HEK293A cells (Figure 2A). F17 was recovered more readily in Raptor than in Rictor complexes, reflecting observations in NHDF-based screens (Figure 1D). Conversely, recovery of mTOR and mLST8 was higher in Rictor than in Raptor complexes, again suggesting Rictor binds mTOR more tightly than Raptor. These inverse relationships suggested that F17 competed with mTOR for binding to Raptor and Rictor. mTOR’s HEAT repeats (HRs) make several contacts with either Raptor or Rictor (Aylett et al., 2016Aylett C.H.

Maier T. Ban N. Architecture of the human mTORC2 core complex.eLife. 2018; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This involves both residues within a unique Raptor N-terminal conserved (RNC) domain and tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat domains in Raptor’s C terminus (Figure 2B). Although both domains are required for mTOR to bind Raptor, mTOR is unable to interact with either domain individually (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). By contrast, F17 bound to either full-length or the N-terminal half of Raptor harboring the RNC and short HR domain. Although it expressed poorly, a minimal RNC also bound F17, while the C-terminal WD repeats did not. Furthermore, F17 binding to full-length Raptor was found to depend upon four distinct, highly conserved amino acid stretches in the RNC that are required for mTOR binding (Kim et al., 2002Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. mTOR interacts with raptor to form a nutrient-sensitive complex that signals to the cell growth machinery.Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). As far as we are aware, this is the only protein known to bind the RNC alone and supports the notion that F17 competes with mTOR for Raptor binding. In line with this, co-expression of the Raptor-binding HR region of mTOR with F17 in HEK293A cells reduced F17 binding to endogenous Raptor (Figure 2E). Under conditions that affected F17 binding to Raptor, F17 abundance was also partially reduced (Figures 2C–2E). This suggested that binding to Raptor helps stabilize F17. F17 is phosphorylated at S53 and S62, but this is not required for virion formation, and the function, if any, of its phosphorylation remains mysterious (Wickramasekera and Traktman, 2010Wickramasekera N.T. Traktman P. Structure/Function analysis of the vaccinia virus F18 phosphoprotein, an abundant core component required for virion maturation and infectivity.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 6846-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These sites lie within an internal disordered region (Figures 2F, S3A, and S3B), and such regions often function in protein binding. Expression of F17 or F17 mutants with serine-to-alanine (S-A) or serine-to-glutamic-acid (S-E) substitutions showed that S-A mutations at either site individually had minimal effects on F17 association with Raptor, while mutation of both sites potently impaired this interaction (Figures 2G and S3C). By contrast, an F17 S-E phosphomimetic retained Raptor binding activity. Although infection stimulates host kinases that phosphorylate F17 (Wickramasekera and Traktman, 2010Wickramasekera N.T. Traktman P. Structure/Function analysis of the vaccinia virus F18 phosphoprotein, an abundant core component required for virion maturation and infectivity.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 6846-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), binding of exogenously expressed F17 to Raptor remained dependent on both S53 and S62 in ΔF17-infected cells (Figure 2H). The S53/62A mutant that failed to bind Raptor was also partially reduced in abundance in both uninfected and infected cells, further suggesting that its interaction with targets such as Raptor enhances F17 stability. Finally, expression of F17 or the mTOR HR region showed that Raptor/Rictor-binding proteins can enhance p70S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in NHDFs (Figure 2I). As such, F17 binds the Raptor RNC and regulates mTOR activity. We next assessed how the absence of F17 impacted infection. WB analysis of the early-intermediate protein I3 revealed no significant defects in early viral protein expression, while p70S6K mobility shifts showed modest stimulation of mTOR activity by both WT and ΔF17 viruses at early times (Figure S4A). However, although the accumulation of I3 and initial low levels of late (D8 and A14) viral proteins were compa"

Despite decades of research, attempts to effectively inhibit MYC, particularly with small molecules, still remain challenging due to the featureless nature of its protein structure. Herein, we describe the engineering of the dominant-negative MYC peptide (OmoMYC) linked to a functional penetrating ‘Phylomer’ peptide (FPPa) as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit MYC in TNBC. We found FPPa-OmoMYC to be a potent inducer of apoptosis (with IC50 from 1–2 µM) in TNBC cells with negligible effects in non-tumorigenic cells. Transcriptome analysis of FPPa-OmoMYC-treated cells indicated that the fusion protein inhibited MYC-dependent networks, inducing dynamic changes in transcriptional, metabolic, and apoptotic processes. We demonstrated the efficacy of FPPa-OmoMYC in inhibiting breast cancer growth when injected orthotopically in TNBC allografts. Lastly, we identified strong pharmacological synergisms between FPPa-OmoMYC and chemotherapeutic agents. This study highlights a novel therapeutic approach to target highly aggressive and chemoresistant MYC-activated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2887811105,"Objective A growing body of preclinical and clinical literature suggests that brain-gut-microbiota interactions play an important role in human health and disease, including hedonic food intake and obesity. We performed a tripartite network analysis based on graph theory to test the hypothesis that microbiota-derived fecal metabolites are associated with connectivity of key regions of the brain’s extended reward network and clinical measures related to obesity. Methods DTI and resting state fMRI imaging was obtained from 63 healthy subjects with and without elevated body mass index (BMI) (29 males and 34 females). Subjects submitted fecal samples, completed questionnaires to assess anxiety and food addiction, and BMI was recorded. Results The study results demonstrate associations between fecal microbiota-derived indole metabolites (indole, indoleacetic acid, and skatole) with measures of functional and anatomical connectivity of the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and anterior insula, in addition to BMI, food addiction scores (YFAS) and anxiety symptom scores (HAD Anxiety). Conclusions The findings support the hypothesis that gut microbiota-derived indole metabolites may influence hedonic food intake and obesity by acting on the extended reward network, specifically the amygdala-nucleus accumbens circuit and the amygdala-anterior insula circuit. These cross sectional, data-driven results provide valuable information for future mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2885684158,"Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons mediate fast inhibition of principal neurons in many brain areas; however, long-term plasticity at PV-interneuron output synapses has been less well studied. In the auditory cortex, thalamic inputs drive reliably timed action potentials (APs) in principal neurons and PV-interneurons. Using paired recordings in the input layer of the mouse auditory cortex, we found a marked spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at PV-interneuron output synapses. Long-term potentiation of inhibition (iLTP) is observed upon postsynaptic (principal neuron) then presynaptic (PV-interneuron) AP firing. The opposite AP order causes GABAB-mediated long-term depression of inhibition (iLTD), which is developmentally converted to iLTP in an experience-dependent manner. Genetic deletion of GABAB receptors in principal neurons suppressed iLTD and produced deficits in auditory map remodeling. Output synapses of PV-interneurons thus show marked STDP, and one limb of this plasticity, GABAB-dependent iLTD, is a candidate mechanism for disinhibition during auditory critical period plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2886221083,"Sensory input reaching the brain from bilateral and offset channels is nonetheless perceived as unified. This unity could be explained by simultaneous projections to both hemispheres, or inter-hemispheric information transfer between sensory cortical maps. Odor input, however, is not topographically organized, nor does it project bilaterally, making olfactory perceptual unity enigmatic. Here we report a circuit that interconnects mirror-symmetric isofunctional mitral/tufted cells between the mouse olfactory bulbs. Connected neurons respond to similar odors from ipsi- and contra-nostrils, whereas unconnected neurons do not respond to odors from the contralateral nostril. This connectivity is likely mediated through a one-to-one mapping from mitral/tufted neurons to the ipsilateral anterior olfactory nucleus pars externa, which activates the mirror-symmetric isofunctional mitral/tufted neurons glutamatergically. This circuit enables sharing of odor information across hemispheres in the absence of a cortical topographical organization, suggesting that olfactory glomerular maps are the equivalent of cortical sensory maps found in other senses."

Interestingly, it was reported that dissociation of αBc multimers can stimulate the chaperone activity of αBc against amyloid aggregation (37Peschek J. Braun N. Rohrberg J. Back K.C. Kriehuber T.

Therefore, it appears that the two functions of αBc (a structural multimer versus an amyloid chaperone) are negatively correlated, and the mechanism and regulation underlying the switch of the two functions have yet to be investigated. In this study, we found that αBc interacts with αSyn and Tau and prevents their amyloid aggregation by the conserved β4/β8 surface of CαBc. Interestingly, it is known that the C-terminal IPI motif of αBc also binds with the β4/β8 surface to mediate αBc multimerization. Thus, we further revealed that the interaction of IPI with αBc diminishes the chaperone activity of αBc; however, disruption of the interaction between IPI and αBc, which impairs αBc multimerization, in turn enhances its binding with amyloid clients and inhibits amyloid aggregation. Our work demonstrates that β4/β8 strands of αBc provide an interacting surface for the binding of different proteins/motifs that regulates αBc's activities between chaperoning amyloid clients and constructing eye lens via self-multimerization. We first characterized the chaperone activity of αBc in preventing the aggregation of different amyloid clients, including αSyn of Parkinson's disease and K19 (the repeat region of 3R-Tau) of Alzheimer's disease. αBc exhibits potent chaperone activity in inhibiting fibril formation of both αSyn and K19 in a dose-dependent manner as monitored by a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence kinetic assay and negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 1, B–D). Consistent with previous reports (33Baldwin A.J. Lioe H. Hilton G.R. Baker L.A. Rubinstein J.L. Kay L.E. Benesch J.L. The polydispersity of αB-crystallin is rationalized by an interconverting polyhedral architecture.Structure. 2011; 19 (10.1016/j.str.2011.09.015 22153508): 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Braun N.

U.S.A. 2011; 108 (10.1073/pnas.1111014108 22143763): 20491-20496Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we observed that αBc assembled into higher-order multimers in solution as measured by multiangle laser light scattering (Fig. S1A, left). Negative-stain EM further showed that αBc multimers are highly heterogeneous and feature spherical architectures with a diameter ranging from 15 to 30 nm (Fig. S1B). In sharp contrast to αBc, CαBc mainly populates as a dimer in solution with a molecular mass of ∼24.9 kDa (Fig. S1A, right). The ion mobility mass spectrum further showed an ensemble of CαBc monomer and dimer (Fig. S1C), indicating the dynamic nature of CαBc dimer. Intriguingly, compared with full-length αBc, CαBc exhibited a significantly enhanced chaperone activity in preventing both αSyn and K19 aggregation (Fig. 1, B–D). These results suggest that CαBc serves as a key region of αBc in preventing aggregation of different amyloid clients, but the chaperone activity is somehow weakened once CαBc is in the context of full-length αBc. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the chaperone activity of αBc, we conducted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between CαBc/αBc and αSyn. By titration of CαBc into 15N-labeled acetylated αSyn, we found that the N terminus of αSyn, especially residues Asp2, Val3, Phe4, Met5, and Lys6, exhibited subtle chemical shift perturbations (Figs. 2, A and B, and S2A). Titration of full-length αBc to αSyn induced chemical shift changes of the same N-terminal region of αSyn but with smaller perturbations (Figs. 2B and S2B), which is consistent with the stronger inhibitory effect of CαBc on αSyn aggregation than that of full-length αBc (Fig. 1D). These NMR results indicate a weak binding of CαBc and αBc to the N terminus of αSyn. Indeed, as we deleted the N-terminal 20 residues of αSyn (αSyn(21–140)), the inhibitory effects of both CαBc and αBc on αSyn(21–140) aggregation was completely abolished (Figs. 2C and (S2C). Notice that the N terminus of αSyn is involved in membrane binding (39Fusco G. De Simone A. Gopinath T. Vostrikov V. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Veglia G. Direct observation of the three regions in α-synuclein that determine its membrane-bound behaviour.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (10.1038/ncomms4827 24871041): 3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to inhibiting αSyn aggregation, αBc may also regulate binding of αSyn to membranes. To identify the interacting surface of αBc, we inversely titrated [15N]CαBc with αSyn. The result showed significant chemical shift perturbations of residues including Lys90, Lys92, Val93, Ile124, Thr134, Ser135, Ser136, and Leu137 (Figs. 3, A and B, and S3A). Most perturbed residues cluster on the β4/β8 strands of CαBc (Fig. 3C), implying that the interface of CαBc interacts with αSyn. The apparent Kd value for CαBc–αSyn complex was 275 ± 105 μm as determined by NMR titrations (Fig. S3C), confirming a weak binding between CαBc and its client αSyn. Intriguingly, the binding affinity was enhanced when the temperature was increased (Fig. S3D), indicating that environmental factors (e.g. temperature, pH, and salt) may be involved in regulating the interaction between CαBc and its client. To validate the NMR result, we mutated Lys90 and Lys92 in β4 to alanine (the double mutation is named “KA”). The KA mutation in both CαBc and αBc severely disrupted the chaperone activity of inhibiting αSyn aggregation (Fig. 3D). A previous study showed that the β4/β8 strands of αBc are also involved in Aβ40 binding (17Mainz A. Peschek J. Stavropoulou M. Back K.C. Bardiaux B. Asami S. Prade E. Peters C. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. Reif B. The chaperone αB-crystallin uses different interfaces to capture an amorphous and an amyloid client.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (10.1038/nsmb.3108 26458046): 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether αBc utilizes a common surface for the binding of different amyloid clients. To address this question, we titrated Tau K19 to [15N]CαBc. The result showed that residues involved in K19 binding are also located within the β4/β8 strands of CαBc, including Lys92, Val93, Leu94, Thr134, Ser136, and Leu137 (Fig. S3E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that αBc utilizes a common surface consisting of the β4/β8 strands to bind different amyloid clients, including αSyn, Aβ, and Tau. Intriguingly, the β4/β8 surface has been previously identified to interact with the C-terminal IPI motif of αBc (residues 156–164) to mediate αBc self-multimerization (36Hilton G.R. Hochberg G.K. Laganowsky A. McGinnigle S.I. Baldwin A.J. Benesch J.L. C-terminal interactions mediate the quaternary dynamics of αB-crystallin.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Vis. 2004; 10 (15448619): 655-662PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the β4/β8 surface is essential for both αBc multimerization and chaperone activity, and αBc multimers may represent a self-inhibitory conformation that hinders αBc from binding to amyloid clients. However, in CαBc, which does not contain the IPI motif, the β4/β8 surface is fully exposed to interact with amyloid clients, explaining its enhanced chaperone activity. We next investigated the competition between αSyn and the IPI motif in binding the β4/β8 surface of CαBc and its influence in modulating chaperone activity. First, we titrated synthetic peptide 156ERTIPITRE164 (named “IPI” peptide) to [15N]CαBc. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra showed significant chemical shift perturbations and intensity changes of residues, including Lys90, Val91, Lys92, Val93, Leu94, Ile124, Thr134, Ser135, and Ser136 (Fig. 4, A and B), which is consistent with a previous report (40Delbecq S.P. Jehle S. Klevit R. Binding determinants of the small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin: recognition of the ‘IxI' motif.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (10.1038/emboj.2012.318 23188086): 4587-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), indicating that the IPI peptide binds to the β4/β8 strands of CαBc in solution. Intriguingly, 40 μm IPI peptide induced significant HSQC spectral changes of CαBc (Fig. 4, A and B); such changes were only achieved by αSyn at 400 μm (Fig. 3, A and B). The result indicates that CαBc binds to the IPI peptide much tighter than to αSyn, which is consistent with previous studies by mass spectrometry showing that the Kd value for the IPI peptide binding to CαBc was 70 μm (36Hilton G.R. Hochberg G.K. Laganowsky A. McGinnigle S.I. Baldwin A.J. Benesch J.L. C-terminal interactions mediate the quaternary dynamics of αB-crystallin.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 368 (10.1098/rstb.2011.0405 23530258): 20110405Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We further mutated the central residues 159IPI161 of the IPI peptide to AAA (named “AAA” mutation) and observed that the changes on NMR spectra of CαBc were diminished, which indicates the vital role of the 159IPI161 segment in the binding of the IPI peptide to CαBc (Figs. 4A and S4, A and B). Notably, although similar residues of the β4/β8 surface are involved in the binding to the IPI peptide and αSyn, their binding patterns are significantly different as probed by NMR spectroscopy. αSyn binding induced a global intensity decrease of the entire CαBc (Fig. S3B). In contrast, binding of the IPI peptide resulted in a significant intensity drop (I/I0 < 0.4) of the interacting residues of the β4/β8 surface (Fig. 4B) in addition to a global decrease, implying that the interaction between IPI and CαBc is in the fast to intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale. Moreover, three residues, namely Lys90, Leu131, and Ser136, exhibit distinct chemical shift perturbation patterns for the two partners (Fig. 4C, left and right). These differences enabled us to directly monitor the competition between αSyn and the IPI peptide for binding CαBc at the residue level. We premixed [15N]CαBc (200 μm) and αSyn (400 μm) in solution, and then by the addition of IPI peptide we observed sequential chemical shift changes of residues Lys90, Leu131, and Ser136 as shown in Fig. 4C (middle), which indicates the replacement of αSyn by the IPI peptide from the binding of CαBc β4/β8. Only 40 μm IPI peptide, 10% of αSyn, was required to replace αSyn for CαBc binding, further validating that the binding affinity of the IPI peptide to CαBc is much higher than that of αSyn. Consistently, the IPI peptide significantly weakened the chaperone activity of CαBc against αSyn aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that αSyn and the free IPI peptide competitively bind to the same β4/β8 surface of CαBc, which indicates that this competition may regulate the two different functions of CαBc. To investigate the regulation of the dual functions of αBc as structural multimers and an amyloid chaperone, we first constructed αBc(69–175), which contains CαBc followed by the C terminus with the IPI motif. Similar to full-length αBc, αBc(69–175)"

However, protein aggregation involving both types of aggregates has not yet been elucidated in much detail. Using a protein associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, β2-microglobulin (β2m), we previously demonstrated that amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates form competitively depending on salt (NaCl) concentration. To examine the generality of the underlying competitive mechanisms, we herein investigated the effects of heat on acid-denatured β2m at pH 2. Using thioflavin fluorescence, CD, and light scattering analysis along with atomic force microscopy imaging, we found that the temperature-dependent aggregation of β2m markedly depends on NaCl concentration. Stepwise transitions from monomers to amyloids and then back to monomers were observed at low NaCl concentrations. Amorphous aggregates formed rapidly at ambient temperatures at high NaCl concentrations, but the transition from amorphous aggregates to amyloids occurred only as the temperature increased. Combining the data from the temperature- and NaCl-dependent transitions, we constructed a unified phase diagram of conformational states, indicating a parabolic solubility curve with a minimum NaCl concentration at ambient temperatures. Although amyloid fibrils formed above this solubility boundary, amorphous aggregates dominated in regions distant from this boundary. Kinetic competition between supersaturation-limited slow amyloid fibrillation and supersaturation-unlimited fast amorphous aggregation deformed the phase diagram, with amyloid regions disappearing with fast titration rates. We conclude that phase diagrams combining thermodynamics and kinetics data provide a comprehensive view of β2m aggregation exhibiting severe hysteresis depending on the heat- or salt-titration rates.

The nucleation phase, the duration of which is a lag time, is long because of a high free-energy barrier. Once amyloid nuclei form, the elongation of fibrils occurs rapidly.

Amorphous aggregates are an alternative form of aggregated denatured proteins. Amorphous aggregates are also associated with diseases, such as cataracts (12Ecroyd H. Carver J.A.

In practice, amorphous aggregates often contaminate the preparation of amyloid fibrils. Amorphous aggregate designation often accommodates the oligomers responsible for the cytotoxicity of amyloidogenic proteins (15Bemporad F. Chiti F.

Despite their potential medical importance, the role that amorphous aggregates play in amyloid fibrillation has yet to be clarified. When amyloid fibrils are regarded as crystal-like precipitates of denatured proteins, amorphous aggregates are presumed to be a glass-like state populated under conditions where the driving forces of precipitation are too strong to retain amyloid fibrils (17Yoshimura Y.

This viewpoint may enable a more comprehensive understanding of aggregation in terms of solubility, supersaturation (or supercooling), and competition between the two types of aggregated states (17Yoshimura Y.

By considering solubility and supersaturation, we previously showed with β2m that amyloid fibril formation and amorphous aggregation competed in a manner that depended on NaCl concentrations, thereby creating a competitive mechanism of aggregation (17Yoshimura Y.

We then examined the heparin-dependent amyloid formation of hen egg white lysozyme, a model amyloidogenic protein, revealing two distinct mechanisms of amyloid formation (21Nitani A. Muta H.

In both cases, amyloid fibril formation competed against amorphous aggregation, producing a complex heparin concentration-dependent phase diagram.

The findings obtained showed that amyloid fibrils were in a thermodynamic state of unique calorimetric properties, amyloid fibrils degraded to monomers at higher temperatures, and low-temperature–induced degradation (i.e. cold denaturation) occurred for amyloid fibrils of α-synuclein (32Ikenoue T. Lee Y.H. Kardos J. Saiki M. Yagi H. Kawata Y. Goto Y. Cold denaturation of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

However, the relationship between amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates with respect to temperature has not yet been elucidated. By combining a series of temperature- and salt-dependent transitions, we constructed a unified phase diagram of the conformational states of β2m. The phase diagram showed that phase transitions from soluble monomers to crystal-like amyloid fibrils and then glass-like amorphous aggregates are common to three types of variables that decrease the solubility of β2m (i.e. increasing NaCl concentrations, increasing the temperature at the low temperature region, or decreasing the temperature at the high temperature region), thereby providing a comprehensive view of protein aggregation. We investigated the dependence of β2m aggregation on temperature, for which the heating rate was controlled using a Peltier element (Fig. 1A and Figs. S1 and S2). Amyloid fibrillation was measured by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence at 485 nm with a heating rate of 0.2 °C/min. We simultaneously measured light scattering at 445 nm to monitor the total amount of aggregates. Based on these measurements, we distinguished amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates. Furthermore, to obtain information on secondary structures, CD measurements were performed by removing aliquots of the solution from the fluorometer at the desired time points. Under standard solvent conditions (8.5 μm (0.1 mg/ml) β2m, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 μm ThT, and 10 mm HCl under stirring) at a constant temperature of 25 °C, amyloid fibrillation occurred with a lag time of ∼3 h and finished at ∼5 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Increases in ThT and light scattering intensity occurred simultaneously, and the change in ellipticity was consistent with those in ThT and light scattering intensities (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicated that the formation of amyloid fibrils occurred cooperatively without the accumulation of amorphous aggregates. When β2m solution in the absence of NaCl was heated at 0.2 °C/min, no aggregation occurred when monitored by ThT or light scattering (Fig. 1D). CD spectra showed that β2m remained unfolded (Fig. 1, E and F). Upon heating in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, ThT and light scattering intensities both increased at ∼40 °C (Fig. 1G), indicating the formation of amyloid fibrils. ThT fluorescence significantly decreased with an increase in temperature. This decrease initially suggested the degradation of amyloid fibrils. However, because subsequent cycles of decreases and increases in temperature reproduced the temperature-dependent change in ThT fluorescence without affecting light scattering and the CD spectrum typical for the β-structure (Fig. S1), the decrease observed in ThT intensity was attributed to a reduction in the efficiency of the fluorescence of ThT at a high temperature. We previously showed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that β2m amyloid fibrils at 0.1 mg/ml were completely degraded upon heating and that the transition temperature of degradation increased with elevations in the concentration of NaCl (see Fig. 4 of Ref. (24Sasahara K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Kinetically controlled thermal response of β2-microglobulin amyloid fibrils.J. Mol.

We also reported the complete degradation of β2m amyloid fibrils at 0.1–0.3 mg/ml upon a 10-min incubation at 99 °C monitored by ThT fluorescence and CD spectroscopy (30Kardos J. Micsonai A.

The ellipticity value at 200 nm indicative of the β-structure component (Fig. 1, H and I) and the large amount of amyloid fibrils observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM) images taken after cooling (Fig. 1G, inset) suggested that the highest temperature employed under the current experimental conditions (90 °C; Fig. 1, G and H) was not sufficient to completely degrade amyloid fibrils.Figure 2.Degradation of β2m amyloid fibrils by heating.

Upon increases in temperature, light scattering gradually decreased. A sharp increase in ThT fluorescence occurred beginning at ∼45 °C. These results suggested that amyloid fibrils formed and were accompanied by the dissolution of amorphous aggregates. CD measurements also indicated the formation of amyloid fibrils at high temperatures, although these measurements were disturbed by contaminated amorphous aggregates (Fig. 1, K and L). AFM images showed coexisting amyloid fibrils and amorphous-like structures (Fig. 1J, inset). We previously reported the heat-induced conversion of protofibrils to rigid amyloid fibrils in 0.5 m NaCl monitored by DSC, CD, and transmission EM (TEM) (27Sasahara K. Yagi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Heat-triggered conversion of protofibrils into mature amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (10.1021/bi602403v 17316024): 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we assumed that salt-induced protofibrils were categorized into amorphous aggregates and that the heat-induced conversion observed was the same transition as that in our previous study (27Sasahara K. Yagi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Heat-triggered conversion of protofibrils into mature amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (10.1021/bi602403v 17316024): 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate the temperature-dependent stability of amyloid fibrils, amyloid fibrils were prepared under different NaCl concentrations at 25 °C (e.g. Fig. 1B, in 0.1 m NaCl), heated at 0.5 °C/min, and monitored by ellipticity at 220 nm (Fig. 2A). CD measurements confirmed the degradation of preformed amyloid fibrils at a specific temperature and that the midpoint of degradation increased at higher salt concentrations (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with previous findings (27Sasahara K. Yagi H. Naiki H. Goto Y. Heat-triggered conversion of protofibrils into mature amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (10.1021/bi602403v 17316024): 3286-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AFM images showed that the fibrils observed before heating (Fig. 2E) disappeared after heating (Fig. 2F). CD spectra also showed the degradation of preformed amyloid fibrils at 100 °C (Fig. 2, B–D). Collectively, these results showed that amyloid fibrils were degraded at high temperature and that the degradation temperature increased with elevations in the salt concentration. Amyloid fibrillation was not observed at NaCl concentrations lower than 50 mm, e.g. 25 mm NaCl, even after an incubation at 25 °C for ∼12 h (data not shown); however, fibril formation occurred at higher temperatures. On the other hand, NaCl promoted the formation of amyloid fibrils with an increase in its concentration. Taken together, amyloid fibrils formed at moderate NaCl concentrations and at ambient temperature degraded at low and high temperatures. In other words, we observed the “cold denaturation” and “heat denaturation” of β2m amyloid fibrils, as evidently observed for α-synuclein amyloid fibrils (32Ikenoue T. Lee Y.H. Kardos J. Saiki M.

Depletion of SQDG causes different degrees of effects on photosynthetic growth and activities in different organisms. Four SQDG molecules bind to each monomer of photosystem II (PSII), but their role in PSII function has not been characterized in detail, and no PSII structure without SQDG has been reported. We analyzed the activities of PSII from an SQDG-deficient mutant of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus by various spectroscopic methods, which showed that depletion of SQDG partially impaired the PSII activity by impairing secondary quinone (QB) exchange at the acceptor site. We further solved the crystal structure of the PSII dimer from the SQDG deletion mutant at 2.1 Å resolution and found that all of the four SQDG-binding sites were occupied by other lipids, most likely PG molecules. Replacement of SQDG at a site near the head of QB provides a possible explanation for the QB impairment. The replacement of two SQDGs located at the monomer–monomer interface by other lipids decreased the stability of the PSII dimer, resulting in an increase in the amount of PSII monomer in the mutant. The present results thus suggest that although SQDG binding in all of the PSII-binding sites is necessary to fully maintain the activity and stability of PSII, replacement of SQDG by other lipids can partially compensate for their functions.

https://openalex.org/W2886989149,"The role for the NOD-like receptor (NLR) P3 inflammasome in enterovirus infection remains controversial. Available data suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is protective against enterovirus A71 but detrimental to the host during coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection. CVB3 is a common etiologic agent associated with myocarditis and pancreatitis. Previous findings on the role of NLRP3 in CVB3 were based primarily on indirect evidence. Here, we utilized NLRP3 knockout mice as well as immune and cardiac cells to investigate the direct interplay between CVB3 infection and NLRP3 activation. We demonstrated that NLRP3 knockout mice exhibited more severe disease phenotype after CVB3 infection (significantly higher virus titers), increased myocardial, and pancreatic damage, as well as markedly impaired cardiac function compared to nontransgenic control mice. We further showed that NLRP3 activity was enhanced during early stage of CVB3 infection, as evidenced by increased gene expression and/or secretion of IL-1β and caspase-1. Finally, we demonstrated that CVB3 inactivates the NLRP3 inflammasome by degrading NLRP3 and its upstream serine/threonine-protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 1/3 via the proteolytic activity of virus-encoded proteinases. Taken together, our results reveal the functional significance of NLRP3 in host antiviral immunity against CVB3 infection and the mechanisms by which CVB3 has evolved to counteract the host defense response.-Wang, C., Fung, G., Deng, H., Jagdeo, J., Mohamud, Y., Xue, Y.

PI3K inhibition (PI3Ki) can restore dependence on ER signaling for some hormone therapy-resistant ER + breast cancers, but is ineffective in others. Here we show that short-term supplementation with estrogen strongly enhanced Pik3caH1047R−induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice that resulted exclusively in ER + tumors, demonstrating the cooperation of the hormone and the oncogene in tumor development. Similar to human ER + breast cancers that are endocrine-dependent or endocrine-independent at diagnosis, tumor lines from this model retained ER expression but were sensitive or resistant to hormonal therapies. PI3Ki did not induce cell death but did cause upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene BIM. BH3 mimetics or PI3Ki were unable to restore hormone sensitivity in several resistant mouse and human tumor lines. Importantly however, combination of PI3Ki and BH3 mimetics had a profound, BIM-dependent cytotoxic effect in PIK3CA-mutant cancer cells while sparing normal cells. We propose that addition of BH3 mimetics offers a therapeutic strategy to markedly improve the cytotoxic activity of PI3Ki in hormonal therapy-resistant and ER−independent PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2885310528,"Testicular Leydig cells (LCs) are the primary source of circulating androgen in men. As men age, circulating androgen levels decline. However, whether reduced LC steroidogenesis results from specific effects of aging within LCs or reflects degenerative alterations to the wider supporting microenvironment is unclear; inability to separate intrinsic LC aging from that of the testicular microenvironment in vivo has made this question difficult to address. To resolve this, we generated novel mouse models of premature aging, driven by CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 (Cisd2) deletion, to separate the effects of cell intrinsic aging from extrinsic effects of aging on LC function. At 6 mo of age, constitutive Cisd2-deficient mice display signs of premature aging, including testicular atrophy, reduced LC and Sertoli cell (SC) number, decreased circulating testosterone, increased luteinizing hormone/testosterone ratio, and decreased expression of steroidogenic mRNAs, appropriately modeling primary testicular dysfunction observed in aging men. However, mice with Cisd2 deletion (and thus premature aging) restricted to either LCs or SCs were protected against testicular degeneration, demonstrating that age-related LCs dysfunction cannot be explained by intrinsic aging within either the LC or SC lineages alone. We conclude that age-related LC dysfunction is largely driven by aging of the supporting testicular microenvironment.—Curley, M., Milne, L., Smith, S., J⊘rgensen, A., Frederiksen, H., Hadoke, P., Potter, P., Smith, L.

Its ability to change quickly results in the potential for rapid generation of pandemic strains for which most individuals would have no antibody protection. This pandemic potential highlights the need for the continuous development of new drugs against influenza virus. As an essential component and well established virulence determinant, NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) of influenza virus is a highly prioritized target for the development of anti-influenza compounds. Here, we used NMR to determine that the NS1 effector domain (NS1ED) derived from the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) strain of influenza (1918H1N1) binds to two previously described anti-influenza compounds A9 (JJ3297) and A22. We then used X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of the 1918H1N1 NS1ED. Furthermore, we mapped the A9/A22-binding site onto our 1918H1N1 NS1ED structure and determined that A9 and A22 interact with the NS1ED in the hydrophobic pocket known to facilitate binding to the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), suggesting that the two compounds likely attenuate influenza replication by inhibiting the NS1ED–CPSF30 interaction. Finally, our structure revealed that NS1ED could dimerize via an interface that we termed the α3–α3 dimer. Taken together, the findings presented here provide strong evidence for the mechanism of action of two anti-influenza compounds that target NS1 and contribute significant structural insights into NS1 that we hope will promote and inform the development and optimization of influenza therapies based on A9/A22.

Each year, the influenza virus circulates through human, avian, and mammal populations across the globe. Its ability to undergo antigenic shift via reassortment of its segmented genome renders its hosts constantly vulnerable to potentially pandemic strains. Every year unique strains of influenza cause seasonal outbreaks that result in over 200,000 hospitalizations (1Thompson W.W. Comanor L. Shay D.K. Epidemiology of seasonal influenza: use of surveillance data and statistical models to estimate the burden of disease.J. Infect.

Currently, the effort against influenza is primarily composed of preventative vaccines and antiviral drugs (3Beigel J. Bray M. Current and future antiviral therapy of severe seasonal and avian influenza.Antiviral Res. 2008; 78 (10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.01.003 18328578): 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although these methods have been successful, high mutation rates among circulating strains are limiting the efficacy of currently approved therapeutics in both categories. For example, vaccination strategies have been effective in decreasing the number of infections and fatalities caused by influenza. However, rapid evolution of these viruses can lead to the appearance of novel strains that render current vaccine strategies ineffective (4Zost S.J. Parkhouse K. Gumina M.E. Kim K. Diaz Perez S.

This situation occurred in 2009 when it took several months to manufacture an effective vaccine to the pandemic H1N1 strain (termed “swine flu”) that infected ∼60 million individuals, resulting in more than 12,000 deaths worldwide (6Yang Y. Sugimoto J.D. Halloran M.E. Basta N.E. Chao D.L. Matrajt L. Potter G. Kenah E. Longini Jr., I.M.

The severity of this situation highlights the need for effective antiviral treatments to impede the spread of novel strains for which vaccination is not a viable option. Currently available antiviral strategies for the treatment of influenza infection include two distinct classes of antiviral compounds. Adamantanes, including amantadine and rimantadine, inhibit the activity of the influenza M2 ion channel, preventing release of the genome from the endosome. Additionally, neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit influenza replication by preventing release of viral particles from the infected cell membrane. Although these antivirals can be quite effective in preventing the replication and spread of influenza, viral resistance is an ongoing issue. Resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals has been reported, with high levels of such resistance rendering adamantanes ineffective (7Bright R.A. Shay D.K. Shu B. Cox N.J. Klimov A.I.

The NS1 protein consists of two independently folding, functional domains: the RNA-binding domain (NS1RBD; residues 1–73) and the effector domain (NS1ED; residues 86–205).

NS1 accomplishes this by interacting with a multitude of host factors in different cellular compartments and at different times during infection.

NS1's multifunctional role during infection makes it essential to the survival and adaptability of the influenza virus (27García-Sastre A. Egorov A. Matassov D. Brandt S. Levy D.E. Durbin J.E. Palese P. Muster T. Influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene replicates in interferon-deficient systems.Virology. 1998; 252 (10.1006/viro.1998.9508 9878611): 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Therefore, NS1 is a high-value target for the development of the antiviral compounds that could control the replication and spread of the influenza virus (28Engel D.A. The influenza virus NS1 protein as a therapeutic target.Antiviral Res. 2013; 99 (10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.06.005 23796981): 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interest in developing NS1 antagonists as anti-influenza inhibitors has increased in recent years (28Engel D.A. The influenza virus NS1 protein as a therapeutic target.Antiviral Res. 2013; 99 (10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.06.005 23796981): 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In 2006, the CPSF30 (the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor)-binding site on the NS1ED was identified as a potentially effective target for antiviral drug development after a cell line stably expressing a small protein fragment derived from CPSF30 (F2F3) was shown to be highly resistant to the replication of influenza A virus (29Twu K.Y. Noah D.L. Rao P. Kuo R.L. Krug R.M. The CPSF30 binding site on the NS1A protein of influenza A virus is a potential antiviral target.J. Virol. 2006; 80 (10.1128/JVI.80.8.3957-3965.2006 16571812): 3957-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additionally, these cells produced significantly more IFN-β mRNA compared with infected control cells (29Twu K.Y. Noah D.L. Rao P. Kuo R.L. Krug R.M. The CPSF30 binding site on the NS1A protein of influenza A virus is a potential antiviral target.J.

In 2009, a yeast-based screen was used to identify small molecules that target NS1 function with the goal of identifying potential inhibitors of influenza replication (30Basu D. Walkiewicz M.P. Frieman M. Baric R.S. Auble D.T. Engel D.A. Novel influenza virus NS1 antagonists block replication and restore innate immune function.J. Virol. 2009; 83 (10.1128/JVI.01805-08 19052087): 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ward et al. (31Ward A.C. Azad A.A. Macreadie I.G. Expression and characterisation of the influenza A virus non-structural protein NS1 in yeast.Arch. Virol. 1994; 138 (10.1007/BF01379133 7998836): 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of NS1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was toxic and led to a “slow growth” phenotype in the S. cerevisiae expressing the NS1. Using this phenotype, Basu et al. (30Basu D. Walkiewicz M.P. Frieman M. Baric R.S. Auble D.T. Engel D.A. Novel influenza virus NS1 antagonists block replication and restore innate immune function.J. Virol. 2009; 83 (10.1128/JVI.01805-08 19052087): 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) created a yeast strain expressing NS1 from A/WSN/33 under control of the GAL1 promoter. Small molecules were screened for their ability to inhibit NS1 function, thereby rescuing growth kinetics back to WT levels. This screen was successful and led to the identification of four compounds shown to inhibit influenza replication in tissue culture (30Basu D. Walkiewicz M.P. Frieman M. Baric R.S. Auble D.T. Engel D.A. Novel influenza virus NS1 antagonists block replication and restore innate immune function.J. Virol. 2009; 83 (10.1128/JVI.01805-08 19052087): 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One of these small molecules (NSC125044) was subsequently used as the basis for synthesizing additional small molecules with the goal of increasing the efficacy of NSC125044 as an inhibitor of influenza replication. The two most promising compounds synthesized were A9 (JJ3297), with an EC50 of 0.8 μm (32Walkiewicz M.P. Basu D. Jablonski J.J. Geysen H.M. Engel D.A. Novel inhibitor of influenza non-structural protein 1 blocks multi-cycle replication in an RNase L-dependent manner.J. Gen. Virol. 2011; 92 (10.1099/vir.0.025015-0 20881091): 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and A22, determined to be ∼10 times more potent than A9 (33Jablonski J.J. Basu D. Engel D.A. Geysen H.M. Design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel small molecule inhibitors of the influenza virus protein NS1.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2012; 20 (10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.026 22099257): 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, A22 is capable of inhibiting the replication of influenza by up to 3 orders of magnitude and its activity depends upon a functional IFN response pathway, consistent with its presumed function as an NS1 inhibitor (32Walkiewicz M.P. Basu D. Jablonski J.J. Geysen H.M. Engel D.A. Novel inhibitor of influenza non-structural protein 1 blocks multi-cycle replication in an RNase L-dependent manner.J. Gen.

Although these compounds represent a significant step in the field of NS1 inhibitors, there is a pressing need to understand the specific mechanism by which these compounds function. To identify the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, we used an NMR technique known as chemical shift perturbation (CSP) (19Jureka A.S. Kleinpeter A.B. Cornilescu G. Cornilescu C.C. Petit C.M. Structural basis for a novel interaction between the NS1 protein derived from the 1918 influenza virus and structure RIG-I.Structure. 2015; 23 (10.1016/j.str.2015.08.007 26365801): 2001-2010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Foster M.P.

NMR. 1998; 12 (10.1023/A:1008290631575 9729788): 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This method has been used in the past to successfully identify binding interfaces between two proteins, as well as between proteins and small molecules. Here we present structural and biophysical evidence that both compounds interact with the NS1ED derived from the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) strain of influenza (1918H1N1). Additionally, we show that this interaction is conserved in the NS1ED derived from the A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) strain of influenza (2013H7N9), suggesting that these compounds or others like them may hold broad-spectrum therapeutic potential. To provide structural context to the interaction between A22 and the NS1EDs, we solved a high-resolution structure of the NS1ED from the 1918H1N1 strain of influenza for residue specific mapping of our measured CSPs. This structure adopts a homologous fold when compared with NS1ED from other strains of influenza; however, our structure revealed a novel homodimer. By mapping the CSPs observed onto our newly solved structure of the 1918H1N1 NS1ED, we conclude that the A22 compound interacts with the known CPSF30-binding pocket. Our results provide a potential mechanism of action of these novel compounds and highlight their potential to be further developed as effective antiviral compounds. Although successful in identifying small molecules capable of inhibiting influenza replication, the mechanism of action for these compounds was never determined, thereby hindering efficient optimization by structure-based drug design. We sought to use an NMR technique known as CSP to determine the precise interface of interaction between each small molecule and NS1. We expressed both the NS1RBD (residues 1–73) and the NS1ED (residues 86–205) to determine the amenability of both domains for this type of NMR analysis. The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra show a dispersed single set of peaks, which is indicative of a well folded protein (Fig. 1). In both spectra, the expected number of amide resonances (excluding prolines) are visible in addition to amides from the side chains of glutamine and asparagine. Importantly, we introduced a previously described (35Kerry P.S. Ayllon J. Taylor M.A. Hass C. Lewis A. García-Sastre A. Randall R.E. Hale B.G. Russell R.J. A transient homotypic interaction model for the influenza A virus NS1 protein effector domain.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (10.1371/journal.pone.0017946 21464929): e17946Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Xia S.

Previous studies have shown that although this mutation inhibits dimerization, the overall fold of the monomeric unit of NS1ED is unaffected. All forthcoming references to the NS1ED constructs used in this study contain this mutation. These data indicate that the 1918H1N1 NS1RBD and NS1ED are amenable to analysis by NMR. A close inspection of these compounds (Fig. 2) reveals an intriguing structural similarity to a fragment of CPSF30, a known binding partner of the NS1ED. CPSF30 is responsible for 3′ end processing of host mRNAs in the nucleus (24Noah D.L. Twu K.Y. Krug R.M. Cellular antiviral responses against influenza A virus are countered at the posttranscriptional level by the viral NS1A protein via its binding to a cellular protein required for the 3′ end processing of cellular pre-mRNAS.Virology. 2003; 307 (10.1016/S0042-6822(02)00127-7 12667806): 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). By sequestering CPSF30, NS1 prevents maturation and nuclear export of host mRNAs, resulting in a global down-regulation of host gene expression (37Hale B.G. Steel J. Medina R.A. Manicassamy B. Ye J.

Each compound is composed of a phenyl ring along with a hydroxyphenyl group (A9) or an aminophenyl group (A22) that have extraordinary structural similarity with phenylalanines 98 and 102 of CPSF30. Analysis of the structure of the NS1ED bound to CPSF30 indicates that these phenylalanine side chains are buried within a hydrophobic pocket of the NS1ED (Fig. 2) (26Das K. Ma L.C. Xiao R. Radvansky B. Aramini J. Zhao L. Marklund J. Kuo R.L. Twu K.Y. Arnold E. Krug R.M. Montelione G.T. Structural basis for suppression of a host antiviral response by influenza A virus.Proc. Natl. Acad.

This led us to hypothesize that A9 and A22 block influenza viral replication and NS1 function by interfering with the interaction of NS1ED with CPSF30. Molecular docking was subsequently employed to determine whether this hypothesis was credible. Docking experiments were performed using Autodock Vina (39Trott O. Olson A.J. AutoDock Vina: improving the speed and accuracy of docking with a new scoring function, efficient optimization, and multithreading.J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31 (19499576): 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar). For these experiments we used the NS1ED from the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934/H1N1 (PR8) strain of influenza and the A22 and A9 compounds modeled in Autodock Tools. We obtained binding energies for both A9 and A22 complexed with the PR8 NS1ED containing the W187A mutation (PDB code 3RVC) (Fig. 3). The docking results we obtained appeared to be in broad agreement with previously published docking data (40Zhang L. Zhao J. Ding G. Li X. Liu H. Screening of potent inhibitor of H1N1 influenza NS1 CPSF30 binding pocket by molecular docking.Adv. Infect. Dis. 2012; 2 (10.4236/aid.2012.24015): 92-96Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The results of the docking models support our hypothesis that A9 and A22 bind to the NS1ED in the canonical CPSF30-binding region (Figure 2., Figure 3.). Importantly, we repeated the docking of A9 and A22 with Trp-187 modeled back into the PR8 NS1ED structure (data not shown). We found that Trp-187 participates in a π–π stacking with the phenyl ring of both small molecules. We note that our constructs, which require the Trp-187 mutation to make the NS1ED amenable to NMR, would theoretically exhibit decreased affinity for A9/A22 because of the absence of this π–π stacking. To experimentally determine whether A9 and A22 interact with the NS1ED CPSF30-binding pocket, we used an NMR technique called chemical shift perturbation.

However, a crucial need in the clinical management of NSCLC is represented by the identification of cases sensitive to DNA damage response (DDR)-targeting drugs, such as cisplatin or PARP inhibitors. Here, we provide a molecular rationale for the stratification of NSCLC patients potentially benefitting from platinum compounds based on the expression levels of RANBP9, a recently identified player of the cellular DDR. RANBP9 was found overexpressed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in NSCLC compared to normal adjacent tissues (NATs) (n = 147). Moreover, a retrospective analysis of 132 platinum-treated patients from the multi-centric TAILOR trial showed that RANBP9 overexpression levels are associated with clinical response to platinum compounds [Progression Free Survival Hazard Ratio (RANBP9 high vs low) 1.73, 95% CI 1.15-2.59, p = 0.0084; Overall Survival HR (RANBP9 high vs low) 1.99, 95% CI 1.27-3.11, p = 0.003]. Accordingly, RANBP9 KO cells showed higher sensitivity to cisplatin in comparison with WT controls both in vitro and in vivo models. NSCLC RANBP9 KO cells were also more sensitive than control cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib alone and in combination with cisplatin, due to defective ATM-dependent and hyper-activated PARP-dependent DDR. The current investigation paves the way to prospective studies to assess the clinical value of RANBP9 protein levels as prognostic and predictive biomarker of response to DDR-targeting drugs, leading to the development of new tools for the management of NSCLC patients."

https://openalex.org/W2885470528,"Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal oxidase of cellular respiration, reducing O2 to water and pumping protons. X-ray structural features have suggested that CcO pumps protons via a mechanism involving electrostatic repulsions between pumping protons in the hydrogen-bond network of a proton-conducting pathway (the H-pathway) and net positive charges created upon oxidation of an iron site, heme a (Fea2+), for reduction of O2 at another iron site, heme a3 (Fea32+). The protons for pumping are transferred to the hydrogen-bond network from the N-side via the water channel of the H-pathway. Back-leakage of protons to the N-side is thought to be blocked by closure of the water channel. To experimentally test this, we examined X-ray structures of the azide-bound, oxidized bovine CcO and found that an azide derivative (N3−–Fea33+, CuB2+–N3−) induces a translational movement of the heme a3 plane. This was accompanied by opening of the water channel, revealing that Fea3 and the H-pathway are tightly coupled. The channel opening in the oxidized state is likely to induce back-leakage of pumping protons, which lowers the proton level in the hydrogen-bond network during enzymatic turnover. The proton level decrease weakens the electron affinity of Fea, if Fea electrostatically interacts with protons in the hydrogen-bond network. The previously reported azide-induced redox-potential decrease in Fea supports existence of the electrostatic interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2887081577,"Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCC) remains incurable despite advances in the development of anti-angiogenic targeted therapies and the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We have previously shown that the sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway is oncogenic in CCC allowing us to identify the developmental Lim1 transcription factor as a Gli target and as a new oncogene in CCC regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and promoting tumor growth. In this previous study, preliminary in vitro results also suggested that Lim1 may be implicated in metastatic spread. Here we investigated the potential pro-metastatic role of Lim1 in advanced CCC (1) in vitro using a panel of CCC cell lines expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene either naturally or by gene transfer and (2) ex vivo in 30 CCC metastatic tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, skin, bone, and adrenal metastases, and (3) in vivo, using a metastatic model by intravenous injection of siRNA-transfected cells into Balb/c nude. Our in vitro results reveal that Lim1 knockdown time-dependently decreased CCC cell motility, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity by up to 50% regardless of their VHL status. Investigating the molecular machinery involved in these processes, we identified a large panel of Lim1 targets known to be involved in cell adhesion (paxillin and fibronectin), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Twist1/2 and snail), invasion (MMP1/2/3/8/9), and metastatic progression (CXCR4, SDF-1, and ANG-1). Importantly, Lim1 was found constitutively expressed in all metastatic tissues. The H-score in metastatic tissues being significantly superior to the score in the corresponding primary tumor tissues (P value = 0.009). Furthermore, we showed that Lim1 silencing decreases pulmonary metastasis development in terms of number and size in the in vivo metastatic model of human CCC. Taken together, these experiments strengthen the potential therapeutic value of Lim1 targeting as a promising novel approach for treating metastatic human CCC."
https://openalex.org/W2884440354,"One-carbon metabolism provides a direct link among dietary folate/vitamin B12 exposure, the activity of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and epigenetic regulation of the genome via DNA methylation. Previously, it has been shown that the common C.677C > T polymorphism in MTHFR influences global DNA methylation status through a direct interaction with folate status and (indirectly) with total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. To build on that and other more recent observations that have further highlighted associations among MTHFR C.677C > T, tHcy, and aberrations in DNA methylation, we investigated whether the interaction between mildly elevated plasma tHcy and the C.677C > T polymorphism is associated with site-specific changes in DNA methylation in humans. We used data on plasma tHcy levels, c.677C> T polymorphism, and site-specific DNA methylation levels for a total of 915 white women and 335 men from the TwinsUK registry (n = 610) and the Rotterdam study (n = 670). We performed methylome-wide association analyses in each cohort to model the interaction between levels of tHcy and C.677C > T genotypes on DNA methylation β values. Our meta-analysis identified 13 probes significantly associated with rs1801133 × tHcy levels [false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. The most significant associations were with a cluster of probes at the AGTRAP–MTHFR–NPPA/B gene locus on chromosome 1 (FDR = 1.3E–04), with additional probes on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 16, and 19. Our top 2 hits on chromosome 1 were functionally associated with variability in expression of the TNF receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8) gene/locus on that chromosome. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide a direct link between perturbations in 1-carbon metabolism, through an interaction of tHcy and the activity of MTHFR enzyme on epigenetic regulation of the genome via DNA methylation.—Nash, A.

(ENC®), rich in ellagitannins, has been studied in 120 male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided in four groups. Two groups were controls: regular (RD) and HDF diet. Two groups received ENC® (20 mg/kg/day): RD + ENC® and HFD + ENC®. At baseline and at 7, 14 and 21 days, weight gain, serum lipids, plasma cytokines, liver histology, microsomial enzymes and oxidation, intestinal oxidative stress and contractility were studied. HFD increased body weight, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, induced hepatocytes microvescicular steatosis, altered microsomial, increased liver and intestinal oxidative stress, deranged intestinal contractility. In HFD-fed rats, ENC® exerted antiadipose and antioxidative activities and normalized intestinal contractility, suggesting a potential approach to overweight management associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2887866449,"Plasma profiles of acylcarnitines (ACs) and amino acids (AAs) may have interest as potential biomarkers. Here we analyzed plasma AC and AA profiles in 2 rat models with different metabolic programming outcomes: offspring of dams fed a cafeteria diet during lactation (O-CAF, with a thin-outside–fat-inside phenotype) and the offspring of dams with diet-induced obesity subjected to dietary normalization before gestation [offspring of postcafeteria dams (O-PCaf), nonaltered phenotype]. The purpose was to identify early variables that might indicate a propensity for a dysmetabolic state. O-CAF rats presented higher circulating levels of most of the lipid-derived ACs and higher hepatic expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation (Ppara and Cpt1a) than controls [offspring of control dams (O-C)]. They also exhibited an altered plasma AA profile. These differences were not observed in O-PCaf animals. A partial least squares-discriminant analysis score plot of the metabolomics data showed a clear separation between O-CAF and O-C animals. The long-chain ACs (C18, C18:1, C18:2, C16:1, and C16DC) and the AAs glycine, alanine, isoleucine, serine, and proline are the variables mainly influencing this separation. In summary, we have identified a cluster of ACs and AAs whose alterations may indicate poor nutrition during lactation due to maternal unbalanced diet intake and predict the later dysmetabolic phenotype observed in the offspring.—Pomar, C. A., Kuda, O., Kopecky, J., Rombaldova, M., Castro, H., Picó, C., Sánchez, J., Palou, A.

https://openalex.org/W2886332927,"Some cells, such as red blood cells, readily transport water, whereas the water permeability of other cells, such as neurons, is nearly undetectable. For years, researchers wondered why water transport seems to occur in some tissues but not in others. Was there an ion-transport channel doing double-duty as a water channel, or did proteins expressed in certain membranes make them leaky to water? The mystery remained until 1992, when, for the first time, Peter Agre and colleagues identified a dedicated water channel protein, aquaporin-1 (AQP-1)—work that earned Agre the Nobel Prize in 2003. Agre was trained as a blood specialist, and, in 1988, had a small laboratory at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) that studied red cell membrane proteins, hoping to identify the D antigen of the Rh blood group. He and his team had identified a unique 32-kDa RhD protein, and when they purified it, to their surprise, a 28-kDa protein was copurified. “Our interest in this 28-kDa protein, which we now know is AQP-1, was really because it was a contaminant that initially we misunderstood as a breakdown product of the 32-kDa RhD polypeptide,” Agre says. At the time, they had no idea that this protein was the water channel. “In the beginning, we stumbled upon something we didn't expect to see,” Agre says. “It certainly was not genius. It was probably a little bit of observation.” Hundreds of laboratories were studying red cell membrane proteins. They would separate them with SDS-PAGE, stain the gels with Coomassie, and get a series of bands. In the 28- to 32-kDa region, nothing seemed to stain well, which had allowed the protein to go undetected. The 28-kDa protein's peptide maps were unique. After purifying it, Agre's team calculated that it was one of the most abundant proteins in the membrane. “It took a bit of confidence building to assess that, in fact, it was a new protein,” Agre says. In a 1988 paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) (1.Denker B.M. Smith B.L. Kuhajda F.P. Agre P. Identification, purification, and partial characterization of a novel Mr 28,000 integral membrane-specific protein from erythrocytes and renal tubules.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263 (3049610): related-article-type=“article-reference” vol=“263” page=“15634” ext-link-type=“pmcAbstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), they explained how they had identified the protein and described its basic bilayer-spanning orientation and its presence in renal proximal tubules as well as red blood cells. “We thought the 28-kDa protein might be a membrane-associated protein to bracket transport molecules,” Agre recalls. “We didn't realize that it was the transport molecule itself.” Afterward, they searched for a function. The protein “appeared to be mostly living within the bilayer itself, with an extracellular glycosylation site and some small cytoplasmic domains visible at the termini,” Agre says. They spoke with dozens of scientists to determine what the protein did. Agre had a discussion with John Parker, a scientist at the University of North Carolina, who had been Agre's clinical mentor, who suggested it might be a channel specific for water. Agre says, “It was really John Parker's suggestion that caused us to roll up our sleeves and collaborate” with William Guggino, an associate professor at JHU who had studied water permeability in fish eggs. For a 1992 paper in Science (2.Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Appearance of water channels in Xenopus oocytes expressing red cell CHIP28 protein.Science. 1992; 256 (1373524): 385-38710.1126/science.256.5055.385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), Agre, Guggino, and colleagues cloned the protein and expressed complementary RNA in frog eggs, conferring water permeability to the otherwise impermeable membranes. With the protein expressed, the eggs “swell by osmosis and explode like popcorn,” Agre says. They established that the protein was a water-selective channel, described its function, and named it aquaporin-1. “Usually with a new idea you get a lot of skepticism, and people argue that it's wrong,” Agre says. But the Science paper was immediately greeted with enthusiasm. “We were a small lab and were astonished by how interested people were. Science is sometimes not predictable.” Over the next two years, Agre's lab published many papers on the topic, including two in JBC. A 1993 paper (3.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. The mercury-sensitive residue at cysteine 189 in the CHIP28 water channel.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (7677994): related-article-type=“article-reference” vol=“268” page=“17” ext-link-type=“pmcAbstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) addressed AQP-1's function, showing that AQP-1 forms a complex made up of multiple subunits and that water molecules permeate AQP-1 through a single pore in each of those subunits. The next (4.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Molecular structure of the water channel through aquaporin CHIP: The hourglass model.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (7514176): related-article-type=“article-reference” vol=“269” page=“14648” ext-link-type=“pmcAbstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), in 1994, presented an hourglass model for the way water channel proteins such as AQP-1 function during water transport (Fig. 1). “The hourglass has a specific structure in the pore that allows water to move right up through the pore itself,” Guggino says. “The water molecule fits very nicely in the pore, and thus the water channel is highly selective for water.” It has since been shown that there are many homologs in other tissues and in other organisms, including plants and even archaea. The number of aquaporins determines a tissue's permeability. “Most tissues have a very small number, although in situations where cells are stressed,”—for example, in the case of dehydration—“the renal AQP-2 levels rise, causing kidneys to maximally reabsorb water from urine,” Agre says. For discovering this essential physiological process, Agre won one-half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003. “It is my opinion that the work in these three JBC papers forms a significant part of the basis for his Nobel Prize,” says Eric Fearon, director of the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center and a JBC associate editor. “It would have been nice to slow down and savor each paper a little more, but when things get going, they get going,” says Agre, who now directs the JHU Malaria Research Institute. He counts himself and his team lucky to have worked on a solvable problem with an elegant solution. “I like to tell people that we didn't discover the AQP-1 protein—it discovered us,” Agre says. “I wish everyone would have the opportunity to make a discovery like the aquaporins and figure out how they function.”"
