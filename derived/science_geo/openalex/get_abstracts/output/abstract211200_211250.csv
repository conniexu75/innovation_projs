This report proposes first that actinomycin affects DNA polymerase indirectly by way of the changed physical properties of the template and that it functions in the major groove of helical DNA; second, that RNA polymerase functioning in the minor groove is subject to direct steric inhibition by bound actinomycin; and third, that the reaction of actinomycin with free purines is unrelated to its reaction with DNA."

The signs of diabetes included elevated blood glucose, excessive glucose and ketone bodies in the urine, and cataracts. The diabetic animals showed degeneration of the pancreatic insulin producing tissue (beta-cells)."

https://openalex.org/W1996856852,"The field of heterotransplantation is now being explored because of success with immunosuppressive measures in homotransplantation, and because of the scarcity of suitable human organs. Two patients in terminal uremia, maintained on dialysis, received heterotransplants from nonhuman primates. In the first case a renal heterotransplant from a rhesus monkey implanted in a 32-year old woman showed satisfactory immediate function but was removed after 10 days because of inadequate function. The second patient received a renal hetero transplant from a chimpanzee. A threatened rejection was reversed with immunosuppressive measures, but 2 months after transplantation the patient died of pneumonia. The transplanted kidneys showed no evidence of rejection."

https://openalex.org/W2063089377,"The binding of actinomycin D to DNA results in an increase in the temperature at which thermal dissociation of the DNA occurs. With this enhancement of thermal stability as a criterion for binding, it is shown that complementary RNA and DNA-RNA hybrid do not bind actinomycin D. This result can be interpreted to mean that these polynucleotides have helical conformations which differ from that of DNA."

Such staining is dependent upon the histone content of the band, as shown by the effects of selective extraction and blocking of the histones. The effects of qcid extraction and HONO solution on the A-S staining of different bands suggest that specific genes may have particular histones associated with them."

 Nirenberg regularly made reference to Khorana's contributions, which eventually earned him a share of the Nobel Prize

https://openalex.org/W35122594,"Although the ability of animal tissues to oxidize thiols and organic disulfides to sulfinates and sulfonates has long been recognized, the enzymatic mechanism of this oxidation is obscure. For extensive literature on this field the reader is referred to recent reviews (1, 2). An enzyme capable of oxidizing cysteamine (RSH) to hypotaurine (R-S02H) and thiotaurine (R-SOaH), in the presence of inorganic forms of sulfur, however, has been recently detected in a number of animal tissues (3-6). The presence of elementary sulfur or sulfide was found essential for the activity of this enzyme, and it was postulated that thiocysteamine, i.e. the persulfide analogue of cysteamine (R-SSH), was formed and utilized as substrate (5, 7). Hypotaurine is the initial product of the reaction, whereas thiotaurine is produced by nonenzymatic transulfuration between hypotaurine and excess thiocysteamine or other polysulfides present (6). Furthermore it was observed that sulfide in small amount has an evident catalytic effect on the enzymatic reaction whereas at high concentrations it displays strong inhibition (6). This paper deals with the purification of this new enzyme, which we have extracted from horse kidney, and with a preliminary study of the mechanism of its action."

The propositus suffers from an apparently unrelated, possibly genetic, agranulocytosis. According to the history and the blood grouping data there is considerable in breeding in the tribe and remarkably little admixture with other ethnic groups."

https://openalex.org/W2418183214,"Catalysis of flavin mononucleotide formation from riboflavin and adenosine triphosphate with yeast flavokinase was described by Kearney and Englard (1). The presence of flavokinase also has been demonstrated in several bacteria (24), higher plants (5,6), and more recently in animal tissues (7). In crude extracts from the latter, the kinase is largely masked by phosphatases (8) which effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of flavin mononucleotide formed in the flavokinase reaction (9). After the partial purification and characterization of flavokinase from rat liver (lo), initial investigations of the substrate requirements of this enzyme (11) revealed a degree of specificity for flavin structure similar to that found with the yeast kinase (12). A more thorough study of flavin specificity of the liver kinase attempted to elucidate the primary requirements for interaction of flavin with flavokinase (13). Previous investigations on the behavior of several flavin analogues indicate that combination of kinase with flavin is narrowly dependent upon substituents in the isoalloxazine ring (10, 11, 13). For flavokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a 9-(I’-n-ribityl)isoalloxazine to occur, the ring must be substituted in position 6 or 7 and preferably both. Position 5 must be unsubstituted to allow access to the nitrogen atom at position 10. The nitrogen at position 3 must be unsubstituted, presumably to allow dissociation of the hydrogen and tautomerization with the carbonyl function at position 4. It is noteworthy that both the nitrogen at position 10 and the carbonyl oxygen at position 4 are necessary also for the stable chelation of metal ions by flavins (14). The present study extends in a more quantitative way the structural requirements for interaction of the isoalloxazine moiety of flavins with flavokinase and the similarity to the mechanism of chelation of cations by flavins. The optimal character of substitution at positions 6 and 7 is demonstrated, and the indirect role of position 2 in the tautomeric process is delineated. Although the biological function of a flavin 5’-phosphate as an oxidation-reduction carrier is intimately concerned with isoalloxazine structure, the oxidation-reduction potential per se has no direct relationship to the ability of the flavin to be converted to the coenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2079120387,An application of the techniques of intracranial self-stimulation to the study of delayed reward indicates that the rate of discrimination learning for stimulation of the hypothalamus is a decreasing function of the delay interval. The resulting delay-of-reward gradient does not appear to differ appreciably from other such gradients based on food reward.

The alleged sharing of the intestinal glucose transport system by 1-deoxyglucose does not contradict the mutarotase theory."

https://openalex.org/W2085236546,A utoradiographs of kidney sections from rats injected with sodium 22 showed two areas of relatively high concentration of the radioisotope. The first area appeared in the outer medulla; the second appeared as an area of increasing concentration toward the papilla. Autoradiographs of sections labeled with chloride-36 appeared essentially the same. Autoradiographs of sections labeled with inulin-C(14)OOH showed an increased concentration in the inner medulla. These results may have a bearing on the counter-current multiplier hypothesis for the production of concentrated urine.
