https://openalex.org/W2008223866,"We have previously reconstituted the soluble phase of precursor protein translocation in vitro using purified proteins (the precursor proOmpA, the chaperone SecB, and the ATPase SecA) in addition to isolated inner membrane vesicles. We now report the isolation of the SecY/E protein, the integral membrane protein component of the E. coli preprotein translocase. The SecY/E protein, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, acts together with SecA protein to support translocation of proOmpA, the precursor form of outer membrane protein A. This translocation requires ATP and is strongly stimulated by the protonmotive force. The initial rates and the extents of translocation into either native membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes with pure SecY/E are comparable. The SecY/E protein consists of SecY, SecE, and an additional polypeptide. Antiserum against SecY immunoprecipitates all three components of the SecY/E protein."
https://openalex.org/W2067895067,"P transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster can undergo precise loss at a rate exceeding 13% per generation. The process is similar to gene conversion in its requirement for a homolog that is wild type at the insertion site and in its reduced frequency when pairing between the homologs is inhibited. However, it differs from classical gene conversion by its high frequency, its requirement for P transposase, its unidirectionality, and its occurrence in somatic and premeiotic cells. Our results suggest a model of P element transposition in which jumps occur by a ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism but are followed by double-strand gap repair to restore the P element at the donor site. The results also suggest a technique for site-directed mutagenesis in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1966815449,"Retroviral DNA integration involves a coordinated set of DNA cutting and joining reactions. We find that the IN protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) is the only viral protein required to accomplish these reactions in vitro. IN protein has a site-specific nuclease activity that cleaves 2 nucleotides from the sequence present at the 3' ends of MoMLV DNA made by reverse transcription. This reaction generates the recessed 3' ends that are normal precursors for integration. IN protein also possesses the integration activity that joins these recessed 3' ends of the viral DNA to a staggered cut, made by IN protein, in the target DNA. Short duplex oligonucleotides, corresponding to the ends of MoMLV DNA, serve as the viral DNA substrate for both the cleavage and integration reactions; there are no special requirements for the DNA that acts as the target for integration. The reaction products are detected by a direct physical assay."
https://openalex.org/W2057628471,"Heterokaryon studies suggest that senescent and quiescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) contain a common inhibitor of entry into S phase. DNA synthesis can be induced in senescent and quiescent HDF by fusing them with cells containing DNA viral oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen, adenovirus E1A, or human papillomavirus E7. Both senescent and quiescent HDF contained the unphosphorylated form (p110Rb) of the retinoblastoma protein, a putative inhibitor of proliferation. After serum stimulation, senescent HDF did not phosphorylate p110Rb and did not enter S phase, whereas quiescent HDF phosphorylated p110Rb and entered S phase. These findings, combined with the observations that T antigen, E1A, and E7 form complexes with, and presumably inactivate, unphosphorylated p110Rb, suggest that failure to phosphorylate p110Rb may be an immediate cause of failure to enter S phase in senescent HDF."
https://openalex.org/W2059911808,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) governs the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. Glucocorticoids and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) increase PEPCK gene transcription and gluconeogenesis, whereas insulin has the opposite effect. Insulin is dominant, since it prevents cAMP and glucocorticoid-stimulated transcription. Glucocorticoid and cAMP response elements have been located in the PEPCK gene and now a 15-base pair insulin-responsive sequence (IRS) is described. Evidence for a binding activity that recognizes this sequence is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2087997490,"The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/man6PR) can directly interact with and activate Gi-2, a GTP binding protein (G protein). We found that the segment of residues 2410-2423 in the human IGF-II/man6PR activates Gi-2 in a manner similar to G-coupled receptors. We observed a hierarchy of the segment action when tested on various G proteins, with an order of Gi-2 greater than Gi-1 approximately Gi-3 greater than Go. The segment had no effect on Gs or low molecular weight G proteins. The segment action depended on its primary structure and was potentiated when the segment was connected with a part of the receptor transmembrane region. Finally, the Gi-2-activating function of the human IGF-II/man6PR could be blocked by an antibody against the segment, indicating a critical role for this small region of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1971729222,"The cyclic AMP receptor protein-cAMP complex (CRP-cAMP) binds at a variety of distances upstream of several E. coli promoters and activates transcription. We have constructed a model system in which a consensus CRP binding site is placed at different distances upstream of the melR promoter. CRP-cAMP activates transcription from melR when bound at a number of positions, all of which lie on the same face of the DNA helix. The two distances at which transcription is strongly activated correspond exactly to those at which CRP-cAMP binds upstream of the well-studied galP1 and lac promoters. Footprinting of the synthetic promoters reveals that RNA polymerase makes identical contacts with their -10 regions even though CRP-cAMP binds at a different distance in each case. Kinetic analysis in vitro indicates that CRP-cAMP activates transcription from these promoters in similar but distinct ways. A model is proposed to explain this two-position activation."

https://openalex.org/W2029545906,"We studied the protective efficacy of novel 21-aminosteroids against several forms of neuronal injury in murine cortical cell cultures. Concentrations of 200 nM to 20 microM partially attenuated the damage induced by glucose deprivation, combined oxygen-glucose deprivation, or exposure to NMDA; maximal protection was less than that produced by NMDA antagonists, but the combination of a 21-aminosteroid plus an NMDA antagonist produced a greater benefit than either drug alone. 21-Aminosteroid addition did not attenuate NMDA-induced whole-cell current, but did block almost all of the damage induced by exposure to iron, a protective action consistent with inhibition of free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation may be a downstream event mediating a portion of the injury triggered by excess stimulation of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2028801502,"HO encodes a site-specific endonuclease that initiates mating type switching in S. cerevisiae. It is expressed only transiently during the cell cycle of mother cells, as they undergo Start, but not in daughter cells. Since SWI5 appears to be the only HO transcription factor missing when daughter cells undergo Start, we were interested in the intracellular distribution of SWI5 at cell division. We discovered that SWI5 is found equally concentrated in the nuclei of both mother and daughter cells at the end of anaphase, suggesting that its subsequent fate must somehow differ. Prior to the end of anaphase, SWI5 accumulates in the cytoplasm and only moves into the nucleus when cells enter G1. A version of the HO promoter that has lost its dependence on Start is nevertheless still strongly cell cycle regulated and is activated when SWI5 moves into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1573088108,"Using ESR spin-trapping techniques with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), we confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry for the formation of hydroxyl radicals with Fe2+ in the Fenton reaction under experimental conditions wherein [H2O2] is 90 microM and [Fe2+] is very low, 1 microM or less. The stoichiometry decreased markedly as the Fe2+ concentration was increased. The efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation varied with the nature of the iron chelators used and increased in the order of phosphate alone approximately ADP less than EDTA less than diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC). The second order rate constant for the Fenton reaction was measured to be 2.0 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for phosphate alone, 8.2 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 for ADP, 1.4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for EDTA, and 4.1 x 10(2) M-1 s-1 for DETAPAC. Measuring the radicals formed as spins trapped in the presence of ethanol, we estimated the amount of total oxidizing intermediates formed in the Fenton reaction, which we concluded consists of hydroxyl radicals and an iron species. The oxidizing species of iron which might be assigned as ferryl, FeO2+, or Fe(IV) = O was generated effectively in the presence of ADP even at low Fe2+ concentrations. In general, as the Fe2+ concentration was increased, the ferryl species predominated over the hydroxyl radical except for the case of Fe(II)-DETAPAC, which generated only hydroxyl radicals as the oxidizing species. Three possible pathways are proposed for the Fenton reaction, the dominant ones depending very much on the nature of the iron chelator being used."

https://openalex.org/W2049321118,"The endogenous polyamines spermine and spermidine increase the binding of [3H]MK-801 to NMDA receptors. This effect is antagonized by diethylenetriamine (DET). We report here that spermine increases the rates of both association and dissociation of binding of [3H]MK-801, suggesting that it increases the accessibility of the binding site for MK-801 within the ion channel of the receptor complex. 1,10-Diaminodecane (DA10) inhibited the binding of [3H]MK-801. This effect was due to a decrease in the rate of association with no change in the rate of dissociation of [3H]MK-801. The effect of DA10 was not mediated by an action of DA10 at the binding sites for glutamate, glycine, Mg2+, or Zn2+, and was attenuated by DET. This suggests that DA10 acts at the polyamine recognition site. In hippocampal neurons the NMDA-elicited current was decreased by DA10, an effect opposite to that of spermine. The effects of spermine and DA10 were selectively blocked by DET. It is concluded that DA10 acts as a negative allosteric modulator or inverse agonist at the polyamine recognition site of the NMDA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1601021783,"Two distinct cell surface endothelin receptors were identified, namely a 73-kDa protein referred to as ET-R1 and a 60-kDa protein named ET-R2. ET-R1 was expressed as the sole endothelin receptor on rat A10 vascular smooth muscle cells and C6 glial cells. Binding of 125I-ET-1 to these cells was inhibited by 50-200 pM endothelin-1 and -2, whereas endothelin-3 did not compete for this receptor subtype. Binding of 125I-ET-1 to intact A10 and C6 cells was reversible, indicating that ET-R1 is located on the cell surface. Affinity labelling of a single 73-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels by 125I-ET-1 in A10 and C6 cells was inhibited by endothelin-1 but not by endothelin-3. In A10 cells, endothelin-1 but not endothelin-3 elicited a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular inositol trisphosphate levels. ET-R1 was also expressed in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells based on findings of a subset of receptors with an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa that bound 125I-ET-1 displacable by endothelin-1 and endothelin-2 but not by endothelin-3. These cells also expressed the ET-R2 receptor subtype, based on findings of a 60-kDa binding site that could be labeled by both 125I-ET-1 and 125I-ET-3. Labeling of ET-R2 by the radioactive endothelins-1 and -3 was inhibited competitively by endothelins-1, -2, and -3. Furthermore, ET-R2 was shown to be a functional receptor, as endothelin-3 caused inositol trisphosphate levels to rise in mesangial cells. An endothelin binding site with high affinity for endothelin-3 was also identified on rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, although the apparent molecular mass of this receptor could not be verified by cross-linking studies. Since endothelin-1 or -3 failed to augment inositol trisphosphate levels in these cells, this binding site could represent a third endothelin receptor subtype. Thus, two distinct functional receptors for endothelins were identified on rat cells, namely the 73-kDa ET-R1 which has an exceedingly low affinity for endothelin-3 and the 60-kDa ET-R2 which binds endothelin-3 with high affinity. Whether an additional endothelin receptor subtype exists in PC12 cells remains to be shown with certainty."
https://openalex.org/W2042895151,"The Hin protein binds to two cis-acting recombination sites and catalyzes a site-specific DNA inversion reaction that regulates the expression of flagellin genes in Salmonella. In addition to the Hin protein and the two recombination sites that flank the invertible segment, a third cis-acting recombinational enhancer sequence and the Fis protein, which binds to two sites within the enhancer, are required for efficient recombination. Intermediates of this reaction were trapped during DNA strand cleavage and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy in order to determine their structure and composition. The analyses demonstrate that the recombination sites are assembled at the enhancer into a complex nucleo-protein structure (termed the invertasome) with the looping of the three segments of intervening DNA. Antibody studies indicated that Fis physically interacts with Hin and that both proteins are intimately associated with the invertasome. In order to achieve this protein-protein interaction and assemble the invertasome, the substrate DNA must be supercoiled."
https://openalex.org/W2070338838,"Adenovirus E1a represses transcription of the collagenase gene via the phorbol ester-responsive element (collTRE). The mechanism involves inhibition of the trans-activating function of the transcription factor AP-1 without reduction of its synthesis and without any apparent change in DNA binding or composition. The ability of E1a to downmodulate AP-1 is a unique property among dominant oncogenes. This repression depends on conserved region 1, one of the transforming domains of E1a, indicating that it is an integral feature of adenovirus transformation."
https://openalex.org/W193673460,"Twelve independent Tn10 insertion mutants of Escherichia coli K12 were isolated that were defective in the synthesis of enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). The mutants were identified by screening a random pool of Tn10 insertion mutants for their ECA phenotype using a colony-immunoblot assay. All 12 of the Tn10 insertion mutants were found to be located in the chromosomal region of the rff-rfe genes. Four of the Tn10 insertions were in rfe genes while the remaining eight Tn10 insertions were in rff genes. All of the rfe::Tn10 insertion mutants were defective in the synthesis of GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (C55-PP-GlcNAc, lipid I), the first lipid-linked intermediate involved in ECA synthesis. Biochemical characterization of the rff::Tn10 insertion mutants revealed that they were defective in various steps of ECA synthesis subsequent to the synthesis of lipid I. These defects included: (i) the inability to synthesize UDP-ManNAcA due to Tn10 insertions in the structural genes for UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase (rffE) and UDP-ManNAcA (N-acetyl-D-mannosaminuronic acid) dehydrogenase (rffD), (ii) defects in the synthesis of C55-GlcNAc-ManNAcA (lipid II) due to insertion of transposon Tn10 in the structural gene for the UDP-ManNAcA transferase (rffM), (iii) the inability to synthesize TDP-Fuc4NAc (4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose) due to Tn10 insertions in the structural gene for the transaminase that catalyzes the conversion of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose to TDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-galactose (rffA), and (iv) defects in steps subsequent to the synthesis of C55-GlcNAc-ManNAcA-Fuc4NAc (lipid III). In addition, a re-examination of a mutant possessing the rff-726 lesion revealed that it was defective in the synthesis of lipid III due to a defect in the structural gene for the Fuc4NAc transferase (rffT)."
https://openalex.org/W1547942861,"Macrophage responses to recombinant IFN-γ decline during aging, as measured by two criteria of macrophage activation, O2− and TNF-α secretion. The production of O2− by macrophages in response to opsonized-zymosan and recombinant rat IFN-γ is 75% lower in 23-month-old rats than in 3-month-old rats. Furthermore, the secretion of TNF-α in response to IFN-γ and LPS is almost absent in macrophages from aged rats. Production of both O2− and TNF-α by resident peritoneal macrophages from specific pathogen-free aged rats in response to priming and triggering stimuli was partially or fully restored by implantation of syngeneic pituitary grafts from young rats. These data demonstrate that macrophages from aged rats are defective in their response to a priming signal induced by IFN-γ, and they suggest that impaired macrophage responses during aging may be reversible.— Davila, D. R.; Edwards, C. K., III; Arkins, S.; Simon, J.; Kelley, K. W. Interferon-γ-induced priming for secretion of superoxide anion and tumor necrosis factor-α declines in macrophages from aged rats.

https://openalex.org/W1508288914,"We have studied the degradation of type X collagen by human skin fibroblast and rat uterus interstitial collagenases and human 72-kDa type IV collagenase. The interstitial collagenases attacked the native type X helix at two loci, cleaving residues Gly92-Leu93 and Gly420-Ile421, both scissions involving Gly-X bonds of Gly-X-Y-Z-A sequences. However, the human and rat interstitial enzymes displayed an opposite and substantial selectivity for each of these potential sites, with the uterine enzyme catalyzing the Gly420-Ile421 cleavage almost 20-fold faster than the Gly92-Leu93 locus. Values for enzyme-substrate affinity were approximately 1 microM indistinguishable from the corresponding Km values against type I collagen. Interestingly, in attacking type X collagen, both enzymes manifested kinetic properties intermediate between those characterizing the degradation of native and denatured collagen substrates. Thus, energy dependence of reaction velocity revealed a value of EA of 45 kcal, typical of native interstitial collagen substrates. However, the substitution of D2O for H2O in solvent buffer failed to slow type X collagenolysis significantly (kH/kD = 1.1), in contrast to the 50-70% slowing (kH/kD = 2-3) observed with native interstitial collagens. Since this lack of deuterium isotope effect is characteristic of interstitial collagenase cleavage of denatured collagens, we investigated the capacity of another metalloproteinase with substantial gelatinolytic activity, 72-kDa type IV collagenase, to degrade type X collagen. The 72-kDa type IV collagenase cleaved type X collagen at both 25 and 37 degrees C, and at loci in close proximity to those attacked by the interstitial enzymes. No further cleavages were observed at either temperature with type IV collagenase, and although values for kcat were not determined (due to associated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2), catalytic rates appeared to be substantial in comparison to the interstitial enzymes. In contrast, type X collagen was completely resistant to proteolysis by stromelysin. Type X collagen thus appears to be highly unusual in its susceptibility to degradation by both interstitial collagenase and another member of the metalloproteinase gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1520534074,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of thyroid status on the Na,K-ATPase alpha isoforms and beta in rat heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain at the levels of mRNA, protein abundance, and enzymatic activity. Northern and dot-blot analysis of RNA (euthyroid, hypothyroid, and triiodothyronine-injected hypothyroids = hyperthyroids) and immunoblot analysis of protein (euthyroid and hypothyroid) revealed isoform-specific regulation of Na,K-ATPase by thyroid status in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle and no regulation of sodium pump subunit levels in the brain. In general, in the transition from euthyroid to hypothyroid alpha 1 mRNA and protein levels are unchanged in kidney and skeletal muscle and slightly decreased in heart, while alpha 2 mRNA and protein are decreased significantly in heart and skeletal muscle. In hypothyroid heart and skeletal muscle, the decrease in alpha 2 protein levels was much greater than the decrease in alpha 2 mRNA levels relative to euthyroid indicating translational or post-translational regulation of alpha 2 protein abundance by triiodothyronine status in these tissues. The regulation of beta subunit by thyroid status is tissue-dependent. In hypothyroid kidney beta mRNA levels do not change, but immunodetectable beta protein levels decrease relative to euthyroid, and the decrease parallels the decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity. In hypothyroid heart and skeletal muscle beta mRNA levels decrease; beta protein decreases in heart and was not detected in the skeletal muscle. These findings demonstrate that the euthyroid levels of expression of alpha 1 in heart, alpha 2 in heart and skeletal muscle, and beta in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle are dependent on the presence of thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2031683755,"The stimulation of phospholipase A2 by thrombin and type 2 (P2)-purinergic receptor agonists in Chinese hamster ovary cells is mediated by the G protein Gi. To delineate alpha chain regulatory regions responsible for control of phospholipase A2, chimeric cDNAs were constructed in which different lengths of the alpha subunit of Gs (alpha s) were replaced with the corresponding sequence of the Gi alpha subunit (alpha i2). When a carboxyl-terminal chimera alpha s-i(38), which has the last 38 amino acids of alpha s substituted with the last 36 residues of alpha i2, was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the receptor-stimulated phospholipase A2 activity was inhibited, although the chimera could still activate adenylyl cyclase. Thus, alpha s-i(38) is an active alpha s, but also a dominant negative alpha i molecule, indicating that the last 36 amino acids of alpha i2 are a critical domain for G protein regulation of phospholipase A2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1511284320,"The effect of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and calcium ionophore A23187 on Ca2+ release from bovine adrenal medullary secretory vesicles and microsomes was examined. Ins(1,4,5)P3 released 3.5 nmol of Ca2+/mg protein from secretory vesicles and 1.5 nmol of Ca2+/mg protein from microsomes as measured by a Ca2(+)-selective electrode. However, A23187 promoted Ca2+ uptake into vesicles while releasing Ca2+ from microsomes. Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release from secretory vesicles was rapid, but the released Ca2+ was absorbed within 3 min during which the Ins(1,4,5)P3-releasable pools were refilled. The in situ calcium content of secretory vesicle measured by atomic absorption spectrometry was 112 +/- 6.3 nmol/mg protein indicating the potential importance of secretory vesicles as an intracellular Ca2+ store. The high Ca2(+)-buffering capacity of secretory vesicles is presumed to be due to the high Ca2(+)-binding capacity of chromogranin A, the major intravesicular protein, which has calsequestrin-like properties."
https://openalex.org/W1503000710,"This study was undertaken to define the roles of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the regulation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release and biosynthesis in cultured ovine anterior pituitary cells and to define the intracellular mechanisms responsible for their action. At 4 h, CRF and AVP increased both ACTH release and total ACTH content, with AVP clearly the more potent agonist (maximal ACTH release: AVP, 22.8-fold; CRF, 7.6-fold; maximal increment in total ACTH content: AVP, 1.9-fold; CRF, 1.1-fold; EC50 for ACTH release: AVP, 2.3 +/- 0.5 nM; CRF, 9.2 +/- 5.0 nM). The increase in total ACTH content was interpreted to reflect an augmentation of ACTH biosynthesis since it was abolished by 10 microM cycloheximide. Exposure of the anterior pituitary cells to increasing concentrations of forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP elicited increases in ACTH release and total ACTH content that were similar to those caused by CRF. A 30-min incubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a dose-related translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the cell membrane; after 4 h, the increases in ACTH release and total ACTH content in response to increasing concentrations of PMA were similar to those caused by AVP. Chronic (24 h) exposure to 150 nM PMA caused an almost total depletion of both cytosolic and membrane-bound protein kinase C activities. When protein kinase C-depleted cells were subsequently exposed to AVP, the increases in ACTH release and total ACTH content were markedly attenuated, but the responses to CRF were preserved. Finally, the combination of CRF and AVP, CRF and PMA, or AVP and 8-bromo-cAMP increased ACTH release and total ACTH content in a synergistic manner. We conclude that: 1) in ovine anterior pituitary cells, AVP is the predominant regulator of ACTH secretion and biosynthesis; 2) the action of AVP is predominantly mediated by activation of protein kinase C, whereas the action of CRF is likely to be mediated by activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A); and 3) the ability of CRF and AVP to increase total ACTH content and secretion in a synergistic manner provides a demonstration in normal pituitary cells that protein kinases C and A may interact in a unidirectional manner to regulate ACTH biosynthesis in addition to ACTH release. This interaction may take place within, or between, individual corticotropes."
https://openalex.org/W1533390549,"AAC1 and AAC2 genes in yeast each encode functional ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the present study, mitochondria harboring distinct AAC proteins and the pet9 Arg96 to HIS mutant (Lawson, J., Gawaz, M., Klingenberg, M., and Douglas, M. G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14195-14201) protein have been characterized. In addition, properties of the different AAC proteins have been defined following reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Deletion of AAC2 but not AAC1 causes a major reduction in the mitochondrial cytochrome content and respiration, and this level remains low even when the level of AAC1 protein is increased to 20% that of the AAC2 gene product. In reconstitution studies, the rate of nucleotide transport by isolated AAC1 protein is approximately 40% that of the AAC2 protein. Thus, the lack of mitochondrial-dependent growth supported by the AAC1 gene product alone may be due to the combination of low abundance and reduced activity. Surprisingly, analysis of the Arg96 to His mutant protein revealed binding and transport activities similar to the functional AAC1 and AAC2 gene products. These observations are discussed in relation to a molecular analysis of this highly conserved small transporter and its function in conjunction with other proteins in the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2018851653,"Visual input during a critical period of development plays a major role in the establishment of orderly connections in the developing visual system. In Xenopus laevis, the matching of visual maps from the two eyes to the optic tectum depends on binocular visual input during the critical period, which extends from late tadpole to early juvenile stages. Alterations in eye position, which produce a mismatch of the tectal maps, normally evoke a compensatory adjustment in the map of the ipsilateral eye only during the critical period. However, continuous application of the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) after the normal end of the critical period restores this ability to realign the visual map."
https://openalex.org/W2018666999,"A change in synaptic strength arising from the activation of two neuronal pathways at approximately the same time is a form of associative plasticity and may underlie classical or Pavlovian conditioning. A cellular analog of a classical conditioning protocol produces short-term associative plasticity at the connections between sensory and motor neurons in Aplysia. A similar training protocol produced long-term (24-hour) enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). EPSPs produced by sensory neurons in which activity was paired with a reinforcing stimulus were significantly larger than unpaired controls 24 hours after training. Thus, associative plasticity at the sensory to motor neuron connection can occur in a long-term form in addition to the short-term form. In this system, it should be possible to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term associative plasticity and classical conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W1607685020,"Recently, we characterized the export of leukotriene (LT) C4 from human eosinophils as a carrier-mediated process (Lam, B. K., Owen, W. F., Jr., Austen, K. F., and Soberman, R. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12885-12889). To determine whether a similar mechanism regulates the release of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were preloaded with LTB4 by incubation with 25 microM leukotriene A4 (LTA4) at 0 degrees C for 60 min. PMN converted LTA4 to LTB4 in a time-dependent manner as determined by resolution of products by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and quantitation by integrated optical density. When PMN preloaded with LTB4 were resuspended in buffer at 37 degrees C for 0-90 s, there occurred a time-dependent release of LTB4 but little formation or release of 20-hydroxy-LTB4 and 20-carboxy-LTB4. When PMN were preloaded with increasing amounts of intracellular LTB4 by incubation with 3.1-50.0 microM LTA4 and were then resuspended in buffer at 37 degrees C for 20 s, there occurred a concentration-dependent and saturable release of LTB4 with a Km of 798 pmol/10(7) cells and a Vmax of 383 pmol/10(7) cells/20 s. The release of LTB4 was temperature-sensitive with a Q10 of 3.0 and an energy of activation of 19.9 kcal/mol. The rate of LTB4 release at 37 degrees C is about 50 times the rate of 20-carboxy-LTB4 release. PMN preloaded with LTB4 and resuspended at 0 degree C for 1-60 min in the presence of 30 microM LTA5 progressively converted LTA5 to LTB5. The rate of LTB4 release at 0 degree C was inhibited over the entire time period, peaking at about 50% at 30 min. These results indicate that the release of LTB4 from PMN is a carrier-mediated process that is distinct from its biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1523078330,"Vanadate, at concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mM, rapidly decreased the basal level of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) mRNA and blocked the dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-induced increase in enzyme mRNA in both FTO-2B and H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. The concentration of vanadate necessary to inhibit the expression of this gene was similar to that required for the vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. To determine whether vanadate could inhibit PEPCK gene transcription, a series of chimeric genes containing several deletions in the P-enolypyruvate carboxykinase promoter between -550 and -68 was linked to the structural genes for either amino-3-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and introduced into hepatoma cells using three methods: (a) infection with a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus, (b) transfection and stable selection for neo expression, or (c) transient expression of chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase. In FTO-2B hepatoma cells infected with retrovirus, vanadate rapidly (within 1 h) inhibited transcription of the PEPCK-neo gene and blocked induction of gene expression caused by the addition of either Bt2cAMP or dexamethasone to the cells. Vanadate was not a general transcription inhibitor since, it like insulin, stimulated the expression of the c-fos gene. Also, the inhibitory effect of vanadate was rapidly reversible in FTO-2B cells since PEPCK gene expression could be stimulated by Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone after removal of vanadate. A series of 5' deletions in the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter (-550 to +73) was ligated to the structural gene for neo and stably transfected into hepatoma cells. Sequences responsive to vanadate were detected between -109 and -68. This result was confirmed using H4IIE hepatoma cells transiently expressing the PEPCK-CAT gene. The most likely target for vanadate in that region of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter is cAMP regulatory element 1 which maps from -91 to -84. A comparison of the inhibitory effects of insulin and vanadate in this system indicated a major difference in the site of action of these two compounds on PEPCK gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1531882358,"Abstract A Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism has been recently described in human neutrophils that constitutes the principal pathway for Ca2+ influx into resting cells. The potential role of this system in regulating the respiratory burst in response to activation by the chemotactic tripeptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine was explored. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+, a variety of di- and trivalent cations suppressed the generation of O(-2) radicals in a series of decreasing efficacy: La3+ approximately Zn2+ much greater than Sr2+ approximately Cd2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ni2+ approximately Mg2+. This sequence is similar to their rank order of activity in inhibiting 45Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ counter-transport. Benzamil, phenamil, and 2',4'-dichlorobenzamil, analogues of amiloride which selectively block Na+/Ca2+ exchange in neutrophils, likewise suppressed the release of O(-2) with apparent Ki values of approximately 30 microM. The effect of the cations was competitive with Ca2+, while the interaction between the benzamil derivatives and Ca2+ appeared to be noncompetitive in nature. Both the divalent cations and benzamil also inhibited the rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ as monitored by fura-2 fluorescence: these agents reduced peak cytosolic Ca2+ levels after N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulation to values seen in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the influx of Ca2+ via Na+/Ca2+ exchange contributes to the transient elevation in intracellular free Ca2+. The polyvalent cations block the entry of critical Ca2+ ions by competing with Ca2+ for binding to the translocation site on the exchange carrier, while benzamil acts by lowering the maximal transport rate. These studies emphasize that Na+/Ca2+ exchange through its effects on cytoplasmic Ca2+ plays a major regulatory role in activation of the respiratory burst in chemotactic factor-stimulated neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1482057189,"The gene encoding the major ADP/ATP carrier in yeast AAC2 (pet9; Lawson, J., and Douglas, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14812-14818) has been disrupted (delta AAC2) by itself and in combination with a disruption of a second translocator gene AAC1 (delta AAC1). Disruption of AAC2 like the pet9 mutation renders yeast unable to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source. The AAC1 AAC2 double disruption exhibits a phenotype identical to the AAC2. This provides the host strain for the analysis of point mutations in the AAC protein. We have initiated this structure-function analysis by characterizing and confirming that the pet9 mutation is a G to A transition resulting in an arginine to histidine change at position 96. Site-directed replacements at Arg96 confirm its essential function for growth on a nonfermentable carbon source. These data also suggest that in the absence of functional AAC1 and AAC2 gene products, adenine nucleotide transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane must occur by an as yet unidentified translocator or translocation mechanism or that within these cells separate intra- and extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide pools can exist to support growth."
https://openalex.org/W1482969198,"Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy were used to characterize the heme prosthetic groups of the nitrite reductase isolated from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774), which is a membrane-bound multiheme cytochrome capable of catalyzing the 6-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia. At pH 7.6, the as-isolated enzyme exhibited a complex EPR spectrum consisting of a low-spin ferric heme signal at g = 2.96, 2.28, and 1.50 plus several broad resonances indicative of spin-spin interactions among the heme groups. EPR redox titration studies revealed yet another low-spin ferric heme signal at g = 3.2 and 2.14 (the third g value was undetected) and the presence of a high-spin ferric heme. Mossbauer measurements demonstrated further that this enzyme contained six distinct heme groups: one high-spin (S = 5/2) and five low-spin (S = 1/2) ferric hemes. Characteristic hyperfine parameters for all six hemes were obtained through a detailed analysis of the Mossbauer spectra. D. desulfuricans nitrite reductase can be reduced by chemical reductants, such as dithionite or reduced methyl viologen, or by hydrogenase under hydrogen atmosphere. Addition of nitrite to the fully reduced enzyme reoxidized all five low-spin hemes to their ferric states. The high-spin heme, however, was found to complex NO, suggesting that the high-spin heme could be the substrate binding site and that NO could be an intermediate present in an enzyme-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W1567228660,"The 98-base pair enhancer/promoter sequence is critical for cell type-specific transcription of the human neurotropic viral promoter, JCVE, in glial cells. Transcriptionally active extracts were prepared from glial cells and used to identify cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that are involved in the glial-specific activation of the JCVE promoter. Results indicate that multiple regulatory sequences within the 98-base pair repeat specifically bind to nuclear proteins present in glial cells and positively regulate viral early RNA synthesis. The central region of the repeat, designated domain-B, interacts with a 45-kDa nuclear protein present in brain cells. This brain-specific protein was purified by conventional and DNA affinity chromatography. Complementation of the highly purified protein with HeLa extract significantly increased JCVE promoter activity. Thus, association of the novel glial-origin transcription factor with its target sequence increases transcription of the JCVE promoter in a non-glial context."
https://openalex.org/W127340152,"The preceding paper describes purification and properties of a 150-kDa polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C from a cytosolic fraction of turkey erythrocytes (Morris, A. J., Waldo, G. L., Downes, C. P., and Harden, T. K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13501-13507). Turkey erythrocytes express a P2Y-purinergic receptor that employs an unidentified G-protein to activate phospholipase C (Boyer, J. L., Downes, C. P., and Harden, T. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 884-890; Cooper, C. L., Morris, A. J., and Harden, T. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6202-6206). This paper describes receptor and G-protein regulation of the purified turkey erythrocyte phospholipase C after reconstitution of the enzyme using [3H]inositol pre-labeled turkey erythrocyte ghosts as acceptor membranes. These membranes contain polyphosphoinositides labeled to high specific radioactivity and display reduced responsiveness of their endogenous phospholipase C to P2Y-purinergic receptor agonists and guanine nucleotides. Reconstitution of purified enzyme had no effect on basal inositol phosphate production, but markedly increased P2Y-purinergic receptor agonist and guanine nucleotide-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates. Reconstitution of 5 ng of purified phospholipase C with 10 micrograms of acceptor membrane protein produced half-maximal effects, and maximal activity was observed with reconstitution of 100 ng of purified enzyme. Agonist and guanine nucleotide-regulated phospholipase C activity measured using a reconstitution assay co-purified with phospholipase C activity detected using exogenously provided phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate during purification of the 150-kDa protein. Only the maximal rate of inositol phosphate formation attained upon activation was increased in the presence of the purified phospholipase C. K0.5 values for adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, and A1F4- activation of the purified enzyme were the same as for the endogenous phospholipase C activity of the acceptor membranes."
https://openalex.org/W126889650,"In phagocytes, activation of the respiratory burst by chemoattractants requires ATP and involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. ATP is also required for the response elicited in permeabilized neutrophils by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, indicating that at least one of the ATP-dependent steps lies downstream of the receptor-coupled G protein(s). A respiratory burst can also be produced in a reconstituted cell-free system by addition of arachidonic acid. Most investigators find this response to be independent of ATP, yet stimulated by GTP analogs, implying that the ATP-dependent steps observed in the unbroken cells must precede the guanine nucleotide-requiring event. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we studied the ATP and guanine nucleotide dependence of the oxidative response elicited by arachidonic acid in electrically permeabilized human neutrophils. Two components of the response were apparent: one was ATP-dependent, the other ATP-independent. The ATP-dependent component was partially inhibited by staurosporine, suggesting involvement of protein kinase C. This kinase signals activation of the NADPH oxidase without intervening G proteins, since stimulation by phorbol ester was unaffected by guanosine 5'-(beta-thio)diphosphate (GDP beta S). Although nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs failed to stimulate the oxidase in the absence of ATP, the ATP-independent response stimulated by arachidonic acid was found to require GTP or one of its analogs and to be inhibited by GDP beta S. The relative potency of the guanine nucleotides to support the arachidonic acid response in the absence of ATP (5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) greater than or equal to guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate GTP gamma S) greater than or equal to (GTP) differed from their efficacy to stimulate the burst in the presence of ATP (GTP gamma S greater than GMP-PNP much greater than GTP). These observations suggest the involvement of two distinct GTP-binding proteins in oxidase activation: a receptor-coupled, heterotrimeric, pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, and a second GTP-binding protein(s) located downstream of the ATP-requiring steps, which may lie in close proximity to the NADPH oxidase. This secondary GTP-binding protein could be part of the pathway activated by chemoattractants, but does not mediate stimulation via protein kinase C. Therefore multiple parallel routes may exist for activation of the NADPH oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W126692597,"The effects of cyclic AMP treatment on total cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in GH3 pituitary tumor cells have been studied. Incubation of cells for 24 h with 1 microM forskolin resulted in a 50% decrease in total cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity which was reversible upon removal of forskolin from culture media. A similar response was observed in GH3 cells treated with 5 ng/ml cholera toxin and 0.5 mM dibutyryl cAMP but not 0.5 mM dibutyryl cGMP. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the steady-state level of the mRNA for each of the six kinase subunit isoforms studied was not detectably altered after treatment with 1 microM forskolin for 24 h. The concentration of catalytic subunit was also assessed by binding studies using a radiolabeled heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor. Treatment of GH3 cells with 1 microM forskolin for 24 h reduced protein kinase inhibitor binding activity by 50%, consistent with the observed forskolin-induced decrease in total kinase activity. Analysis of endogenous heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor activity in GH3 cell extracts showed no significant difference between forskolin-treated cells and cells maintained under control conditions. To assess possible effects on catalytic subunit degradation, pulse-chase experiments were performed and radiolabeled catalytic subunit was isolated by affinity chromatography. The results demonstrated that treatment of cells with chlorophenylthio-cAMP detectably increased the apparent degradation of radiolabeled catalytic subunit. The increased degradation of the catalytic subunit was sufficient to account for the observed decreases in kinase activity. These results suggest that relatively long term cAMP treatment can alter total cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity through effects to alter the degradation of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1633631485,"Complexes between tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its rapidly acting inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) are bound, internalized, and degraded by HepG2 cells. The mechanism involves endocytosis mediated by a specific high-affinity receptor. However, the particular domains of the complex that are recognized by the receptor have not been elucidated. To identify the determinants involved in ligand binding to the receptor, several variants of t-PA were assessed for their ability to form complexes with PAI-1 and thereby to inhibit specific cellular binding of complexes between structurally unmodified 125I-t-PA and PAI-1. Catalytically active variants lacking selected structural domains form complexes with PAI-1 and inhibit 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 binding to HepG2 cells. In addition, several forms of the plasminogen activator urokinase (u-PA), which shares partial structural homology with t-PA, were evaluated as competitors of cellular binding. The catalytically active two-chain forms of u-PA, but not the inactive proenzyme single-chain form, complex with PAI-1 and inhibit specific binding of 125I-t-PA.PAI-1, suggesting that the serine protease domain, rather than other domains, may confer the determinants required for cellular binding. However, a mutant t-PA with markedly reduced catalytic activity, resulting from replacement of the active site serine with threonine, not only forms complexes with PAI-1 but also inhibits specific cellular binding of unmodified 125I-t-PA.PAI-1. These data indicate that specific binding of t-PA.PAI-1 to HepG2 cells does not require a serine-containing catalytic site in the protease domain. To determine whether binding of the complex is mediated through other components of t-PA or through structural elements of PAI-1, both t-PA and PAI-1 were examined separately for capacity to bind directly to HepG2 cells. To exclude potential interactions with components of the extracellular matrix which contains binding sites for PAI-1, ligand binding to HepG2 cells in suspension was assessed. Although neither t-PA nor PAI-1 alone binds specifically to HepG2 cells, the preformed t-PA.PAI-1 complexes do. These findings suggest that specific binding of t-PA.PAI-1 requires elements of the PAI-1 moiety and/or parts of the protease domain of t-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1537463342,"Rat liver peroxisomal D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, which in combination with enoyl-CoA hydratase catalyzes the epimerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, was purified by a five-step procedure to yield a highly purified preparation as judged by gel electrophoresis of the native and denatured enzyme. Since the molecular mass of the native dehydratase was estimated to be twice that of its 44-kDa subunit, the enzyme seems to be composed of two, possibly identical subunits. This dehydratase catalyzes the reversible dehydration of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA, but, in contrast to enoyl-CoA hydratase, does not act on 2-cis-enoyl-CoA. The dehydratase is virtually inactive toward crotonyl-CoA, but exhibits high activity with 2-trans-hexenoyl-CoA as a substrate and acts with decreasing efficiency on all 2-enoyl-CoAs tested from 2-hexenoyl-CoA to 2-hexadecenoyl-CoA. The pH optimum of the enzyme is close to 8. Equilibrium ratios of 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA/2-trans-octenoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA/2-cis-octenoyl-CoA were found to be close to 3 and 137, respectively. It is suggested that 2-cis-enoyl-CoA intermediates formed during the beta-oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in peroxisomes are hydrated by enoyl-CoA hydratase to D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs which are epimerized to their L-isomers by the sequential actions of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase and enoyl-CoA hydratase."

A 16-base pair double-stranded region was established as the minimal duplex region required for topoisomerase II cleavage activity. The region was located symmetrically around the 4-base staggered cleavage site. Topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage within the 16-base pair core duplex, however, required single-stranded regions flanking the duplex to either the 5'- or 3'-sides, or an extension at both ends of the duplex with 1 or more base pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1600253215,"Phosphorylation of hormone receptors by protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the regulation of receptor recycling. We have studied the recycling and the phosphorylation state of the insulin growth factor (IGF) II/mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor in microvascular endothelial cells from rat adipose tissue. Scatchard analysis showed these cells have over 2 x 10(6) receptors/cell with an affinity constant of 1 x 10(9) M-1. In the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC and analog of diacylglycerol, IGF-II receptor number increased in the plasma membrane by 60% without changes in the binding affinity. This increase in cell surface receptor number was confirmed by affinity cross-linking and 125I-surface labeling studies, occurred with a half-time of 20 min, and was reversible upon withdrawal of PMA. The redistribution of IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors was not due to an inhibition of internalization which was in fact stimulated by PMA. The effect of PMA on IGF-II receptor recycling correlated with its stimulation of PKC activity. Furthermore, after down-regulation of cellular PKC levels by preincubation with PMA, PMA was unable to activate residual PKC activity in the membranous pool or increase IGF-II receptor number at the cell surface. The phosphorylation state of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor was determined by 32P labeling of intact cells and immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies. In the basal state, the receptor was phosphorylated only on serine residues which was increased by 75% after treatment with PMA. In contrast, IGF-II decreased receptor phosphorylation and plasma membrane binding in a parallel and dose-dependent manner. Thus, PKC-stimulated serine phosphorylation of IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor may promote the translocation of the receptor to the cell surface, whereas IGF-II-stimulated dephosphorylation of the receptor may lead to a decrease in the number of cell surface receptors. These data suggest a role for PKC-mediated serine phosphorylation in the regulation of intracellular trafficking of receptors in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562923905,"Guinea pigs fed a diet low in zinc develop clinical signs of apparent neurological origin. The signs include abnormal posture and locomotion as well as hypersensitivity to touch. In this study, electrophysiological and biochemical measurements were made on sciatic nerves from zinc-deficient and repleted animals as well as on controls fed either ad libitum or restricted to maintain weight comparable to those consuming the deficient diet. Both in vivo and in vitro measurements showed decreased motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in nerves of deficient animals. A longitudinal study showed excellent correlation of NCV and severity of clinical signs. Nerves from zinc-deficient guinea pigs had decreased Na,K-ATPase activity, but the number of sodium channels, as determined by saxitoxin binding, was not affected. It was concluded that the clinical signs of neuropathy in zinc deficiency are associated with impaired NCV and decreased Na,K-ATPase activity of peripheral nerves. The zinc-deficient guinea pig provides a useful model to study the biochemical defect in a peripheral neuropathy.— O'Dell, B. L.; Conley-Harrison, J.; Besch-Williford, C.; Browning, J.

Both the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of BD 621 and BD 607 and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) estimated by fluorescence monitoring were consistent with values obtained by using radioligand binding techniques. The binding of BD 621 and BD 607 assessed by fluorescence measurement was reversible, abolished by photoaffinity labeling with Ro 15-4513, and unaffected by a variety of substances that do not bind to benzodiazepine receptors. The potencies of chemically diverse benzodiazepine receptor compounds to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding were highly correlated (r = 0.94, P < 0.001), with potencies obtained from radioligand binding techniques. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using direct fluorescence measurement techniques to quantitate ligand-receptor interactions.— McCabe, R. T.; de Costa, B. R.; Miller, R.

Similar to the heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum, heparinase III also degrades heparin to mainly disaccharide fragments. It is specific for heparin and also breaks down heparan sulfate, but not hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate. Heparinase III, however, differs markedly from heparinase I in several other aspects: it has a higher molecular mass (94 versus 43 kDa), pI (9.2 versus 8.5), its Km and kcat are different, and it has a higher energy of activation (15.6 versus 6.3 kcal/mol). Optimal activity was also found at higher pH (7.6 versus 6.5) and temperature (45 versus 37 degrees C). Furthermore, the amino acid composition of heparinase III is quite different from that of heparinase I."
https://openalex.org/W1598400820,"Fluorinated compounds play an important role in enzymology as well as clinical medicine. Based on the stereochemical preferences of dihydroorotate oxidase and enzymes that use fluoroaspartate, it was anticipated that threo-5-fluoro-L-dihydroorotate (t-FDHO) would have the properties of an antimetabolite. Thus, t-FDHO was synthesized via the reduction of 5-fluoroorotate using NADH and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase that was free of dihydroorotase. When the product was purified and studied by high field proton and carbon 13 NMR, the fluorine, the five carbons, and all the nonexchangeable protons were readily observed. Confirmation of threo configuration was obtained by examining the vicinal coupling constants between the substituents on carbon 5 and carbon 6 of the newly synthesized compound. Additionally, t-FDHO could be reoxidized to 5-fluoroorotate in the presence of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and NAD+. Treatment of t-FDHO with dihydroorotase generated N-carbamyl-threo-3-fluoro-L-aspartate (CTF-ASP) which was also purified and characterized by NMR. The antiproliferative activity of t-FDHO was determined against a diploid human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080). Fifty microM t-FDHO caused 50% inhibition of HT-1080 cell proliferation. During the 48-h toxicity study, extracellular t-FDHO underwent significant hydrolysis to CTF-ASP. Further extracellular degradation to fluoroaspartate was not seen. The antiproliferative activity of t-FDHO was not due to extracellular degradation since CTF-ASP itself was essentially nontoxic."

To gain insight on the mechanism regulating its synthesis, we have examined various conditions of cell proliferation arrest. We used pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis, which allow the detection of the well characterized 100-kDa precursor of gp115 (p100). In the cAMP-requiring mutant cyr1, p100 synthesis is active during exponential growth, shut off by cAMP removal, and induced when growth is restored by cAMP readdition. The inhibition of p100 synthesis also occurs in TS1 mutant cells (ras1ras2-ts1) shifted from 24 to 37 degrees C. During nitrogen starvation of rca1 cells, a mutant permeable to cAMP, p100 synthesis is also inhibited. cAMP complements the effect of ammonium deprivation, promoting p100 synthesis, even when added to cells which have already entered G0. Experiments with the bcy1 and cyr1bcy1 mutants have indicated the involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases in the control of p100 synthesis. Moreover, the synthesis of p100 was unaffected in A364A cells, terminally arrested at START B by alpha-factor. These results indicate that the switch operating on p100 synthesis is localized in early G1 (START A) and is one of the multiple events controlled by the cAMP pathway."

We report evidence for the occurrence of a functional PI-linked subset of cell surface fibronectin receptors (FNR).

PI-PLC treatment of cell membranes purified from [35S]methionine-labeled CEF or MG63 cells led to a similar loss of membrane-associated immunoprecipitable FNR from the pelleted membranes, while such treatment led to the appearance of FNR in the supernatant of treated MG63 membranes. Biosynthetic labeling of CEF FNR with [3H]palmitate and [3H]ethanolamine demonstrated the acylation and putative PI linkage of avian FNR subunits. PI-PLC treatment of CEF and MG63 cells also reduced fibronectin-specific adhesion in a short-term in vitro assay, suggesting that the avian and human FNR occur in PI-linked isoforms which appear to contribute to cell adhesion to fibronectin."
