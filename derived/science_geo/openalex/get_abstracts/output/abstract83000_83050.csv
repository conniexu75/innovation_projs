https://openalex.org/W1515821888,"Inside-out membrane vesicles from human red cells were used to investigate the side specificity of K+ interactions with the K+-activated phosphatase, a partial reaction of the (Na, K)-ATPase. In the absence of Na+ and ATP, K+ at moderate affinity sites at the extravesicular surface (cytoplasmic K+) stimulates activity, whereas intravesicular K+ (K+ normally at the extracellular surface) is without effect. In contrast, under conditions of phosphorylation of (Na, K)-ATPase (Na+ and ATP present), K+ ions acting at high affinity sites at both surfaces are required. It is concluded that an enzyme x K complex is involved in K+-activated phosphatase activity and that it is formed either by interaction of cytoplasmic K+ with the dephosphoenzyme, or as a consequence of extracellular K+ binding and dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of Na+ plus ATP."
https://openalex.org/W51463557,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) phosphatase has been purified 840-fold to apparent homogeneity from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Native eIF-2 phosphatase has a Mr = 98,000, pI = 6.1, s20,w = 5.1, and a Stokes radius = 38 A. A subunit composition of one 60,000-dalton polypeptide and one 38,000-dalton polypeptide is indicated. The Km for [32P]eIF-2 is 30 microM and the Vmax = 1.1 nmol of phosphate released/min/microgram. The 38,000-dalton subunit of eIF-2 phosphatase does not co-electrophorese with the catalytic subunit of liver phosphorylase phosphatase, a type 1 protein phosphatase. The specificity of eIF-2 phosphatase for phosphorylation sites on th alpha- and beta-subunits of eIF-2 appears to be determined by the environment of the phosphatase and substrate. Both the alpha- and beta-subunits of [32P]eIF-2 are rapidly dephosphorylated by the purified phosphatase. In unfractionated lysate and in unfractionated lysate supplemented with an equivalent activity of the purified phosphatase, only the alpha-subunit of eIF-2 is dephosphorylated. This indicates other factors are present in the lysate which govern the dephosphorylation of eIF-2."

https://openalex.org/W1550772894,"Four T7 products, DNA polymerase, gene 4 protein, RNA polymerase, and DNA binding protein, have been purified from phage-infected cells. It has been previously shown (Hinkle, D. C., and Richardson, C. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5523-5529; Kolodner, R., and Richardson, C. C. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 574-584) that two T7 products, DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein, catalyze extensive synthesis on duplex T7 DNA containing single strand breaks. However, the T7 DNA polymerase purified by our procedure does not efficiently contribute in this reaction, although the preliminary evidence suggests that this enzyme may be the native form of the DNA polymerase. Such inefficient T7 DNA synthesis is greatly augmented by adding the third T7 product, namely T7 RNA polymerase. This DNA synthesis apparently requires transcription, since each of the four rNTPs must be present. The rate of synthesis is increased about 2-fold by the addition of T7 DNA binding protein. In contrast to the results obtained when DNA synthesis is initiated at single strand breaks in a duplex DNA molecule, essentially none of the DNA synthesized in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase is covalently attached to the T7 DNA template. We postulate that in this in vitro system, T7 DNA replication is initiated using an RNA primer synthesized by the T7 RNA polymerase."

The labile enzyme was stabilized in cell-free extracts by the presence of MgATP and dithiothreitol at pH 7.8. The stabilized enzyme was purified by a rapid procedure consisting of ion exchange chromatograhy and electrofocusing The native molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be 190,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a monomeric molecular weight of 165,000. The isoelectric point of the purified enzyme was 6.05, and only one species of active enzyme was observed during electrofocusing of both purified enzyme preparations and crude liver homogenates. The enzyme exhibited a pH optimum of 7.8. The apparent Michaelis constants for NH4+, HCO3-, MgATP, and the activator, N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid, were 0.8, 6.7, 1.1, and 0.1 mM, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2017670652,"Intraperitoneal injection of neuropathogenic strains of lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV)1–3 causes a histologically distinctive4 fatal paralytic disease characterized by an inflammatory destruction of motor neurones in the brain stem and cord in C58 mice aged over 9 months. To elicit the disease in the naturally susceptible C58 strain requires an age-associated5 or X-ray induced6 loss of immunological competence5, LDV infection1–3 and genetic susceptibility1,6. Genetic studies1,7 of the common inbred mouse strains showed that susceptibility to the disease was not linked to the major histocompatibility complex but correlated with the FV-1n allele, susceptibility to spontaneous leukaemia, and infection by neuropathogenic strains of LDV1–3. These observations suggested that neuropathogenic strains of LDV elicit the disease only in those strains of mice that carry multiple copies of N-tropic C-type retroviruses in their genomes8,9 and that are permissive for retrovirus replication. Presumably the expression of these viral genomes (high titres of virus in tissues correlating with age9) is the important factor. Here we present genetic evidence to support this hypothesis and briefly discuss the possible implications."

https://openalex.org/W21368335,"Previous experiments (Fukushima, Y., and Post, R.L. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6853-6862) demonstrated that the Ca x phosphoenzyme of sodium- and potassium-transport adenosine triphosphatase gradually becomes stable after dissociation of Ca2+ in the presence of a chelating agent such as 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilo-tetraacetic acid. In the present study, we investigated whether the ADP- and K+-sensitive forms of the Ca x phosphoenzyme show different affinities for divalent cations. Our findings were as follows. (a) As the concentraion of Na+ was increased during phosphorylation of the enzyme with ATP at pH 7.4 and 0 degrees C, both the sensitivity to ADP and the amount of calcium-free phosphoenzyme increased in parallel. (b) For this Na+-dependent change, kidney enzyme required higher concentrations of Na+ than did brain enzyme. (c) In addition, the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from the ADP-sensitive Ca x phosphoenzyme was faster than that from the K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme. It was thus concluded that Ca2+ binds to the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme less tightly than to the K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme."
